One, the sound of symphonic music to relax and resassure them. Two, the sound of a heart beat to remind them of a safe place(inside your womb). And thirdly, the sound of a familiar voice like that of a mother or father. Luckily, this toy captures all of the above and does so in a simple and colorful object that fits nicely over a baby's head.My little son absolutely adores this night soother. Before he had trouble settling into the night pattern, but now being seven months, he drifts off to sleep and if he cries in the night, this toy is voice(cry) activated so it goes on automatically to help him drift gently back to sleep without having to get up to comfort him. It has been a lifesaver in our home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time or money","review":"I left a review here already but don't see it.

I thought he would explain things and go through what is covered in the book. WRONG. He goes over some things and not everything in the book. Also he just plays through the scales without even showing examples or giving ideas of how to use or apply them. He even starts going through all these crazy exotic scales for \\"who knows what reason\\". After going through those scales he then tells you that you will find explanations in my book!! What the hell!!! Is the DVD supposed to be a companion while you go through the book?? He does not teach anything in the DVD, he just wants you to waste your money while he sells his book to you. This DVD sucked!!! I was really looking forward to expand my knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very strange","review":"I figured that I'd try this since I have the book. Actually, if you spend time reading the book, which is very helpful, you'll learn volumes more about scales and chords. The narrator/player cruises though at such a high rate of speed through all sections that it almost requires you to know what he is doing before hand to understand. I'm not writing this from a beginners point of view but as a warning to those who think it may be a nice introduction; it really isn't. The reviews that gave it 5 stars puzzles me and I'm truly and honestly being sincere when I say this. Get the book before this video and you'll know what I mean. As an aside, to call the whole wizardry thing being cheesy is an understatement. I wouldn't call it satanic, just not necessary. If anyone's interested I'll sell you my copy.. It really is of no value.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"I purchased this dvd along with the companion book, \\"The Guitar Grimoire\\". The book is rather confusing and droll. I would rather shoot myself then watch that video again. Not only was it basically a rote reading of the book, but the format was terrible. Throughout the entire thing the author wears a monks robe that hides his face, he continually makes these idiotic gestures like he's a magician, the whole audio is done with some annoying special effect on his voice and the content was just not that eye-opening. I have \\"A Modern Method for Guitar\\", volumes 1,2 and 3 by William Leavitt of Berklee music. I have found them to be far more valuable. Not only do you learn to sight read, but you also gain better theory and much of the same information offered by Cad-man in a much more mature presentation style. Sorry, Adam.

You never see his face as it is shrouded in a cloak as the smoke and fake fire torches and gargoyle statues set a dark mood before you. I thought that it was just a joke before I opened the DVD and that they would play this up for only the first couple of minutes on the DVD, but to my disappointment, the entire production is done in this theme. Have at it you \\"devil worshipping\\" types. But in my home, this will not be played again. There are other more effective ways to teach scales and modes. I agree with the previous reviewer in that this has very little to show you in terms of learning scales and modes on the guitar. What little there is doesn't even come into play until the last couple of chapters on the DVD...Sorry Wizard, you won't be getting any more of my money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deliver","review":"Technobrands is a book about branding new technologies. According to the author, techno branding is different from usual branding and needs a new approach. The book is supposed to introduce this new approach and make you, and your company, more successful.The problem is that the book does not deliver. It is a series of generalitities strung together. The concept of technobrand is not defined and the differences with usual branding are not properly explained. There are no practical advice on branding (except the overly repeated advice to test your plans with focus groups). The author cites 'authorities' throughout the book and at the start of each chapter. I realized how desperate he was when he actually cited himself (chapter four).Technobranding may be a good idea. But this book is not the place to learn about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Synthetic Patches","review":"These are a synthetic fiber. In my opinion, they do not do half as well as a good cotton patch.

The 2002 movie, though taking many liberties with the story stayed, exciting and fun through-out. This 1975 version is just dull.

And followed the sequence of this classic very closely. Giving great drama to the trails of Edmond. From arrest, to years in prison, escape, obtaining the treasure of Monte Cristo, and finally revenge. But this beautiful mini-series was cut fron a multi hour sensation, into as poor imatation of the original work. If the original mini-series was to be released, I beleive you to be greatly entertained. But of the Movie version is to be released, you will find dis-jointed scenes and a story that many times is hard to follow because the essence of this story was left on the edditing room floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits the stereotype","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is by far the best piece of literature in my collection, yet when I saw this movie I was greatly disappointed. The director failed to direct Chamberlain into the intensity and the morality of Dantes and the lack of equally important details of the book were left out due to reasons not understandable to me. This movie fits the stereotype: the book was (WAY) better than the movie. Instead of spending 3 hours with this bad adaptation of a masterpiece, why not read the book and get a lot more experience and depth out of it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Monte Cristo","review":"Although this version follows the book more closely than the newer version, I felt it lacked the excitement.

Monte Cristo also has more duality and sensitivity than Chamberlain depicted. If you want a taste of the REAL Monte Cristo, see the 1955 French version, where the incomparable Jean Marais plays the Count. He is the one and only Monte Cristo."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"With a story like The Count of Monte Cristo, you'd think even the most inept filmmaker couldn't go far wrong. Not so. Even Richard Chamberlain's good looks and mellow voice can't rescue this bland and lifeless film, especially not with that ghastly haircut.

Songs guaranteed to be classics such as Heads on the Wall and I'm not a stranger. This is a cd that every metal fan should own and cherish. Long live the King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but takes several listenings to appreciate","review":"This is a fairly rough album, and the whole is by far better than the sum of its parts. None of the songs stands particularly well on its own, so you have to listen to the whole thing to truly enjoy it. The flow of the story, as well as the song structure, is typical King. The story is horribly dark and disturbing, and I stayed away because I originally thought it was a tribute to child abuse. Reading an interview with King changed my mind: it's really about a man who is falsely accused of child abuse, and his suffering then revenge. This is King's standard theme. If you read the lyrics, make sure to read ALL of them, as the story has a few twists. Once I got past the lyrics, and listened several times (which I always have to do with King albums), this album grew on me and is probably my third favorite. Don't buy this as your first King album, as Them plus Conspiracy or Abigail plus Abigail 2 are better. If you're a King fan, buy it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding concept album","review":"King Diamond's 1996 album The Graveyard is a concept album that just plains rocks. It's dark metal at its finest. King Diamond sounds like a cross between Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Metallica. They are definitely influenced by these bands, as all bands are influenced by something out there. King Diamond (formerly of Mercyful Fate) has a wickedly high voice that fits the music perfectly. He has cited Robert Plant, Ian Gillan, Rob Halford, Ronnie James Dio, Ozzy Osbourne, Alice Cooper, and David Byron as his main influences.The entire album rocks. Some of my favorite songs are Trick Or Treat, Black Hill Sanitarium, Meet Me At Midnight, and I'm Not A Stranger.If you want some really dark heavy metal for your listening enjoyment, listen to this album and all this band has to offer. Their concept albums are awesome for the Halloween season or any time you want to listen to dark metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome band, o.k. mix c.d.","review":"i absolutely love the band, but i think they could have picked a better selection. i guess they have too many good songs for one disc. maybe it should have been a double c.d, but its not at all bad. if you have all the others then theres no point in getting it, but for a first time listener you should definately get it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, did I miss something?!?","review":"I don't get it ... (hed) pe seems to have built their career on not caring what anyone thinks and saying f*** you to the establishment ... and then they release a \\"Best of\\" disc?!?! What?The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because the tunes are great. The concept of a \\"Best of\\" disc kills it, though.I've been a fan of (hed) pe since their first disc and have seen them a few times in clubs and I just don't get this. One other reviewer said something about this feeling like the record label milking the band ... totally agree. And if thst's the case, why would the band let the label do that?There seems to be fewer and fewer bands out there that truly do whatever they want without regard to what anyone else thinks and (hed)pe used to be one of them.**cough** sell out **cough**"},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated opinions not qualitative research based info","review":"This book was required reading for my class and I found it to be lacking in scientific backing.

Make a move on me, where Olivia delivers the words in quite a suggestive way. And, of course, the title track, which spent 10 weeks at #1 back then, and remains one of Olivia's biggest sellers. Other memorable tracks are \\"Stranger's touch\\", \\"Silvery rain\\" and \\"Recovery\\". Although not a favorite of mine, \\"Love make me strong\\" is quite good too. The only thing missing here are the beautiful Herb Ritts photos that were on the LP inlay. But this CD is worth it, just for the superb music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Physical is one of my phavorites","review":"Most ONJ fans, myself included, rank Physical as one of Olivia's best releases. The title track may seem a bit goofy, and it was overplayed in the early 80s, but the album as a whole is really good. The uptempo songs are full of energy and there's a fire in her voice, and the ballads are soulful and her voice is extremely genuine in tone and timbre. An outstanding CD from beginning to end. If you're looking for an Olivia CD beyond a greatest hits compiliation, this is a very good one to check out. \\"Landslide\\" and \\"Make A Move On Me\\" are two of my favorites from her entire repertoire. Other standout tracks include \\"Love Make Me Strong,\\" \\"Silvery Rain,\\" \\"Promise,\\" and the well-known title track, \\"Physical.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The sweetnes just went !","review":"Olivia got sexy with tihs album - 10 tracks 8 great and two weak (Silvery Rain and Dolphin Song, keeping up the tradition of usually one oddity) but it's sleek, rocky and upbeat album that marks a pinacle in her career. More more more !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Compromise","review":"It seems that ONJ feels she has to get something commercial out there to get attention for what she seems to really believe in. \\"Physical\\" although it was her #1 selling single of all time is such a commercial song. The pictures in the album are inane. The rest of the tracks like Landslide and Strangers Touch are just as commercial. Then you get finally to Silvery Rain and realize that there is a deep message to the song and its cleverly written and well sung. And then The Promise which is a gorgeous song about Dolphins and I am a fellow Dolphin lover. So, I give it 2 stars for these 2 songs. The rest of it belongs to the masses of people.... These 2 songs save the album. Recovery is also good due to the harmonies and lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"good reading, i think....","review":"I don't claim to be an expert, but I've been reading many books like this one & I found several things stated in this book that are contradictory to ALL other authors that I've read so far.

This router was intended to be used in a router table and I must say that it is well suited for the task. Above table bit change with the help of a above the table spindle lock Mechanism. However the height ajustment seemed kind of clunky and when the router was bottomed out to change the blade above the table it seemed to bind. The last time I raised the router to change the blade it bound so tight it would not release. For fear of breaking it and the fact the router is now a table weight, I am sending it back for an exchange. I like this router allot and for what it is intended to do it is great.

However, the router started to heat the bits up so hot they couldn't be touched. The router was sent in to Freud for repair. They replaced the armature and a bearing...received it back and the problem is not corrected. I called Freud and the repair person shrugged it off trying to tell me its normal for the router bits, collet and shaft to heat up beyond the point of being able to touch it. He said sorry and rudely hung up. I own Porter Cable, Milwaukee and Craftsman routers and they don't do this. In fact, the Freud didn't until recently.

If you've ever wondered about reincarnation and what happens after death, you won't be disappointed. One of the best gifts that Gelek Rimpoche has is that he can take deep material and make it accessible - this book is very readable, and you will find no pretension in the prose - it is lucid, instructive and to the point. Throughout the book, the author's refreshing sense of humor manages to shine through. After dealing with death and the Tibetan take on the subject, we are then presented with practical advice and instructions on how to live and cope with this very precious life that we have been given. The book also includes a daily practice in the appendix. Gelek Rimpoche has written a book that is brilliant and useful; it is a book that I'm sure I'll re-read numerous times in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone interested in a spiritual path or thinking about the death of a loved one.

It has ended the battles over his riding in the stroller to go to the playground. I bought the Brummi as it was readily available, however, if money and time were no object, I would recommend the Navigator. If you are considering the Brummi vs. another less expensive stroller, I would say go for it. The included seat belt, bucket and push bar are great features. The stroller is very well made and seems as if it will last the entire four years I expect that he will use it, and then have some life still for the next child. If I could have it all, I would have bought one with the rear navigation, because until the child learns to steer properly, the adult ends up pushing the Brummi model with the front wheel elevated as if it is a wheelbarrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I got this trike for my daughter's 1st birthday and she loves it. It is a great distraction for her when she's bored. The recommended age states 18 months to begin with, but she's been riding it since she was 12 months. She's 13 months old now and loving her trike. Of course, she can't pedal or steer well, but that's where the push bar comes in, it is wonderful to be able to steer her without breaking your back! It was quite easy to put together. And Kettler's customer service is great, too. I had an issue with not being able to steer correctly. I called them and they shipped out a replacement part immediately, which I installed and now the trike is as good as new again. I love it and my daughter loves it.

I primarily use them to freeze or refrigerate individual or double portions of home cooked things to reheat later. They work great in the microwave and they stack nicely in the fridge. The only issue I have with them is that the lids are not quite as secure as some other similar products I've used, and at least once I had a spill because of it.

The Storm is better than Heltah Skeltahs Nocturnal. Ruck had minimal skills. Starang is the true shiner in OGC. I love how the album has a feel to it.

This really is a concept album in that all of the songs (produced with beautiful accuracy by Da Beatminerz) truly do evoke a rainy-day type of mentality. And that is to make no mention of the Gunn Clappaz themselves. Starang, Top Dog and Louieville Sluggah are among the most accomplished MCs in the Bootcamp Clik. Although Starang is most definitely head-and-sholders above the other two, they hold it down with more conviction than the average rapper in this industry. Highlights include the muffled-but-thumpin' \\"No Fear,\\" the record-industry indictment \\"Gunn Clapp\\" and the Starang solo, aptly entitled \\"Hurricane Starang.\\" This is yet another great album from the Bootcamp Clik, thanks to Da Beatminerz deep-yet-simple production and real MCing.

The location is only based at one spot: The Dessert. Dale 'apollo' Cook is a good fighter but it's a shame to see a waste of his talent in this project due to his very bad acting (which is normal) and very slow fight scenes which is unlike some of his other movies: This is the plot anyway.In the new arena of modern day gladiators, the price of failure is death. When the top gladiator, \\"Amp\\" (Dale 'apollo' Cook)' makes his bid to escape the clutches of the syndicate that runs these fights sends their evil henchman \\"Mainframe\\" (Greg Douglass) who eventually hunts him down in order to destroy Amp in a fixed tournament so he can become the new champion. Amp is almost caught but his girlfriend Lisa is slaughtered in the process of the escape. Now Amp has no choice but to stop running and fight the syndicate in pure hatred as vengeance for Lisa's death and for his freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A honeypot of sweet problems in geometry","review":"Geometry is such a sweet science and this book is a honeypot. Ross Honsberger is one of the best in creating crafty, delightful problems. In reading this book, you will be amazed at how hard the problems appear when stated and how simple and elegant the proofs are.Some topics are relatively obscure. I am sure that Honsberger is quite correct in stating that few modern mathematicians have heard of the symmedian point of a triangle. I certainly had not. However, the level of the material is such that even teachers of high school geometry will be able to find some suitable exercises. College instructors will find it essential. Problems are given at the end of each chapter and detailed solutions are included in an appendix.It is hard to read this book and not understand why the Greeks were so captivated by geometry. Properly presented, as is done here, it is addictive.Published in Smarandache Notions Journal, reprinted with permission."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good book with good examples","review":"I use this book as a quick reference.

Even my Danish friends wanted this book so they could understand their own grammar. Its perfect for beginners and a great reference book for more advanced speakers of this often times difficult language. The only problem with this book (and the reason why I gave it 4 stars) is that it is written in very high formal British English, which is different from formal American English. This can often times confuse the reader, but not to a large extent. All in all, this is an excellent book and well worth the price. I plan on using this book the rest of my life (and the rest of my exchange year here in Denmark)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content may be fine but print quality is atrocious","review":"I just received this book. The print quality is really quite bad. Printed letters in bold type often touch one another and there is a diffusion between print and surrounding white space.

Now he is 9 months old and he has enjoyed it at every stage. There are four stages and a card to go with each stage. At stage 1, he loved listening to the classical music and batting at the plastic things while laying on his back. At stage two, we altered the stand so that he could sit up and play the \\"baby senses\\" card (which he loved and laughed hysterically at!) Now at stage 3 he stands up and pushes the plastic things to make consonant sounds. The only complaint I have is that now at 9 months, he is very interested in pulling the card out of the slot and chewing on it which confuses the system and the mouse on the card will \\"oink\\" occaisionally. They should have made it a little more difficult for a baby to get the card out of the holder. But overall, it was a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this toy as an alternative to my son's activity gym. He was almost 3 months old when I bought it. It was frustrating because he wasn't interested in stage 1, but liked stage 2. Stage 2 starts at 3 months, but your child needs to be able to press the levers himself or you have to be there the entire time to press them for him. It just didn't keep him interested like his other toys do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for the youngest infants!","review":"My daughter loved this toy from the time she was only 2 months old - even when she was too young for the most basic toys. The lights and music keep her attention, and the music is enjoyable for all of us. Durable, educational, and versatile (since it has different cards for different developmental stages) - I love this toy!!!UPDATE: My daughter played with this toy until she was about 3, and even now (she is 5) we still sing the \\"rainbow song\\". We handed it down to a friend's son who didn't enjoy it AS much as my daughter did, but still got LOTS of use out of it. The toy still works like the day we took it out of the box. I suppose your experience may vary, but I swear by this toy. (Okay, I wish it had more letter cards and/or song cards, but it's still great, and the black/white classical music was genius!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter showed no interest in this toy.","review":"I bought this toy because I thought that it would be interactive, but she pushes one button and the music goes on and on, and she loses interest. She hardly played with it. She prefered the Fisher Price baby gyms."},{"rating":"1","title":"My son doesn't like it","review":"We got this toy as a gift, when my son was 3 months old. He didn't like it at all, looked scared of it and started to cry after a while. We also have a Fisher Price system with animals hanging from it and he loves that!

The plans are repetitive and derivative of each other.

The software is great. It lets you change your options either on your computer or on the printer's control panel. It shows the level of the toner cartridges every time you start to print. The cartridges are lasting a long time too. The fax machine will pick up a double or triple ring so you can order this feature from your phone company (with a separate number) for about $5/mth and not have to pay for a dedicated phone line. The 50 sheet document feeder works flawlessly for both faxing and copying. Its base is only 10 x 19 inches so it can be angled on a narrow desk or work-space.

Very enjoyable, though the author is very understated in his reporting of events. The author's courtship got no explanation and his marriage no more than a sentence, and he barely mentions his wife thereafter; an encounter with a pirate vessel is reported in a matter-of-fact manner that is not as gripping as it probably was in reality. If you're looking for \\"The Perfect Storm\\" this book does not have the same level of drama, but nonetheless it is an interesting and accurate portrayal of what life was like for a real sea captain in the early 1880s.

If you like a book that teaches you more than just telling a story, than you would like this book more than if you like a book that tells a good interesting story. In the book, I thought it was boring reading it as a ninth grader. I read it for a story that I had to read. I thought it was going to be an interesting STORY rather than all facts that made no sense to me. I did think the book was good with all the detail and everything, but if someone hasn't researched boats or anything they wouldn't know what half of the equipment or terms mean. All together it was a good book but I don't recommend it to someone who doesn't like books that are only lists of facts. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodrama on the High Seas","review":"It's easy to see why this book was such a huge bestseller, as Junger weaves a tragic love story in with a tale of men doing manly work, the wrath of mother nature, and peppers with a dash of science lending what is a mythic tale an aura of detachment. The book centers on a fishing trawler which (presumably) sank in the Atlantic during a horrific storm in 1991 and the men who crewed it. Junger's interviews with their surviving loved ones, sailors who were caught in the same storm, and others who survived similiar near-death experiences form the compelling core of the book, as he recreates the buildup to the trip, the fishing, and the storm. Along the way are excursions into the history of commerical fishing, trawler design, fluid dynamics, meterology, and many other tangents. It's a good, melodramatic tale, and when you're done, you can see why it's being made as a big Hollywood movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tragic event that reads like a textbook","review":"I haven't been this sorely disappointed with a book in a long time. This book was recommended under the banner \\"If you liked 'Into Thin Air' you'll love....\\" A crucial difference, however, is that Krakauer has an unerring eye for the TELLING detail. In \\"Into\\" he describes the inevitability of the Everest tragedy with a haunting relentlessness and emotional impact. Junger, meanwhile, layers numerous dry, technical descriptions over \\"characterizations\\" that, while meant to evoke an emotional bond, just had me screaming for him to get on with it already. This book is nothing more than a collection of gramatically pristine sentences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explanation Overides Story","review":"This was not the \\"white-knuckle adventure\\" the jacket copy described. The author felt compelled to name and explain too many nautical details. Perhaps, if one has had training in the navy, a maritime academy, or on a fishing vessel, THE PERFECT STORM would be sensible--even exciting. However, I found myself (a true landlubber) silently screaming at Mr. Junger to just get on with it and to forget his esoteric descriptions. In short, this book was cast out to sea long before I completed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sided view of the evacuation of the sailboat Satori","review":"I am the son of Ray Leonard, the captain and owner of Satori. The Coast Guard \\"rescue\\" of the crew and captain of Satori, as described in part of this book, is based on one crew member's account and doesn't give an accurate impression. The captain never wanted a rescue attempt. He knew that the small, solid boat could withstand the conditions it was in. The crew, in contrast, were very frightened and apparently issued the mayday call. When the Coast Guard came to the boat they ordered everyone off. Even after she was abandoned, Satori continued through the storm with no damage, eventually being recovered from a Maryland beach. Another sailboat, the Stafka I, also sailed safely through the same part of the storm. The author never contacted Ray Leonard, even though he devotes many pages to the \\"rescue\\" from Satori"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected More","review":"I was drawn to this book, mainly as I lived half of my life just south of Gloucester Mass. Having been at the beach as the waves were tossed ashore by an offshore hurricane, I have always loved and yet feared the oceans power. This book could have been so much more. Every time I started to be drawn in to the lives of those involved, I ended up being distracted by so much technicality. Was it really necessary to know every little detail of the weather patterns? It was hard to picture alot of his detail. Still, I didn't hate the book, but honestly, I was mostly bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, poorly organized, and boring","review":"This book is so poorly written and poorly organized that it is almost unreadable. The author has the crew of a boat sailing by the light of a new moon (a new moon is dark), water 'avalanching' over the boat, describes a lost fishing boat as '900 feet long', has a storm- ridden boat at 'the epicenter of the storm' (look it up). A BAD BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"fiction","review":"I did find the book fun to read. But Junger uses a rather deep imagination to convey his non - fiction story.

He got it right.","review":"Having lived in Massachusetts for most of my life, and specifically in Gloucester for thirteen years, I was enthralled by the authentic ATMOSPHERE of the place captured in this book. I was there during the year of this particular storm and I know these people, contrastingly shy and rowdy.I read the comments by reviewers and some say it's boring. Hardly. However, they may be referring to the inscrutable quality of the picture Junger paints both of the players and the place. Cape Ann, Massachusetts has a mysterious \\"veil\\" over it at times, not unlike the shades of sleet grey, bracken and bottle green that envelope it during its terrible, killing seasons: the fall hurricane months, the nor'east winters, the early, false springs. Actually, for those of us who can afford to stay in our snug homes and watch the spectacles, it can be gorgeous, but for men who must risk their lives to earn their livings, it's treacherous.

A story of power and courage, sometimes power wins, sometimes courage wins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experience Shows","review":"Junger obviously tries to experience what he writes. Though venturing out into the maw of a Georges Bank storm wouldn't be prudent, Junger has brought the same kind of thinking to bear that he has done previously with his real-life experience. It is clear that Junger is an adventurer. Whether hiking in his youth through the toughest part of the Appalachian trail or venturing to Bosnia in adulthood, Junger is an author from the school of experience.

I spoke with a Coast Guard rescue helicopter team, and with two Air Force PJ's who had known Rick Smith and John Spillane personally before they went down, and they all recommended the book very highly.

Some of the history and technique of commercial fishing sounds accurate, as does the drowning description, but this is fiction so how much can any of the seemingly factual stuff be relied on?

It's just that I felt that I was too often reading the latest weather report in more detail then I cared to know about.I'm sure that many will disagree on the basis of the \\"man against the sea\\" cliche.

About midway through I found myself in a state of illusion were I felt the cold grip of the ocean water on my skin and the terror of being trapped and drowning. Jungers portrayal of the ocean in the state of rage and his narrative of what it is to drown made my own heart pound in my chest as if I were gasping for air.

Too much details about water currents and wind currents.This book is not really a \\"story\\" as you might think. The book focuses on the STORM but I wanted to read about the people that were on the Andrea Gail since that is the boat where everyone perished but I wasn't even sure what the Captain's name was because the book jumped around so much.

Every one is saying how it is so good but I didn't think so. I don't feel that the book was about the Andrea Gail. It was in the book but the author talks about fishing, drowning, waves, boats, and on and on. The books explains waves and how work and all about drowning, etc.It talks about lots of different boats and people that were ever involved in a storm at sea. I got bored reading a lot of the time and started of thinking about something else and couldn't follow it. The book just drags on. But when it talks about the Andrea Gail it becomes exciting.

The history of fishing that it gives and also the way it portrays the voyage of the Andrea Gail is captivating to some extent, however I have not really enjoyed reading the book. It is written very well and you can tell that the author spent a lot of time researching what happened during the storm and the history of fishing. One thing that I did like about the book is how the author goes back and forth explaining old and new fishing techniques and shows how many of them are very similar. I guess that this is a book that people should read because it does have a pretty accurate account of history but it really doesn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it is any consolation, the movie is worse","review":"There was a lot of technical, boring stuff that pertained to fishing boats and meteorology. What could I have expected? Still, the long passages where the intricacies of sword fishing were explained really bored me. I very much disliked the glorification that the author made of the crew members. The fact of the matter is that they were just a bunch of maladjusted men (may they rest in peace). Please do not think of the word \\"hero\\" when describing the crew. The only heroes were the National Guard rescue crew, because they did risk their lives in order to save others. Bobby, Billy and company were no heroes (this is the most corrupted word in today's language).I did watch the movie, hoping for some color. Somehow, the storm representations did not have the same vividness in a page than on the screen. The movie has some typical Hollywood defects, like once again the prettifying of the crew, their glorious lives, etc, etc.I liked the map!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Through Howling Gale","review":"The reading public seldom has the opportunityto read good books on storms at sea and rescue.

I found passages in the book to be very entertaining, very interesting, but the whole doesn't stick together. You finish, and you scratch your head. What's the message? How should I think about what I've just read. And you are just blank. Kind of like when you go to a \\"B\\" movie.

The author wasn't able to decide what he wanted to write about, and this horrible book was the result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Griping","review":"The Perfect Storm was loaned to me by a friend that prefaced our conversation by saying \\"It may seem like it's a 'Men's Book' at first, but stick with it\\". How true those words became as I read Mr. Junger's fictionalized accounts of the souls aboard the Andrea Gail. As a landlubber, I was fearful that I would not be able to connect with the life these seafarers lead, but that was not the case. The Author found a way to make the individuals very accessible with a sort of \\"everyman\\" quality. Establishing the characters' personal attachments went a long way towards establishing a personal connection for me. I found as I read the chapters relating to the voyage and the storm, I almost wanted to look away as though I were watching a movie. This reflex action convinced me how vividly Mr. Junger's writing painted pictures in my mind's eye. Any book that makes me flinch and yet compels me to continue is certainly worth recommending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A focus on fishing details clouded the human tragedy.","review":"I read this book after just completing \\"Into Thin Air\\" and it's hard not to compare the two. While I learned much about the nature of deep-sea fishing on the east coast, I felt that the author devoted more pages than necessary to those details. Because of that, I felt the book had a clinical feel to it. I thought there'd be much more emotion associated with the gut-wrenching story hidden in its pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Watery Snoozefest","review":"Following a trip to the top of Everest in \\"Into Thin Air,\\" I immediately plunged right into \\"Perfect Storm,\\" naively expecting the same kind of drama. How wrong I was. Like many other reviewers listed here, I found the author's annoying attention to technical detail to be very distracting from the story at hand. And many times, I forgot which boat I was on, who owned it and why we were being asked to care about it. All in all, a major disappointment. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most overrated novels around","review":"What is the appeal in a book that mostly uses in depth sailing terms and has very little actual action. Granted, the story itself has some appeal, but Junger spends most of the novel describing the technical aspects of the ships and of the fishing business.It wasn't until the end of the novel that it became quite captivating, but it was not worth wasting my time being bored by most of the book and interested in only about the final 30 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, but could be written better","review":"A very compelling book that I would recommend to anyone. However, I found myself wishing it had been better organized. The author seemed forget (somewhere around page 100) that I didn't know all of the maritime terms he wanted to use. I found myself struggling to understand the flow of the storm both in time and in space. Otherwise, this is an entrancing story well worth reading, especially if you ever considered fishing for a living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful book, but much of the meteorology is all wet!","review":"As a professional meteorologist this book was a frustration. The story itself is taut and exciting, but much of the meteorological information was simply wrong. The description of the forecast process was confused (the LFM is a computer forecast model not some kind of observational system) and description of the storm was inadequate at best. This was not as big a storm as the book implies.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I would not recommend this book to anyone that is expecting a good sea story. This book gets way to technical about the boat,the weather, and the fishing. I did not finish reading this book as it was not close to being as good as the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"remembering the day","review":"I have known one of the young man on board this ship, and have been at his families home, and I am still in contact with his mother today, who lives in south hamilton, mass. I am deeply touched by this true story... as I remember so well... the day when we were told that he was missing... good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!! A book that combines non-fiction...","review":"With the craftsmanship and story flow of a first-rate novel. Sebastian Junger combined exhaustive research and a gift for storytelling to write this extremely readable story about life and death on the high seas. While the crew of the Andrea Gail were the main focus of this book, he further illustrates what they must have been going through by giving us all an account of what happened to other boats during that \\"perfect storm\\" back in 1991. This book is very tastefully done, and honors the memory of the brave men who died that night, as well as their families and loved ones.Buy this book. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"The only reason the book doesn't get 5-stars is because much of the technical terminology is over my head as I am not a fisherman or and expert on boats. Having said that I still found the book to be an intense read. The matter-of-fact description of drowning is more frightening than anything one could put on a big screen and the story of the rescues at sea are both harrowing and exhilarting at the same time. Mr. Junger allows you to know the people he is writing about and brings your emotions to a pitch as he describes their thoughts and actions as their lives reach a critical mass. He also does not try and \\"re-create\\" the final moments of the Andrea Gail and I think in keeping the book factual he has shown a greater respect for those on board the Gail and those on board the vessels that were rescued, who's stories are told as facts. An outstanding book. I look forward to the movie, but know I will be disappointed after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational...Interesting...Surprising","review":"Those looking for full character development with a sound ending need not apply. The book is highly informative and technical. Very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An experience a sailor loves to dread","review":"I have been sailing (mostly inland and some offshore) for about 30 years and I think that the book provides a thorough experience that every sailor loves to dread. I doubt that a movie can provide justice, especially the coast guard actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable book - terrifying story","review":"I enjoyed the book immensely, as a reader of action/adventure books and as a pleasure craft sailor.I was perplexed by seeming contradictions in the segment about Ray Leonard, owner of the yacht Satori. The abandonment of his vessel did not seem consistant with his background and experience. Satori was recovered by Mr. Leonard, beached and intact, with personal possessions still on the deck where they sat at the time of abandonment END"},{"rating":"2","title":"suspenseful, exiting, informative and tragic","review":"I purchased this book after returning from a trip to Nova Scotia and seeing the fleets of fishing boats loaded with unrecognizable equipment.(at least to me) This book gave me an incredible sense of what fishermen go through on an almost daily basis. The author concisely explains the process of fishing and fills in some detail of the lives of the men involved, while slowly building to the tragic events to follow. I will never eat another piece of fish, without thinking about this particular story and about the fishermen who caught it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book but a slow start.","review":"This book is very good. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it started out slowly.But after you pass the first 150 pages or so this book is very good. It gives a very good description of fishing life in the ninties. The description of the storm, drowning and everything else is very good. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your husband if a Commercial Fisherman, make sure he's in","review":"I had the book for six months before I had enough courage to read it. A Perfect Storm does depict fishing as the dangerous job that it really is. Junger has most facts straight and his discriptions are good. The one part I really had a hard time with is the fact that he protrays fishermen as a bunch of drunks, when that is really not the case. For the average reader who knows nothing about the lifestyle, he gives a good eyefull of the lower side of the business. It does hit home hard if you're from a fishing family.I'm glad I read it when the weather was calm and my husband was home!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible, can't put it down, takes your breath away book","review":"For the unintiated of the sea, or for the experienced seaman, this story curls your toes, and makes you count your blessings. Gives an inside view of the men who put their lives on the line battling the oceans of the earth. The reader will walk away thinking \\" Man O man. I can't believe these people went thru this! And this. And then that!\\" The beginning is the only section where the reader can catch his breath. After that, hold on! Well done, Mr. Junger, well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-read Joseph Conrad","review":"\\"Perfect Storm\\" a tragic tale simply told with little visceral impact. For style, character development and visceral contrast re-read Joseph Conrad's short stories: \\"Nigger of the Narcissus\\" and \\"Typhoon.\\" Most of the four and five star reviewers will drop their scores . . . I bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't care if they all went down","review":"A male relative told me this was one of the greatest books he ever read. I will never trust him onward. Sebstian is consumed with technical crap like wave heights, weather warnings, boat jargon, blah blah, and barely toches on character or plot. There were too many boats, too many crew members and helicopter pilots that were in trouble that you didn't get close to any of them. The best part of the book was the end (not just because it was over) but how he told the story of pulling information out of the local seadogs. Who cares. Boring!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"there's no \\"there\\" there","review":"As a sailor I was looking forward to this well publicized book... It was a bitter disappointment. It is not a novel, nor is it novel. It isn't even a story... It is a description of events coupled with the author's best guess musings about what people who died might have done and thought in their last hours. My husband thinks, without bothering to read it yet, that maybe it's a book that would only appeal to men, but I wouldn't even have made it a book; at best, it should have been harshly edited down and published in a specialized magazine for people interested in commercial fishing by rather sad people."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Did Not Draw Me In At All\\"","review":"Junger simply told me what was going on. He did not let me experience the events through the eyes of the crewmen. The characters did not come out as flesh and blood people. Junger also took too much time going into all kinds of historical and technical detail, most of which did not move the story along at all. I finished a third of the book and had no sense of drama, no sense of forboding and no care for the people on board. That's a darn shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disapointment","review":"I found myself much more interested in numerous sub-plots than the main story of the doomed Andrea Gail. Much to much technical information is given on waves,clouds and boats for this to be a truely gripping read (I thought at one point I was back in school wishing I were somewhere else). This was however Krakauers er, Jungers first book and it appears that he does have a future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype...","review":"I had been planning to read this book for over a year and after hearing so much praise for it, I expected a lot. What a disappointment. Junger is extremely well-researched, but this doesn't necessarily make for an exciting read; at times I felt like I was reading a textbook. When he focused on the people, I was drawn in but when he spends 5 pages talking about weather patterns and how waves form it bored me to tears. Not a complete waste of time, but definitely not the \\"nail-biter\\" I expected it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good journalism but fair fact or fiction?","review":"Suspended between fiction and fact this account ultimately left me unhappy with key elements of the narrative. The disjointed nature of the timeline doesn't help, and one is left wondering at the author's interpretation of personal events. More transcrips of the survivors' stories may have helped turn a piece of journalism into a more subtantive piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"My shoes fell off!","review":"I stayed up all night under a wet blanket on a water bed and read the whole book until my shoes fell off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Analysis of Ocean Weather and Boating Challenges","review":"This book provides an excellent analysis and commentary on the challenges faced by fisherman, rescue crews and pleasure boating sailing on the open ocean. The perfect storm gave both a person touch and great facts on an often hostile environment that few of us will ever experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - reads like a meteorological/nautical text.","review":"The first quarter of the book was intriguing, with character development and a sense that the author was trying to get to know the sailors who perished on the Andrea Gail. For some reason, the focus of the book changes to the meteorological events that occur, the integrity of the ship's construction, nautical history, etc. I kept wondering, \\"where are the people\\". Maybe this is more a guy-type book. I was disappointed enough by page 150 that I decided not to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever written","review":"How can anybody sing praise to this literary piece of junk? The author must have decided to capitalize on the popularity of \\"Into Thin Air\\" and put out a commercial account of an event that he has not witnessed and has no eyewitnesses. So being too poor of a writer to write a fiction novel with characters and action he compiles this textbook articles on the weather, fishing and drowning and sprinkles some speculation on what may have happened. Comparing this piece of garbage to the fascinating first-hand account of John Krakauer's is ludicrous. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Over-rated Book Ever","review":"I had heard wonderful things about The Perfect Storm. I must be reading a different book under the same title! This is the most poorly written example of a supposedly non-fiction account. Do yourself a favor, read \\"Into the Wild\\" and \\"Into Thin Air\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read","review":"With all the hype over how great this book is, I was expecting a bang-up, well-written read that would transport me into the middle of a whistling, blowing storm, and subject me to the whistle and force of the 100-mph winds and the driving, horizontal rain (believe me, I went thru a few hurricanes myself). I was truly disappointed. The first half started out as a very well-written, engaging read about the lives of working-class Massachusetts fishermen who depend on the sea to make ends meet. But as the book progressed, it bogged down into repetitive, technical minutiae about the many different ways of going through a mega-storm. I could never feel connected with the characters in this book, especially those who went through the awful experience of a storm such as this. At the end, I came away with an empty feeling about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turtle-paced Beginning with Riveting Ending","review":"This book has no focus. It seems Junger didnt have enough information about the Andrea Gail's final moments to fill an entire book so he saved the \\"Story\\" until the end and fills up the first half with useless information about fishing that you really don't care about, unless you're a fisherman, of course. DONT LET THE COVER FOOL YOU. The cover has you think that the entire book is a page turner when, in reality, its the final few chapters that has your face glued to the book. My advice: Skip all the boring foreplay at the beginning and head straight for the money shot located at the end of the book; you'll read less and save a lot of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really long book report.....","review":"I'm afraid that I just didn't enjoy this book at all... found it too filled with facts that did not interest me, or add to the storyline. Perhaps knowing the fate of the fishing boat and crew did not help. In many ways it was more like reading a book report about an event in history. If you are interested in the lifestyles of fisherman, and the job... maybe you'll find it more interesting than I did. Otherwise, the writing was very good and informative... but not very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried to read,tried to listen,still a long newspaper story","review":"I read this, I listened to it ( read by Stanley Tucchi) YAWN. Besides the lovely picture of the author, I can think of no other reason to read this. It is simply a long newspaper story. This is non fiction? Seems alot of maybes, and could haves fill the story. But then I had just read Angela's Ashes and Tis. After great books like those it was hard to read this 1 dimensional thing. I think the Learning Channel's deadliest job ( crab fishing) was much more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"After hearing so much hype I determined that I should probably read this book. What a disappointment. It could have been a good book but page after page of tedious boring facts like \\"they went into the bar for a drink, then they got in the car and went to the diner, then they went back to the bar, then they went back to the diner\\".... and on and on. Ho Hum. Poor writing style. It just could not hold my attention, No doubt he had all the facts about the boats and the men right but it lost so much in the telling. Too bad. Mr. Junger doesn't even pass \\"Writing 101\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Perfect Snore\\" is a more appropriate title...","review":"I'm on page 115 and have fallen into some sort of coma. So far the book's not much more than a technical guide to fishing boats and the history of the sad plight of several crews off the coast of Massachusetts. I keep waiting for something to happen. Even though I know what's going to happen, it somehow doesn't seem worth the finish. I think I'll go to the movies instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of a Good Storm","review":"Sadly, this reads as a well-researched but poorly visualised piece of journalism. Something that Rolling Stone might have commissioned then had second thoughts about. Despite the wealth of detail, there's just too little feel for what a storm at sea is like, and the he-man bits about the helicopter rescuers is like something out of Tom Clancy (I mean that as an insult)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Junger does a great job weaving very interesting science into a very interesting plot.","review":"I did not expect to learn so much from this novel, and was pleasantly surprised. The plot is interesting, and moves along well. But the best part is that Junger does a great job incorporating all sorts of very interesting scientific explanation into the book. I learned a little about meteorology, oceanography, marine biology, and even marine architecture.Definitely recommended, especially if you are a guy who likes to learn interesting facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't feel that it can be compared to \\"Into thin Air\\"","review":"This book starts slowly then tapers off. It finally got interesting toward the end with a description of the storm itself. To compare it to \\"Into Thin Air\\" does the the latter a great disservice"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best kind of read: both entertaining and informative","review":"\\"The Perfect Storm\\" is the most emotionally engaging book I've read since \\"The Shipping News.\\"Like \\"Into the Wild\\" and Sheila Nickerson's \\"Disappearance: A Map,\\" \\"The Perfect Storm\\" is a heart-stopping, heart-wrenching story of improvident sparrows, ordinary people engulfed in extraordinary circumstances.Even for one who has little interest in being on the ocean, the book is hugely informative and entertaining. It's one of those stories you can't stop reading, even though you don't want it to end. \\"The Perfect Storm\\" deserves Pulitzer consideration"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a beach book, but worth it","review":"A meteorologist in my organization recommended this book and this should have tipped me off that this was not a beach book. This story of a real life event, in which the ship Andrea Gail and other ships get caught in the \\"storm of the century\\" is a detailed, serious read. You should not try to read this in snatches, a few pages at a time or you will be lost. It is worth it to read several chapters at a time to learn about the hard life of swordfisherman by stepping into the shoes of the 6 men on the Andrea Gail. I recommend that if you are not interested in all the detail provided by the author, that you at least skim to capture the flavor of this way of life and feel what they must have experienced during that last, fatal cruise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight, quick, dramatic read","review":"The author does a nice job and telling the story of the men who battled this storm on their fishing boat. A nice job, especially considering the author had no one to interview about the critical moments.His detailed reporting nicely layout the setting and take us just enough into the lives of these men to make us care about the outcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-stopping and thrilling, you'll learn about a new world","review":"The Perfect Storm is absolutely thrilling,heart-stopping look at the lives, and deaths, ofGloucester swordfishermen and their compatriotson the seas 200 miles out.How 6 fishermen lost their lives at sea 6 yearsago in the \\"Halloween Gale\\", the \\"perfect storm\\"of the title, is described as fully as possible.Amazing work considering there were no survivors,and that the author had to do his researchelsewhere.Before you've finished reading this book, you'llhave an incredible feeling for and knowledge ofthe lives of these swordfishermen, and you'llvirtually know what it feels like to die bydrowning. Junger describes the textures of thelives of these men so well that you feel you arethere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awash in an ocean of tangents...","review":"Man Against Nature is always an interesting topic and Junger certainly covers many aspects of it, but this story is unfocused and poorly edited. The \\"Andrea Gail\\" incident is only one of many loose threads covered in the detail-burdened narrative. A major storm is the picture of chaos - a book should not be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping Story","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this. The detail in describing characters, locations, weather conditions was excellent. I felt like I was there. Read it every spare minute I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightful and tragic.","review":"I was prepared for a book about weather, wind, and waves. It was all of that, but mostly it was about the people caught up in a tragic natural phenomenon. The author's research was thorough and results in a multidimensional description of the persona and the events of this true story. As a side effect of experiencing this gripping tale, the reader learns a lot about the details of long lining for swordfish a thousand miles from home port. There's the stuff for many nightmares in this book, but it's well worth the risk to enjoy the account."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally Written","review":"Exceptionally well written, this book is a page turner. Heart racing with sweaty palms the reader will unfold a castrophy at sea in great detail. Junger, in my opinion, has done an excellent job in researching, compiling and presenting the necessary data in a manner that is enjoyable and easily understandable. Having no knowledge of sailing, I at no time felt uninformed or confused about the material being presented. The story is gripping from the first chapter and is highly recommended. If this book is enjoyed by the reader than strong consideration should be given to \\"Into Thin Air.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Superstorm Power","review":"The descriptions of the storm were vivid.

Junger is gifted at stringing together different narratives into one gripping, can't-put-down story. He'll make you feel like you're seasick in Gloucester."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent and important look into commercial fishing","review":"Junger did an amazing job at detailing the terrifying last hours aboard the Andrea Gail. The amount of work that went into his book is astounding - his research, his dedication and his attention to detail. Much of the book is very technical and focuses on the intricacies of fishing tactics, boats, equipment, etc. A lot of the book is also focused on explaining weather systems and their effects, all of which I found fascinating. But not all of the book is scientific. Junger does a great job at giving a history of fishing, background stories on the men and of Gloucester itself. You can practically smell the salt water as you read. I highly recommend giving this one a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure and devestation","review":"October 1991 produced one of the most devastating storms to hit the North Atlantic.

It puts the importance of our jobs in a real and fascinating context."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Marketing Plan but poor storytelling","review":"I find true stories of human hardship and endurance such as 'Into Thin Air\\" compelling. But watch out when someone tries writes about a story to which there were no surviving eyewitnesses, such as the Andrea Gail sinking, \\"into the Wild\\" etc. This book goes off on tangents to fill space, such as how do we forecast storms, or how do longline fisherman live. But the actual story of the Andrea Gail crew is a thin thread, shrouded by conjecture. And the most dissapointing and telltale feature is the lack of authentic photographs in the book, substituted by cheesy set of glossy prints from the movie, with that ER guy. No, my imgination did not go anywhere with this.....but its making lots of $$ in the theatre."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intense and realistic narrative of life at sea.","review":"As a fishing vessel owner and one who has lost friends at sea, this book really brings it home and is hard to put down. For the non-fishing public, this book should help show life at sea and the real cost of fish to the people that harvest them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goot learnin but....","review":"Learned alot about the fishermen of the Grand Banks but, the sentences where so chopped up, it was like driving in stop and go traffic. ie: The boat arrives at the dock.

The girl crys......"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Imperfect Storm","review":"The history of the evolution of the methods of catching large hauls of fish was very interesting, as was the history of the fishing villages.

Their lives seemed to have been lifted from an unpleasant melodrama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great tale but so poorly written!","review":"I was very dissapointed after all the hype this book got.

I read it at night to get sleepy. I get through about 2 or 3 pages and I'm ready to turn off the light and go to bed. Save your money if you don't have insomnia.

Sexist opening aside, \\"The Perfect Storm\\" started fairly strong and then lost me about half-way through. I pressed on, hoping for the payoff other readers had promised. I was disappointed. The writing is passable but not stellar. The character development is folksy and familiar (having lived on Cape Ann) at the start. Then the story gets bogged down in technical, nautical details about storms, drowning and the rescue. I found it frustrating and strangely boring, as I did watching \\"Titanic.\\" In this case, everybody drowns. FYI: The movie version of \\"Storm\\" is even worse than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Storm","review":"The Perfect Storm is a very good novel about man vs. sea. I will admit that the story starts off slow with drunken sailors and how they live. Once you get passed the background stories of all the characters and the slow opening you will really get into the book. With the action packed fishing stories and the non stop storm action you are guaranteed to get a thrill. The ending of the story is extremely sad knowing that none of the fisherman survived the horrible storm. When all of the sailors a bored the Andrea Gale died its sad remembering that they all have loved ones back at home who need them in some way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oddly detached","review":"After reading the mesmerizing \\"Into Thin Air\\", I had hoped that The Perfect Storm would be equally as engrossing. Unfortunately, it left me rather cold (no pun intended.) Although the research and level of detail about the fishing industry was interesting (and sometimes tedious), I never became emotionally invested in the characters. It's not just that they weren't particularly likeable, it's that they are always overshadowed by the sheer quantity of facts. Their struggle never became a gripping aspect of the narrative. It was almost as if the author didn't care for his characters as much as he did for the technical accuracy of his descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is lightweight journalism","review":"Light on content, light on analysis, medium-to-light on characterization, all in all it reads like a not-very-good magazine article, inflated to book length. If it were fiction it would be without worth. As non-fiction there's an occasional thrill, but it should tell more than it does (I wanted to know more about the storm!) And as journalism the author fails to connect solidly with the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unputdownable true sea adventure","review":"Drowning at sea hardly seems a book subject, especially since there were no survivors and the author makes nothing up. But, in a masterly first section, the author creates such empathy for the sometimes unlovely fishermen aboard the Andrea Gail that the reader is compelled into their world, the physiology of storms, and the triumphs and tragedies of rescue. A style to marvel at and a book to reread"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly written","review":"After hearing much of the hype about this book, I bought a copy. After reading through almost half of it, I finally gave up and threw it against the wall. The writing was just abominable.

A better book that deals with ships disappearing on the high seas is Alan Villiers's \\"Posted Missing,\\" now out-of-print but available from booksellers at modest prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Waste of Time","review":"I wanted to read the book before I watched the movie. I'm a staunch believer that books are always better than their movie counterparts. For this particular book, I hope this is not the case.I was looking for an human interest story, what I got was a mariner's manual. Of the approximate 290 pages of the book, perhaps 150 of the pages actually had something to do with the Andrea Gail and her seamen. The other 140 pages were dedicated to explaining different aspects of swordfishing, tunafishing, history of Gloucester, history of the New England fishing industry, and nuclear testing, above all things.I do respect the amount of research Mr. Junger has put into his book, but one must wonder if he just lumped together a bunch of magazine articles and tried to bind them together, rather than telling a real story, with some sort of character development. It felt like I was reading a documentary. Let's hope the movie based on the book doesn't become a documentary as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good, Solid Read","review":"In a world that's more and more about go along to get along and where people will barely risk embarrassment let alone their lives, this is a story of people still working at sea and taking mortal risks to earn a livelihood. It protrays an older, more elemental world where survival is more important than being on a wining team and where can-do optimism pales beside the fury of a storm at sea. Junger has written a truly interesting and unique book. Something worthy of the New Yorker before it turn to chic literary voguing. To someone who once spent a few days in a small sailboat in the middle of a gail, it brought back the confusion and terror of the sea. I recommend it to anyone who loves the elements. Also, take a look at Allard Coles' classic, Heavy Weather Sailing"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Storm Has It All","review":"If you enjoy true life drama that is fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat this book is for you. Junger is a gifted writer who sifts all the wheat from the chaff resulting in a highly compact narrative. It moves seamlessly between the story line of those unknowingly caught in the path of impending tragedy and the technicalities that cause it without a noticable shift in gears. It is high drama. It is also highly educational. Above all, it is a monument to the human spirit; the spirit of those lost at sea, those who survived and those who risked their own lives in the rescue"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars and a full moon!","review":"Make no mistake, the main character of this story is the storm...Others have their moments in the limelight, but the storm is always there. It will have your entire attention through the last page.

Before you finish, you will have a understanding of longline fishing, basics of commercial fishing boat construction theory, how weather is formed at sea, the training of sea rescue personnel, and the process of drowning. All this and the human stories of each crew member of a fishing boat that was lost at sea. Included are the thought processes of various seapeople trying to guide boats in severe weather conditions. The weather situations will astound you. For those who enjoyed \\"Into Thin Air\\", and \\"Into the Wild\\", this will be an enjoyable and informative read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is NOT a \\"chick book\\"!","review":"But it's not strictly a \\"guy book,\\" either. It IS a terrific read -- the quintessential summer book: mass market paperback (i.e., easy to tote) and compelling story (i.e., difficult to put down). Elsewhere, I've talked about being \\"ruined by books,\\" and I confess to being partly ruined by The Perfect Storm. Trailers for the film moved me to pick it up. (I've avoided the book for two years, thinking it was too \\"bestseller\\" for my tastes.) The story of the Andrea Gail crew, their fellow fishermen, their friends and family, and the most compelling character in the book -- the sea itself -- drew me in and has not yet released its hold on me. Don't miss the vicarious thrill, terror, and wonder that Perfect Storm inspires. And pick it up before the movie. Let the film complement the mental pictures your mind conjures as you read, not dominate them."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anybody who loves open water boating","review":"Awesome book. The author usues very vivid and believable descriptions of the action. Even though he wasn't there in full, he knows his stuff and did his homework. I love all of the sub plots outside of the main fishing boat. He also describes the plight of the Atlantic swordfish better than any environmentalist! A book for the generations and one of my all time favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book ... interesting reviews","review":"The reviews will give you a good idea of the book. For my part, I couldn't put it down.Yes, there are a few annoying copy-editing glitches. Yes, you need to have a brain and an attention span.I was amazed at seeing negative reviews here, but after reading them, I think I understand them a bit better. Some found the detail distracting or worse. Some looked for more excitement (and lost me right about there; I don't see how anyone would want or need more excitement in a book than they'd find in The Perfect Storm). One or two could be summed up along the lines of, \\"Gee, only a few people died and I didn't like them, so why should anyone care?\\" I'm not sure what you call that. Empty, I guess.I've bought copies for friends and will keep doing that. In my driver's manual, that comes under the heading of High Praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped Author","review":"What a disappointment after all of the so-called book reviewers went on and on about how well this book was written. The content was interesting but the writing style was mediocre. It reminded me of reading some of the papers my children wrote in grade school. I guess that any style of writing is acceptable now and I shouldn't be so disappointed but I sure was. The author should get an \\"A\\" for his research but I would give him a \\"D+\\" for his style and lack of fluidity. 2 Stars is pushing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"over-rated","review":"When I read critic quotes that used words like \\"riveting, mesmerizing, thrilling\\" and so on, I thought I might be getting a book that I could liken to Krakauer's, \\"Into Thin Air,\\" or something, but absolutely not! I would use none of those words to describe this book. I felt as if the author was having to fill pages with all sorts of technological data, old stories, and so forth because there was so very little of a story to tell. I think this book may very well be worthwhile to those who are vastly interested in the subject matter; for me, though it was just dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story - Lukewarm writing","review":"If you like exciting stories, skip the first half of this book and read the remainder. If you like good writing, skip the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While somewhat interesting, I found the focus on the Andrea Gail unsatisfying since no one could say with certainty exactly what happened to the crew. I found the section on the parajumpers more interesting and, for me, it saved the book from being a complete waste of time. Still, I did throw it out when I finished with it...something I almost never do with a book.For those interested in the sea and its many faces, I would recommend John McPhee's Looking for a Ship as a far superior book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tearjerker","review":"It's not very often that I cry while reading a book but this was a rare exception for me. The book was fantastic reading and was jam packed with a lot more detail than the movie of the same name. So, if you thought the movie was good, then you absolutely must read this book. You're be happy you did too because the book is more involved in the people's lives. After reading this book, I was compelled to visit the fisherman's statue in Gloucester, MASS which was placed next to the sea in memory of all the fisherman who have passed away while fishing over many years. Knowing this book is also a true account of a freak storm which took the lives of these men, also makes it such compelling reading. I fully recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting.........","review":"Very suspenseful book...even if you have already seen the movie! I do not know much about the sea or sailing, but I now know more than enough to stay off the water during a storm! I had a little trouble with all the \\"sailing\\" details, which is why I rate it at 4 stars. It has a lot of detailed information that I sometimes found tedious. But it is a great story to read on the beach!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Storm Of The Century","review":"This was an excellent book! From the moment the ship set sail from Gloucester, Mass. until the end of the storm was heart wrenching. The action was nonstop. The story was about six men who love to fish, and are given a great opportunity to make a lot of money by going on this trip. They thought the only problems onboard would be the ones with each other...none of them expected to run into the perfect storm. When the storm hit, it was suspense all the way until the end of the book. Not knowing what would happen to these men was mind-boggling, and the final outcome was shocking. This a story for both guys and girls to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written book about a killer storm","review":"This book is part weather report, part fisherman's tale, and part climatological lesson. On their own, chances are the book would have been a flop. But throw them together, and add a spice of human interest, and you have the makings of a great book.Sebastian Junger does a nice job of writing about a storm that took place off the coast of New England, and the effects it had on the community. And although one might thing a story about a storm might be kind of dull, the storm is really the main character of the book. Every detail on what goes into turning your average run-of-the-mill storm into a 'perfect' storm is well researched and well written. And perhaps most importantly, it is written in such a manner so that the average read isn't lost in a lot of scientific talk.No matter what your background is, if weather is something that interests you, and on some levels weather and its causes and effects interests everyone, this book is worthwhile reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving:this is not a thriller!","review":"If you want to know about a fisherman's way of life or you want to know about storm formations out at sea, this may be an interesting book for you. I read it because I was told it was a thriller, a true life drama of how 6 men tried to survive a terrible storm in a boat, and I was totally disappointed. because there was no story. All Junger kept mentioning was that the ship disappeared without a trace, and then he went back to talking about weather formations again....I was half way through the book when I started wondering if this is all there is because I was getting bored, and sure enough that was all there was up to the end.! Those commentaries at the beginning of the book were total lies to promote the book and were totally unsubstantiated"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Bore???","review":"This book is ridiculous. Although I thought it looked interesting when I first started, it's actually quite boring. No offense to the author, he did his job very well, but the subject and actual structure of this book together was what casually led me to drowsiness. The amount of effort put into the book is extraordinary, and it totally shows in the awesome details and facts thrown in by the author, who really did his research. The book was confusing in the beginning, got boring real quick, but finished off decently. Overall it wasn't worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Storm by Sebastian Junger","review":"The Andrea Gail and her crew are out for what looks like a short pleasure cruise. It turns out they get stuck in the worst combination of weather in history. This storm makes a tornado look like a small gust of wind. The Perfect Storm gives you every reason in the world to not go out on the Atlantic Ocean. The Perfect Storm gives you a new sense of what a storm is. I think this is a soaking wet, hands down book. It is an aquaphobics nightmare. The crew of the \\"Andrea Gail\\" thought they could endure anything.... They thought wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only there were a picture","review":"Sometimes this book is so technical in its description of the boat and the hazards that can happen to them in open sea, that I really missed having some sort of visual reference. Nevertheless it would be a small improvement to this exciting book that picks up speed every page. Great fun !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Par excellence!","review":"A rare blend of human intrigue, suspense (even though you KNOW the outcome), technical grasp of physics, meteorology, oceanography and the fishing industry. Not a book you can put down very easily. I will recommend it to all I know for a long, long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Send a rescue Editor!","review":"The story related is interesting enough to carry the reader's interest, but the writing is atrocious and I can't understand how such a book gets the media wave to become a best-seller. The writing lacks dramatic pace, the story line is choppy, and there is a dismaying lack of compassion. The publisher is equally at fault for not demanding more careful editing and re-writing. If you want to hear a harrowing tale told right, read Krakauer's Into Thin Air. It sets a standard for humanistic adventure writing that A Perfect Storm cannot touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thriller - suspenseful - wonderful research/insight!!","review":"From one who loves the sea, I can feel what's happening through his words. His research is incredible. Suspense, emotion, physics, meteorology, psychology, information, on & on. This book has it all and is tough to put down. I remember the storm well. I had a flight from Boston that night and was the first time I never really wanted to get on a plane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely whets appetite on suspense; too much dry detail","review":"\\"A reader\\" on 5/26/98 has echoed my feelings on this book perfectly. I expected a suspenseful read with laced with vivid human drama; I expected a \\"page-turner\\". What I found was a true life event with far too much techno-talk and a story (\\"the worst strom of the 20th century\\") that unfolded as fast as ketchup runs out the bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in surprising ways.","review":"Junger's book ends up being fascinating for many different reasons, despite its weird structure. It starts out as the tale of one fishing boat caught in the \\"perfect storm\\", but since no one lived to tell the story of that boat, much of the excitement of the story comes from his patching together other stories. Besides, for the most part, the lives of the fishermen and those they lived with on land are less than compelling because these are ordinary rather than exceptional people. By far the best and most compelling writing in the book is about the Air National Guard helicopter that goes down after a rescue attempt. Other interesting segments of the book deal with the basic mechanics of long-line fishing (i.e., how it is done today), the mechanics of drowning, and meteorology. Junger has strung together a variety of almost stand alone chapters, but the end result still for the most part captivates one's attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I read a excerpt of this story in my IB english class.(Freshman)I found it to be extremely boring as did many of my peers. Although it is a nonfiction, I think that it could have been better written to make it a more interesting story. Something else I would like to bring up is that not many people know alot about baots the frequent usage of boating terms was useless for describing the story because I did not understand a word of it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Technical","review":"This would have been an interesting story, if the author had stuck to the main story and not gone off into several different directions, and I really don't care to know about every little detail of how a ship is run. I wanted a story, not a fishing manual!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why this book when you can read Private Parts?","review":"Great Book...I loved every page of it however, I will stick to Private Parts and Miss America by Howard Stern."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrifying book that must be read to be believed","review":"I asked my father if he could recommend an interesting read and he handed me this book. Starting out as leisurely stroll through the history of the Gloucester coast and the daily comings and goings of professional fishermen, page by page The Perfect Storm becomes an increasingly tense and unsettling recreation of the tragedy that befell the crew of a small fishing vessel during one of the worst storms in recorded history. Although Junger takes the occasional unwelcome diversion into history and technical description, his book is genuinely frightening - the journey through the physical sensation of drowning is particularly disturbing - but most of all, it is very sad. The coda is some of the most hauting writing I have ever read. Stick through the difficult stuff and you'll be richly rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic, but fascinating - I couldn't put it down.","review":"The book is gripping in its tale of struggles on the sea and the hardships endured by families whose lives depend on the commercial fishing industry. I was enthralled by the author's description of the history of commercial fishing in New England and his explanations of the meteorological events which lead to the tragic loss of many lives during \\"The Perfect Storm\\". Having once been \\"lost\\" in Gloucester while on a driving tour of Eastern Massachussets, I really appreciated the author's description of the local culture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, great topic","review":"One would have to read the Patrick O'Brian books about the age of sail, or perhaps a great novel about courage under fire like \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\", to find a book to compare with \\"The Perfect Storm\\" for emotion-packed accounts of heroism and dedication. I was very impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm now hooked on stories of man vs. mother nature","review":"Being the passenger of a boat that swirled around the Chesapeake Bay during this \\"perfect storm\\" I have the utmost respect for the characters, victims and family members, Junger so eloquently describes. However, you don't have to be able to recall this storm to appreciate Junger's work. It's obvious, he did a tremendous amount of research, and put a great deal of effort into this great account of Mother Nature showing her nasty side. My wife read the book after me, and she too was hooked, saying it was impossible to put down. I can't wait to see what Mr. Junger does for an encore. His first will be hard to top!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My God","review":"I read this book because i was really interested in the movie coming out. I am not a fisherman and have never spent time on the ocean, but this book was incredible. I went through it so quick and when you stop to think that this REALLY happened it gives you a moment of pause. My heart goes out to all the families of the men lost aboard the Andrea Gail. The afterword by Sebatian Junger was particulary interesting seeing what has happened to him since writing this book. His constant nightmares about being onboard during the storm. This book was heartwrenching it is incredible please read it you will never forget what happened to those brave men."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY SUPRISINGLY INTERESTING BOOK....","review":"THIS BOOK NOT ONLY DESCRIBED IN DETAIL THE FINAL MOMENTS IN THIS \\"PERFECT STORM\\" TO ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED, MAKING FOR A VERY SCARY READ UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT, IT ALSO GOES IN GREAT DETAIL OF A FISHERMAN'S LIFE. I LEARNED MUCH ABOUT THIS LIFE THAT I REALLY HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT,EVEN AFTER SEEING THE MOVIE. ALSO AGAIN, WITH THE DETAILS, U FEEL AS THOUGH U WERE ON THE WATER, GOING THRU THIS MONSTER. A GREAT READ!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read - even the third time","review":"I gotta agree with Roy, and disagree with Stephanie...I've now read this book 3 times. The first time was for the story and drama, and the extra 2 reads were for the details about the boat and swordfishing. I've also read Linda Greenlaw's book \\"The Hungry Ocean: A Swordboat Captain's Journey\\" and it is excellent as well.I think the drama is well depicted: if you have ever sailed or boated in extremely hazardous conditions (I have on Lake Michigan), you wonder to yourself what brought you there that day - why are you there? I think that's the part of the book I can really identify with."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book.","review":"Though you already know the outcome, the drama is intense. The story is skillfully told, both awesome and sad. I learned a lot and was sorry to finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe inspiring","review":"This book was well researched and excellently written. The extensive backround and technical details do not detract from the sheer thrill of the book, if anything they accentuate it. My only complaint with the book was that Ray Leonard's situation was given what I believe to be unfair, biased and misleading coverage - The ultimate result was that he was proven right, despite the opinion of his crew and the Coast Gaurd, but not before the CG forced him to abandon everything he owned. Unfortunately, that's what happens when only one side of a dispute will talk to the media, but I digress. This book also serves as an excellent technical primer for anyone contemplating going to sea in less than favorable weather. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a mess.","review":"The Perfect Storm is an imperfect story. This book promises a lot, but it doesn't pay off until the final third. What transipred on the Andrea Gail is unkonwn, even if you've read the book. It has a lot of \\"Well, if the sea did this, then the people on board might have done this.\\" And then the formation of a storm or the history of a bar is discussed for 15 pages. The book's high point is near the end when the Air National Guard rescues are being discussed. I was very disappointed by the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect storm","review":"After In Cold Blood, The Perfect Storm is the best non-fiction book I can recall. I don't understand why so many 1 star reviews, but then look at how many reviews! Over 900! To me the book is a great compilation of the northeast USA fishing industry, the fishermen themselves, meteorology in general, and what happens when the fishermen meet bad weather. The drama comes in between the details of the life of fishermen of one of the most dangerous areas on earth. The climax comes when the author details the last moments of dying fishermen on a sinking boat. I don't think I've ever read anything as moving as that description. The book naturally descends from that point (the boat's sinking) to the several weeks following the storm: further rescues, searches, aftermath of the storm. I wish I could write a review equal to this author's book. Totally recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated and at times very boring book.","review":"This might be an ok book if you're involved in the industry, but for all others it just doesn't ring true. You know from the beginning that no one knows exactly what went wrong with the Andrea Gail. Also, the accounts of other fishermen with similar experiences reads more like a survey or a part of a case study than an actual story. The author should have at least stuck to one storyline and tried to make us believe that we were with the the sailors from the beginning of the trip to the end. This is a very disjointed book, as someone said earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't wait to put this book down.","review":"If it wasn't for the section describing the Navy rescue attempt, this book would not have been worth reading. This book has been unjustly compared with \\"Into Thin Air,\\" which was an exciting, eye-witness description of the events on Mount Everest.In 'The Perfect Storm,'the descriptions of what *may* have happened on the Andrea Gail were, at best, fictional. The author should have focused the story on one of the activities of one of the other boats in the hurricane.I would not give this book even a one-star rating if there was an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I had heard so much about this book that I had come to it expecting something interesting. Indeed, the story should be interesting, and I am very much interested in the sea and in weather. However, this book makes for excruciatingly painful reading. The author seems to be repeating himself in many places, while leading us on with promises that never pan out. The book is presented as \\"factual\\", but this is stretching the notion of fact a little. The few things that I know something about were presented by the author in such a way that they were only \\"true\\" in a fuzzy sort of way, and lead me doubt almost everything that he writes about. He is either a bad lier or a bad observer; in either case, he doesn't give an impression of verisimilitude. This is the Disney version of sailing in storm. I see from the dustjacket that it was originally a magazine article. It should have been left there for a better writer to tackle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect storm","review":"The Perfect StormThis is a true story about the adventure of six sword fishermen taking on the perfect storm. This perfect storm is the rare meeting of three weather systems. The author Sebastian Junger, brings the story to life. The Perfect Storm will leave you on the edge of your seat and keep you guessing what might happen next. The beginning of the book may keep you from reading on because it is so descriptive, but I strongly encourage you to do so. Sebastian Junger shows how life is as a fisherman as well as a fisherman's wife. He shows the pain loved ones feel when they leave to go out to sea for months at a time. If you are looking for \\"A white knuckle adventure\\" according to Newsweek this is the book for you. The New York Times honors it as a bestseller. In 1991 the perfect storm took place off the coast of Nova Scotia. This may be a once in a lifetime event.

This book hits the reader like a hundred foot wave, and yet there is so much more. Its the feelings the book brings out that makes it so good. One moment you're happy because someone was saved; half a page later you're on the verge of tears because you know someone isn't coming home."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping tale of the perils commercial fishermen face.","review":"The storm that destroyed the fishing boat and its crew was not forecast ahead of time.

The book reminds us that men are insignificant when it comes to the forces of nature, no matter how sophisticated the equipment or technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best non-fiction I've ever read!!!","review":"The book pulls you in. The nautical explanation is surpassed only by the emotional analysis. What were these men thinking, seeing 90 foot waves breaking over them.

Junger gets closer to the truth than anyone has before."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should have been a great book","review":"What a great idea for a book. The weather - we all know about it, most talk about it at least once a day, if not more. What a chance to take this often poorly understood topic and transform it to something really exciting. Imagine, a very low pressure system, so low it raises the ocean beneath it next to a very high pressure system of very cold air in Canada. Now imagine the forces at work between them. I can see masses of cold and warm air feuding for supremacy. Alas, what I found in the book were pages and ponderous pages of boozing people in pubs. Then more plodding pages of what the storm could have been like.

I certainly don't wish to speak ill of those who I presume died...but there wasn't a character in this book that had a single redeeming feature, as they were described in it.I am very character focused in those books I enjoy, and I enjoy them most when I like at least some of the characters; I liked no one in this book. No one.The detailed descriptions of the day-to-day work and technicalities were boring; the book just never seemed to go anywhere.I gave it two stars because the author at least used correct grammar and syntax; I save the one stars for those who can't even do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Story Sadly Written","review":"i read this book because i was intrigued, and indeed touched, by the story of these fisherman...i soon after saw the movie, and i am sad to say that this is the one in a million time that the movie is better than the book....Junger weighed down this novel with boring stories about the history of fishing and a bunch of other meaningless drivel...the story is of course sad, though it is thrilling (as evidenced by the action in the movie) but the book drags unbelievably...its sad to say that such a tale has been told in such a poor way"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I looked very forward to reading this book. I loved Into Thin Air and was told to read Perfect Storm. I read the many positive reviews for this book in the papers and magazines.

Yes, a tragic story, but in my opinion a very boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is much better","review":"The book accounts too many details on what the crew ate, drank, and purchased before their fateful voyage.

I find the main fault is that it is hideously boring. A friend of mine pretty much summed it up when he said, \\"If I want to read a report, I'll look in the newspaper.\\" Because that's what this book is equivilent to; a 256 page news report. So if you're going to spin an interesting sea yarn, you might want to try a little harder than Mr. Junger; this borefest is more likely to have us landlubbers diving into our dictionaries than the book itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Present for my husband that I read first!","review":"Purchased as a Christmas gift for my husband, I made the mistake of reading a few lines before wraping; I was hooked!

Why did this book get such good reviews? Beats me. I wonder of those who loved it ever read a GOOD adventure book like Into Thin Air? J.K. needs to learn to WRITE and then how to make a good story suspenseful and present! I'm giving the STORY 2 stars and Junger none!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read. Five Stars isn't enough!","review":"I have for many years now deeply respected Mother Nature. This is particularly relevant to the many years I have been boating whether it be sailing or fishing on a motor boat. For the average boater, I have seen everything I would ever want to see and this book brings everything you don't want to see in perspective. As any mariner would tell you, It can be perfectly calm one minute and the next minute Mother Nature has reared her Ugly head and all you can think to yourself is, \\"I hope I can make it home.\\" This book is the only book I have ever read from front to back and then immediately started over again. I am here today to open an account and then to order a few more copies of a book in which I think everyone should read. A must for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"If you enjoy the ocean and have an appreciation for its strength,weather commercial fisherman,mariner,Pleasure boater.This is the real heart pounding stuff that awaits us all on The Great Blue.Superb Book. 5 Star."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific, absorbing","review":"I had served in the U.S. Navy in the 50s in that area while on picket duty aboard a radar picket ship. I not only could relate to that particular area of the ocean. It not only brought back memories of the sea but I re lived the entire episode through this wonderful saga. I felt like I was 19 again. terrific book. cannot praise it enough"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great sea-side sequel to Jon Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air.\\"","review":"Contemplating a relaxing cruise this fall? Don't read this book until after you return! The horrifyingly stark descriptions of drowning and being swallowed by the sea would make even the most seaworthy skipper a little timid. Junger mixes the action and the scientific fact in a way that keeps the story moving, even if he darts back and forth through time. A perfect seaside version of Jon Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air,\\" and an equally enthralling look at what happens when pride and hubris cloud one's judgement. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super read. Humbling, informative, tragic, heroic......","review":"This book takes you to the eye of the storm and back. While based somewhat on speculation, I still found the story gripping and realistic. It didn't exploit the lives of those that died, but made them human. It managed to weave in the stories of others in the storm as well (not just about the ship the Andrea Gail), which I felt added to the atmosphere and tension of the storyline. These supporting stories were necessary to provide context, as well as to provide real-life accounts of survivors to add credibility to the finished story. I also liked the information about the difficult lives of fisherman and the description about storms and weather. If you like adventure laced with interesting information, this book could be for you, though you may not want to go boating for awhile. Nice work !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, not so great movie","review":"The movie does this book no justice. Read this book, it is a true story of the brave fishermen who risk their lives to put fish on our plates. Overall, I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the movie!","review":"An incredible thriller, this non-fiction account of a disastrous storm will undoubtedly make it to the big screen, something that doesn't often happen with non-fiction. But then non-fiction is rarely as gripping as \\"The Perfect Storm.\\" In reading through the other buyer reviews I saw no mention of the portrait of bravery the author draws concerning the \\"rescue swimmers.\\" These are the real heros of the story for me. Having spent some time sailing on an angry Lake Erie in mild storms, I now understand that I only saw a fraction of the terror that can befall the sailor"},{"rating":"1","title":"An overrated, overblown magazine article","review":"This book was easy airplane reading, easily finished in a trip from Dallas to Portland, but left me incredibly unsatisfied. The execution of the book's premise, capturing the last days of a doomed crew, is flawed. The author has limited information on what actually happened and fails to adequately speculate. Moreover, he only captures the personality of one of the crew members. When the author realizes he has to fill up 200 pages to justify the $25 price, he starts on several new \\"magazine articles\\", having little to do with the story.This book had a great premise and some interesting insights into the fishing industry, but unfortunately is easily forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money (or the time)","review":"There has been a lot of hype about this book and I'm not sure why. I read this book expecting to learn about the tragic event that occurred in the Atlantic and instead the book gives various scenarios that might have happened. These hypotheticals are distracting because it interrupts any semblance of a story. At the very least, the author could have followed one hypothetical through to its logical end. Instead, we're given random facts along with the hypotheticals which purport to explain different aspects of navigation. The author could really have benefitted from reading \\"Into Thin Air\\", which is a far superior book and tells a fascinating story. That is what's missing from \\"A Perfect Storm\\" - a good story told in an interesting way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"Horrible book straight ahead! No coherent structure exists for this \\"story\\". Down, down your hard-earned money goes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was written by a journalist...","review":"And you can tell. This book reads like a 100+ page newspaper article. And while newspaper style is very nice for short, half page articles, it is not good for a book.I have to admit, I may be a bit biased. I tend to carry a bit of a grudge against largely overrated popular books. But the fact is, reading this book was torture. Every few pages, Junger seemed to go off on tangents longer than the actual story. He goes into absurdly unnecessary discussions of the technology involved, and even I, a geek and technophile, was bored to tears.So, basically, an interesting historical story completely ruined by awful narrative, excessive detail, and an incapability to stick to the point.Give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Storm","review":"The $5.42 that I spent on the paperback copy of this book should've gone to some charitable organization. There should have been a warning on the cover that says \\"For seafaring people only\\". I am an avid reader and can read almost anything in print, but.....I had to HUNT for something in this book to read and understand. The movie looks so awesome, surely it does not follow the story line in the book. The book was full of facts, explanations, and history...but no story about a perfect storm. I will see the movie, because I can't imagine George Clooney doing anything that is not quality, but he must not have read the book! Advice: don't read the book, just see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix of fact, fiction, fishing and social commentary...","review":"Mr. Junger has captured the feeling of both the fishing life in New England and also the hopelessness of some of the lives of the people there. It's a fine job of writing that keeps you turning to the last Epilogue and Afterword page even though it's clear from the book's jacket that the ending is anything but happy. This is a story that could take place in many hard-working towns, and I'm off to search Amazon.com for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very engrosing; Tough to put down...","review":"I thought this was an excellent book. It kept my interest throughout and is very well researched, written, and informative. The sections on the rescue teams (i.e. PJ's) were amazing and the descriptions of the climate put me right on the boat or the H-60's. Many great little facts and tidbits can be found throughout the text. This storm really was \\"Perfect\\" and I hope we never see it's type of wrath again. I was in Massachusetts during the storm and it was as destructive a storm as I had seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly insightful and educational!","review":"This book was much better than I was expecting. It had a lot of technical jargon, but it was necessary in order to understand what actually happens when these men are at work. It was suspensful, while at the same time sad because it was based on actual events. The author really got into the guts of the fishing industry and how tremendously difficult it is. He shows the level of dedication that these men have to do what they do. If you can stick with the technical jargon, the end result is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go figure. A book about a storm that you can't put down!","review":"This book simply refused to be put down until I finished it in the wee hours of the morning on the day I started to read it. Even the rescue missions were utterly captivating. Junger's articles in OUTSIDE magazine are always must-reads, but this book, written with style and verve, yet with extraordinary compassion and sensitivity for the victims and their families, is a work of a truly unique writer. This is what \\"investigative journalism\\" really should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating book -- if a bit unstructured","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read it on vacation near the sea and could not stop reading it. Junger is a great storyteller, equally able to captivate the reader with characters and narrative as well as with factual detail. I liked the descriptions of fishing, weather, and the Coast Guard's rescue people very much. My main criticism of the book is that a bit of graphic material (more detailed maps, weather photos, drawings of sword fishing boats, perhaps something to help the reader visualize an 80-foot wave) would have really helped. As it was, I kept having to flip to the limited map to help me understand who was where, when."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is poorly written and unfocused.","review":"Unfortunately, the stories of the men lost at sea get lost in a quagmire of unrelated details, trivia, and imagined conversations. For the most part, the writing gets bogged down, and the point of the book is foggy. However, the descriptions of the survivors' experiences at sea are fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Button down the hatches, we're going for a ride","review":"All the adulation this book has gotten certianly is deserving. Anyone with a white collar day job will probably question their integrity and manhood after reading about the abject terror that those who work on the sea must face. I found the ditched helicopter and subsequent rescue attempt the most riviting part of the book. Simply terrifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Drama in the \\"Into Thin Air\\" Mode","review":"I read this book almost immediately after \\"Into Thin Air\\" and was immediately taken by the similarities. Again, I found myself asking why anyone would risk such a potentially hideous death. Of course, there is a huge difference between rough hewn fisherman trying to eek out a living and the bored noveau rich out looking for a thrill. Junger builds the suspense very well and his first hand description of drowning is absolutely riveting. As with Krakauer's book, this is great non-fiction that reads like an adventure story."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you wanted to know about swordfishing and storms","review":"The book contains a great description of the economics of swordfishing, followed by a fascinating narrative on how a little bubble in the Atlantic Ocean off the Equator becomes a deadly part of the \\"Perfect Storm\\" of the title.How these fit into the lives of the men on board the Andrea Gail makes for a good read and a hope that the author will not be a one-shot sensation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Dated","review":"This would be a nice compilation of stories and anecdotes to read--if it were 1982. Reading it felt like I was being lectured by an old man in a nursing home telling me about how hard it was 'back in MY day'.I judge a book about the Appalachian Trail by whether or not it makes me want to go out and hike it. This one did no such thing. It felt like sitting around listening to a bunch of old George Carlin-types, without the wit or humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of great people not true people.","review":"This book is great for those who want the taste of the appalachian trail and what it has to offer but does not bring the at to your house so you can feel it. When I read this book I never did feel him walking the trail. I do respect him for walking the trail but the format of this book does not walk the trail it explains it. He speaks of the super hikers not the average hikers like myself. I can't hike the trail in 50 days. I did not walk the trail blind. I experienced it. I stopped and smelled the wildflowers bloom with the fresh mountain dew. Thats the trail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walking the Appalacian Trail","review":"Diappointing purchase. If you are a history buff and want to read about legends or those who have hiked the trail from 1930 to 1980, this book may interest you. However, if you are looking for either entertainment about those who have hike the AT recently or advise about the AT - forget it. Well written, but not, I suspect, what most readers are looking for with regard to hiking the Appalician Trail. A much better read is \\"AWAOL on the Appalacian Trail\\" by David Smith - also available on Amazon. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget Bryson's book, read this one!","review":"A pleasure to read the tremendous variety of experiences of people who did the AT and got something out of it.

Indeed, 5 months after reading this book, I was sleeping on the ground at night and walking 15-20 miles every day. It inspired me to start a thruhike of the AT, and after finishing the first one, I did another, and then another. Almost surely I'll do it again. Life will never be the same. This book started it all for me. Not just about Luxenberg's own hiking experiences, the book distills the stories of many different hikers, from the first thruhiker (Earl Shaffer) to \\"ordinary\\" hikers of today, plus several who were not at all ordinary. Many, many books have been written about the AT. This one is a powerful classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read - Will need to have more to Hike the A.T. though","review":"I really enjoyed the read, lots of history and interesting stories of people on the trail. The book points out many ways to do the trail without stressing one method over another. Further enticed my desire to do the trail but this book is by no means a how to or a what you'll need type book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Pete","review":"Gotta love Pete! Great album.

An answer to my prayers!!","review":"I bought this dress after battling incontinence for the past five years. It has been a very embarassing ordeal for both myself and my family. Either I have to always be near a bathroom for fear of soiling and ruining yet another pair of pants, or I have to wear Depends. The embarassing thing about the Depends is the crinkling sound they make when you sit and how droopy they get when they're full.When I first bought this dress, I was a bit skeptical, but it has been a lifesaver for me! It's so easy to quickly remove when you're got that 'got to go' feeling! No more wet pants for me! The only drawback to wearing this is the looks and comments that I get from my wife and kids.

She is a great artist and this book reflects her abilities, the books has pictures of the dolls she created for the story. The pictures say a thousand words. If you are a doll maker, you will greatly enjoy this book. The story is good but the pictures are better. It has different kind of trolls, fairies and wizards. If you love fantasy you will love the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So religious I couldn't use it","review":"I bought this book for a team-building at work, and was very disappointed because 95% of the suggestions were based on religion.

Things Fall Apart is another well crafted Roots gem that has original instrumentation, tight lyrics & thoughtful concepts. It's a reason why The Roots during their concerts perform a song called \\"Hip-Hop 101\\" because a lot of these fraud emcees need a crash course in the art. Things Fall Apart doesn't need to be broken down because the 4 or 5 star ratings speak for themselves.

This album is real good in comparision to 90% of hip hop albums but I also think the previous 2 were better. I bought this, Eminem, DJ Quik and Prince Paul the same day.

He is a truly incredible MC. And is backed by some truly remarkeble artists. ?uestionlove, the human drum machine, paces the group with a mellow vibe. A vibe the Roots have sought to perfection, with so much chaos riding within. An excellent LP. \\"Double Trouble\\" with Mos Def is most ill (sorry about the pun) and \\"You Got Me\\" with Erykah Badu and Eve(?) is perhaps the albums zenith. The Roots,simply put, are one of Hip-Hop's finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album not as good as Illadelphi or do you want more though","review":"I'm going to be critical here because all the people that review tend to be fans of the album their reviewing. I've got all the roots albums and can say that this is middle of the road. I would say it is the first album of the modern roots phase where their style differs by creating a modern but at the same time retro feel with the bottles and bells sampling. \\"Dynamite\\", \\"Ain't sayin' nothin new\\", \\"love of my life\\" and \\"you got me\\" are all chilled and great songs but don't flow like tracks such as \\"Episodes\\" or \\"Proceed\\" on previous albums.

Word up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good? Yes! Great? Not so fast.","review":"This joint, the fourth from the Roots, shows me two things. One, The Roots have more \\"artist\\" in their hip-hop than just about anyone out there. Act Too (Love of My Life) is probably the dopest joint I have heard in 5 years. The intricate nature of their production is simply beyond reproach, and goes places that most rap artists aren't even thinking about going. Definitely way ahead of the game, and it's sad that 10 times more people will select a Puffy or Mase joint over this. Hell, I could almost duplicate a Puffy album on my computer in an afternoon. Anyway, the second thing this album shows me, is that it is not up to the level of the Roots classic, \\"Do You Want more??!!!!?\\" But, hey, 80% of the Roots is better than 110% of anyone else. A definite keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Record was ingeniously titled...","review":"AIYO SUMTHIN'S GOIN' On!!!!!I am a big roots fan, but like i said this album was ingeniously titled because on this album things did just that, FELL APART... I felt the roots the most on Do you want more, but ever since then their albums (in my opinion) have on been a downward spiral. Perhaps I didn't like the album because i cant feel mos def. Infact I hate mos def!!!! And this album was ridden with the ridiculously monotonus style of Talib Kweli, which to me was practically unbearable... If it was any other group i would recommend that you save your money, but i am a die hard fan.(so at least try to get it on sale) Black Thought (to me) sounded extremely bored on this album and was trying too hard to make something out of nothing..

I only enjoyed about 4 tracks in total, like \\"You Got Me\\", where Erykah Badu perhaps had the effect of making BT tone down his aggressive tone to a more listenable one.It's a pity (though I can understand him to be frustrated as someone who is conscious of past racism and the black cause) that he has this particularly annoying tone of voice, that whilst not as bad as Canibus', is still sufficiently misplaced that it spoils things for me.Anyway that's why I give it 2.5/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"This album I am sorry to say is a disappointment. Unworthy to follow up illadelph halflife. The best song is \\"You got me\\" and maybe two other songs are worth mentioning but I want. The lyrics may have been tight but the music lacks luster.

Things Fall Apart is simply the best hip hop cd in years. from the intro all the way to the hidden track, it is top notch hip hop. u can just tell by listening to the lyrics and the thought that the music is being played with (god forbid) live instruments that a lot of hard work went into making this album, and we, the fans, have been so generously awarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Bless The Roots!!!!","review":"This is by far one of the hottest albums to come out of the hip hop world in a hot minute.

It is consistently good, and has some strong tunes as well as very interesting lyrics, which makes for a great listen.

I actually recorded this CD on a low quality tape to get all the hissing and popping and I like that little bootleg tape better then the actual album.

The tracks on this album are so great(Next movement, Adrenaline, Act Too, You Got Me), that any song less than perfect is a disapointment. Songs like Dynamite and Without a Doubt are creattive, but not dynamic (by Roots standards). Hoowever, even these two are better than 90% of what is out now. Black Thought proves why he is one of the top five MC's in the game, spitting out lethal, agressive lyrics over catchy, creative tracks. Malik B. is ok, but not up to Thoughts calliber.

But I decided to buy this book because a) I had a gift certificate and b) I was getting tired of hearing him tell me it was the greatest thing since the invention of hair in a can (hint, hint Tony!). But the book is actually pretty funny. It's amusing to read about the mistakes that Tony's made (not counting PTI) and about the way he does things. My favorite is the story about how he didn't even tour the colleges his daughter was looking at. He was busy playing golf with his son. Tony, that's just CLASSIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The names and events may be somewhat outdated,,,,","review":"but the humor certainly is not in Tony Kornheiser's, \\"I'm Back For More Money\\". The material in this book comes from collections of some of Kornheiser's best columns from the Washington Post. Kornheiser's ascerbic wit is at it's best in \\"I'm Back...\\". He rants on everything from the battles he has with his teenage children to national politics. A lot of sport topics are thown in but, most of the material comes from Kornheiser's \\"Style\\" column and not from \\"Pardon The Interruption\\"-type (PTI) topics.I don't often find myself laughing out loud while reading a book, but I did many times as I progressed this fast-reading book.

The rug arrived, well-wrapped, a week earlier than anticipated, in perfect condition and exactly as described. We have it in our living room of our condo and everyone who walks into the room just oohs and aahs over it. The nap is thick and lush, and the quality of the rug is excellent.

The only thing lacking in this novel is further insight into the mind of Louis, a smart but constantly taken advantage of character.

My only and real disappointment with this album is that the wonderfully melodic \\"Message of Love\\", from the original BOG LP was left off this CD. \\"Message of Love\\" was one of the most melodic and inspirational tunes I think Jimi ever wrote. Jimi's soaring-soul searching solo on \\"Message of Love\\" just breaks my heart. It's just absolutely thrilling to hear someone play this well, straight from the heart. The soulful back up harmonies by Cox and Miles really set this song off. It's a shame \\"Message of Love\\" was not included on the CD.Von Ehman"},{"rating":"2","title":"Woo-hoo","review":"What can I say, I have come to exspect a lot of Jimi and he just pulls \\"Live\\" from his sack shoves it down my throught and says \\"In Your FACE\\" Voodoo Child (Slight Return) is amazing and quite a bit better then his studio recording, although We Got To Live Togeather is a dissapointment it balences out the \\"stunning-nes\\" of the rest of the album and I reccomend you buy this.

I haven't read one review mentioning how awesome the featured version of \\"Stepping Stone\\" is here. What were Jimi, Billy, and Buddy trying to do, invent punk rock before there was such a thing? I mean how many Jimi Hendrix songs (live or studio) would be at home in a mosh pit? Jimi was the greatest and his talent for reinventing his material live on stage was limitless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than first rate effort","review":"Band of Gypseys was formed because of 1)a contractual problem Hendrix had and 2)a desire to broaden Hendrix's appeal with the black crowd. This recording has numerous examples of inadvertent tempo changes and playing that's off-key. Buddy Miles ain't no Mitch Mitchell. This is not Hendrix at this best. His best live recording is the album titled, \\"Hendrix in the West.\\" It's not in CD format. His playing on that album is blistering and a clear measure of how far off the Fillmore East concerts are."},{"rating":"1","title":"its o.k but,......","review":"I have to agree with \\"Josh Turnpike\\" a previous reviewer, this collection of live performance's is nothing on \\"Band Of Gypsys\\", there just doesnt seem to be the energy or the cohesion within the band.I love jimi, I have all his studio albums and quite a few live one's, and I was really looking forward to hearing this, but on it's 3rd listen I just had to admit to myself that this cd was sub standard.If I had heard it in the store, and could take my time listening to longer than 30 second samples I wouldnt have bought it.By \\"BAND OF GYPSYS\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Machine Gun","review":"I'm giving this four stars because of Hendrix' performance And I removed a star because there were a few slow moments that should perhaps have been left off. And I don't think Buddy Miles was the right drummer for him. But when Hendrix was on, he was on! Machine Gun alone is a terrifyingly intense performance wherein Hendrix played everything that can possibly be played on an electric guitar. Earth Blues showcased a marvelous guitar work, as did Power of Soul and others.I know some people who were at these concerts. They told me that listening to recordings were nothing compared to being there. Unfortunately, this is all we have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Essential","review":"In 1967 Jimi Hendrix plugged in his guitar and took over the world for almost 4 full years! This is very upbeat and uplifting music. Buddy Miles is probaly the best soul singer I have everheard. Jimi teams up with buddy and billy and tears off the roof of the fillmore with his extended jams. This music is very jamming with awesome guitar from brother Jimi. This live performance is very awesome and it makes you wana get up and dance with your brothers and sisters. Its got this funk/soul feeling with the rock n' roll and makes it a great selection. I feel this is some of the best hendrix outthere. I am impressed after borrowing it from my best friends and I immeditaely wanted it to be my next Hendrix selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some great jams on here.","review":"I can't really tell you how this album compares to the original band of gypsies, but I can tell you that its pretty darn good. Jimi's playing is different-hard to describe- he seems to be playing more rhythmically and less over the top intensity, although there are moments of the latter. Its really just a great soulful album with some of the best guitar playing you'll ever hear and a positive vibe. Both the versions of machine gun on here are incredibly sonic and atmospheric. Whatever you may think about how this compares to other Hendrix albums, this is still better than 99.99999999% of what passes for music now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crocheting Teddy Bears","review":"This was exactly what I was hoping for.

As hostess, you can also use the preset format of the books entertainment pages for special parties and write in the hors d'oeuvres & appetizers, the entire menu and any special notes you want to add.

It began with a boy named Nick Young. He snuck onto the ship Endeavor and hid in the pinnace for a while. It might have been a better book if he wasn't found hiding in Chapter 2 or what have you. All I can say is the book was boring and repetitive. The crew met natives, traded with natives, befriended natives, killed natives etc.Don't get me wrong some parts were exciting, but there wasn't much action. If there was sword fighting and pirates, it would be a much better book. There was quite a bit of death which I didn't like to much.The book had no fantasy, not one bit, but you might like it if you like fancy ship talk and boats. I wouldn't recommend it.

It didn't deserve it.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the best books I've read.","review":"Stowaway was not one of the best books I have read.

Now for the bad, and there is pleanty of it. The most annoying feature for me (other than the poor transfer quality...call me spoiled by DVD) was the constand barrage of Titles. Unlike Baraka or Chronos, there were titles every 3-7 minutes that really broke the spell that the images can supply. On top of that the music accompanyment is awful. And the worst sin is the constant repitition of cities and images. There was little flow to this video, and overall I would not reccomend it to those seeking something similar in the Baraka genre'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Award Winning and Inspiring!","review":"I was instantly swept away by the magnitude of awe-inspiring images.

Let's just keep our fingers crossed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A More Internal Perspective.....................","review":"These novelizations of three of the television episodes from the third Buffy season featuring Faith are solid; we get a little more of Faith's perspective and experience, how these stories and events had an impact on her on a personal level. It's a good read, not a necessity, but enjoyable nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaining Faith","review":"This is almost the only place to find even a mention of Faith in the book series, let alone to experience her as a character. Which is a great pity, because there's a lot there to explore.This book is merely a novelization of Faith's first episodes on the series, and as such will be nothing new to the fans. The stories end at the point where Faith falls from grace, which hardly makes for a complete novel from her entry as a co-Slayer, but is at least a solid introduction to the confused psychological mess that is Faith for book series newcomers.As a novelization, it isn't bad. Laurence is able to give inner voice to the tormented Slayer, which is something the T.V. series of course could rarely do.Who's it for? Buffy and (especially) Faith fans, of course. Not a book for newbies to start out on, but one well worth getting for those who are behind on their Slayer watching, or to get to later for other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame goggles, dont buy!","review":"first of all, this goggle is designed for women, it says it right on the package, the product description failed to mention that. second, when i recieved the goggles, the whole goggle was rather very sticky. i think the glue just melted off during the shipping process. lastly, the goggles didnt really fit well...there was a huge gap between where the goggle was suppose to come in contact with your nose. but whatever, it deserves a 0/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"100% happy with the product","review":"5 starsI'm very happy with the goggles I got.

So much has changed in China and Tibet since publication of this book that I cannot recommend it.

I guess it was one of their very first films. It's in black and white and the sound quality is so poor that sometimes it's difficult to understand what the characters are saying. The Indian background music is often shrill and jarring, like fingernails on a blackboard. Also, the acting seemed pretty amateurish to me. The story is quite slow, too, and for me it dragged a bit.

As a former student of Gibbs, Wheeler is well-placed to provide a detailed biography of a man of whom he had first-hand experience. But this closeness must raise questions as to how objective this book is: at times the biography might be overly-eulogistic. This book was first published in 1951. What is needed now is a modern, more objective work. Amongst Gibbs's contemporaries, for example, Lords Raleigh and Kelvin were critical of Gibbs's thermodynamics.

I strongly believe there is a design flaw. My son is so disappointed every time he tries to use it and now just leaves it alone.

Built to survive nuclear war - this thing looks indestructible!I've read other reviews where people wrote it's too fast so it falls of a track.The one i got is a bit slow, hence 4 out of 5 stars, but overall so far it's very good"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute and he loved it.... BUT...","review":"My son received this train for Christmas and was ECSTATIC. We put in a battery and he was off! Like other people have said, this train DOES NOT stay on the tracks, but I expected that when I added it to his wishlist because I am a review-reader. I figured it would stay on a little better than it did-- every time it hits a curve it flies off-- so if you have a lot of straight lines in your track, this could still be lots of fun for you.Unfortunately, the train WE received died almost immediately. We changed the batteries, tried everything. It was, after 1 day of play, just... dead.It is on its way back now as a return. We have opted to get a different item instead of a replacement because I feel $30 is a lot to spend to have it die immediately and because the falling off the tracks made it hard to play with for my 2 year old.Again, it is a fun item if you have lots of straights in your track, but I have to lop off some stars for it full-out dying on us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design - Breaks Too Easily","review":"Purchased one and it broke the day we received it. The jet engine car in the rear is motorized and pushes Thomas and the other trains around the track - essentially turning you standard wooden into a motorized one. A single fall off of the train table and the plastic portion that holds the magnet to connect to other cars broke. Learning Curve customer service was quick to ship out a replacement unit. But again, the day we received it a similar thing happened and it broke in the exact same place. I think it comes down to poor design. The jet engine is already heavy because it is metal instead of plastic, and then you add in the battery. Would be a really nice addition to the set if not for the poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not correctly engineered. Weight distributions is off.","review":"The pusher pushes the engine off the railroad. Does not do turns the weight distribution is off at the connection magnet. My kids still enjoy it but I would recommend a puller engine instead of this one(with this flaw the kids have to be more interactive with it). Might cause frustration in younger children. Thought about re-engineering it to make it a puller."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it.","review":"Great item consisting of Thomas with a scared expression and a jet engine that pushes him. My son calls it \\"Brewster's rocket\\" because I got rid of Thomas and substituted Boosted Brewster. The engine is very nice and makes a jet engine sound, and has a red light at the tail. It pushes but does not pull. Sometimes if it is used alone the push carriage [first set of wheels in picture plus a yoke] will derail as it was really designed to push. I have noticed:1. The engine is plenty strong and goes up even to the summit of the Rumble and Roll set with ease.2. The engine lacks a 5 minute cutoff switch so the battery gets wasted easy. Rechargeables are a must.3. The engine does not move so fast as to derail around corners. But not all track layouts will prevent derailment.If you want a pulling engine consider the Brio Big Red. I own both and a rechargable Duracell set of four AAA [for brio] and four AA [for Thomas which uses 2 AA]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stay on the track","review":"I bought this for more 2 year old who just loves Thomas. He loves to turn the engine on and let it go on the floor. But as soon as you put it on the track it derails as soon as it hits a curve. He still has a great deal of fun with it but I think they need to tweek it a bit so it won't go off the track so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jet engine is too powerful","review":"My 4 yr old loves Thomas and has a ton of the various types of Thomas train sets. My husband bought the Thomas and the Jet Engine for him as a special treat. Unfortunately, the jet engine pushes too hard, so if you have any curves in your track, it pushes right off the track. This is very frustrating. Yes I realize Thomas is pushed very fast by the jet engine in the movie, but the toy shouldn't push him right off the track if there is more than a slight gradual curve. This was a total waste of money. Every once in a while my son will try it again and then puts the jet engine aside again because it won't stay on the track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"My two sons age 3 1/2 and almost 2 love their new Thomas railway system, but this battery powered engine is problematic for even the 3 1/2 year old to operate. It goes so fast that it pushes the engines off the track. (We have tried about 10 different engines with it.) It is also too tall to go under one of our bridges. It does not pull cars so we can't add cars behind it to try to slow it down either. Both boys have had much better luck (and more fun) with the battery-powered James engine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Another Battery Powered Train","review":"This is one of the most frustrating toys that my son has. It's just too powerful for most any layout and constantly falls off of the track. We love Battery Powered Percy, but this one is propelled by the rear jet engine which causes it to be unstable. Plus, the first model we bought was broken within the first 24 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We were so disappointed that the Jet Engine stopped working in less than a day. My husband stopped to pick this up for our almost 5 yo on the way home from work, by bedtime it wouldn't push."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating for my child","review":"My son recently turned 3, and while he often tries to play with this toy, it frustrates him because he can't get it to stay on the track. Neither can I. Falling off bad enough, but if you have any sort of attachments, like tunnels or special bridges or what have you, it can get stuck on them.Just let your child enjoy watching the rocket on the screen. Stay away from this toy. There are other motor-powered engines that do a better job of staying on the track, even if none of them do it particularly well. And I am using official Wooden Railway tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still running 6-7 years later!","review":"Bought this for my first child back in '03 or '04. Also was used by 2nd, then packed away for at least 2-3 years. Got pulled out because my third \\"surprise we're still fertile despite birth control\\" child recently turned two and is just getting into the whole \\"Thomas\\" thing. I dumped the \\"rocket engine\\" out of the box of forgotten Thomas stuff certain it would not work at all, pressed the button and the thing started pushing Thomas around the track just like it was 2003 or '04.Others have said theirs broke in days (or hours!) don't know if the older \\"build\\" is better or I just got lucky. But I was pretty surprised. Says a lot for the old Duracell batteries that were inside as well. Yes it does go fast on the track, but use old worn batteries and that slows it some. You'll also probably need to help it up hills, but then Thomas is supposed to be interactive. Also, not creating super tight turns will help decrease derailments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive but the kid loves it","review":"So, $30 for a two piece Thomas the Train toy is ridiculous. My son enjoys it though. Of course he is smart enough to realize that the jet engine on the toy and the jet engine in the movie are not alike. Bottom line is watching your kid open this toy and play with it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy, not toddler proof","review":"We purchased this for my son and after 2 hours of gentle play, the engine stopped working.

It arrived packaged with numerous missing parts and duplicates of other parts. For example there was only suppose to one #8 part but we had two of those and extra #7's as well but no #2 or #3 parts. We then placed a call to the company with a list of the missing parts and they agreed to FedEx them to us. That seemed fine and we were happy...until the FedEx arrived, STILL with wrong parts. It is now three weeks later and I still have no #1 shelf part to put this thing together. I am very frustrated with this company and ready to throw this thing away before we've even used it. Very disorganized company.

We have left it in our garage for several weeks, and then brought it back in to our daughter's room, only to find the smell still there. We have looked online for suggestions to get rid of the smell and we tried vinegar and putting a cut onion next to it (supposedly they absorb chemical smells), but to no avail. It still smells. It is back in the garage and I am so disappointed in this product. The style, size, and build of it is perfect for our needs, but I don't want my daughter or any of us in our home breathing in what might be toxic smells from this bookcase.

So after putting everything together correctly, it starts to fall apart from the bottom, once you've moved it.I was able to solve the problem by using some good old-fashioned nails in the back, but I would expect this unit to have some structural integrity. I think KidKraft is part of StorkCraft--the company that had to recall its baby cribs that were falling apart on top of infants.While I understanding the economic realities of outsourcing manufacturing to China, it sounds like these guys have outsourced their design there too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, sturdy, attractive","review":"Bought two of these for my daughter's room along with the matching toy chest and they look terrific.

For $120, you'd expect a solid wood piece. I purchased a much better, solid wood bookcase from Staples that is $79. The reason I wanted the KidKraft is because of the size and design (for my son's room).

When the toy is in the walker mode, the area between the 2 rear wheels is way too small and there are sharp parts (meant for the wagon mode) that can hurt baby's feet. Also, when in the walker mode, the shape sorter is not easily accessible. In my opinion, this toy is not worth the money. If you already have it and you think the toy moves way too fast for a child just beginning to walk, try using it on a carpeted surface- it slows it down a little. Your money would be better spent on another walker with a better design"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable","review":"This wagon was given to my daughter by her grandparents. It is so lightweight that we had to place two 8 pound weights on the bottom to keep it from flying ahead of her.

I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for babies just learning to walk","review":"I bought this walker for my baby when she was 10 months old and pulling herself up/doing the 'furniture scoot' to help her learn to balance and walk. While she loves playing with the toys, the walker is unstable and pulls right down on top of her when she tries to use it to pull herself up. The wheels move really fast and when she tries to walk with it (now 11.5 months old) it flies forward and she falls. We have to hold it carefully. Also, the red pieces on the inside of the rear wheels (where the white handle connect) are in the way of her feet, and have sharp plastic on the seam. This was a good idea and has fun toys on it, but the functionality of the walker wasn't well thought-out by the manufacturer. I'm buying Chicco now becuase I've heard better things about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not wide enough and sharp parts","review":"When the Walker-to-Wagon is set up as a walk-behind walker, the space between the rear wheels is too narrow and our child hits his feet and shins against the pieces where the handle snaps in to covert it to a wagon. These pieces have sharp edges (it's plastic, so it's not sharp enough to cut, but I'm sure it doesn't feel good to kick it). We will be returning this poorly designed toy.

Just gross little crawly things creeping around inside and outside of the box. I say beware because the bugs are tiny and you might think that they're not there when you open the package. My advice would be to let the internal box of bars sit outside your cupboard on a counter for a day and see if you notice any bugs before you co-mingle the box with your household food.

Can't see myself purchasing an entire box.I really think that if you're trying to eat healthfully... and want something that has real fruit and nuts in it... you're much much better off buying some dried or fresh cherries and nuts. If you love dates, buy some medjool ones. 1000x healthier...most likely cheaper... much tastier....and just as convenient.

The very welcome surprise for health-conscious snackers is the big zero, 0mg of sodium!Other nutritional positives, 6g of protein and 3g of fiber. There are traces of various nutrients (0% to 6% of various vitamins and minerals) so don't throw the basket of fresh fruit away :-)The trade-off, as usual, with healthy foods, is price vs \\"healthiness\\".

It doesn't have a great deal in the way of good flavor and it's over burdened with cashews and walnuts (neither of which I like). The labeling makes great hey out of the fact that it's not got gluten, doesn't use GMO's, has no cholesterol, no trans-fats, and that the blueberries used therein are raw. Because, you know, mankind was doing fine before we actually started cooking our foods.Beyond the hype of the product, there's not really anything worthwhile here, and lord help you if you have a nut allergy. This thing just didn't taste good and I can't say as though I have any interest in ever eating any more.

For the most part, I'm not a huge fan of \\"nutty\\" bars, but this is an exception. While not packed with blueberries, the taste does come through, with just enough sweetness and a nice texture compared to many other bars that can be either too chewy or cakey. The organic ingredients are nice and this is certainly a good sweet-tooth alternative to candy bars and many of the other \\"energy\\" bars on the market that are packed with sugars.

Nothing is worse than a 'health food' that tries to taste like it's something decadent--so you get thin tasting carob instead of chocolate, etc.Not this bar. It doesn't pretend to be gooey rich and bad for you food. It is unrepentantly its own thing. And in this case, its own thing is pretty darned good. If you've ever made a homemade granola bar, that's what this tastes like, only somehow less sticky and messy!It's delicious, what more can I say? It doesn't pretend to be what it's not. It's a quite nice serving size, as well--perfect for a good pick me up snack! It's sweet but not too sweet and would go well with water or a coffee beverage as a nice snack.

It's very similar to Clif Nectar bars in taste and consistency. I did like that it's all raw and has all organic ingredients. I also thought that the sweetness-level was perfect. Not too sweet and not too bland. If you like nut-heavy raw food bars, I think you'll really like this.

I guess if I was starving I might be able to eat the whole bar, but I was able to eat less than half of it and kept trying to give the rest to my son.I think the product page needs to be updated to reflect what other food items are processed in the facility, I misplaced the package, but if I remember correctly they included: milk, soy, peanuts, and fish.

Not only did it had the texture and taste of a bad fruitcake, but it was less nutritious than a comparative bar like something from Luna or Cliff. It also containing a whopping 14% of your daily fat intake. The only real value of the bar is in terms of copper and dietary fiber, both of which you can get in many other things and with far less fat. Perhaps a Fiber One bar which has less calories than this and 45% of your fiber instead of 16%All in all, I love that Pure bars are mostly organic, but they have no flavour or any actual health benefits.

It has a rich fruity taste where you can taste the Cashews and Cherry and it was very satisfying compared to some of the bland products I have tried over the years.I will be keen to try some more of these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy & A Good Taste","review":"I was excited to try this product as I am always looking for something healthy to snack on. This bar definitely has the ingredients of health, blueberry, raw fruit, nuts, it's there that is for sure, and I feel in just the right amounts.These bars are full of flavor, fresh, and knowing that they are good for you only makes it that much more enjoyable. They are great to carry around with you, eat in the car, on a trip or keep by your computer for a quick snack. I liked this bar and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cashews and Cherries are a Good Balance","review":"I wasn't sure I would like this bar because I'm not a huge fan of dried cherries. The cashews did a nice job balancing out the super sweetness of the dried cherries. While I could still taste the cherries they weren't overwhelming to the rest of the bar which I really liked. This isn't my favorite flavor of this brand but I still enjoyed it and would eat it again. I like the fact that Pure Bars have around 7 grams of protein in each bar. It makes me feel like it's a good option before working out when I'm too busy to stop and eat a meal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of blah","review":"This bar didn't taste terrible, but it didn't taste good, either. Just kind of blah. I split it with a friend, and all she could taste was sweetness with some cherry flavor, and all I could taste was a faint cashew flavor. If you're looking for a benign organic option, high in calories (190 for a small bar), give this a try. If you're looking for something higher in protein and more flavorful, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flavor, good for you","review":"Same review as for the cherry bars - Typically, I only like to eat whole foods and until now, Lara Bars were it for me. Until now. These are amazing - really delicious and good for you, with whole food ingredients you can recognize, and they're made in Michigan! Fruits and nuts and honey - it doesn't get better than that. My kids loved them, too, which makes me happy because they're sweet enough to satisfy an urge for a candybar but so much better for you.The blueberry taste was real because the blueberries are real! The only icky thing in this bar was canola oil, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I received this bar not expecting much, and I was quite pleasantly surprised. So many bars of this nature (gluten-free, protein-powder-added type bars) has a distinctly \\"vitamin-y\\" smell and flavor. These do not. The cherry could certainly be more pronounced, but then I think that about every single fruit-containing bar I have ever eaten. So that may just be my sweet tooth acting up.Pretty good nutritionally speaking...super low sodium, good healthy nut fats, fruit, etc. Good amount of dietary fiber. Slightly high in sugar, but not terribly so.The other thing I liked was the texture. Chewy and moist, not gritty and chalky like you may expect. It would be great as solid food for a long bicycle ride.The only thing that puts me off at all is the expense. A little higher than I'm comfortable paying on a regular basis, but that's all about how much value you place on the product and how much extra cash you happen to have, so YMMV."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice but not so tasty","review":"The ingredients are impressive and all...but the bottom line is... they taste badly.. Too bad!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit sweet, but satisfying","review":"This isn't bad for a gluten-free berry bar. A bit on the sweet side, but crunchy and satisfying. Good fruit taste. I find that most fruit bars are pretty addictive and don't serve to quell your appetite- this one does a better job than most due to the raw nuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice taste","review":"However, it is a little dry. I like the blueberry pieces in this bar, they added needed moisture to the nut meats that tend to dry out a bar. Overall, a pleasant and Organic treat for those times when \\"the nibbles\\" overcomes self control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes good","review":"I'm not a cashew fan so I braced myself to be objective regardless of my personal likes and dislikes (it's a cherry cashew bar after all). To my surprise I found the taste of cashew was very faint as walnuts and almonds were the more prominent nutty flavors. That can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on how much cashew you wanted in your bar. What does explode is an incredible amount of sweet cherry flavor along with the fibrous texture common in health bars. It has enough sugar (via agave syrup and already sweet Oregon cherries) to equal a couple of chocolate chip cookies, frankly, but if you'd rather get your sweets from nature it's a tasty choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tasting and Goof for You","review":"This is a pretty good bar. It has a real nice fruitiness to it. The cherry flavor is sweet-tart but not overly tart like a kids candy. For me, the cashews is what really wins me over. A 1.7 oz. bar provides 190 calories (8g fat, 25g carbs, 7g protein). Not bad. Compare to Odwalla bars that come in at 2 oz. and 200+ calories. Personally, I would like the bar to be a little bigger but, I often eat these bars either as a meal or while I am walking a round of golf so I want as many calories as I can get. The package is almost twice as long as the bar (marketing trick).Considering this bar is free of preservatives, trans fats, cholesterol, refined sugar, gluten, soy, and dairy it is pretty good. If you have an allergy to any of those things this is a good snack food choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chewy,Sweet, Tart","review":"Even though the main ingredient in this bar is dates, the tartness and strong flavor of the cherries add an extra layer of flavor to this bar, making it a better tasting bar than the Wild Blueberry Bar by the same brand. I like the crunchy cashews and the fruity paste, but think the flavor is somewhat unidimensional and could be improved with a touch of flavoring (vanilla) and balanced with a bit of savory. The lack of interesting flavors left me wanting for something else to appease my sweet tooth. Perhaps it is not fair of me to judge this bar since I like complex flavors and interesting textures in my food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda like eating a 20 year old fig newton","review":"I had high hopes for this treat. It sure sounded yummy based on the description. HOWEVER, it was like the insides of a fig newton, but only after being left out on the counter for a couple of years. It had an unpalatable appearance, didn't smell very good,and didn't really taste much of cherry or cashew. It's fairly high in fat. I'm not very adept at describing flavors, but truly this had a kind of vague fruity taste that was at best non-descript. I had originally split my bar with my wife, but she took one small bite and set it aside. \\"Maybe you'll like it,\\" she said tentatively. I did not.I will never try another product from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Organic Natural Meh","review":"Pure hypes this as \\"Organic, Vegan, 4 grams of fiber...\\" and so on for a long paragraph. I don't really care. It looks like a candy bar or a snack bar and that's how I'll review it.It's not disgusting. I can taste the cherry. It doesn't have a noticeable aftertaste. And that's about it on the positive side.The negative side isn't large. The texture isn't pleasant. Although I could see the cashew chunks I didn't notice any cashew flavor - and I like cashew so that was a disappointment.It's nice to have the Omega 3s, vitamins and what not but I take supplements for those anyway and those aren't mildly annoying to eat.Summing up, I have little use for this but it wasn't bad enough to warrant a 1 star review. However, if you're heavily into the \\"organic\\" stuff this is worth looking at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Ingredients","review":"Good quality ingredients--a very healthy product. Just not crazy about the texture--a bit sticky. That said, not crazy about any food bars--I would rather have a handful of gorp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty Date Bar, hint of Cherry only","review":"This is a date bar, sure a date is fruit, but a very sweet and not very nutritious one. I still don't understand why dried apricots are not used more in fruit bars. Regardless, this date bar does have the taste of cashews and a satisfying crunch and goo too. The Cherry taste is pretty much non-existent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty but I liked the blueberry bar better","review":"This cherry and cashew bar is a small dense bar with the chunks of cashews clearly visible. However, unlike the blueberry bar which smelled like blueberries when you opened it, there's really no aroma noticeable from this bar. It's sweet, but not too sweet, with a slight crunch from the cashews and walnuts but little taste of cherries (though they are the third ingredient after dates and cashews). It's more of a chewy bar (versus crunchy) that (along with something to drink) makes a tasty mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack. All the ingredients are listed as organic and you won't find any mysterious chemicals, strange ingredients, or added sugar.However, of the two bars (blueberry versus cherry), I liked the blueberry bar more - I liked the smell of blueberries and it seemed tastier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Said Princess Peony, blecch","review":"I don't know if it was the weird, acrid aftertaste of something the resembled blueberries the way blue Gatorade resembles blueberries, or the dry, choking mealiness of a bar that nevertheless left my fingers sticky, but I'm just not at all a fan of this bar. If there were nuts in it, I never noticed, although that may explain the thin wafers I had to prod out of my gums afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Bar if you Have no Tastebuds","review":"Okay, taste is relative, but really this one takes the ... well if you don't have anything nice to say. From a nutrition standpoint, they are very healthy, but just be prepared, perhaps you'll want to buy one from a local store before you invest in a whole case!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Send this product back to the design team","review":"This product should be sent back to the design team. Why?- Organic but tasteless- It should focus on one main ingredient, instead of mixing all kind of things- The nuts are too mushy, not crispy anymoreThe only positive thing is that it is not infused with sugar. The fruit juice sweetens it.Fix this product and let me review again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Natural and Very Tasty","review":"I was very satisfied with this snack bar. Unlike some of its competitors, all of its ingredients are organic and natural. There are a lot competing bars that only have some organic ingredients.As for the taste, I thought the bar was very good. It is a little on the small side, so some people might find that one isn't filling.Overall I'm happy with this product and would seek it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, rich taste.","review":"I've tried a number of this sort of thing and Pure ranks amongst the top. There is a rich blueberry taste totally unlike all the synthetic flavoring we find in heavily processed foods these days. It's basically just fruit and nuts, but the nuts aren't chunky or crunchy. The texture is soft and slightly moist, kind of like a dense cake. Above all, it tastes really great without a lot of added sugar. The natural flavor of the blueberries really comes through.If you're looking for a great tasting, healthy snack, I would recommend trying Pure. I haven't tried the other flavors yet, but I'm sure they're equally good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Processed Sugar Girl","review":"Maybe I was raised on too many processed sugars and prepackaged food but it seems the more \\"natural\\" things get, the more they tend to taste like cardboard. Needless to say, I was not a big fan of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great snack with almost NO SODIUM!","review":"Like many middle aged people I've recently begun to restrict my sodium. These Pure Bars give me a snack I can throw in my bag that has almost no sodium. It makes a nice treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious and Nutritious","review":"I love this bar. I regularly work long days so I always need a filling afternoon snack. Pure bars are fast becoming my favorite go-to bar and this is my absolute favorite flavor. Tastes like a blueberry muffin and highly recommended. They are actually good enough that I would happily substitute one for dessert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy, great tasting snack bar","review":"If you don't call this a snack bar, I wouldn't know what else you'd call it but they sure taste great. I eat several different kinds and brands - though mostly the fruit varieties - and they all lack something, yet these have a wonderful combination of ingredients. The cranberry orange combination is just right in terms of tartness, not too sweet, a little crunchy, not too dense, you really feel like you are eating something filling and healthy. They are pretty popular I think because Amazon tends to run out of them quite frequently. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOYLENT GREEN IS PEOPLE!","review":"Well now, here we have yet another healthy bar to snack on, but unfortunately this bar has very little taste and what taste it does have is nothing I would want to eat. I'm all for healthy eating, but we live only once and I prefer to eat something that taste good. It has the consistency of a fruit roll up without being very sweet. The bar has an slightly sour taste and the nuts are soft(yuck!). There are numerous better tasting bars on the market that are healthy so as a food source this would only be eaten if all other food disappeared off the planet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"delicious snack with organic ingredients","review":"The description on the side of the bar says \\"Nothing cooked. Nothing processed. Completely PURE.\\" What it doesn't say is that besides being completely pure, made from all USDA-certified, CF-certified organic ingredients, this bar is completely DELICIOUS.This bar contains blueberries and nuts (cashews and almonds) and dates. All the ingredients can be tasted and savored when one eats even the smallest bite of the bar. This is a great snack choice.To my palate, this tasted a lot better than Cliff's Mojo bars or Luna's Mojo bars. Ingredient-wise, the Pure bar is a lot healthier and tastes better than any energy or chocolate bar. For someone who has a sweet tooth, this type of bar is a welcome alternative to the high calorie count of a chocolate bar, and the ingredients are a lot better for the whole body.If one was to note any disappointments with this bar is that at 1.7 ounces it is a lot smaller than its wrapping would suggest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"These bars were rather flavorful for being a healthy product. I would recommend these bars to anyone trying to eat healthier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Tasty!","review":"Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Bars are very tasty. They are surprisingly moist with a hint of blueberry and lots of nuts. They actually reminded me of my grandma's banana bread with blueberries instead of bananas. Definitely worth a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think You Could Eat Something Better","review":"I liked the fact that this bar was all organic, but hey does that mean that because it's organic, it gets a pass on taste? I don't think so. It was just okay. You can find better tasty and organic alternatives in my opinion that are not as pricey. I was not sure what to make of the texture which like one reviewer said, is not crunchy and is something like a fig newton bar. The bar itself is pretty small and for the calories, I think you can eat something else that would probably be less calories and more filling. I just was not impressed at all by this bar. Not sure if I would purchase if given the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Tasty","review":"I was a bit disappointed in the taste of this bar. The nut flavor was good and nice and crunchy, but it didn't taste anything like blueberries. It was kind of a gooey (or gluey), chewy bar with a taste that is hard to describe. Not a bad taste, but I doubt it's anything kids would like that much. I assume there is no added sugar, which is a real plus. I suppose it is good to be eating something natural, but why not just eat the nuts and blueberries separately instead of crushed and compacted into a bar? Convenience would be the only reason I can think of and these would have a longer shelf life than fresh blueberries. Great for campers or hikers who don't want a high sugar snack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Healthy-ish. And gummy...","review":"I guess this bar is healthy...it has good ingredients. Not enough of any of the ingredients to get a good dose of what makes those ingredients healthy, however. For your nearly 200 calories you get almost no vitamins or minerals to speak of. There are nice chunks of nuts, but since they aren't toasted first they don't have that flavorful crunchiness. (And yes, I get that toasting would make this a NON-raw food, as if being raw is necessarily worthwhile, anyway.) The bar is just bland with some vague blueberry taste. Just brownish-purple gumminess with little pieces of dried blueberry and big pieces of raw nuts. It may have 6 grams of protein, but 190 calories aren't going to sustain you for long, regardless. My teenage son (who eats anything)took one bite and handed it right back. Frankly, if I'm going to throw away 200 calories on what basically amounts to an empty calorie snack, I'll find something more appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too chewey, not enough flavor","review":"These bars are a bit small for the price and I found them to be way too chewey for my pleasure. I shared this bar with my boyfriend - both of us eat different types of food bars during the day - and neither of us would buy this again. The flavor was lacking and the texture was too dense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy, Nutty-flavored Fruit Bar","review":"This is my first time trying PURE fruit and nut bar. I don't know what I was expecting, maybe the taste of a regular trail mix bar. It's hard to describe what the PURE bar (strawberry flavor) tastes like, but it's not an unpleasant flavor. The fruity flavor is obvious, but the cashews are a little overwhelming. It's more like a cashew bar than a fruit bar.I like that the bar is soft and chewy, and not too sweet. Also, it's made out of all natural and organic ingredients, with nothing processed. That to me is worth having a bar that doesn't have the conventional taste of other energy bars. The taste is not bad, but it's not delicious either. However, the bar is filling and doesn't make you feel guilty about eating it, because the ingredients are so healthy. I would recommend these bars as snacks, but they do have plenty of calories, so I wouldn't eat too many of them at once. But that's true of any kind of snack."},{"rating":"1","title":"great before change","review":"These bars used to be very tasty and fresh. However, they were recently changed for the worse. I believe I read somewhere the company was sold to a larger company which may be the reason. Anyway, they no longer taste fresh. They are much more cardboard like. Previously they were dense, moist and fruity. Now they are dry and pretty much tasteless.

Not worth buying, you should buy regular brownies"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most and delicious","review":"This is one of the tastiest granola bars I've ever had.

I broke my elimination diet with this guy and am glad to report that I'm not having any reactions, and MAN OH MAN! did it taste amazing. the texture, the flavor, and the nuts. You couldn't convince me that this was a raw food bar when I ate it. Awes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thick and not very tasty","review":"Our family often eats granola bars, especially ones that are high in fiber. I was happy to give this little bar a try. While cherry is not my favorite flavor, I kept an open mind when trying this bar. I do really love cashews, so I thought the combination might be interesting and tasty. My husband an I both had a bite, and we both agreed it was too thick. It was not an enjoyable texture or flavor (even for my husband, who is a cherry fan). The cashew flavor was very subtle. If you are a huge fan of cherry flavored bars, you may want to give this one a try. Unfortunately, for our family, we will not be trying it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant","review":"I was looking forward to the taste of cherries. What I got was a dark, dense, unpleasantly non-cherry chunk that was slightly sour-tasting. It is something I might keep in my car on the offchance that I get caught in a blizzard and find myself stranded in a snowbank for three days. This bar would keep me alive ... and keep me opening the car door to swallow lots of snow in order to get the taste out of my mouth. Disappointing and not something I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty, handy and satisfying: a good snack on the go","review":"I'm quite fond of cherries and cashews, and combining them worked out just fine! These are nice to keep around when I'm traveling or even just running errands, as an alternative to various fast foods and snack foods out there. They're really just raw fruit (dried, of course) mixed with nuts and packaged for easy storage and use. Very tasty and very easy! Oh, and I never even noticed that they were low in sodium; there was too much flavor for me to care about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes good...but not really like cherry","review":"This bar has the consistency of a dense cake and I thought it tasted really good but not so much like cherries. More sweet and slightly tangy. I didn't think it tasted like dates as some reviewers have claimed. I, personally, hate the taste of dates so if I had tasted that I would not have given it a good review. It has a good quanity of nuts in the bar so it does have crunch, whereas some bars I have tasted claim to have nuts they chop them up so fine I can't even tell they are there this bar leaves them in good-sized bites. Overall, this was a tasty, healthy snack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sort of like a fig newton but with blueberries","review":"I don't like artificial candy flavors and this bar tastes much better in comparison. It's been a long time since I ate a fig newton, but this tastes similar to me, only with blueberries instead of figs. However, I like to limit my calorie intake and at 190 calories, this bar is not a quick snack, it's a substantial part of my lunch or an entire breakfast. Frankly, I prefer raw fresh blueberries. They're lower calorie and they taste, well, fresher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste, sensible ingredients. I will try these again.","review":"I love this bar. The taste is great not excessively sweet that leaves a sickening after taste. The product is moist and chewy with healthy ingredients. The Blueberry flavor is quite \\"real\\" and not the artificial kind so prevalent in other products. I love this bar and will get it again - depending upon the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not worth seeking out or buying.","review":"The consistency of this bar is fairly typical, with a gummy texture whose dominant flavor resembles a slightly softened cherry \\"fruit chew.\\" The cashew flavor is subtle and, in my opinion, not significant enough to be worth buying the product if that's your main interest. I've enjoyed many other bars much more: I'd eat it if it was the only thing handy on a long hike, but I would not intentionally buy it given the panoply of choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Organic Cherry Cashew & Nut Bar","review":"Well, I was excited about trying this product especially since I like cherries and cashews. When it arrived, I opened it up and took a bit (it arrived about mid-afternoon). I caught a little cherry flavor then cashew at first but it disappeared quickly and the next bit didn't help either. Sorry, but this is not very appetizing to my palette. I choose my caloric intake carefully and this just doesn't come up to a positive for me. Maybe another combination might do it!I would suggest a little more cherry flavor and that possibly through adding additional sweetner to the mix. The crunch, the cashews are just fine but the lack of continuing flavor not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"High on health, low on flavor","review":"Okay, if you are a health nut or vegan, or into organics, this is for you. It's certified organic, gluten free, rich in Omega 3's, raw, and Vegan.

Unless you like to eat cardboard, which I don't. Plus, it's about the size of my pinky, so you're not getting much.If I'm going to waste 200 calories on some kind of health bar, I'm going to make sure it tastes good.

I was hoping that it would have been more like the KIND Fruit plus Nut Bar, which has a very satisfying taste and texture, but instead it was more like a chewy gooey unidentifiable powerbar with some nuts and fruit added. If you like the normal powerbar goo (which I do not), then this could be a good fit for you as the addition of the fruit and nuts could make it more interesting. It definitely felt like it would fill you up for the 190 calories, but I like to enjoy the food I it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE ORGANIC WILD BLUEBERRY RAW FRUIT & NUT BAR-ALL NATURAL","review":"Four HEALTHY Stars!

The bar tastes good, with a distinct blueberry flavor. The mouth feel reminded me of an Odwalla Banana Nut Bar, with a pleasant crunchiness from the nuts contrasting with the softness of the bar as a whole. Given the price and the calories (190 per bar) I would not buy this product very often, but I'm sure there will be those health nuts that will 'eat this up', so to speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, moist and chewy fruit bar","review":"At 190 cals this is no lightweight bar. Heavy and filling, it is not at all candy-like, granola-like, or even particularly similar to a cereal bar with fruit filling.

The dominant flavor of this bar is of walnuts. They're the third ingredient on the label after dates and cashews, but tastewise they take over. I only get the slightest taste of blueberry so I am quite disappointed. At 190 calories for the bar, they are about average for similar snacks and the ingredients list is all organic and raw. I wish I liked the flavor better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok","review":"I am not big on energy bars or health bars. This does not taste that great. It is a good health choice but I like the fig nut-tons better. I overall think if you like organic or want a healthy snack this is fine. Since its all natural kids might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Snack","review":"Ingredients:Organic Dates, Cashews, Organic Cherries, Organic Rice Protein, Organic Walnuts, Organic Agave Nectar, Organic Almonds---and that's it!Considering the price of organics to make a quality product, I think the price is a deal! The taste of cherries is not strong and overpowering, date is the prevailing flavor, the combination of ingredients is, in my opinion, a great mix for a good flavor without being too sweet. For those who watch gluten, you will be happy to know this has none! Also it has no--refined sugar, cholesterol, trans fat, preservatives, color or dairy. I thinks it just nice to be able to have a decent tasting snack and feel good about it! Hope you enjoy yours as much as I.

They generally taste very fake to me and have unpleasant textures that don't seem to resemble those of any real foods I can think of. I really loved the Pure Bar I received, however. It tasted very genuinely of fruit (dates and blueberries), and there were big enough nut pieces (cashews and walnuts) that I could tell I was eating them. Although the bar contained \\"rice protein concentrate,\\" whatever that might be, it didn't have any chemical flavors, and the texture was quite date-like (as if dates were pressed into a bar - a little firmer than the center of a fig cookie). I don't know what the bar's price will be, but I definitely will be happy to buy it if it's available at a reasonable cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as tasty as I would've thought","review":"Well Cherry and Cashew hmmm sounds good right? Well mostly it's not either of these and has a high calorie, carb, and sugar content. I could live with that if it tasted better, sadly it just does not. For that high a calorie content, sugar content and carb content, I could have a nice dark organic chocolate bar with no added sugar that would be much healthier. It was not the worst thing I ever ate but not all that good either. I would not recommend it, or buy it if I was looking for something of this nature. It sure looked good, unfortunately in the taste department it fails, and as far as healthy its not all that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome health choice.","review":"At last, someone has put on the market a health food bar that meets all the qualifications of being organic, gluten-free, dairy free, and MSG free. As someone who struggles daily to eat healthy, I have often found it difficult to eat something quickly that is both gluten-free and organic. Especially on the days when I'm rushing to work and haven't any time to prepare a meal. This bar is the answer to my dilemna. While most breakfast/snack bars are heavy on the nut or oats side and sparing on the fruit side, this bar is very heavy on the fruit side. However, I was relieved to find that it isn't overly sweet. In fact, I found this cherry flavor to be just right in maintaining the balance of not being too tart and not too sweet. In sum, I'm relieved to find that this truly healthy snack bar is out there and I very much recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tasting Healthy Energy Bar","review":"I like organic and raw energy bars. In the past there were very little choices as only a few small manufacturer were producing them. Lately there has been a proliferation of organic and raw products on the market.Some of the negatives that I have experienced from some raw fruit and nut bars BUT NOT THIS ONE were:-Bad taste not very appealing-Poor texture not easy to chew-Gas forming by improper mix of ingredients-Not sweet enough or too sweetThis PURE bar was just right. The blueberry flavor was distinct and the nuts were sized right and tasted good mixed in with the fruits. There was not a bad aftertaste and the bar supplied me with extra energy for several hours. The ingredients were organic and raw. The shelf life was 1 year which seems a little long for not having any preservatives. I would refrigerate them to make them last longer even though that is not required.All in all this is a good product in my opinion. I am now curious as to how their other bars taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Raw, Meal Replacement Bar","review":"Pure Organic Wild Blueberry Bars are a good, raw, meal replacement bar (at about 190 calories per bar). Like many raw bars, these bars are made from dried fruit and nuts, but unlike some other bars, this bar tasted mainly like the advertised fruit--blueberries--and not like nuts or other dried fruits. The nut pieces are relatively small--so they provide protein not taste. This bar was also sweeter than many other raw bars I've had (thanks to the inclusion of agave) so if you want something a bit sweet, this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good","review":"I was surprised how good this tasted. It taste similar, though not exactly like it was fruit leather. It had just the right balance of nuts without seeming too much. Obviously taste will very, so you are probably best to try one before buying 12.Typically, Organic = Expensive. But for $20 you get 12, which i think is pretty reasonable priced for these. If you are into fitness or eating healthy, this may be something you really enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definite chemical taste to them","review":"I purchased a case of the chocolate and a case of the cherry. The cherry bars are WONDERFUL and I highly recommend them. The chocolate bars are horrid. There is a chemical smell and chemical taste coming from these bars which is troubling because they are supposed to be organic. Not sure if they are past the expiration date (just received them a few days ago) but its not something I can risk giving to my kids. Amazon will not let you return any food products (even if they are rotten) so take this in mind before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird smell, ok flavor.","review":"I tried several of these bars, but I had to hold my breath to take a bite -- they smell terrible! Like vinegar or something. Most unpleasant. The taste isn't bad, but it ain't a chocolate brownie, I don't care what any of the other reviews say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Healthy and tastes like it","review":"The bar is healthy judging from the ingredients. I was looking forward to getting it because I love cherries and cashews. And, I'm always looking for a good health bar. But, I was disappointed when I tried it. In fact, no one in my family (two daughters and wife) really enjoyed it. It's rather dry and not very appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick!","review":"This bar is not tasty at all.

He didn't like them at all. I ended up giving them to the snack pantry at school because no one at our house would eat them."},{"rating":"1","title":"For cherries & nuts, I prefer a handful of mixed dried fruits & nuts","review":"Considering the ingredients, I'd rather snack on a mix of high quality dried cherries and nuts than on a bar that is mostly dates (note: dates are listed 1st in the ingredient list, with cherries 3rd). Dates are a fine fruit, but for a bar named Cherry Cashew, I expect, well, cherries & cashews!Though the flavor was OK, the crunch of nuts was totally lost in the heavy, chewy mixture that was the basis for the bar.The pre-packaged bars are definitely convenient (grab and go). Still, for my money, I'd prefer buying dried fruit & fresh nuts in bulk, mixing up a batch to my taste, then storing in small reusable containers to throw in the lunch bag or purse during the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I can taste is rancid nuts","review":"No refined sugar, no gluten, dairy or soy, no cholesterol, trans fats, preservatives or anything artificial, sounded great to me but....I tried this PURE organic cherry cashew bar from Amazon and all I can taste is the overwhelming rancid nuts. I have to rate this item based on my experience, so sadly I can only give it one star. Not much else I can say based on what I tried other then all the ingredients listed are good simple and organic. Problem with all these natural foods which contain nuts especially raw nuts is that they are extremely volatile and have 0 shelf life because there are no preservatives. Too bad something with the best of intentions can't make it to the public to enjoy before going bad. These bars sound really good and probably are if you are lucky enough to get one that hasn't spoiled, I haven't been that lucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very tasty","review":"To be honest , I wasn't expecting much.

I ate one bar and realized there was an ingredient that caused me to break out. I emailed and eventually called customer service and over the course of a month was asked to jump through hoops sending my amazon invoice and then resending it... I followed like a blind puppy and finally realized it was all a show. I'd have to rank the customer disservice with my very worst experiences. I think customer service is the face of a company and how they deal with their customers speaks volumes about their mission. Pure Bar is pure bunk....but amazon on the other end of the spectrum is AMAZING"},{"rating":"1","title":"So its pure organic........","review":"The texture reminded me of the center of a Fig Newton cookie but slightly moister. I would use these on a camping trip or hiking event but would not use on a daily basis. The flavor was bland and I did not care for the texture which I found to be pastey. Tended to stick to the roof of my mouth and was a little hard to swallow. Did not get a distinct blueberry flavor. The most flavorful was when a bite would contain a nut. The actual appearance of the bar is not appealing in the least. I almost threw half of it away but then went ahead and forced the rest down. Organic healthy snacks can be healthy and taste good but not this bar. I kept thinking of wet soggy flavored cardboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent flavor, soft and moist...","review":"Excellent flavor, soft and moist.

It's not very sweet but tastes very fruity. It is soft and chewy. The wrapping was easy to open and did a good job at keeping the fruit bar fresh. I wish the fruit bar was bigger. I tried both the blueberry and the Cherry flavor and liked them both about equally well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really healthy, but super tasty!","review":"These are perfect for a snack when you want something small, sweet and satisfying.

Awesome healthy snack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rancid Nuts","review":"Upon first bite I thought I was eating a Fig Newton. I looked for the blueberries but could not taste any. What I did taste were rancid nuts. Maybe the fact this contains no preservatives (a good thing) and maybe because the bar is very moist had something to do with the nuts going bad quickly. If you want blueberry taste you'll be disappointed. If you like Fig Newtons you'll like this bar. If you know what rancid nuts taste like, you will not enjoy this bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of rancid nuts","review":"Looks like I was not the only one who got a bar with rancid nuts.

Not sure if I would give this another chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Taste Blueberry","review":"I was only given one bar to review, so I don't know how much of a difference there is from one bar to the next, but I did not taste the blueberries.

The only tricks up this bar's sleeve is that the main ingredient is dates (and it mainly tastes like a date bar) and the nuts are ground so fine they seem to add no texture, or taste, or crunch (all of which would improve the bar). If your primary goal is a filling and healthy snack that doesn't taste bad, it will do the trick if you like dates. For me, I'd like more flavor and texture as well. In this line of bars, I prefer the Pure cherry/cashew bar which also has a strong dates flavor but the cherries stand out more and the cashews are ground large enough to add a bit of texture and crunch to the bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not likely to purchase","review":"Nutrition Information:Calories 190fat Cal 70total Fat 8gcholest 0mgfiber 3gsugars 17gprotein 7gThe packaging is enticing, I'd at least pick it up in the grocery store to look at since it's organic.

These were great! One bar held me from lunch until dinner (6PM) with no problem. It tasted good - like blueberries and good granola. If they meet your nutritional requirements, then these are excellent, because they're delicious. Obviously, unless you are engaged in strenuous physical activity, you'll want to avoid eating too many because they are hi-carb and hi-cal. But, they are excellent for occassional meal replacement and would be awesome for breakfast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste which makes you reach for another bar, which is bad!","review":"This is a great-tasting bar. Tangy cherry + nuts really reminds me of a fruit cake. I has 190 calories and nutritional content similar to Zone bars. However, I felt a bit more full while chewing on a Zone Bar. Oddly enough I think its because Zone bars require more chewing and Pure Bars are very soft and delicate and you can finish them rather quickly. Obviously the more chewing you do, the longer it takes you to finish the bar and by the time you ate one, your brain already told your stomach that it has something inside. Therefore, I find Pure Bars to be more addicting and would eat them more as a snack(candy bar alternative,) rather than a meal replacement bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent, but I doubt I will eat it again","review":"For 190 calories, this was a tasty little breakfast bar.

Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing cooked, nothing processed, nothing could taste worse...","review":"I'm sorry, I'm usually down with the organic food stuff, but these bars just don't taste very good. They're reasonably healthy (though each small bar still has nearly 200 calories), but they're bland, dense and vaguely sour (when I described the bar that way to a friend, she said, \\"Well, you are what you eat.\\").So I'm not a fan. You might like it, but I sure don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasteless to me","review":"This bar contains only good (not processed) ingredients with dates and cashews first and second in the ingredients list.

You can definitely taste the blueberry, and the flavor is very pleasant. It also has slices of nuts in it, which I really liked. I also love that it's organic. The only reason I'm rating this at 4 stars and not 5 is because the calorie count is quite high at 190 calories for a bar like this and of this size. It has a decent amount of protein and fiber, but I probably wouldn't buy it as a snack because it's too high-calorie. Otherwise, it's a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Variety switch-a-roo","review":"I ordered the variety pack with the description:3 Bars Each of Chocolate Brownie, Wild Blueberry, Cherry Cashew and Apple CinnamonThe package arrived with same box as pictured, but the contents were different.

The banana coconut was actually a pleasent surprise. I probably wouldn't have tried it if it wasn't in this variety pack. Now I'll probably order a box of just banana coconut. It makes a great breakfast bar on the go.The other three varieties in the pack are also good. Overall, I'm satisfied with the quality and flavor of the pure bars.

Memories of a taste long buried and almost forgotten. That is until now. My beloved aunt's family tested and terrible tasting homemade fruitcake.This moist and overpowering concoction of organic dates, cherries, walnuts, agave nectar, almonds, cashews, and brown rice protein is overpoweringly sweet to me. Low sodium and certified Kosher, one Cherry Cashew bar packs 200 calories, 26 grams of carbohydrates, 9 grams of fat, 4 grams of fiber and 14 grams of sugar. Not necessarily diabetic friendly.Normally I am a big fan of energy bars. Its rare that I come across one that I cannot finish. The 1.7oz Pure Bar Cherry Cashew edition similarities to fruitcake cannot be dismissed. Nor can its lingering aftertaste.

From the product description, \\"We specifically choose apple juice-infused (not sugar-infused) wild blueberries to avoid refined sugars\\", which is a shame because blueberries are naturally sweet. The texture is similar to a Fig Newton, slightly chunkier, but still not appetizing for me.For the nitpickers out there, they also claim the product is gluten, soy and dairy free, but then state it is produced in a facility that processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, fish and tree nuts. Oh well, I suppose in our \\"economies of scale\\" world maybe it's impossible to produce items without having them contaminated by unrelated ingredients and the hyper-sensitive part of our society dictates these have to be called out.

It sounds good in theory-no cholesterol, no trans fats, no artificial ingredients, no refined sugar, it's rich in Omega-3s, it's got fiber, it's got calcium and it's a full serving of fruit. On my first taste, I chewed it a couple times before spitting it out. My second bite went down but I just couldn't get into the flavor. The calorie count is rather high for a small bar and I think I could find something more satisfying, more tasty, and just as healthy to eat for about the same amount of calories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry","review":"Usually products like this tend to be bland with a mixture of ingredients that are blended to a pulp. The Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry bar was a surprise. It had a pleasant blueberry taste and the walnuts were not minced into sawdust, but were clearly scattered through the bar in good size pieces.

Not a promising sign. The bar itself looked very unappealing, like something that had been made with an industrial extruder into which someone threw blueberries, oats and other healthy-type food. At least it smelled edible. The bar is definitely blueberry flavor, but with a twist. Imagine if you had a piece of blueberry pie while you were out at a nice hillside picnic. Now imagine that you dropped your pie piece and it rolled down the hill and into a nearby forest, all the while collecting dirt, leaves, twigs and other detritus. Now eat that pie.

I gave this cherry cashew bar to my wife but did not tell her about my blueberry review in order for her to provide an unbiased opinion. I watched her as she read the ingredients list as is her custom with a new product. Her first comment was about her reluctance to eat this bar because of the huge calorie count for such a small bar and the unbelievably high fat content. I urged her to at least take a bite in order to evaluate the taste. After she bit into it I could see her grimace as the unwelcome result of this action took its toll. She said that it did not taste good. I asked for her overall rating to which she unhesitatingly replied \\"one\\".

I wished I had several more to look forward eating - guess I will have to buy a 12 pack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy, flavorful snack bar","review":"The Pure Organic Raw Fruit and Nut Bar is a healthy alternative for snacking and provides 6g of protein and 3g of fiber. The ingredients include organic dates, almonds, cashews, walnuts, and blueberries. The flavor is quite intense and surprising. They are very sweet but contain no refined sugars. This is also a gluten-free product. My first impression after biting into you reminded me of a fig newton. It has the same type consistency and flavor. I found the fruit flavor more notable than the nuts. Nice product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I expected","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by how good these Pure bars are. I've tried a number of healthy organic snack bars in the past, and most of them are barely edible. These are a bit tart, but not overly so. They are sweetened with dates & agave nectar, but are not overly sweet. I wasn't sure if I liked the first bite, but they grow on you.I love the ingredients list, which is all whole food: Dates, Cashews, Cherries, Rice Protein, Walnuts, Agave Nectar, Almonds...all organic. This is an unprocessed, raw, healthy treat. It contains 190 calories (70 from fat), 7g of protein, 3g of fiber, and 17g of sugars (which are natural fruit sugars). It's also very low in sodium and high in potassium.My biggest complaint is that Amazon will only ship these to the Lower 48 states, so living in Alaska I can't order them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Combination of Flavors","review":"I found this product to have intense fruit and nut flavors with no excessive sweetness or saltiness. The bar has a chewy texture, and resembles sheets of dried fruit, only thicker. It is exceptionally tasty and satisfying. However, since sweetness and saltiness are two things that many folks like, they may find the bar too bland. There is 0 % sodium, so the product may be enjoyed without guilt by those on salt-restricted diets. Unlike candy bars and many health bars, the Pure bar is filling and won't have you craving food for a good while after eating one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a tasty treat and all natural","review":"I like the ingredients on this snack bar: Organic Dates, Organic Cashews, Organic Cherries Organic Rice Protein Concentrate, Organic Walnuts, Organic Agave Nectar, Organic Almonds. That's it. I can pronounce all of it. The bar has a nice texture: kind of chewy but not a major workout for the jaw. The nuts give you a little crunch; the cherries add a nice tartness. The overall flavor was a little flat but definitely not tasteless - I enjoyed it.It is a little high in carbohydrates and fats but it's made mostly from dates and nuts so that should be expected. They're natural \\"fruit\\" carbs (agave, dates and cherries) and \\"good\\" fats (from nuts). One bar is 190 calories with 8g fat, 25g carbohydrates (3g Fiber -yay!, 17g sugars) and 7g Protein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh yeah!","review":"Oh yeah.... I was surprised how good this tasted without alot of fake ingrediants in it.. this and the blueberry are really good and honestly satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"tasty organic bar","review":"I really like cashews and this bar has large pieces of them in it, which made me really happy. The bar is a good size for an afternoon snack or a pick me up while exercising/hiking at 1.7 oz. The ingredients are very natural with organic dates, cashews, cherries, walnuts, almonds, agave nectar and rice protein being the entirety of them. The cherries are a bit tart which helps give the bar a good flavor with enough sweetness added by the agave nectar. The bar is rather soft, but firm enough to hold. It is a tad sticky but won't leave a residue on your fingers. I really liked this bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"fruity snack","review":"The Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew fruit and nut bar is a refreshing alternative to sugarry snacks. It is not meant to be a meal replacement bar, or a fruit snack confection but does have some attributes of each.It contains the vitamins and minerals of fruit, the protein and crunchiness of nuts.It is more moist than meal bars, has no added sugar and natural flavors.Camparing it to the Pre blueberry bar, the cherry bar has a more subtle fruit flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw Tastes Good! Who Knew?","review":"I tend to prefer crunchy, rather than \\"moist\\" granola/snack/power bars. Most of the latter are too sticky for my liking. Additionally, most of the moist power bars are just too dense for my taste. The PURE Bar is a bit different. It is moist, but not too sticky or dense. The flavor is primarily of dates, but the fruit and nuts come through. As others have noted, it is a bit small for the calories it packs. Organic, raw, and vegan are nice bonuses. I'd buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Pure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew raw fruit and nut bar is not for me. It was like eating an unbaked blob of dough mixed with bits of nuts and tart unripe cherries. I would rather eat a cherry pop tart than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck, with a capital Y","review":"Yes, it may claim to be all organic and such...but, yuck! This is the worst bar I have ever had. I am always looking for a good, healthy, organic AND tasty bar, but this...tasted like cardboard, with a nut here and there. I have eaten two of these, and the first one was so bad that the second one made me gag. I love theClif ZbarandKashi. They are tasty, this is not.Although the list of ingredients sounds good (health wise) and the flavor says cherry chashew, it asll tasted disgusting to me. If you are looking for a vegan/organic bar that actually DOES taste like what it is supposed to be, check outPROBAR Fruition Superfood Snack Bar, Strawberry. The Fruition is seriosuly yummy. With a capital Y, the good Y."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice balance of flavors and well formed","review":"Unlike some other similar products, this bar holds it's shape well, doesn't fall apart and is only slightly sticky. It's got a great fruit and nutty flavor. I think most people who appreciate organic products will enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly yummy!","review":"My experiences with health and energy bars have been mixed. Most of the ones I've tried are pricey, taste terrible, and make me feel like I've swallowed powdered cement. So, I was cautious about Pure Bar. My general view, based on experience, is that the healthier and more \\"organic\\" it is, the worse it's going to be and this one is jam-packed with things like organic dates, organic cashews, organic rice protein concentrate, and other organic healthy stuff--so it couldn't possibly be delicious, right? Wrong. I was pleasantly surprised after the first bite hit my taste buds. These things are really good! Unlike most health bars I've tried, these are chewy and moist--not hard and dry. I don't have to wash this down with a drink in order to get it from my throat to my stomach, and there's no nasty aftertaste. And, the price is definitely reasonable! I'll be buying more of these for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Organic is a must","review":"This might have been the most unpolluted nutrition bar I have ever eaten, but it wasn't delicious. It offers a nutty feel, subtle fruity flavor, and 8 grams of fat and 19 grams of sugar that barely translate into taste. If organic is what you seek primarily then this might be just what you were looking for. Your mouth might even be acquainted with it. I would prefer a Zone Bar for the same calories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Healthy & Fairly Tasty","review":"I was surprised by how moist and chewy the PURE bar was, and the taste was surprisingly good as well. I really liked the fact that this bar was both organic and raw, without the typically unhealthy ingredients you find in similar products.My only complaint is that they don't indicate on the packaging or amazon page whether or not the raw nuts have been soaked, which aids the digestability of the nuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy & Tasty","review":"First things first: I really love this snack bar. I tried the Cherry Cashew one and I was actually surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Before tasting it I read the packaging and really liked the fact that this bar is a raw and unprocessed snack without any artificial flavoring or ingredients. It also provides you with 7g of protein and 3g of fiber per serving. However, when something is that good for you it usually doesn't taste that great. But the Pure Bar is different. The texture is chewy with lots of different nut pieces in it and it has a sweet taste to it that is just the right amount of sweetness. I will definitely be ordering more of these and keep them around for a healthy snack option. LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This was a very good bar, chewy with nuts and cherry. It actually was filling and satisfying. I do not know how much they sell for, but they would go well on a trip to fill in-between craves. They certainly were better than granola bars."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Six-Year-Old Loves It!","review":"This cherry and cashew bar was tasty! The sweetness sort of creeps up on you. It is like a thick fruity \\"leather\\" bar, but not at all tough to chew. My son, who is six and loves dried fruit, wanted to eat the whole bar himself. We finally convinced him to share. It's nice to know it was made with high quality ingredients. It would make a great snack on a hike or at the zoo. They make them in blueberry as well. Give it a shot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive!","review":"This was very impressive. As a snack, it's basically mushed up dates with some cashews. It has a VERY different consistency from grain based bars: imagine a sort of rolled-up fruit rollup, and you'll come close. The cashews add a nice crunch, and it has a very distinct cherry flavor.For someone trying to eat naturally, it's tough to get any better! Though what \\"Rice Protein Concentrate\\" is, I'm not sure, and I don't think it really needs any added sweetening from the agave and would prefer to see raw honey instead, or no sweeteners at all. (There are some controversies around agave, apparently.)I'm interested in trying other flavors: apparently, Amazon also sells a variety pack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I was a bit hesitant when I unwrapped the bar since, at first glance, it doesn't look all that appetizing. Just a dark slab that doesn't inspire much confidence. But, one bite and I was sold - this tastes great! Very fresh, sweet but not cloying, soft and chewy with the nuts adding some crunch. Perfect mid day or late day snack.My only small complaint is that the bar is sticky to the touch, which can make it a bit messy if you're eating it on the go and don't have a napkin (preferably a wet nap) handy. Minor issue when compared with the benefits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad to me","review":"The ingredient list is very impressive - natural and simple. I wasn't sure how it was going to taste since it's labeled \\"raw.\\" I was pleasantly surprised - it's mildly sweet and fruity (in a natural way of course). There is some nutty texture from the real nuts. The only disappointment is that the bar itself is surprisingly small, which will be discovered once you open the package.

The texture and taste are dominated by the dates, which comprise the base of this bar.

For my carbs and calories, I'd choose something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as a lara bar","review":"A bit more sticky and not quite what I would call a chocolate brownie.

However I am only willing to sacrifice so much to cut a few calories. To be totally honest these bars are the worst tasting snack that I have ever tried. They are so bad in fact that I could only finish about 1/2 of the bar. All I taste while eating them are dates with a hint of cashews and walnuts. I don't really taste the cherry in them at all. I have tried a few other similar bars that tasted much better than these. They are very small as well at about 1 1/2 inch by 3 1/2 inches and are quite expensive as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasteless","review":"This may be good for you, but it is like eating cardboard with a few nuts tossed in.

However, my first choice remains the Zone Bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ingredients slightly strange taste","review":"For any person who cares about eating healthy, but likes to get their sweet cravings taking care of, these fit the bill. The ingredient list is very impressive, all organic, no refined sugars, and a short list.The bars are very sweet - even without refined sugars added, so you need not worry about them being plain or not sweet enough. I tried both these and the cherry ones, and I preferred these ones. They are a little less sweet (other was too sweet for me) and the flavor is not as strange.Superb ingredients, but not quite my type. It might be an aquired taste - it is unlike any other bar you've eaten including: power bars, odwalla, granola bars, etc) it's soft, chewy, and very moist.If your children like it - it's a much better alternative that other bars.I personally won't buy them again due to their taste though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorful","review":"I like it.

I was quite surprised when I took my first bite of Pure Organic (Cherry Cashew flavor) as it reflects its self-classification as a \\"raw fruit & nut bar\\") and goes down easily. This does not taste like all the rest and even has 7 grams of protein to boot. It does have 190 calories so for those of you who are watching your weight, it's important to know that this is not one of those diet bars, which in my opinion taste like junk because they are made from junk. I would highly this flavor in particular as it was refreshing. I also sampled the Wild Blueberry and did not like how it tasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holistic Medicine Defined","review":"The most comprehensive statement of what holistic medicine is about.

A comparison of Keck and Kupecky's discussion of attachment with any of the many scholarly publications on this subject, such as those by Mary Ainsworth, Inge Bretherton, or Everett Waters, shows dramatic differences; whatever Keck and Kupecky are talking about, it is not what scholars and researchers mean by attachment.Readers should approach this book with serious caution, and check statements against other, more conventional sources before accepting them."},{"rating":"2","title":"very informative","review":"A very helpful book.

Like before everything was just too perfect with them. My favorite character is Cammie because she reminds me of this girl at my school who is also rich and beautiful and totally mean, only Cammie does it much better! The way Zoey Dean writes makes you feel like you are right there living inside the book. I wish I was Anna! Zoey Dean is now my favorite writer because she really knows how teens think and feel, even teens like me who aren't so rich.

In addition, the A List books are fun, absorbing, and very well written.

A National Book Award winner should be less of a chore to get through. The book is almost all dialogue, none of it attributed, and so it is always up to the reader to retrace his steps to figure out who is talking. Gaddis can't make up his mind whether he is writing a satiric comment on modern America or a surreal pseudo-Joycean trip. A lawyer reading the book will note many technical errors (state law pre-empting federal?), but I did love the Episcopal Church/PepsiCola lawsuit about the latter being an anagram of the former. As a lawyer and Episcopalian myself, I'm mulling it over"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why don't I Iike any of these people?","review":"Although tour-de-force writing, this book is a difficult read. Inadequate puncuation, run on sentences, lengthly full-text LEGAL BRIEFS and massive excerpts from one character's ponderous Civil War play make for an overall annoying literary experience. Although there are many humorous moments of exchange between the main characters (you have to figure out who's talking by context since the author rarely identifies the speaker), most of the personalities end up being stunningly whiney and have almost zero redeeming values, which makes you say at the end: \\"Do I care about any of these people? NO.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! This book stank!!","review":"I'm afraid I didn't get past the first 50 or so pages because this book stank. It was billed as a hysterical comedy of manners in America in the 1990's etc., etc., but was about as funny as a good kick up the arse. The subject is some asinine litigation, which gives the author an excuse to pad out the text with the most tedious legal verbiage and opinions. It was bad! 7.99 as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaddis genius strikes again!","review":"I'm afraid I had to offer my own review after being appalled that other customers had rated this novel beneath the five stars its due. While others bring Pynchon's name to the top of the list, I don't believe it possible to deny Gaddis' status as the top author in American letters. Brilliantly innovative, with a minute eye for both the sublime and the mundane, and the threads which bind the two in existence, this book is a must read. And if you read it twice, perhaps you'll come away chuckling at the realization of the true measure of the frolic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, non cheesy journal for granmothers of all ages.","review":"I have wanted to get this for my mom to fill out even before I found out I was pregnant with her first granddaughter! Out of all the journals for grandmas, I felt this one was the best fit for my 51 year old mother to fill out.

This will be something great to hand down to my daughter one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beginning of another great series!","review":"This is my favorite author in all the world. I was thrilled to see the beginning of another series. All too soon I finished it. This book gives you an idea of what it would have been like to live during the time of Christ's ministry on the earth. I gained new understanding of how some of the Jews of that time would have felt, and what they were expecting from a Messiah. I can't wait for the next book and reccommend this book to everyone. Christians of all denominations will find this book very worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I absolutely LOVE these series. I'm now reading them for the 4th time.

I get great copies and nice pictures when I need them. I can remember when dot-matrix was the only option so it I have no complaints inthat regard. If I have any complaint it's over the pricing of toner in general which isn't specific to this brand or type so I'll leave that out of this review as far as the rating. I'm only taking off 1 star because I tend to feel these don't last as long as some others I've had in the past-but that's entirely subjective- I've done no testing on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical HP Itty Bitty Ink Supply","review":"HP ink cartridges are priced so high that they can afford to give the printers away for free. My next printer will not be a HP printer because other printers of equal or better quality have more affordable cartridges. Having said that, the price here at Amazon for this cartridge is lower than the price to purchase it locally. For example, at Wal-Mart this same cartridge is $23.97 plus the gas cost to travel approximately 8 miles. This is a typical HP cartridge - long on price and short on ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor belly dance instruction","review":"I rented this video from the library.

Her approach, her writing style, is much, much better than the standard click-on-this approach used by many writers and suitable for the beginner or power user.This is combined with what seems like more than one color picture on each page, brilliantly printed on a very white paper stock.

He is absolutely convincing in this role, which is a real tribute to his ability to play vastly different characters. He sheds any tainted memory of Frasier in the first ten minutes of the series and puts on a clinic for the superiority of facial expression over dialogue as a method of communication. And with this episode, I also applaud the writers. I was on the fence about the writing as I was losing interest in the story over the past few episodes, but this episode blew me away. Maybe I'm not the brightest star in the sky, but I was totally surprised, shocked, disgusted, but spellbound as the story unfolded in this episode.

I still have the unused glass file I bought from a drug store, and I rarely buy something when I can get by with what I have.Some say they like the thinner glass files but I never noticed it being a problem. These files make the chore of filing your nails almost fun! It takes so little time to file your nails with these compared to the regular nail files. Just buy it, you'll be happy you did. Oh!

She writes well, and with brutal honesty, about herself and about the people she came in contact with during her years as a reporter.She doesn't gloss over the mistakes she has made or the problems she encountered. She looks at herself unflinchingly and tells you both the good and the bad. Many times autobiographies won't paint a complete picture of the person, but you get the idea that you really know who Stahl is. Yo also respect her for being willing to show her human side, and to share her mistakes. It helps us \\"regular people\\" to know that she is not perfect -- we can all relate to that.In addition, Stahl brings politics to life by sharing some of the background stories, her experiences with famous world leaders, and her struggle with the sometimes overt/sometimes covert sex discrimination she encountered in her travels.This book is well worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A total fix for political junkies","review":"The problem I had with Stahl's book is that I STOPPED WORKING. Luckily, I am a writer, so no one really noticed. But this is a book so rich in behind-the-scenes detail that you can hardly put it down.Here is the line I liked best in the book. At a ferocious briefing with press secretary Larry Speakes, he is saying \\"I'd like you to report....\\" Stahl interrupts: \\"We don't care what you'd like us to report.\\" Get it?Finally, I was impressed with how much credit and space she gives her producers, even as they refer to her as \\"news babe in ridiculous heels.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Popular not expert view, bigotry & ignorance present","review":"Overall the book is a nice & easy reading. But, IMO, it only presents Lesley's personal and popular rather than an expert view of the political matters. One should treat her opinions with limited confidence. I loved the warm touches when Lesley talks about her Aaron. I hated an instance of bigotry and ignorance that I encountered on page 346, line 35 (hardcover). Referring to Bush's visit in Poland (July, 1989) she concludes: \\"The Poles (with help from their friendly neighborhood Germans) had killed off their tradesmen, the Jews, in the 1940's.\\" Well, I don't need to explain that it is a historical & political fallacy, do I? What is less obvious is that it is a potentially harmful revisionist statement, possibly triggered by some ethnic prejudice."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting inside look at the television news business","review":"I enjoyed this look at television news from a woman's point of view. I've always admired Lesley Stahl, but knew little about her personal life. Her book is honest, and she is very forthcoming about how she was more career-driven than family-driven, and left much of the childrearing to her husband. It was slow in a few spots (harping quite a bit on Ronald Reagan) but all-in-all well worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of knowledge, plenty of stupidity","review":"Book is totaly 'unreadable'. One bumbs every page on the totaly false sentences and misconceptions. For example L.Stahl thinks that we, Judes were kiled by Polish when in fact We and Polish people (not to mention Rusians, Gipsies etc.) were killed by Germans - namely Nazi Germans. Who says that this not happened is a liar and ought to be prosecuted as nazi. As for the political writer such ignorance ought to be punishable.

SHAME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her put down of Reagan is pathetic and shows her true colors","review":"Ms. Stahl wants to make herself the most important person. A shame she couldn't take care of her child. I was very disappointed in this book and found her way of harping on all the negatives she could find very distressing.

I could not ignore some of the similarities to Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone (single, female private eye, ex-cop, ex-wife, quirky landlord-tenant relationship, broken nose), but the plot was well paced and the mystery kept me guessing. I look forward to reading other Carlotta tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really bad","review":"This is my first time dipping into Barnes's Carlotta Carlyle series, and I can't say I was in any way impressed. This novel is both underwritten and clumsy, full of cliches, poorly drawn characters, false tension, silly narrative developments, and ultimately a revelation that makes absolutely no sense. I don't believe in putting spoilers in these reviews, so I won't describe the utterly absurd revelations that come at the end of this novel, but suffice to say that to call it half-baked would be to insult all the half-baked books out there. I am glad Barnes's many fans find enjoyment in her works, and I hope they can continue to do so, but for a reader who is looking for something other than a lifeless installment in a feisty female detective series, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointing, disorganized imitation of previous reads","review":"as much as i have enjoyed reading barnes books in the past, that's how disappointed i was in this book. its almost as if she felt obliged to keep her name current with no thought given to organization, rhyme or reason. thoroughly unlike barnes like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"This started out with a bang but what a let down.

Throughout the entire book I waited (and hoped) for the return of Enoch, so the book could get back on track, only to be dismally disappointed. It seemed to me that this books should have come to a conclusion several times before it finally finished, as if the writer was stringing this book out, so that she could write a third book.

Am I the only one who hates this book? How can a book, with such a prequel (Shield of three Lions), be as terrible as this book is?

Alix, the main character, who marries her Scottish friend at the end of Shield of three Lions (a book which I, by the way, absolutely love), leaves her home and friends to go off after King Richard the Lionhearted.

At first slipping into them they feel great but as you try to actually wear them around the house (for me it's on tile floors) you'll experience your feet slipping out and an awful lot of sloshing around inside.

Google this drive on the web and you will see how many other people are having the same problem. It works well as a USB drive, but I paid $40 more for an eSATA feature that has never worked. (I have another eSATA drive - not Seagate - that works perfectly).

This seems USELESS to me, as most people purchasing a hardrive of 320, 500, or 750 GB are going to need much more backup space. I can store 5 GB for free on my hotmail account. What was their marketing department thinking when they only offer 5 GB of online backup, and even the price for that is high?The hardrive itself is a good price, and besides the fact that the first one I bought was DOA (I think it was the cheap power supply that didn't work) the hardware is fine.

If they fix the software, this could be a good product, but right now my recommendation is: AVOID.Things they need to fix with the backup software:- make it usably fast (the UI itself and the backup speed - for large numbers of small files)- make it reliable!

I actually had a 320 gb model, but the problems I had were identical to those mentioned in these comments - overheating, losing access to important data, unresponsive support. Sure, the hard drive worked fine for awhile - but then once I had transferred loads of important data it began to fall apart. I guess my biggest problem with Seagate is that with so many nearly identical, catastrophic failures of these units, they should've issued a voluntary recall and refund. Instead, I was told that I could pay $30 shipping for the privilege of replacing a fundamentally corrupt unit with another one, as well as unknown fees for data recovery.

It fared well enough to be the first in this series of what will surely be a collection of covers. There is still that effortless, irresistible quality in his singing and a thick sense of pure romance in all these songs. Although mostly standards from the ages, Julio does stretch out a bit and lend a warm vocal to modern songs like, the Hollies, \\"The Air That I Breathe\\" and \\"If\\". His big cuts, of course, are \\"To All The Girls I've Loved before\\" and \\"All Of You\\". Once again, Iglesias never falters in his tone or vocal quality. This is a classic keeper for all romantics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage","review":"This is a young Julio with a truly melodic voice.

When I started to play the CD, my entire class started laughing,and eight people simultaeneously said, \\"What the heck is this?\\" To make a long story short I was humiliated in front of my whole class. The music was a very poor attempt to immitate some American music at the time. It was a very noble idea but some of the words don't translate into Spanish and rhyme at the same time. It was a great attempt, but I can't reccomend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pigs in a Blanket","review":"I first saw this movie in its theatrical release. All of my work peers saw it as well and it seems that it was all we talked about. Yes, it was starnge, but oddly comical as well. Someone even had a dinner party serving up some of the Shelly Duvall's character's favorite recipes. It was a truely visionary and idiosyncratic Robert Altman movie and was compared to Bergman's \\"Persona\\". I taped it from t.v. once, but it was so cut up and disjointed that I eventually taped over it and decided to wait until it eventuall came out on video. And now I've ordered it and I'm so excited. Can't wait to see how it has held up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange, dreamlike, and disturbing","review":"Very weird psychological drama from Robert Altman, featuring Sissy Spacek as a mousy woman who befriends the talkative but equally unpopular Shelley Duvall when they both work in a rehab center. As the roommates increasingly crash and have conflicts, they enter into an odd connection with a third woman, who makes disturbing art when her philandering husband is off....well, philandering. Atmospheric and bizarre but tame enough to get a PG rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"ratio","review":"love the movie. it was great seeing it again after so many years. but it was not the advertised 1.77 to 1 ratio, which i had wanted. it was wider, letterboxed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece.","review":"This is Robert Altman's most singular film and it may also perhaps be his very best. Finally ridding himself almost completely this time of that always pesky narative albatross called plot, Altman seemingly bites off more than he can possibly chew, but I'll be damned if he doesn't get just about every bit digested. The hypnotic acting and mis-en-scene steer this cinematic poem down streets and alleys that I wasn't quite expecting from a Robert Altman film,who admittedly has always been consistently hit-or-miss in terms of quality. The almost ethereal tone that Altman strikes here seems to anticipate the more recent work of David Lynch,which makes one wonder why he never continued in this vein.However, 3 Women is better than any of the very talented David Lynch's work, but you ought to check into this yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watchable, yet nearly insufferably pretensious","review":"This movie is bearable for two reasons only: Sissy Spacek and Shelley Duvall. They both are great actresses who create very interesting characters, but they get bogged down in a convoluted muck. Why Altman, whose 70s movies I usually enjoy, felt the need to include identity switches, overbearingly ominous music, dozens of slow pans to Greek-like paintings of rape and violence, and an unfathomable (and disappointingly tacked-on) ending is thoroughly beyond me. No, on second thought it's not BEYOND me, it's BENEATH me. I get what he was trying to do, but it's heavy handed and poorly executed. David Lynch (who I suspect was influenced by this film) has been infinitely more successful at committing ominous dream worlds to film in \\"Lost Highway\\", \\"Mulholland Drive\\", and just about every other film he's ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop projecting and SEE what a pretentious film this is.","review":"Altman may have been the most over-rated filmaker in the United States. What we see in this film is the work of a person with superb technical skills being applied by one with the vision of an ambitious film student. Disolves are disjointed and ambiguous---not \\"because they are meant to be\\" but because Mr. Altman has lost all sight of his narrative. This happens ALOT. No excuses, Mr. Altman. You are stillriding on your ill-deserved rep. For excellent film-making see ANYthing by Jaques Tati. Nuff said. And to all you out there, impressed by this film: what WAS going on in your life when you saw it, and were SOOO impressed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Collection","review":"This is a good cd mix with some old and some current things made in the last 2-3 yrs.

I decided it was time to get better at tuning the sails so I got this book. It's way too advanced for me. I wanted to know the basics--when to use the boom vang and how, when to use the genoa travelers and how, sail shape to shoot for and how to get it. What I found was excruciating detail about ajusting the forestay, the scientific explanation of all kinds of stuff, and very little basics. It's not a thick book, but the nature of the writing makes it a very very slow read. If you've been racing for years and want to get that extra 5% get this book. If you want some straightforward general pointers on improving how you tune sails look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent on tuning, not so good on engineering.","review":"I brought this book to check the rigging on a boat that I want to build.The diagrams are very clear and the book is concise and easy to read.While this book was helpful it was not really what I was after.I see this book being great for those sailors who want to win races."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing but someone obviously mis-informed.","review":"The author of this book is poorly misinformed on the meaning of certain things.

Why the word \\"internet\\" is prominent in the title, is beyond me. What is said about the internet is little and shallow. Windows XP and MacOS X are never mentioned and everytime Windows 2000 is briefly mentioned, you can feel that the author adds it, just to prove that some things in the text have been updated at least once the last 10 years.

Ted Williams didn't pay much attention to fielding, but what he did pay attention to, he did very well. The \\"Jesse Stone\\" movies don't do everything well, but when it comes to producing character-driven, moody, exquisitely paced, hard-boiled entertainment, they do very well. Then came \\"No Remorse\\". It isn't terrible, but it's lost some of the appeal.

The underrated Tom Selleck is joined by many of the series regulars, and their usually quiet interactions are among the greatest pleasures of the film.

I love Jesse Stone movies, but the script of this one was very lame. Every Jesse Stone characteristic and saying from all the other movies that had been established was brought up in this movie--and done so in a very obvious way. Sissy offers herself again to Jesse. Hasty's tie lights up. Jesse is drinking and everybody's concerned. Jen calls, and Jesse and she have the exact same conversation you've seen in all the other movies, etc., etc. Jesse goes to his shrink and they talk about drinking....again. The conversations in the first part of the movie are very mechanical. The last third of the movie flows much better. If you are a Jesse Stone fan as I am (I own all the other movies) I would encourage you to rent this one, but not purchase it. I'm not sure you can take this one twice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Wait For Jesse Stone Number 7","review":"This is Chapter Six in the series of Jesse Stone movies. The same great cast continues the story line established in earlier chapters - answering questions left hanging in the previous movie and leaving some open ends for the next movie to tie up.

They are also very soft. I havent tried them as a mousepad, but it says they can be used also as a mousepad and to wipe the laptop screen. For regular price they are a bit silly to have, but on sale they are a great little laptop accessory. Targus also gives them a 1 year warranty.

Everything else on this is pretty good, though there is too much side stuff going on during most of the songs which kinda brings the listening meter down, especially if you here them alot.I would probably reccomend downloading the good stuff if you don't like all the chitters that happen throughout the CD, but it wouldn't be a mistaken purchase either. Your choice, that's while there are samples and reviewers to tell you about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took a while to get used to...","review":"but once I did, I started listening to it every day. I had been listening to a lot of newer hip hop so it was hard to tune into this, but after I did I realized how great the album really was.

It has four of Dr.Dre's hit singles including \\"Let Me Ride\\", \\"F**k Wit' Dre Day\\", \\"Nuttin' But A G Thang\\" & \\"Lil' Ghetto Boy\\". None of the songs are boring or lame.

Every song on this album is awesome and it features the hits f**k wit dre day, ni**a wit a gun, let me ride, nuthin but a g thang lil ghetto boy. this is a awesome release and i recomend that if u r a fan of west coast rap u should definately get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC+CLASSIC+CLASSIC","review":"Listen up wannabes and wankstas, class is in session and the honorable Dr. Dre is presiding.

I'm a huge fan of Eminem, I own everything he has done, released and unreleased. Same with Dr. Dre. This is by far the best thing he has ever brought up. It has the best instrumentals, and every song is an instant classic. If you buy this album you will not be let down. this album is the definition of gangsta rap. If you don't love this album, you don't love rap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dre, Snoop and Death Row at the their best..............","review":"Dre's gangsta funk production picks up where Niggaz4life left off with Parliament/George Clinton being added into the equation. Toss in a green Snoop Doggy Dogg and the rest is hiphop history. The Chronic struck at the right time months after the Rodney King verdict, the police aquittal, and subsequent riots and destruction of Los Angeles. The genius of the Chronic is that all of these cats were hungry including Dre, having just severed ties with NWA and Eazy E. The results were incredible with mainstream classics like Nutthin But a G Thing and F*ck with Dre Day. Hood Classics are pretty much the rest of the album. Cuts that still hit are Rat-a-tat-tat, Little Ghetto Boy and Stranded on Death Row."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"I love Eazy E but I had to bob my head to Der Day I mean both sides to me were hot but anyway you have Snoop showing out lyrically and you got RBX and the Dogg Pound and Lady of Rage featured on this. It doesnt make any sense for this album to be so hotLyrics 10/10 Beats 10/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rap Album","review":"I'm from the east coast but I think this album is one of the top 3 albums of all time. Wit Dre Day is a classic dis record and Ain't Nuthin But A G Thang will have you rocking in your car all day. This is album is the definition of a perfect album. Wit Dre doing all the beats. Having all of Death Row rhymin on here. And Interludes that make you laugh this album is the complete package. You cant say that you're a hip hop fan without this album. If you don't have this album you're a wannabe hip hopper."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRLLIANT GANGSTER RAP ALBUM","review":"ALthough many may argue that Dre isn't the greatest rapper, my opinion is that he has a great presence on the mic. He can also bust some great lyrics even though he hasn't written all hi own lyrics over the years. Subject matter is limited but it's meant to be like that. Dre is rapping about gangster topics. Snoop is at his best here and RBX is just brilliant. However the outro and the bonus track suck and shoul've been left off the album. The standout tracks are Stranded On Death Row, Lil' Ghetto boy, Let Me Ride, F Wid Dre Day, Deez Nuts, Lyrical Gangbang and High Powered. If you're into gangster rap this is recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Birth of Gangsta Rap","review":"This album is a true classic. When somebody says the words \\"Gangsta Rap\\" this is the CD that should pop up in your head. Every track on this album completely amazing, the beats are phenomonal and the fact that the lyrics aren't strikingly deep doesn't really matter. Sure there is isn't too much here that is truly meaningful (this is mostly a party album) but each rapper's style and delivery is mostly flawless (especially Snoop). If you are a fan of West-Coast Hip-Hop and you do not own this album there is something seriously wrong with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dre is pure genius!!!","review":"I've listened to this album a long time ago, but the other day when I piked it back up to listen to it,it took me back to the old days in the ghetto. This has to be the best rap cd ever. This is definitly a classic cd. With songs like \\"Wit Dre Day\\" \\"Nuthin' But A G Thang\\" and \\"Stranded on Death Row\\" everybody should own this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Dre - A Classic Album","review":"What can be said that hasn't been already about this album? It is a banger from Intro to the last song. The guest appearances from the likes of Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, Lady of Rage, RBX and Kurupt are fantastic and this album truly does stand the test of time.The word classic is thrown around and used too often these days to describe albums by the likes of 50 Cent (I do not consider Get Rich...as a classic-overrated).My favorite tracks include: F**k wit Dre Day (great diss track-brilliant), Let Me Ride, Nuthin' but a G thing, A n**** witta gun, Rat-tat-tat-tat, Lyrical Gangbang (Lady of Rage flows superbly in this) and Stranded on Death Row (great beat and the likes of Snoop Dogg, Lady of Rage and RBX all bring their game to the table on this one-EXCELLENT).This can stand upto the strong words of 'CLASSIC'. Rap fans should have this in their collection by now. What you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"All of the 1 star reviews have nothing to do with the product","review":"Just picked up this version and was happy to see that a higher quality version on this classic album was made. I only gave it 4 stars though not because it disapointed me (which it did a little) but because I'm saving my 5-star review for a fully lossless multi-channel version of the album that will eventually come out, hopefully in blu-ray format. The DVD version of the album is in 48kHz/16-bit which is a step up from the 44.1kHz/16-bit CD version; though a 24-bit version would bring the studio quality of the album to your home and/or car. I'll keep hoping for the lossless Hi-Resolution version, hopefully with more people demanding it, it'll become a reality.Also, about the 1-star reviews. I basically flaged all as not helpful, since they're just trashing on the album in general so I don't believe they're proper product reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good at all","review":"Looking back at this album 9 years later I can confirm now what I knew back then in 1992. The lyrics are meaningless, the music sounds like it comes from a casio keyboard, and the supporting cast doesn't improve the album. This isn't music. It's garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"my cousin hates this cd","review":"my cousin gave me this cd to trade in. dre has the warped up beats. this cd got the rainbow sound. my cousin can't see that. i'm not trading it in because it is too much of a good cd. my cousin should understand that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why society sucks........","review":"I'm sorry, but as far as music, this is not, this is the type of stuff you listen to as you drive by a house and make swiss cheese out of it, bulls****. Oh, and most likely, the a**hole who's doing the drive-by is so stoned that he meant to shoot the gangbanger down the street house, and instead, ends up killing a innocent elderly person who was just about ready to call it a night, pure garbage. As far as I'm concern, they should stick every rapper gang banger out in the middle of nowhere, fence them in like the dogs they are, and let them destroy themselves, one by one. There is no moral values in this crap, kind of like that crip that got the goodnight needle at San Quentin, no use for it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of rubbish!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"oh my god!!!! i listened to these reviewers and bought it, too my disgust it was so awful it made me go back to the shop and try and get a refund!!!

I couldn't get passed the 4th track without turning this off! The beats are wack... the lyrics don't make any sense... and they don't rap about ex girlfriends or rims!! True rappers like Lil Wayne write good lyrics and dope beats! I can't believe this guy is even popular... what has Dr Dre and Snoop done for the rap game? NOTHING!For good rap listen to Fred Durst, Kid Rock, LIL Wayne, and Drake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Dre is one of the vision of rap and hip hop, this is the album that brought gangsta rap even more into the mainstream, snoop dogg, RBX, And others deliever great peformances, too bad dre forgot his fans and sold out after this (Dre presents the aftermath, chronic 2001).One of the great albums ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!!","review":"There was only ONE track on this album that I wasn't totally in love with... and even that was pretty smooth compared to most albums. If you haven't heard this album do yourself a favor and buy it NOW it changed the face of rap forever, especially with the beats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip-Hop MVP","review":"The best rap album of all time, and most important. Why? Go back and listen to what kinds of music, not just rap, was popular at the time. R&B and pop rock were still making synthy 80's cheese. Popular rap music was dominated either by pop dance cuts like \\"Baby Got Back\\" or east coast producers sampling James Brown and 70's jazz. Before Dre, the only time you heard live instruments in rap music was as sort of a gimmick. This was the first time hardcore rap music was at the forefront of all music, and the first west coast rap album to get heavy play in the east. So far ahead of its time it's rediculous. Yea, go listen to music before and after the Chronic and tell me that everything didn't change."},{"rating":"2","title":"old school dre day","review":"i love dr. dre, and this cd is def. worth buying, but not before 2001. this one is more laid back, but i'm chillin' to it right now, u like this, buy snoop's doggystyle and everything eminem too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back memories","review":"This album and mostly the song \\"Nuthin' but a \\"G\\" thang\\" really bring back memories of times when rap was really good and not so comercialized. Now we have stuff like \\"Willennium\\"; not that there's anything wrong with Will Smith. I just miss the early gangsta rap vibe at times and this album is the epitome of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Genre classic CD in a newly remastered edition with bonus video track and an extra track. Dark, dense, and intense, this represents Dr. Dre's commercial and artistic peak (so far) and should be part of everyone's core collection. The added track (placed last), though, is an unpleasant, misogynistic diatribe that does not enhance the album and, in fact, almost spoils it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a historical landmark","review":"i was suprised at how quickly this album stood out for me. it is the album that really set the ball rolling in Death Row's position in making history.the album begins with Snoop Dogg's little speech to state where death row stands, which he makes quite clear is on top.the album is more or less consistent as hell. might i note The Roach's intoxicating funk.if you dont have the attitude or an admiration for the attitude, you will not enjoy the lyrics of this album. guaranteed. Dre has alwayse been a premium N.W.A."},{"rating":"1","title":"I find this a waste of money","review":"(NOTE : 2008 Update on review) Just likeDoggystyle Dual Disc, I find this Dual Disc re-release to be a complete waste of money. I feel That The DVD side was lacking when it came to the videos. I would think that the videos would have the explicit song dubbed over. And I thought that they would add some remixes album's singles. Not only that but just likeDoggystyle Dual Disc, the digi pack packaging falls apart way too easily and the videos appear on the later released15 Years on Death Rowwhich is a better set to buy. So if you have the original, don't bother upgrading. It would so be a waste of money if you ask me. This is a cheap re-issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIS CD IS TERRIBLE","review":"i jus recently bought dis cd and i think its terrible, its jus got no quality beats to it, i only like 2 tracks on tha chronic cd, i am dissapointed in this cd, a major reason why i bout this cd is because ppl on this website said it was great i took ur peeps word and wasted my money on it. if u like rap and hip hop on tha radio 2day, then i dought u will like dis cd. dont buy it its a waste of money. im a major 2pac fan and i wanted to buy a cd that wasent related to 2pac cause thats like tha only cd's i get/ so i tryed to increase my cd collection with this cd and ill see now if i can sell it and if i get lucky ill get 5 bucks fo it"},{"rating":"1","title":"N---a please......... Stick with Public Enemy","review":"Yes, I said this cd isn't worth buying. it is stale, repetitive and so commercial that any real rapping present is drowned out by garbage. I have a few reasons for saying this. Surprisingly enough (not), Dre doesn't leave much for himself to say. Decent intro, yet guess who does it? Thats right, S-N-double O-P. Nice one, Dre. Second, the only tracks i found listenable was Nuttin but a 'G' thang, let me ride and the $20 sac pyramid. Don't get me wrong, I like NWA, but Dre shoulda stayed with them. Thats another problem with this album; Dre spends more time dissing Eazy E, etc. than doing any rhyming. Check some of his lyrical flows----> \\"got my finger on the trigger, some n---az wonder why, but livin in this city it's do or die\\" (x3)Come on!!! what is this? well, I suppose I've made my point, and by the way I would have given this 2 or 3 stars, but this coaster don't even bump.On the plus side, this album IS better than 2001, but not by much"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A GREAT CD","review":"Dr.Dre's first solo album is a sucess. His rythms and tunes, are so interesting to listen to and I always play his CD. Unlkike other, CDs, his does not get boring, and it is a real vacation to listen to him. One thing I love about Dr.Dre, is his variaty of different artists in his album. It makes the album that much better. It gives a different flavor of styles, and it gives other artists the time to shine. This album was great, and is a classic in the world of hip-hop.

No Artist in this decade did more for rap than Dr. Dre. His ability of foresight and poetic emotion put hard gangsta rap on the map. It was a style that was glamorized by youth and feared by adults. And all at once, the entire world knew about South Central LA. Dr. Dre was probably more successful behind the scenes for NWA and Snoop, but he lets it rip on The Chronic. Dr. Dre made \\"motherf###ker\\" a household word and we all knew what gats and hos were after this album dropped."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is da sh*t","review":"Dr. Dre and Snoop work together really good on this album.

Many also say Dr.Dre invented G-Funk. Some people think he didn't. The best songs are \\"Nuthin But A \\"G\\" Thang\\" is one of the greatist rap songs of all time and \\"Dre Day\\" is where Dre and Snoop diss Eazy-E, Ruthless records and even Luke of the 2 Live Crew very badly. Just listen to Snoop's remarks to Eazy-E and Luke at the end of that song, which maybe funny to many people. Other Gangsta songs like \\"Let Me Ride\\", \\"Ratta-tat-tat\\", \\"B----ez Ain't S--t\\" which is a hidden track, and \\"N---a Wit'a Gun\\" are just to name a few. On this debut album by Dre, there are many guests, all from Death Row. Execpt 2Pac, Who isn't found anywhere on this album or on Snoop's \\"Doggystyle\\" album.

I'm still learning about it's features but found the night shot feature to be especially useful and looks like it's day time. The video was surprisingly clear as well and the sound, well you can't beat the sound of the ocean.I am struggling with some blurry photos, primarily at night, but I'm pretty sure it's operator error. Other than that, I love the compactness of the camera, the dial, the on-camera guide and the life of the batteries. Amazing. I had upgraded from a very old HP which seemed to just love alkaline. Plus the power switch on that was easily turned on in error while in the case, adding additional drainage to the batteries.I would recommend this camera and I'm pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuzzy pictures","review":"The FE-180 seams to have a major problem with the picture quality in this camera. A review at CNET says the pictures are soften but that's a politely way to say fuzzy. I took over 100 pictures indoor, outdoor close up far off and in some shots the pictures are clear but non of them are sharp.I got a lot of out of focus shots and tried using the digital stabilizer mode called DIS which is really effective in low light scenarios. But I could never get a sharp picture.Another issue I have is that after you take a picture it only stays in the display for about 1 second. If I want to view the picture I have to switch to the viewing mode, making sure my subjects were looking at me. I returned it getting the Canon Powershot SD600 which works perfect; it's worth the extra cost to take pictures that last a lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING NEW","review":"I BOUGHT THIS THINKING IT WAS THE MOVIE RAW FOR 30 DAYS, SORTA A REVIRSE OF THE MOVIE SUPER SIZE ME WHICH WAS FANTASTIC.

Sure, some might argue that some of our blood-sucking heroine's feats are ridiculously far-fetched, but c'mon, it's fiction.

This show is the most overlooked musical of all time in my opinion. It has some of the most beautiful music of any show I have ever seen. I was hooked when I saw it at North Shore Music Theatre in Beverly, MA starring Jodi Benson (Little Mermaid; Polly in Crazy for You, etc.) playing Florence, earlier in her career. Soaring melodies, edgy musical proclamations and much more, should have given this show a place on the all time great Broadway Show list. About all most people remember about this show is that \\"One Night in Bankok\\" was on the pop charts for awhile. Maybe it was too topical: Cold War, Russia...but those of us who lived through those times can appreciate the significance of \\"Chess\\". What more can I say. Child of the 40's and 50's or not, who can resist the magic of a score composed by the guys from \\"Abba\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior Production","review":"Aside from Judy Kuhn, this version of \\"Chess\\" has little to recommend it. In trying to Americanize the show (U.S.A.! U.S.A.!) the writers/producers pandered to what they thought a Broadway audience wanted; consequently, the battle between \\"us and them\\" becomes horribly slanted. The original concept recording with Tommy Korberg and Elaine Paige (still the best of all Florences) and the Danish Original Cast remain the standout recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste time","review":"If you want good quality look at DOTCO. you will pay but remember buy once cry once.

Primarily, I was irritated by the overall lack of depth in this book; The story, although somewhat interesting because it is historical, has little structure. Urquhart uses the old \\"parachute under the pilot's seat\\" device a bit too much, and so nothing is believable. Things just happen, and there is no reasoning behind circumstances or events. Likewise, the characters are flat, predictable, and rather stereotypical--not real people.I found myself becoming aware of Urquhart's writing while reading The Stone Carvers, usually because I was amazed at how simple and un-insightful it was. Perhaps I missed something, or expected too much. Either way, I wish I hadn't bought this book!Tere"},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey","review":"This book was the first I've read of Jane Urquhart's novels.

In fact I couldn't put it down! I took it with me everywhere, even to the golf course! Ha. The descriptions of the work that went into the stone and wood carving performed in the book made me want to go out and buy a set of carving tools.

Neither the power supply nor the cable has any markings to indicate they are Seagate and therefore, while I can pull out any usb cable to connect any of my other usb drives, this is not the case with this line of Seagate drives. Why they would design a product to use a non standard cable and then make replacing that cable almost impossible is beyond me. I really can't say how well the drive functions because I have no usb cable to connect it to the computer and no way of getting one. I have checked their website only to be met with more confusion.

The next morning upon booting up, the computer no longer recognized the drive. I tried this on several other computers and nothing. I also noticed that the connections on the unit were very flimsy. Suffice to say I had to go in and remove the hard drive from the flimsy case. Also the hard drive housing brain malfunctioned...with all of my data on it. Horrible Horrible external hard drive.

I tried accessing it from another computer, and more data was gone. Now the drive isn't recognized at all by any computer and I have no way of recovering the content without ruining the warranty.I've never posted a review before, but wanted anyone who is having problems to know that you should get any remaining data off of the drive as soon as possible before you lose it completely. After that, you can EITHER get your data back yourself (read up on removing it from its case to fix the issues), OR use the warranty. Unless you want to pay upwards of hundreds of dollars for them to do both. Also, unless you're using it for backup only, you might want to buy another one as backup for the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good...","review":"Well, I have always liked Seagate drives because they are the last ones with a five year warranty. Problem is, you are going to NEED that warranty with this type of drive, mine failed in four weeks. There is no cooling system, just passive air vents, so the controller board overheats and the drive starts failing to communicate with the computer properly. Once it fails completely, kiss your data good by as Seagate will ONLY ship you a refurbished drive. They offer to \\"recover\\" your data, meaning they will take the time to copy it off the old drive, at a very high price. If you open the unit to get your data out before you ship it to them you have voided your warranty... Next time I'll get a LeCie with a one year warranty and better history and track record...

I use these on both windows and Linux based machines with minimal problems. The one issue I've constantly run into with this disk is that it \`automagically' goes into power save mode.This is very problematic on Linux based systems as linux detects the disk as having failed and marks it as read-only.The other downers about this drive are the fact that it still uses the 1980's style wallwort power supply, and it also uses the smaller USB connector (Which makes no sense).Speed:This disk does claim to be 7200RPM but I highly doubt you'll ever see any benefit to it.Comparing this against _MANY_ of my other disks, this is one of the slowest USB disks I own.

The build seems solid enough, although I'm sure there's external hard drives out there with a more solid, compact, space-efficient build with better materials, but this one will do.

The problem is that I recently downloaded many, many GBs of irreplaceable data onto this drive.

However, if like me, you would be virtually devestated at the loss of the data you might store on this, please avoid at all cost.

When you remove this property, they still can't be backed up automatically. Of course, you can do a Copy/Paste, but I purchased the item so I wouldn't have to do that.

However, I later tried to switch the firmware back, to see if the newer version was Linksys compatible, etc, and it gave me a checksum error.

The first one I noticed was about her father, she said he never leared to drive, two pages later she has him driving to deliver milk after the war. There are many other misstatements like this in the book.I also wonder why Pamela was so bad. Men have repeatedly reinvented themselves over the years and people think they are great. Pamela did what she had to do to get ahead and more power to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing and enthralling account","review":"This biography separates itself from other Pamela Churchill Harriman tomes in that it reads almost like a fiction novel. Some of the salacious and outlandish goings-on seem almost implausible, if not absurdly bizarre. Harriman proves to be the most singularly opportunistic individual that I have read about - possibly ever. Although she does have her good points(although even her philanthropy seems perfunctory at best), Harriman(or should I say Digby, Churchill, or Heyward?) comes across as the most devilishly clever courtesan of the 20th Century.I recommend this account as one that makes for a most compelling, if not a trifle unnerving, read.

That was the beginning of a line of lovers that included Elie de Rothschild, Stavros Niarchos, Jock Whitney, Prince Aly Khan, Gianni Agnelli---each a tabloid name of his day. She managed to have an affair with Frank Sinatra and also managed to marry Leland Hayward, the famous Broadway producer.

One example is a game quite near the beginning of the book where the conditions are \\"A is chosen if B is chosen\\", etc etc. The authors, in selecting and explaining the \\"correct\\" answer interpret this to mean \\"A is chosen ONLY if B is chosen.\\" This is a common fallacy of test-takers and it just embarrassing and appalling to have paid $30 for a book that commits these errors.Perhaps even worse and more off-track than these reasoning errors is the use of \\"none of the above\\" answer choices. These are never used on the LSAT and they work directly against the process of learning to complete the games efficiently and quickly. Absolutely inappropriate.

The number of typos was, quite frankly, inexcusable. Some of them could have been caught by running spell check (for example, spelling the word first \\"frst\\"). My personal favorite was when the book would list the answer as F, when the choices were only A-E, and you were supposed to figure that out.

There were occasional images that would surface in an appealing way like, \\"count the dogs as furniture as otherwise there will be no chairs,\\" but few of the images recurred enough to give any sense of narrative or unifying theme.

I wasn't able to understand everything that was being said but when it comes out on video with captions, I would get what they are laughing about.The story is about a guy in high school during the 80s when he is trying to identify more about himself. He then had a crush on his neighbor (my cousin) and is trying to accept the fact that he is gay. With the help of his friends, he was able to gain the courage of coming out and able to change his life, hence the title of the movie.I highly recommend this movie because it's very funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGELY disappointing","review":"With all the awrds this movie won, I expected it to be quite good, but it simply was not. Bad acting, bad dialogue, and completely unoriginal and banal plot and characters. Perhaps the dialogue was intended to be arch, but the actors just didn't have the talent to pull it off. Instead, everything seemed stilted and fake. Moreover, their lack of talent and/or charimsa diminshed any sympathy that a viewer might feel for them. While the characters are in \\"sympathetic\\" situations, we seen them all before -- and depicted in much more effective ways. In short, I was bored and unmoved. For a film that deals with many of the same themes, but does it in a more interesting, entertaining and accomplished manner, watch \\"Camp\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical, insightful, helpful","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book, not only as a preparation for taking the GRE general test, but also as a tool for self-enrichment. I admit that I don't agree with everything the author put into the issue or argument essays, but, that's hardly the point for reading this book, isn't it? The sample essays are truly extensive and exhaustive, serving as good models for students who might not be familiar with GRE writing. Moreover, very often I find that the essays jump start my own train of thoughts, challenging my point of view on an issue or argument, and that's a big part of reading this book is about, I believe.This book truly epitomizes the saying - learning by doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 1st section is useful","review":"like titles says... 1st section is useful.

The topics presented in this book are not like at all from the GRE's. They more like fragmented titles than complete GRE style essay topics. For example, one of the arguement topic in the book is \\"Comparing cold medications\\". You won't see a topic like that in GRE. To get better ideas about GRE essay topics, look at the topic list on the GRE web site.The reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 stars is that Do's and Don'ts section in Part I of the book is pretty good.

Sometimes the plunger can be a little hard to press down fully, but that's usually because the grind of the beans is too fine.

I don't own a grinder, so I bought some nice espresso grind at a neighborhood caf�� about four days ago. Every consecutive day since then, my coffee is noticeably not quite as good as the day before.

For me, this was ultimately a disapointing experience. I used the Aeropress for about three weeks, reverting to my single-cup drip maker for comparison once every five or six days. The Aeropress does, indeed, make a very smooth brew, but I found it less than satisfying (compared to my drip maker). This being the case, and taking into account that the Aeropress takes more time and attention and requires about 25% more coffee than my drip maker, I couldn't see any reason to keep using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin coffee","review":"Water raced through the coffee and filter creating a very thin coffee.

I have brewed lots of French Press Coffee and have been an avid french press drinker for years. Additionally, I have made lots of espresso shots. The Espresso that AeroPress makes is delicious and consistent with the shots of espresso that you would find in a high dollar espresso machine.To make the best cup of coffee with AeroPress take your pound of coffee and grind it to Espresso setting at a Grocery Store or when you buy your coffee have it ground to espresso. Or grind it home to the finest grind. It will make the richest most coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the French Press","review":"I've used a Press for a couple of weeks and always found the silt in the bottom to be off-putting.

Then this morning I couldn't find all the parts. In desperation, I dusted off the old Aeropress and made a cup.Yeah, it's a better cup than the Delonghi machine. Much better. Few home machines can really get the strong bitterness of real espresso right, and they cost hundreds. This one is less than $50.Really simple, probably the best bang for the buck coffee you can buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect little coffee maker for me","review":"I bought this a couple of weeks ago.

It works really well for making small amounts of strong coffee, so when I want a lot of coffee I stick to the regular coffee pot system.The quality of flavor you get is among the best I've ever tried. It seems like it requires a lot of grounds (I think two-ish heaping tablespoons to get maybe half a cup of espresso) but it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product that delivers","review":"Just like several reviewers here, I always try to extract the most flavor out of freshly roasted coffee beans. I like the fact that this tool produces very smooth and bold coffee. There is no bitterness nor acidity that is associated with a typical French press brew. It is nice that it is so portable and durable, so good coffee can always be brewed almost anywhere. This equipment is definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"no zippered nylon bag??","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of my Aeropress! I make myself a coffee with it almost every day and make coffee for friends with it all the time.

Unfortunately it's a gift and it has to be ready to give before I could get another one shipped to me.The zippered bag is inexpensive but mine has held up well enough. I use it when I take my press with me. I don't travel with the funnel or the stirrer... If I didn't have a zippered bag I would be shopping for a bag to go with it.It looks like some of the Aeropresses on Amazon DO come with a zippered bag and some do not. I assumed they all would.

This little thing hasn't made me a bad cup of coffee yet. Even with some Blonde roast coffee that I do believe is terrible, it made a nice cup of coffee. It won't do \\"espresso\\" or \\"french press\\" coffee, as those require specialized devices for proper extraction. This will, however, make a great cup of black coffee or an espresso-strength 2oz of coffee. Filters are cheap, the AeroPress is easy to use and clean, and you can have fun experimenting with water temperature, grind, and press time/force. I travel with this and use it at the office with an electric kettle. Easier and cleaner than pourover, and easy for other people to use, even for the first time. If you are already thinking about getting one, I highly doubt that you will regret buying one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as advertised","review":"I've given away more coffee brewers than most have ever owned.This unit does everything as good and as easy as I had hoped.

I like my coffee brewed by-the-cup by a skilled barista from beans whose origins are known to me. I'm from San Francisco, a lot of us are like this.I'm also pretty lazy at home. I've experimented with various coffee making techniques and machines, from expensive Krups automatic makers to French Press and a couple of different Chemex carafes. None of them hold a candle to my Aeropress coffee. It's almost a foolproof technique to a smooth, even, non-bitter, but bold cup of joe. I wish I had had one a long time ago.And at $25, it's a bargain. If you like coffee, you need to try one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple device for quality coffee","review":"I've been a fan of the 'french press' for quick espresso, but the AeroPress does that old device one better by keeping any hint of grounds out of the expressed coffee.

But I am the one laughing while they drink that \\"burnt water\\" from the breakroom.The plunger takes a little bit of effort to press but I figured I could use the exercise anyway.

Use a good quality coffee!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AeroPress Awesome","review":"I love this product! My husband has one cup of coffee, or latte like drink, a day and this is perfect for that. I simply make a shot of coffee, add hot milk and a little caramel syrup and he's off to work. Also when we have company and need a pot of coffee this works great for that as well. It's really easy to use, and clean and doesn't take up much space in the cupboard. Also it's great for traveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best coffee I've ever had!","review":"If you've heard about this product, believe the positivity. It is relatively simple to use (I say relative because obviously brewing a simple pot of coffee is easier). My fresh ground coffee made with the AeroPress has absolutely no bitterness, it just tastes good. I've never been much for coffee, just drink it for the jolt. I actually enjoy a cup of AeroPress coffee on the weekends. Once you buy this, you will be amazed. Coffee as good as a coffee shop without leaving home, and about 10% the cost.When it arrives, go to YouTube and look at videos for how to use the Aeropress. Different people grind the coffee and steep the coffee different for personal taste. Watch a few vids and try them all, then use the method you prefer.If you want to see a good review, look up Julio Ojeda-Zapata at the St. Paul Pioneer Press (Twincities.com). He did a review in 2011 that sums up the product very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for cold brew filtering","review":"I use a cold brew method for my coffee and I didn't want to have to make a special large grind for my French Press anymore. This little product does the trick, by allowing me to filter and press my cold mix made with a regular grind size. The bonus is there is no dust in the bottom of my cup. I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me...","review":"I have to agree with the others who gave this low marks. This device is too Mickey Mouse. It uses too much coffee, the water immediately started flowing through the filter the moment I poured it in giving me little time to stir much less push the plunger in, the water temperature was not hot enough, and in the end just too fiddly.This device would work much better with a U-bend somewhere in it so the water does not flow through right away and would give the user time to give a good push through. Overall a disappointment for me and I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flavorful","review":"Though I still prefer the stronger flavor and better mouthfeel of French Press coffee, this device works as advertised. I have not noticed any dulling or cloudiness to the plastic like I've seen mentioned in some reviews. Handwash only.Grind your beans the night before (you really do need a burr mill grinder for consistent grind) and toss some water in the microwave, and this only takes slightly more effort in the morning than a automatic drip machine. After you press the water through directly into your cup, you're left with a near solid puck of compressed grounds. Just pop it into the trash and rinse the plunger and cylinder in the sink, and away you go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"I had been wanting an espresso maker, but I didn't want an expensive, herky machine. The Aerobie Aeropress is perfect if you're an occasional espresso drinker, which I am. Easy to operate, easy storage and cleanup, and makes a great espresso. It's like a French press on steroids.

I was looking for something I could use at work that was easy and fast. This fits both of those categories. I work in a factory and I can't really leave out a plug in drip coffee pot because it would get dirt and particles in it. Before I found this, I was using a mini single cup drip-style coffee pot that I found at a local Vietnemese grocery store. It worked good, but would allow the occasional granual to pass through it's filter. The aerobie aeropress has the little paper filter in it, which works great.

This is no better than the old fashioned Melitta cone with paper filters. \\"No better\\" including taste. I used the Amazon \\"four for three\\" special which means that I would only get back about $5.00 if I returned this, so it's not worth the effort.

It's pretty good. But I get good coffee from my drip coffee maker. To make one cup of coffee you use the same amount at 4 cups of coffee from my drip coffee maker. And what a pain it is to make a single cup of coffee. Put a filter into the unit. Screw on the end piece. Add two scoops of coffee. Pour in water up to the 2 mark. Stir for 10 seconds. Push plunger into unit and slowly (30 seconds) until coffee is in cup. Add water to cup of coffee.If you think this is the way to make a cup of coffee,and don't mind using 4 times the amount of coffee, then this is the unit for you. Me?

Let me make one thing clear: THIS IS NOT A GOOD MACHINE FOR HIGH QUALITY ESPRESSO! If you want the most bang for your buck for espresso, pay another $115 and get the MyPressi which makes espresso rivalling the thousand dollar machines with good crema, etc. they way it is supposed to be.... so that leaves the evaluation as a coffee maker.... THIS IS NOT AS GOOD AS A FRENCH PRESS FOR MAKING COFFEE. 1) It only makes a partial concentrated cup that you have to dilute with additional hot water to get ONE (YES 1 MAX) cup of coffee. This is more of a gimmick than anything. Any french press will make better coffee and MORE of it. I did not expect a plastic toy when I ordered this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I tried this coffee maker, as it was hyped up in some article. it makes such little bits of coffee, you need to make several batches to even get a cup!

She wasn't impressed with the taste and the clean up wasn't that easy and one of the machines was continually clogging until it eventually broke. I thought I would give the Aeropress a try based on the reviews and at the very low price - I thought it wouldn't cost much if it was all hype. Now that we have used it for several months - we are extremly pleased. It makes great coffee easily and cleans up just as easily. I recently had some house guests stay with us and they raved about the flavor as well. The one item I would be aware of is that the coffee beans need to be a finer grind to get the full flavor.

I prefer espresso when I have the option, but I've been disappointed with less expensive home espresso makers. The AeroPress is about as simple as coffee making gets, and the results are as close to high-end espresso machines as I've ever tasted. I bought it based on good reviews, and I'm happy to report that those reviews were right on the money for my tastes. I would highly recommend the AeroPress to anyone who loves great coffee and simplicity, and all at a very affordable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye Starbucks","review":"Yay--perfect lattes with this little baby and the Bodum milk frother!

Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for making lattes","review":"I use this to make intense shots that are perfect for lattes. The biggest benefit is the lack of bitterness in the shot...using other methods, I would have to put lots of sugar in my coffee, but with the Aeropress I use very little sugar, if any. The product is very solidly built--I don't think I could break it if I tried. However, I did lose a part (the end cap) within a week of receiving my Aeropress, which was my own fault, but after an e-mail to Aerobie they promptly sent me a new end cap for only $5. This is a no-brainer purchase, especially since it will easily pay for itself if it can help you kick your $4 store-bought latte habit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best coffee ever","review":"I'll keep this short, and just say that the AeroPress makes the best coffee I've ever had. I am somewhat of a coffee snob, and love a good cup of joe. I have not used my fancy espresso maker since buying the AeroPress, as it makes wonderfully strong espresso, with no bitterness, and a nice crema, with little fuss. Buy one now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding cup of coffee!!!","review":"If you're reading this review, wondering if you should buy the Aerobie, and whether all the hype is true - stop now and purchase this coffee maker! That way you can get to drinking the absolute best coffee as soon as you can! I use the Hario MSS-1B Mini Mill Slim Coffee Grinder (its got its quirks, but is a great, inexpensive grinder) to grind the beans (try Stumptown or Cafe Mam). I've used a french press and a Krups espresso maker, and they really don't come close to the Aerobie. I think it has to do with the lack of acidity in the coffee that the Aerobie makes. I don't find a need to use sweetener or milk/cream, as the coffee tastes delicious as is. The other reviews give detailed instruction for use, but its fairly intuitive how to use the AeroPress - cleans easy, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as the fancy coffee shop!","review":"As others may have pointed out, You may have to experiment a bit to get the best results. This is what has worked best for me: Bring water in kettle to a boil on the stove. Take off kettle lid and let sit for about 1 to 2 minutes. I use a large 16oz cup for my coffee so I grind enough beans in my cheap grinder to cover the blades. After putting in the filter and spooning about 2 1/2- 3 scoops of coffee inside I pour the water ALL THE WAY to the top. Stir for about 15 seconds then I plunge for about 15 to 20 seconds, then top off with water and cream and stir. This last step was what was preventing me from getting a full rich flavor. Fill the water TO THE TOP before plunging. Now I have my perfect cup of coffee at home. My local fabulous coffee shop, where I buy the beans, misses me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The coffee lives up to what sounds like hype","review":"It is a bit of a ritual to use this process, but the coffee produced is well worth the effort.

When the grind is too fine (a traditional espresso grind) or when it contains lots of dust (having been ground too long in a blade grinder), the press is difficult to operate. Putting most of my entire weight on the plunger has been necessary, and that is not comfortable.The second is that when making more than 2.5 shots of coffee, it harder to get the flavor right (I think the water tends to flow too slowly).That being said, I do not regret my purchase at all, and it makes great tasting, strong coffee quickly, and is easier to clean than a traditional coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I won't bore you with an overly analytical review. For the money, this is a great little device. Makes great coffee, and decent espresso. As for it's longevity, I can't comment in detail other than to say it is very sturdy and substantial and appears to be well engineered. It is not flimsy! Much easier to clean than a French Press. For those who are worried about killing a small (very small) tree every time they use a paper filter and toss it, well, maybe you should just stick with your clunky old French Press or get the stainless steel filter for it, also sold by Amazon. This is a great travel coffee maker as well as at home. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"My experience","review":"I read alot of reviews.Decided to buy.When I first tried it I tended to agree with some of the reviewers that it filtered to much away. Was it the bitterness or acidity I was missing? I don't know.I know it made a really smooth cup of coffee. After a week I realized maybe it was the muddiness I was used to that I was missing. The Aerobie makes a nice clean cup of coffee. The bitterness or acidity I love is there its just not clouded by muddy residuals.I heat up my cup ahead of time in the microwave with some water.I've grown to like it.It produces a clean consitent flavor right down to the bottom.That flavor stays with you for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tasting Brew","review":"Makes a strong flavorfull brew of coffee, although technically it is not brewing. Esay to use and easy to clean up. Takes up no space and can be used for traveling if needed.

It really does take about 30 seconds to brew and the coffee is smooth and not at all bitter.

Good work Aerobie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super coffee every time","review":"I have had a decent quality (~$400) espresso machine, and a French press. The AeroPress is the one I go to.

It makes far better coffee than almost every coffee making device I have ever owned (including french press, electric coffee maker, stove top moka pot and several others), requires no countertop space, and is very easy to use.From expresso and lattes to regular coffee, I have been pleased with the results of this product and would recommend it without reservation.For optimum convenience, add a Zojirushi hot water dispenser for the countertop and you can make 2 cups of coffee ready in under a minute. The Aeropress/Hot water heater has made coffee so quick and simple in the morning that I have stopped getting coffee out in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would definitely buy it again.","review":"Bought this product because of the overwhelming positive reviews. Ditto. Would definitely buy it again. It makes an excellent cup of coffee WITH SOME EXPERIMENTATION. I like strong coffee and found a finer grind mandatory.It also took some testing to find the proper ratio of water to coffee. But with a little patience you will find a brew that your taste buds will really enjoy. It does take several times through the process to make it reasonably time efficient. I like to clean it after each use to remove the oil residue. That can be quite simply accomplished with a cup of hot soapy water a a clean paper towel. It travels easily and I intend to always have one available. I gave it 4 stars only because getting to a five star cup of coffee was not automatic but took some time to experiment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective plastic, silent customer service","review":"I got my aeropress three months ago and found it made good coffee. I like the individual serving idea. About two months later, the plastic on the inside of the cylinder started to break down, forming wrinkles on the inside of the vessel, looking lousy and causing me to wonder if it is or will begin leaching chemical compounds into my morning brew. I alerted the manufacturer to this via the email contact form on their website--twice--and heard nothing in return.So, despite the nifty concept and design, I have to rate this product poorly. In my case it has proven defective, and the company has declined to stand behind it."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth velvety coffee/espresso","review":"This crazy little thing makes amazing coffee and espresso.

I can make coffee like a pro with such simple equipment. Very happy with this device because it saves me a lot of money for Starbucks coffee and let me have a perfect cup of coffee anytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"great espresso","review":"This thing makes great espresso and it is inexpensive. It's that simple. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is plastic.

I bought this at a local mountaineering store and was flat-out blown away by the quality of the coffee it put out. No it's not the equivalent of a perfect shot made on a $8000 commercial espresso machine, but it's far better than anything you'll get from cheaper home espresso maker and a worthy replacement for both your drip brewer and your plunger pot.

If you put good coffee into the AeroPress, you'll get great coffee out. I use the same coffee in it as I use in my drip machine, and while it tastes good coming out of the machine, it tastes so much better coming out of the AeroPress. Well worth the money if you really enjoy coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use and clean, smooth coffee","review":"This well designed coffee maker is a cinch to use and the coffee taste smooth and not bitter, even with moderately priced coffee. Good for expresso, regular coffee, or lattes. Clean up is a cinch, you press the grounds into the garbage, rinse the bottom of the plunger and that's it. This makes better coffee than a French Press."},{"rating":"1","title":"The coffee is fine but. . .","review":"The coffee is fine but it is not worth the hassle. I was on the quest for the best cup of coffee to start my day. I heard someone raving about this maker and said I should give a try. I even bought the extra filters planning and hoping for the best. Results were disappointing. It is a cumbersome process for such a small amount of finished coffee. Boiling water, filter, stirring, pressing into a cup, adding more water, clean up rinse repeat. By the time I made a mug for my wife and I it just wasn't worth it. I ended my quest when I found a Saeco coffee maker with the thermal carafe. Life is good and so is my coffee. Grind, add water and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy","review":"My first review at Amazon. I have been shopping on Amazon for a few years and am usually pretty satisfied with my purchases. However, this is a piece of junk! The coffee tastes horrible and its nothing close to expresso. It is time- consuming to prepare and it is so unstable. I do not recommend this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot make crema","review":"The other reviews were right on....it is very hard to clean for just one cup of coffee. I have tried to create crema and no matter how hard I push (the filter will only allow it to flow so fast), I have not been able to get any crema. I detected no difference from a coffee press in favor and they are way easier to clean. So, in my opinion, it does not work any better than a cheap coffee press, which can be purchased for @ $6.00, but cost 5 times as much....I would not have purchased, given what I now know."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective! not the Aeropress I had before","review":"I am so disappointed. I switched to an Aeropress more than 5 years ago, and used the one we bought on Amazon almost every day without a problem. Eventually the rubber on the plunger didn't make as good a seal, and would leak coffee back up around it into the tube. So I ordered a new one here on Amazon. The new Aeropress is a smoky plastic with cup increments marked on it. Right out of the box we had problems. The hot brew water squirts back up around the rubber plunger, runs out the sides, makes a huge mess. It's a disaster. Really disappointed in the quality. And yes, we follow the directions as to grind and amounts and technique, we've been using one for years without any issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"AeroPress Coffee Maker","review":"Low quality for too high price very disappointed, must return you should reconsider offering this product, it is not a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"stick to a french press if you want good coffee.

Start with fresh, frozen beans, freshly ground and put straight into the Aeropress, and you have a coffee that can't be beat!

No bitter after taste. So much better than any other coffee maker that I have tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple product, great results","review":"While it takes almost as much work to use the AeroPress as it does to use a French press, the Aeropress consistently makes smoother, less acidic coffee. Cleanup is also easier. And compared to coffee made with a mass marketed drip machine or percolator, coffee made with the AeroPress is on another level. Despite the manufacturer's claims, it can't make a true espresso, but it comes pretty close and can definitely make a truly excellent Americano. I've stopped using my Cuisinart drip coffee maker - the 5 minutes of prep, brewing and cleanup with the AeroPress is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent cup at a time.","review":"A quick and easy way to make a cup of excellent coffee.

I must warn readers though, I'm not a coffee connoisseur. I do like espresso drinks and can easily use this every day to make a latte in just a few minutes. I use our Nespreso milk frother with it and they make a great combination. This Aeropress has a super small footprint takes up the same space as a pint glass in our cupboard. It's easy to use and easy to clean and makes decent coffee. I would definitely recommend giving it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"I'm a complete coffee novice. I've only recently developed a taste for it and decided I needed something to make coffee at home, rather than pay high coffee house prices. I didn't want anything that would clog up my limited kitchen space and something easy to use. I had read a lot and asked a bunch of my coffee drinking friends for ideas. In the end I decided on the AeroPress. I'm super glad I did.The AeroPress doesn't take up any counter space, when I'm finished I can put it in a drawer out of sight. It is easy to use, although it did take me some time to perfect the use of it. The thing to remember is that this makes shots of coffee/espresso that need to be added to either more hot water or milk before drinking. I started out making my coffee much too week. The directions included explain this better than I can, but once you get it figured out, it is fantastic.Clean up is super easy. Rinse everything off, wipe off the plunger and let it air dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aeropress is best!","review":"After many years of searching, this is the best coffee maker I've come across.

LOVE IT! Seriously, makes the best cup of coffee I've ever had. I made it has it recommends. Made a 2 shot espresso and then added water, like an Americano. I honestly didn't have super high hopes while using it, and then when I tried the coffee, I was shocked. Had to go around my office showing it off. If you want some thing quick and simple to make coffee, this is not the machine for you. However, if you want the best cup of coffee you've ever had and can follow instructions well, GET THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful enough to have around","review":"I tried using this thing as directed several times and was never terribly impressed with the results--still too acidic for my taste. I switched to merely using it as a filter for batches of cold-brewed coffee that have already been steeping for 24 hours and it does a really good job of keeping the sediment out of the cup.It's pretty tall and narrow which means it's pretty easy to topple with even a slight misapplication of pressure. This is a significant design drawback, but other than that it's reasonably sturdy. You definitely won't have to baby it the way you would a French press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even makes supermarket coffee taste fantastic.","review":"Bought as a gift for my sister-in-law and given to her in Florida at Christmas.

Espresso is not just coffee made very strong, which is what you get when you use this. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It produces great coffee as any press would when you use quality beans and filtered water, but it's a little misleading to call this an espresso maker. When I make espresso it has about 1/2 inch of crema floating on it. No crema, no espresso."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better, Better, Best","review":"My wife has used Bodum coffee presses and says that this is just plain the BEST way to make a good cup of coffee, period. this system is easy to use and clearly superior.

However, it uses a lot of grounds so is less efficient in that respect. I like that you can easily vary the strength of the coffee by adding more or less hot water without sacrificing the good deep flavor. It's well designed, seems sturdy, and the filters are reusable (for a few times), so one does save on filter costs. It's also faster than drip machines or pouring your own drip. I recommend it if you're searching for a richer alternative to yucky drip coffee taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.","review":"I have many different types of coffee makers from the big, very expensive espresso makers, to stove top espresso makers, french presses, grind 'n' brew coffeepots... you name it, I've tried it. This AeroPress is my absolute favorite. I love very strong coffee, and I'm able to make it as strong as I want with the AeroPress - - something the other makers just couldn't do. I simply use the \\"insta-hot\\" that's installed in my sink for the hot water. Making a cup of coffee in the morning is so easy and quick, and clean up is a breeze. Simply rinse everything off while you enjoy your first sip. My one hesitation was using so many filters, but thanks to another reviewer I now recycle my filters many, many times. The pack of filters that came with my original Aero-Press will last me a long time. Now I'm ordering another Aero-Press for traveling - -don't want to do without it, and it fits in my suitcase just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"One great press","review":"I have been using a french press for years and dealing with the mess.

Warm soapy water is all.- You will start roaring through coffee beans (Aeropress uses rougly 20g of beans a serving), so get a line a good bulk beans.- You'll want a burr grinder if you don't have one.You really can vary the flavor of your brew by changing the steep time and the water temperature, but if you want to skip the research, there is - seriously - a World Aeropress Championship from which you can snag somebody's winning technique.[...]Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent coffee!","review":"The AeroPress might seem a bit labor-intensive to anyone who's used to a typical drip coffee maker, but it does make really good coffee, one or two cups at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This press makes perfect espresso.

I've used a French press for years, always forgoing that last 1/2 ounce or so. But the aeropress makes that unnecessary. It really is as easy as the makers make it sound. I haven't tried espresso (not my thing anyway). The only complaint I have is the size. Just 2 ounces larger and it would be the right size for the coffee mug I use the most. Instead, I fill it to the #4, stir, wait until the water goes down to #3, then add more hot water. That sounds easy enough, but it isn't always clear (especially if you're using coffee to wake yourself up) where the water level actually is (versus the kind of coffee froth that forms when you pour the water in--if you've used this, you know what I mean). I've used this for about a month now, and I still don't have that down to a science. It's not a reason not to buy this--I'll continue to use it--but it might take a few weeks of trial an error unless you drink from a rather small cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, Tastes Great!","review":"After years of trying to get the perfect iced coffe in the morning, I found the AeroPress! So simple to use at work or at home (and easy to carry in one's bag when traveling). Like any coffee maker,though, the performance will also depend on which kind of coffee grounds you use. I have tried different brews, but I only need a couple of scoops of coffee with a strong espresso blend. So easy to make iced coffee in the mornings! Or hot coffee in the winter...much more versatile product than a regular french press. Strong coffee does not have the chalky-taste that strong coffee from a french press has.Overall, I give this product five stars.Easy to useBetter tasting coffee than french pressEasy to clean upVersatile (Can make iced coffee, americano, latte, etc.)Easy to CarryAffordableSo glad I ended up taking a risk and getting this instead of a french press!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much less acidic coffee...","review":"Basically in agreement with other reviewers.

I have used it every day for two months and am very very happy with it. However, to get best of it, you need a burr grinder and a hot water dispensing pot (such as Zojirushi CD-LCC30 Micom 3.0-Liter Electric Dispensing Pot).

It does take a fair amount of force to push the coffee through the filter.A couple other points: 1) this model does include filters, and 2) after looking all over the AeroPress trying to find its country of origin, I found a label on the box that says it's actually made in the United States. All the more reason to give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG I love it!","review":"What's not to like.

I've owned a couple of french press machines and have found the coffee was too strong for my taste. Aeropress makes a milder cup of coffee than the french press machines I've used. It's easy to set up and clean. But, it does use quite a bit of coffee to make a cup of coffee.With all of the gadgets I've purchased, big and small espresso machines, french press(es), coffee bean cookers, I still am inclined to use our Bunn coffee maker and grind Starbucks Verona coffee.

The coffee it make is absolutely no different than a french press, except with a french press the coffee has longer to steep. The aeropress doesn't even need to be plunged, it's basically a drip system if you leave it long enough. The final press does get you a little strong squirt at the end but made nearly no difference in the taste or bitterness. Additionally, it holds hardly any water, a french press holds plenty of water, makes several cups. I made several cups using aeropress, french press and coffee maker. I dislike coffee makers in general or any drip coffee, and the aeropress tasted just like the coffee maker.I would return this item if I hadn't already used it, you don't return something like that.

The minute grains do not get through the filter but that is a disappointment in espresso. The espresso quantities required to make a small double would consume a week's paycheck! Well, I exagerate, but I do better in other espresso gadgets. And coffee in a percolator tastes much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"Well I read all the reviews for this product and decided to purchase it. After I opened the box and looked at it the quality was really bad. Well I might be a little harsh but it just wasn't for me. It was way too small and the coffee didn't taste good. It just don't think it's worth it when you can buy one that holds the coffee in it for a while when boiling it. This releases all the flavor out and doesn't taste like watered down coffee. I returned and bought a $25-30 one and I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like arm-wrestling . . .","review":"Makes a nice smooth shot of espresso - but at the price of a sweaty arm-wrestling match combined with a chemistry lab experiment. You have to buy a digital thermometer, get the water temperature just right (not an easy feat, regardless of how you go about it), and then wrestle the plunger down, which takes closer to two minutes than the 20 seconds in the instruction guide, the darn rubber gasket is so tight. Which means the espresso is more bitter than it should be, due to the water sitting in it so long while you wreck your arm trying to get the plunger to go down without knocking the coffee cup over. I'm honestly surprised by all the good reviews here - it might be cheap, and if you can get it work right the coffee is good, but this is not an easy unit to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"aeropress - great, but a tad pricey","review":"I love this device as its the best espresso maker you can get under $1k. Better quality comes from the high in in-coffee house machines. home machines can't come close.I did not give it 5 stars for 2 reasons:-it is overpriced, for being several simple pieces of cheap injection molded plastic, with the addition of a rubber plunger and some numbers. The raw materials here don't even total $1. I could do this with some cheap lab equipment.-2...its really my problem...I bought filters thinking it didn't come with filters...now I have too many filters"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands-down, the best coffee ever!","review":"This is by far the best way to make coffee! I am a coffee-lover and a self-professed coffee snob. I have tried so many different kinds of coffee and different ways of brewing, and I can honestly say that this is hands-down, the best! I have used my aeropress everyday for the last several years - I even take it with my on trips - and I can't drink any other coffee now, including the pod brewers. Thank you, aeropress!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life","review":"Well maybe it didn't change my life, but this gave me a whole different appreciation of coffee that I never had before. I have a relatively sensitive stomach, and I usually have to dilute drip brews with lots of milk and sugar. After using the Aeropress with some middle-of-the-line coffee from the supermarket (the kind you buy bulk as whole beans, and I use a little grinder at home), this was amazing. The coffee is better than anything I've tasted before, and there's so little acid in it I can drink it black without any upset stomach. I'd highly recommend this to anyone and everyone. The only down side is that it takes me about 5 minutes to make a cup of coffee in the morning, but that's more than worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee with very little effort","review":"A very well designed product. Easy to make great tasking coffee, and the ease of cleaning up is even better. No more coffee grounds everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly good","review":"I absolutely love this coffee press. There are a few steps involved, but it is worth the extra effort. This is the first time I can truly appreciate a cup of coffee without having to visit the coffee shop. I will never go back to drip, there is no comparison. The drawback is that it requires a lot of grounds for the small amount that it brews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee but Will it Fail?","review":"I second all the other reviews about how good a cup of coffee you can make with this device and how easy it is. I may be an excessive coffee drinker, because I usually have 3 to 4 cups per day. I have had my Aeropress for more than two years and I still love it.But I have to point out one weakness. The cylinder in which you brew the coffee (not the plunger) has developed crackling on the surface for most of its length. This looks bad, and makes it more difficult to clean; it is developing a brown stain that wont come off. So far it has not had any effect other than cosmetic, but I expect some day it will crack through, and then It won't work anymore. I suppose I will replace it when that happens, but I suspect using a better grade of plastic in the manufacturing process would eliminate this flaw in an otherwise perfect product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best coffee ever!","review":"I consider myself a coffee snob and I was very skeptical of this device that looks like a medical implement - but wow. Talk about easy to use and makes excellent coffee with NO GRIT.

It now has a permanent place in desk drawer at work, and I may need a second one for home. Perfect for the office, as it's much easier to clean than a French press. It takes a little tweaking in terms of experimenting with how your favrite grind / type of coffee works in it, but well worth the initial investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great and lasts long time!","review":"Simple to use but be careful not to press too hard. I started to get some coffee grounds to leak through. Experiment with the stir times. I use one and a half level spoonfuls of coffee with boiling water and stir for about 40 seconds. I would definitely recommend this item to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Product!","review":"This is an amazing product! After some tinkering, we're drinking the best cup of coffee ever every morning. Several helpful hints, buy great coffee beans, grind them finely just before brewing, use two filters, wet them before putting in the fresh grounds. Stir for at least 15 seconds until you get a rich creamy brown foam before inserting the press. The components are well designed of high quality materials and seem to be destined for long lasting daily use. The Aeropress will truly change the way you feel about the a morning cup! It is the best value for a product we've ever purchased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not espresso","review":"Spent a couple of days trying. I really wanted it to work.

If you do not have access to an espresso macine and like to have an average cappachino or americana it will do a pretty good job.

WOW, I read one awesome review after another...to me when you have such a high # of reviewers and the review still stays as high as it is, its a no brainer-the product is amazing, at first it can look intimidating, but dont let looks deceive you! This thing is so quick and easy (cleanup especially-easier than anything Ive ever used...auto drip coffee maker or french press) and even if it wasnt, Id still use it because my morning cup of coffee is out of this world! I cannot reccommend this enough, although be warned, after having coffee using this method, you will undoubtedly turn into a certified coffee snob!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing cup of coffee!","review":"I've been a fan of the french press for the last 5 years and I can say that this is an adequate replacement for making my cup of coffee in the office. I just grab a hot cup of water from the coffee machine and bring the action to my desk. In less than 15 seconds I have my cup of coffee! The quality of the coffee is simply absurdly delicious!! If you're on the fence on buying this product... just do it! You'll enjoy a new dimension into your coffee drinking experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Works","review":"Six months and the AeroPress is still working great.

I don't like leaving old coffee in a coffee maker and clean up for the coffee makers and french presses can get tedious. I love this gadget. There's minimal parts, it's SUPER easy to clean, and it works like a champ. I love this press. I haven't had a whole lot of time to experiment with it but I'm excited for when I do. The plastic is durable, lightweight, all the parts look rugged enough to last for a long time with minimal TLC. I'm also deployed overseas currently and it showed up far sooner than expected. I would buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than a \\"press\\"!","review":"This device makes a SUPER espresso and/or cup of coffee! If you like or prefer a coffee press you MUST try the AeroPress. Seriously, you MUST!The finished coffee product tastes so much better than from a conventional press. Cleanup literally takes 10 seconds. It uses little paper filter discs but they are very cheap. Afraid you won't be able to find the filters in a year? $20.00 will buy 4 years of filters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste;","review":"The coffee comes out great tasting even if a little cooler than would like.Also making more than one cup is difficult to press out. Need to exert much effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Caffeine Maker!","review":"I've owned one of these for 2 years now, and I love it! I bought this one for my son who's leaving home soon. It's the fastest brew in my house, besides being a darn good cup of Joe. When I need to get out of the house - now - I can actually get my coffee from start to finish in less than 2 minutes . . . and it's good! I love the versatility - I prefer a strong brew, but others may prefer something a bit more liquid. With this wonderful press, you can definitely have it your way! It's easy, fast and does exactly what it says it will. How often do you find that today? Just a sidenote - it says that you can make the filters out of coffee filters cut to measure. Don't. Just go the extra little bit of money for the actual made-to-fit filters. They're worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked","review":"I've been drinking coffee out of my french press for years and thought I'd graduate to espresso. I bought an Aeropress because I couldn't commit to a full espresso machine. But now I'm hooked and I don't need an espresso machine. I don't even use my french press that much anymore. With this device, for just a couple bucks you get great tasting espresso strength coffee. Even though it's not truly 'espresso' it tastes just as good and my Aeropress lattes are better than the $4.50 version from the coffee shop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!!!!!","review":"Absolutely the best coffee ever!!! I just thought that I just didnt like coffee a whole lot b/c most of the time the coffee from our old maker was not very good to me. Then we got the Aeropress. Oh my lord I didnt know coffee could taste soooo good!! This little maker has alot wow factor. And its so easy to use. Great for taking on trips too. We have found that you can reduce the amount of coffee it takes(and it takes a lot,only downside-not much to complain about though)by cycling the coffee grounds you just used one more time if youre making a big pot and then we keep the coffee in a carafe. But then we dont like our coffee too strong so it works for us. You wont be disappointed at all!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cup of coffee ever","review":"I've had my Aeropress for almost two years and love it. It makes the best cup of coffee ever.It's easy to use. It comes with everything you need to measure, mix, and press.This isn't just a French Press, the coffee doesn't just filter slowly, it is made with pressure form the plunger, similar to an espresso machine. In fact, espresso from it is spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Espresso","review":"I agree with the other high ratings here. This very simple and well-designed unit makes great espresso. And you don't have to use an expensive burr grinder -- I've been grinding Peet's Espresso Forte beans in my old Braun rotary blade grinder with excellent results. Microwave some milk and you've got an amazing latte."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, weak tasting","review":"I was really excited to try this AeroPress, and was quite disappointed once I did! I don't understand why, but the coffee I made with it was very plain/watery tasting, regardless of how many scoops of coffee I added. I did, however, notice that caffeine made it through the filter, even if flavor did not as I was wired up unlike I've ever been before.I tried the recommended amount of coffee grounds, less coffee grounds than recommended, and more coffee grounds than recommended. I tried regular drip-brew grind and French press grind. I even had a neighbor brew a cup with his own coffee (he brewed side-by-side with his French press), and under every circumstance the conclusion was the same: the AeroPress makes a tasteless, boring, but definitely caffeinated cup of jo.I'm going back to my French press."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Finally Just Threw It Away","review":"I bought the Aeropress on the basis of the many positive reviews here on Amazon. I have been a French press aficionado for many years and appreciated the utterly simple design. But I've got to confess that I did my best to brew a simple good mug of fresh-ground coffee using the Aeropress but every effort was fraught with quirky, sloppy and ultimately unsatisfactory results. Why even employ the paper filter when the act of pressing the grounds through the cylinder circumvents that feature?Finally, I had to surrender to my own incompetence and tossed the whole shebang in the trash can. That felt pretty good, I must admit. Better than to keep it in some cupboard and be reminded of a regrettable purchase.Good luck. Most seem to have success with this device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes the best coffe","review":"I use this on weekends and when i am home from work. It uses a lot of cofffe but makes the best coffe out of any other coffee maker I have used expect $1K+ expresso makers, and this one doesn't cost anywehere near it.

Easy to Clean.","review":"I've wanted a quality coffee maker for a while, but the two things that have stopped me were the size of most coffee makers out there and the huge hassle of cleaning up traditional french press units. The Aeropress is really easy to use, even for a coffee novice for myself. It also cleans with a simple push to shoot the grounds into the trash. It doesn't take up much space, but since there are several parts to it I wish I had gotten the version that comes with a little stuff sack.Also, check out this youtube video demonstrating the inverted method. I was skeptical at first, but I think it makes a much better tasting cup of coffee: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't perform as expected.","review":"I bough this with the anticipation that it would make great single serve cups of coffee. Despite following all the troubleshooting suggestions, the water quickly drained (did not even need to apply pressure to the device) and left me with weak coffee. I tried doubling the filter, and even adding more grounds, but was not satisfied with the item. Perhaps I got a defective unit? I returned it, got a Keurig single server, and am pleasantly happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful way to make coffee","review":"Okay, so here's the deal: there's no universal standard on what makes a good cup of coffee. No matter what way you do it, you always have to start somewhere and adjust to your taste. You have your standard (recommended) ratio of 60 grams of coffee to 1 liter of water, and I find--to my taste--that works for me. That ratio works out to be 15 grams of coffee to 250 ml of water, which makes a very tasty 8 oz cup of coffee.You can brew a stronger cup (more grounds) with the intention of diluting with hot water, but I find I don't care for this. To each their own. The AeroPress itself is great: easy to use, easy to clean and whether you're using the paper filters or one of the steel mesh filters, I'm pretty sure you're going to get some great coffee out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product.","review":"I like good coffee, but haven't ever spent much on making it myself.

I use an electric kettle, and use the hot water once it comes off the boil. (I've found that having hot water off the boil is key to having good coffee out of the Aeropress).It's good if you're a single cup coffee drinker, but it can be a little slow to make enough coffee if you're serving guests. It also travels well, in case you're in a country that doesn't have very many coffee shops, and you need your coffee fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple, easy and good coffee","review":"I had coffee made with this press at a Bike coffee shop.

If you coffee cups has little cracks, you might shatter it with the pressure required for a few minutes to make the coffee.Also their scoop that make one little cup of coffee, and I can make 6 cups of coffee in the Espresso Inox stove top maker.

Has everything you would need, just read the directions, do a couple of practice runs, and play around with the temp of the water and the bean you are using. Some like it at 200, some at 175. First thing I did was find the temp that the bean tasted best at and then practiced it on my microwave so I know exactly 1 min and 45 seconds gives me water thats 175 so I have one less step to do in the morning. The last thing I did was grind a weeks worth of beans. This way I get up, pop in the water, pour the grind in and go. Very easy cleanup. I am used to taking apart a Bialletti every morning, sometimes 3 times a morning. This is soooooo much easier! No burnt after taste on my espresso, now I just have to figure out how to get the crema.

I usually wakeup late so the drip works on weekdays, but weekends I always reach for this. Makes a bit less strong than expresso, but keeps a clean and bold flavor I like. Personally I only would use it for expresso type and latte, as americano just tastes not right. Thats just me personally though. Think overall my favorite thing about this is how very clean the coffee is, there is no residue and very little acidity from the oils, making it my perfect little device when I want something better than drip."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"I read the other reviews prior to purchasing this and was completely sold on it.

I have several types of coffee makers, but this has become my favorite every since I bought it several months ago. It produces a smooth, balanced taste with no bitterness and brings out the flavor of good coffees. It gives the rich taste of a French press, but those are messy and have cancer risk apparently eliminated by paper filters. The only downside is that it takes more coffee to make a strong cup, but in the larger scheme of things even really good coffee is inexpensive. When making, I use a fine grind and let it sit for a few minutes after adding boiling water and stirring and always fill hot water to the top to squeeze out more taste, but each to their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well.","review":"This coffee maker makes a very good cup of coffee. I have a Cuisinart coffee maker that I really love, and the Aerobie makes coffee that tastes about as good as the Cuisinart. The Aerobie is easy to use and the directions supplied with it are well-written. I recommend that you experiment with the variables involved until you find what works best for you. That is, experiment with the amount of coffee used, temperature of the water, the amount of stirring, etc.I don't think the Aerobie will be my main coffee maker, but I can definitely see me taking it on trips, where I would not take a big coffee maker. It would be convenient to take camping, too, I think. There's no power requirements with the Aerobie; all you need is a way to heat some water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee, easy to clean","review":"I've tried all of the usual methods of brewing coffee and the areopress is as good as it gets. It is designed to brew a cup at a time but I've brewed up to four by just adding more coffee. When using an espresso grind, the press can be hard to push, but thats how espresso is made, under pressure. I get a fine creama head and satisfying results. It may not be as good as a $300 machine but for the price its a great value. Additionally, it is easy to set up and clean, once you push the puck through, you rinse and your ready for the next cup. Filters are reusable for about 5 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy, inexpensive way to enjoy gormet coffee!","review":"I purchased one of these after doing much research on the internet.

I am so glad I went the route of the Aeropress Espresso Maker, I wake up every morning now to a gormet coffee shop in the comfort of my home. The Aeropress makes delicious espresso or add a little hot water for American coffee. I also purchased the Aerolatte Milk Frother (wonderful item, works like magic) so in less than 5 minutes I have a delicious latte or cappuccino.

When I first received the horse for my 9th birthday, I looked at it and said, \\"Man, this is the best Breyer horse I've ever seen! It's a dancer in a daydream!\\" Then when I went to a horse auction with friends, I saw a horse like the model and I whispered to one of my pals, \\"Isn't the ugliest thing you've ever seen?\\" Then, I thought of the Breyer model. I imagined if I washed and trained this mud-pony, it would look as beautiful as the model. I bid a thousand dollars and the horse, named Mudman at the time, was all mine. Now I regret ever saying that Dancer was ugly, because if you could look at him run, you'll agree with me that he is a dancer in a daydream. What I'm trying to tell you here is this horse is such a inspiration. A gift to any horse lover out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reproduced photo quality","review":"I rec'd the item quickly, well packaged and in excellent condition however... the reproduction of the photo was strange and purplish.

Let's just say you bought all the grimoire series along with their instructional counterparts. Maybe, it'll cost you $120.00. There's a hell of a lot more information stuffed into these books than 2 hours of private tutoring. Stop being such tightwads, and take these videos for what they are, something to help you understand the book more.P.S.- Everybody learns differently. For some, reading the book alone is the way. For others, accompanying the book with the video makes it easier. At any rate, the \\"Grimoire Series\\" are the most thouroughly comprehensive books available at any cost, and I recommend them to everyone who plays guitar from novice to pro.

Had LaToya had better management and remixed a few of the songs, I think it would have given her career the boost it desperately needed. The two highlights are \\"Turn On The Radio\\" and \\"Tell Me She Means Nothing To You\\". Had they been remixed, \\"Such A Wicked Love\\", \\"You're Gonna Get Rocked\\", and \\"Ain't Nobody Loves You\\" would have been better songs. \\"You Blew\\" and \\"Just Say No\\" should have been scrapped.With all of her albums, there are usually 2 or 3 good songs on each that could put her on the charts, but sadly the wrong songs get picked as lead singles and therefore the albums suffer and die a quick death."},{"rating":"2","title":"4th Disciple beats","review":"As music, this album is 5 stars. 4th Disciple and True Master are hip hop's greatest producers.

Anyway, there's a lot of war propaganda samples and Kubrick's \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" and a lot of war conspiracy rhymes which is more interesting than thug rap. But Killa Sin keeps the album tight, rap-wise. His flow is great... Yeah, he sounds like Raekwon, but he's better.

The beats on this album are so good, I don't even care that the lyrics are kind of lacking. Before this album, I never would have said that anything could be improved with less involvement from Rza, but that's my opinion here.His two beats are some of my least favorite. A warning, though; while 9th Prince shines on the mic and Killah Sin and Dom Pachino are ok, the rest of the rapping is forgettable, and can get old quickly.

I like Spke and Dru on the series and wanted to like this book but it was not readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spike and Dru","review":"I love Spike and Dru! This book was one of the best Buffy books i have read. I loved the way the author protrayed the way that Spike would do anything for Dru. This made the book more enjoyable.One good thing was it had few characters. in most Buffy books, thre are extra characters that make it difficult for you to keep all the different storylines straight.This book takes place long before Spike and Dru came to Sunnydale and that is good because the show is talking about the history and now you get to experience first-hand (with the exception of \\"Fool For Love\\") the the way these charcters were in the past and that they really did have a life before they had met Buffy.All in all i loved this book. i would recommend it to anyone who likes Spike and Dru and Buffy books in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough Spike & Dru!","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Buffy series and Spike is my favorite character. I was very excited to see there was a book written specifically for his character with insight into his life prior to Sunnydale.Although the setting is interesting (1940's - World War II), this book tends to have way too much detail about the Slayer, potential-Slayers and their Watchers (along with miscellaneous demons) and not nearly enough about Spike and Dru. They almost seem like secondary characters!Basically it wasn't what I expected. I was looking for a more intimate detail of their relationship and life together and they were barely even in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan Novel gold","review":"Great story, perfect characterizations of the Buffyverse's fave vampire couple, and even some Watcher's Council action... where the council members actually have to get off their butts and fight for a change (instead of hiding behind little girls as per usual).

Christopher Golden rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good look at the Big Bad...","review":"This is definitely one of the better Buffy books to come along. The focus on Spike and Drusilla is especially intriguing and Golden fills in a good part of the blanks in the two characters' history (alas, a recent episode of Buffy contradicted some what Golden wrote).Positives: the nice insight into the Slayers and Watchers of the era, Golden's ability to make Spike and Dru entertaining, if not likeable by any means, during most of the novel.Negatives: a pair of related historical gaffes (Sweden and Switzerland under Nazi occupation in WWII - is the Buffyverse an alternate history?) and the graphic and frequent descriptions of Slayers being killed by Spike and Drusilla.Overall, this book is definitely worth a look for Buffy fans. 3/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Spike-Book!","review":"As a BtVS fan, and especially as a great Spike-Fan, this book was absolutly wonderful! It is not, in the strictest sense, a Buffy book, as it happens almost 50 years before Buffy's birth, but it incorporates alot of the show's mythology. As the title says, it's all about Spike and Dru and they're violent, destructive, yet wonderful relationship.The only problem I had about the story, was the lack of continuity, when Spike killed Sophie Carstensen, the slayer. It has been mentioned on the show several times that Spike has killed 2 slayers, not 3. This story twist did disappoint me a bit, but not enough not to enjoy the book.All in all it is a very violent, gory novel, but with Spike and Drusilla as the main characters this should be anticipated. I enjoyed reading about Spike in his evil days and also how his love for Drusilla showed (how he's always the \\"fool for love\\").Very good read for any Buffy/Spike fan, who enjoys the wicked side of the \\"Big Bad\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed Buffy fan","review":"I know that Spike and Dru are evil and vicious, but some of the descriptions of the deaths were a little too graphic for me. Also, on the TV show, I like Spike and Dru. I did not like them in this book. And I got tired of being introduced to characters, fairly fleshed out characters, only to see them die. Plus a major even in the end is not consistent with the TV series (Spike has only killed two slayers - a Chinese girl during the Boxer Rebellion and Principal Wood's mother - here he kills another).

Terms like 'accrual basis' and 'dividends' are suddenly announced, without any prior explanation. I bet the author is a great CPA, and extraordinarily smart. But there is no way this book was tested the way it should've been: by handing it to an otherwise savvy business person with no accounting experience, and WATCHING them read the book to see if it made any sense, and where they got hung up.

But when Commissar Ibram Gaunt and his team arrive, liberation is not in their Orders. Gaunt's team is to have the Resistance lead them deep into Chaos territory. There, they must locate and rescue a high-ranking Imperial officer that has been captured. This must be accomplished before the enemy manages to break through the officer's mindlock. Otherwise, the rescue mission becomes an assassination.**** This is the first novel of \\"The Lost\\" series involving Gaunt's Ghosts. Judging by this story, the series will be a winner. (This series is part of the Warhammer 40,000 universe.) At times the story slows down, but readers will not find themselves becoming too bored. I found myself fascinated as the officer's story began to unfold and I learn WHY Gaunt's mission is so vital. All-in-all, a very good read. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable miltary SF book","review":"Another enjoyable book in this series, as usual abnett produces credible and competent villains, maybe less so than usual.

Nothing which precedes this book in the timeline can really prepare you for the savage capabilities Gaunt's team must find within themselves if they are to survive their mission. In hindsight, perhaps it is only when you read \\"His Last Command\\" that you can truly appreciate the full impact of the events in \\"Traitor General\\" and the effect it has on all the Tanith and other men and women who follow Ibram Gaunt to Hell...or worse.

In this one, Abnett changes things up some. The other novels usually take place in a big \\"set piece\\" battlefront, with large clashes between huge groups of soldiers. This time around it's more of a commando \\"behind enemy lines\\" operation with Gaunt taking the elite of the elite from his company to perform an assassination.

I tried to make it again using this book and it did not work.For the marble pound cake, the instructions indicated that a double recipe would work in a 10 inch bundt. There was way too much batter - so much that it would not even fit in the pan so I used about 2\\\\3 of the batter. Also, the instructions called for twice the amount of cocoa in the chocolate part than should be suggested. If I had used the suggested amount, I would have had pound cake mixed with brownies. Finally, the temperature suggested was too high for a cake that dense. The top burned and the center was raw when I removed it from the oven.

The Marbled Pound Cake was dry beyond belief, and half of the Fudgy Chocolate Cake remained stuck to the bundt pan, despite proper buttering and flouring. When I made it a second time in another pan, it was still difficult to remove because it was so fragile.It's a shame, because that same fudgy cake had delicious batter, and some of the ideas are fabulous.

I have tried other recipes in this book for cakes with poor results as well.

All the more so if the edition is in English and the original in French. This proves a glaring lack in the case of Penguin's The Man in the Iron Mask; it lowers my opinion of the usually competent publisher. Without notes, translator Joachim Neugroschel finds himself at odd moments inserting the original French in brackets. The translation is less than successful in other ways as well. Neugroschel uses intrusive colloquialisms (\\"C'mon\\" and \\"Were they gonna shoot us?\\") and worse yet mixes them with graceless versions of Dumas's formal sentence structures (as in the terrible reply \\"It was I who was gonna shoot you.\\") Really, how did a publisher like Penguin let this get to press?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Apparently there was another book in the D'Artagnan series, Son of Porthos, which was not translated into English.

After TTM I wouldn't really have been pushed to read any more Dumas, but I saw two film versions and wondered how they could be so different. Now I see that it's because TMITIM doesn't really deal with the king and his brother at all. Just another story about those musketeers. And it really is such a good idea. I usually never recommend this, but watch one of the films (I love the oldest one) instead of reading the book.

The man in the mask is actually a very minor charactor in the cast. He hardly matters at all except as a way for Aramis to display his cunning and the loss of his loyalty to his fellow Musketteers.

However his will soon have to make it's way to the garbage as it doesn't hold the air anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderately Appealing","review":"This disc has some decent songwriting and overall, it's a good listen. But the general feel of the album is amateurish and poorly produced. There are parts where instruments seem to pop out of nowhere. One song ends with a sustained guitar chord that cuts out and then back in. It's like the player accidentally hit his pickup selector and then switched it back. And throughout the album, the vocals float above the mix in a rather distracting manner. You can definitely 'hear the studio' in this mix.The guitar work rarely rises above mediocre and some of it is down rightunfortunate. All-in-all, I'd pass on this one and wait for the next effort from this promising, but immature artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"why buy from this guy","review":"just getting around to this review. when I purchased the cd it was worthless and I set is aside and forgot about it.

This CD is everything I had hoped for. Beautiful ballads, a few rocking tunes, a diverse mix of styles, and all tied together by Jason's funny, smart and wise lyrics. Anyone who loves real music needs to hear Jason Isbell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, but it's all over the place........","review":"A great CD, of course with the DBT heritage, you knew it would be good....but it borders on brilliant. At first, it seems a bit all over the place, different type of music demonstrated throughout....even the singing approach seems varied from different tracks....but the end result as a whole is an incredible work that showcases even more talent than was already known. Highly Recomended for fans of musicianship and creativity bordering on art. I also recomend the new Poi Dog Pondering '7' CD as well for another interesting journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Debut!","review":"Jason Isbell is wise beyond his years and one hell of a guitar player. He writes intelligent songs that contain absolutely NO BS! His work with the Drive By Truckers would have been an excellent musical contribution for a young artist. \\"Sirens of the Ditch\\" is the next level for Isbell and he proves that he is more than able to stand on his own. He delivers a classic album his first time out. A \\"must own!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album","review":"New to Jason and the band, reminds me if Steve Earl and the Allman Brothers. Pissed in missing their concert at Lincoln Hall in Chicago. Highly recommend this live performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique and personal view of collecting","review":"This is an extraordinary book. Clearly not intended as a scholarly exercise, the authors take us up close and personal with outstanding collectors and their art. These are people I would be unlikely ever to meet, and their personal views and how they are expressed through the works they surround themselves with provide a glimpse into the collecting mind. Many of the homes are wealthy, though some are artists who have accumulated works from their friends. The photos are spectacular, and give many ideas of how art can be integrated into one's home."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Home With Art Not Your Home","review":"Diving into this book, as an avid art collector, one might expect to learn how different people work with the art they possess. This book though is really for those who are stricly ardent and almost excessive collectors who like to jam pack their residences with works galore. What is missing from this text is a careful presentation of how many different types of people display their art. There is too much focus on furniture, collecting passions and interest, and not enough focus on ideas. Overall, I found this book to be somewhat mono-dimensional in the concepts portrayed of how others live with their art. More a picture of what the authors had preconceived than a search for the spectrum of ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story suspenseful but editing was poor","review":"The story was very good and suspenseful. I enjoyed the book very much and would recommend the book. The only problem was the editing for the ebook. At least half the book didn't have a period at the end of a sentence. If the beginning of each sentence hadn't been capitalized, it would have been very hard to read. There were many words misspelled as well.Patricia Potter has been together a good story with good characters. Hopefully, someone will go back and clean up the ebook version."},{"rating":"2","title":"pen works great!","review":"I got this pen because it is thinner and also slightly lighter than the grip pen. The pen works great!The reason for the 4 star is because the color looks transparent red in the picture and what I received was a non-transparent dull brownish color pen so it is definitely less attractive than what it looks like on the picture. Also because I kind of miss the grip rubber feel which this one does not have... nonetheless, a great pen :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"too skinny, not what i expected.","review":"pen is skinnier that the pen that comes with the wacom tablet. it is not the one I'm trying to replace.

The pen itself is 5 stars as I've used it before. But where on earth is my order? First I ordered the other classic platinum pen. That took ages to ship out and therefore I canceled the ordered and bought this one. It shipped out 2 days after. I've used their super saver shipping before but honestly it's really slow now. Why not simply use USPS instead for small orders like these?While I really want an explanation why they are using UPS and also why they report a shipment is out for delivery since 7:42am but is STILL rescheduled for next day, I'm not optimistic I'll get an answer. I needed this pen a while ago and was skeptical of the overnight shipping from amazon (bad experience) but now their super saver is slacking off as well.I'll reconsider ordering from amazon again for time sensitive items until such shipping issues are resolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"tomistic appraisal of 20th century thinkers","review":"This text will help you understand modern philosophers of the 20th century--existentialists, Heidegger, Sartre, Dewey, etc. What is nice about the St. Louis U text is that it provides a flow of critique on philosophies that leave out a proper understanding of BEING--in a Thomistic and Aristotelian sense. Consider this an addition to Etienne Gilson's Unity of Philosophical Experience. This covers the rest of the story and updates us on post-Kantian thinkers.

It's functional decorative and matches my other fiestaware"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute but Dribbly","review":"Great color, this lemongrass (celery green - my term) set brightens up your breakfast table & goes perfectly with your other Fiesta Ware. Just a note - the creamer dribbles after you pour. It's a design flaw not a defect peculiar to my set. So if you don't want your Irish linen table cloth dribbled on, try a different creamer. I'd buy it again; the cute factor overrides the dribbles. Besides, who uses Fiesta Ware in a formal setting? Just wipe the placement and you're good to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"LID COLOR was not right","review":"Anxiously awaited this item. It came quickly and packaged nicely. It was great execpt the sugar LID color isn't quite right . It is not the exact lemongrass match. It is like a slightly faded lemongrass color with a something like a peach glow about it( that's the only way I can describe it). At first glance the set looks great until after awhile the imperfection of the lid color kind of haunts you and you zoom right in on it every time you walk past.I tried to file for some kind of replacement but my only option was to PAY Amazon a fee for restocking or reshipping or whatever..... Which I found utterly ridiculous since they were the ones that sent me the set with the crazy lid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Set!","review":"I've been thinking about getting this set for quite some time, and it is very hard to find in stores, so when I saw it on Amazon, I had to get it. The price was great for the quality, each piece is heavy and solid, and the color is a very nice (and fun) shade of green. The color turned out to be only slightly darker than shown in the photo, and is not the bright neon sort of green shown in some of the other shamrock-colored Fiesta products on Amazon. I highly recommend this set, but I do not recommend putting Fiesta products in the dishwasher as the color will fade."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"I gave this product 4 stars, only because when unwrapped for Christmas, the small handle on the sugar bowl was broken off. I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my mom, who loves Fiestaware - I got a refund and purchased a new set, which was perfect! I was really pleased with the amazon staff for helping me get a new one and my money back for the broken one. My mom gave me the original set, I superglued the handle on and it looks almost brand new!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee, tea, sugar and more sugar!","review":"Sadly, I was VERY DISSAPOINTED by my Fiesta Covered Creamer and Sugar Set with Tray from Amazon Warehouse Deals. I guess if it is too good to be true...well, you know the rest. I know mistakes happen, but seriously- 2 sugar bowls? Did they not think I would notice? Yes, I was sent 2 sugar bowls and no creamer.

It was a total waste of my time:("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased","review":"I ordered this sugar/creamer with a butter dish -- ordered BOTH in Cream Color and they came in TWO DIFFERENT COLORS!!

I am returning the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy!","review":"I was so looking forward to this sugar and creamer set to go along with all of my other Fiesta pieces. Packaging was terrible. I'm surprised it got to me in one piece. Not packed well at all! Upon looking over my pieces there is a gummy, glue residue all over them. Even after washing. AND I now see a big chip on the rim of the creamer! Its the first and last time I order my Fiesta pieces over the internet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking set","review":"Purchased Covered Sugar & Creamer Set in Cobalt. Set looks nice on kitchen counter. Sugar bowl is smaller than my china sugar bowl, but this just means I refill it every 2 weeks instead of every 3 weeks or so. Only complaint was packaging for shipment. The bowl and creamer were shipped without any protective padding between them and the tray, which resulted in scratches in the tray. The scratches were disappointing, but not bad enough for me to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but poor design","review":"Let me start by saying that I love Fiestaware and always get a thrill out of buying a new piece for my collection. This set was no exception. I thought it would be nice to finally have a pretty everyday set so we could retire the diner-style sugar pourer and wouldn't have to pour our milk straight from the carton. Unfortunately the pieces are thoughtlessly designed. It is impossible to pour the cream without it dripping, no matter how careful we are, and the sugar bowl should have a cutout for the spoon. I'm giving two stars for it's utter cuteness, but this is a kitchen utensil and should be more functional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helped me beat the Inkblot test","review":"I read this *years* ago, and ended up sort of memorizing what to look for in the Rorschardt (spelling?)

I was very disappointed. I am sure the fact that the book was written twenty years ago contributes to my disappointment: many subjects present only nostalgic value for some people and mostly outdated. Don't look for revelations - the author is mostly speculating on the subject (secrets mostly will stay secrets). In our time much more and better information could be found on the Internet. I gave it two stars just for some historical data that I found sometimes interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under Par","review":"I really didn't like these books. Some of the information is obviously wrong.

Most \\"secrets\\" revealed are trivial nonsense and quite a bit of the book is outdated.The section on Freemasonry is VERY deceptive.

I realize this is a cheap microphone, but I had a $5.00 mic that was better. The noise canceling is about on par with Koss' M-18, which is to say that it doesn't really cancel noise.The main problem with the mic is that it gives some sort of popping sound every 2-3 seconds (not the actual mic, but during recording). Also, the mute switch doesn't stop the pop. I've tried this microphone with 3 different computers with the same problem. I would really give this a 1/2 star review if I could. It gets the bare minimum done, but it doesn't cost the bare minimum.Buy the Logitech USB Desktop mic instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice analog microphone, unfortunately...","review":"It worked great the first few days but now it is picking up alot of static. I traced the problem to my laptops microphone jack. So even though this is a good microphone, is quality can be affected by its connection. My experience is that microphone jacks are not reliable when used for an extended period of time. I had to upgrade to a USB microphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLANTRONICS MICROPHONE","review":"I bought this microphone to use with internet telephone.

The unusual mix of voices, sounds and the somewhat \\"fuzzy\\" tracks in many of the songs reminds me of hearing music - loud - from a passing car. A strange ambient sort of deal. I highly recommend Los Lobos' \\"Collosal Head\\" if you like this one. Also worked on by Froom and Blake, it has a similar groove to it, and it's interesting to note the Cesar Rosas influence on \\"Collosal Head\\" that is replaced with more sampled sounds on \\"Dose\\".

Even low-brow humour requires some degree of subtlety and context to work, and those things seem mostly absent in this movie. It's also disappointingly uneventful, so much of the movie is set in the one house where not much progresses. I was hoping the guys' schemes would involve some detours to introduce additional environments and characters, but it never happened. The movie is generally pretty dark too, drawing a lot of it's gags from murder attempts. I guess it's a black comedy, but it's not marketed as such. I think it's inconsistent about what it wants to be. Trust the 7 out of 9 negative reviews on this site and don't waste your time with this movie, unless you enjoyed Big Momma's House."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Funny, Unless You're A Stupid Person","review":"Ok first off the movie cover is a lie. That Nikki chick (blond on the cover) is barely in it at all. Yes you see her boobs, but American Wedding already brought us that joy in a much better way. Most of if not all the stars are annoying, if not unlikeable. And through the whole movie the Two guys are with Two nasty old ladies. (I found the fat one apsolutly disgusting) Really by not watching this you're not missing out on anything! This movie could have been good, but it swurves away from the basic plot way two much.

But this along with others National Lampoons flick belong at the bottom of the garbage bin. I rented this about 3 years, and I don't know what I was thinking. I thought it was going to be a funny flick, but it was a campy flick. What made it so campy was that They had Will Friedle dressed up as a baby during a sex scean along with that crapy lollypop song that I can't get out of my head. What other National Lampoons movies can take a turn for the worst. The one thing I owe it to is Actor J.J cole, the black guy who plays the minster, and give the best advice at the end, and that is don't watch the ending because it gets creepy.

For the price of Nordic Pure vs 3M, if it was a little too small, I would get the Nordic Pure filter and add a strip of firm foam tape to the edge and save a lot of money. The ACTUAL/EXACT size of this Nordic Pure filter is listed so someone can make sure they order the correct size. Not all HVAC equipment has the same filter housing so the nordic filter can fit great for other people, like me. Use a tape measure to get the real size of your current filter and compare to the actual size of the filter you are thinking of buying. The size printed on the filter may NOT be the exact size. Amazon lists the details a little further down on the screen so scroll down to see the exact size of any filter you are thinking of getting.

It arrived in fairly good time, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. However, the toy I paid for was the toy in the picture, and what I got was a somewhat cheap toy with loose seams and no character whatsoever. The toy is cheaply made, and I feel like the arms will come off any second. It's an expressionless toy, with no posing ability. It's essentially made of felt, which is not what was promised. I feel like I was cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's one to watch","review":"This is a terrific album. The songs have a great beat and Kiuldret can really sing.

It's good traveling music, if you're on the way home from work and need a little pick up. \\"Standing Out In a Crowd\\" is one of those songs that will grab you if you a miserable childhood (or if you thought you did.) I would recommend the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"I have waited so long for this CD and I was sickened when I popped it into my player the first day it went on sale. There is not a song on the entire disc that I could even remember the melody five minutes after hearing it. The exception being \\"Georgia Rain\\", of course, and that's only because radio has played it into the ground and sort of forced us to like it by default. Usually I find myself humming Trisha songs for weeks after hearing them but not this time. Maybe this is just a warm-up for the real thing. Hopefully she'll be back with her soaring ballads on a new CD very soon now that she's back in the music mode. I'm truly bummed. Trisha is my all-time favorite singer but she sure didn't rise to the occasion this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short...","review":"This album falls short of Trisha Yearwood's incredible voice.

The other song that really hit me was \\"Trying to Love you\\" but the blance of the cd songs like \\"pistol\\" and \\"It's Alright\\" are nothing special. Yearwood still sounds great, but all in all far from her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST Female Vocalist","review":"While Martina and one or two others may give Trisha a run for her money in the belting-it-out department, no one comes clothes to the richness, depth, and emotion she gives to her songs. 'Georgia Rain' is a simple, beautiful ballad about young love. 'Trying to Love You' is an equally beautiful song about the complexities and hardships of relationships. 'Pistol' and 'Sweet Love' are at the other end of the spectrum....sassy,sexy numbers with a honky-tonk style. Trisha does it all so well. This CD is one you'll play again and again.I Also Highly recommend SONGBOOK - a 5-star collection of earlier hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Perfection","review":"Trisha Yearwood's new album \\"Jasper County\\" is gorgeous. Every single song on here is pure perfection. Her vocals soar on \\" Give Me Something Good\\", and the majesty of her rendition of \\"Georgia Rain\\" is something special to behold, it truly is. Trisha Yearwood is one of the best dang country stars there ever were and she will be around forever becuase she is timeless. Trisha Yearwood is beautiful on this record, good for fans of the legendary Faith Hill, country sweetheart Leeann Rimes, and beautiful singer songwriter Corinna Fugate."},{"rating":"1","title":"No love for the fans","review":"I am a big fan of Trisha's music so I bought this CD the first week it came out. I played it once or twice but it just didn't click with me the way her others did. Of course now that she is married to Garth Brooks she has to employ the same marketing gimmicks that he does to get people to buy the same CD more than once. It really irritates me when artists do not take their fans into consideration and add a song to a CD after hundreds of thousands of people have already bought the CD. It's not like you can just buy the one song on iTunes because it's not available. This will most likely be the last CD I ever buy from her. I stopped buying Garth Brooks' music after he re-released every CD he'd ever recorded with a new song on it or with new cover artwork. Enough is enough... artists need to stop making their money off the backs of the working people who need to buy the same CD's multiple times to get the songs they hear on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not impressed","review":"The only song worth listening to on this cd is \\"Georgia Rain\\" the rest of it couldn't even interest me. I took it back to the store the next day. I was so dissappointed in this album and I couldn't wait for it to come out. The lyrics to some of the songs were good like \\"Trying to Love You\\" and \\"River of You\\" but the music was all wrong. The song \\"Who Invented the Wheel\\" is just dumb and I couldn't believe it was choosen by her after all the great songs she has done in the past. I stick to her greatest hits albums since that's the only kind cd that has any good material on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing vocals......BUT....","review":"After an eternally long wait from one of my all time favorite singers, JASPER COUNTY delivers wonderful songs and that amazing voice....Song selection remains true to her roots. The only downside is that after 4 years, I would expect more than a 38 minute CD.......definitely room for at least 4 more songs on the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"GrownUpMusic.com recommended!","review":"The new Mrs. Garth Brooks has a few words for Faith Hill: \\"Step aside.\\" Yearwood takes her time with a record to get it right, and this all-country pleaser has all the ingredients for success: smart, upbeat tunes, a fiddle here/a mandolin there, and best of all, that incredible voice. Yearwood fans are going to love the true-country flavor that lasts and lasts. That's what separates Yearwood from many of her contemporaries (hubby included). Her records never sound dated or old. \\"She's in Love with the Boy\\" is still as fresh as it was back in 1991."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on form...","review":".....not that she ever went off form!

All of the songs really sound awful and so, although I like Trish, this album is just not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"O TRISHA WHERE ART THOU?","review":"I love Trisha Yearwood. She could sing her own cookbook and make it sound good. Wish she'd get out of the kitchen and back in the studio...let Garth whip up some chilli or pulled pork.Trish has only done two albums in the past 8 years including JASPER COUNTY. This is my least favorite TY album but it still has some good points. Noticeably missing are the ballads that helped catapult her to the top of country charts. The sublimely lovely TRYING TO LOVE YOU is the only tune that gives Trisha a chance to melt hearts, although the hit single, GEORGIA RAIN, comes close.Trisha goes for a more bouncy upbeat feel on JASPER COUNTY and she does them well especially on RIVER OF YOU and GIMME THE GOOD STUFF. A couple more slow songs would've given a better balance.Oh well....it's always a better world with Trisha in it. So put down that rolling pin and pick up that microphone...and soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for single parents","review":"I was so happy when I received this book. I am now the single parent of my gorgeous daughter and her father is not involved with anything. This book was great for me to record her milestones and memories without having to have the blank pages like many other books have that involve the father and family trees etc. This has no reference to gender either so it would work for either parent. It was a great purchase for me as I want to record everything. There are plenty of pages for pictures and other momentos and there are also journaling pages and just lots of pages for you to write everything. It was wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"This book is beautifully laid out, thoughtfully and tastefully written. It is a baby book which encourages thoughtful reflection and feeling far beyond simply pasting pictures and jotting down when baby did what.

The tool is great and very handy. I have only one complaint about the Cybertool...since I travel every week, I will not check bags (playing the odds by checking bags every week will definitely result in lost luggage many times a year) and the Cybertool will not pass through TSA security checkpoints. This makes the Cybertool useless for me. It would be nice if the Cybertool and all other Swiss Army knife models were listed in a matrix that showed which ones can be checked according to TSA security rules.

Kleinke uses 90% of the book to describe the woes of the US healthcare system. The tone is very very negative and the author uses words such as \\"moronic\\" way too much. It is tiring to read so much unbalanced negativism. The critique may be warranted but is not properly structured; there is a lot of focus jumping from anecdotes about payers, providers, government, consumers, consultants, etc. Kleinke even tries to explain the problems using Complexity Theory about which he clearly knows nothing. (Attempting to draw analogies between our healthcare system and sets of stiff differential equations). In the last 10% of the book Kleinke presents a solution that he does not tell how could ever be implemented. It is a combination of old utopic ideas. In short, buy this book only if you need more reasons why our healthcare system is broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Myths of Kleinke","review":"Total opportunist, Kleinke has changed his tune 100 percent since his last book. Whatever sells is what he wants to sell; he sold a lot of his last book; in this new book, he provides a crazy critique that is full of utopian ideas that are of no help to anyone working in the health care system today. Some amusing anecdotes, but it seems Kleinke is more in love with his own writing and storytelling than in providing any useful insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this book","review":"If you buy and read this book, you will feel sick that you spent the money and the time on it. The author has done a complete flip-flop from his earlier book, but that's not all that is wrong with this book. While it has gathered some interesting points together, it leaves one with no useful recommendations and frankly, the author seems to have completely lost it. It's no wonder this book isn't popular.

The codes are explained well, so they are easy to understand, though some you have to think about more than others. It's really fun to write secret messages to your friends! The hardest code in this book is called the Vigenere square and keyboard. It's my favorite. This book also has some interesting facts worked into it and more!

But when you have 20 sets of quotations back-to-back with no identification of who is saying what, it gets confusing. Then you read it again and realize that the author threw a 3rd person into the conversation somewhere in the middle. Overall, it was a short book with a terrible flow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Please write more books like this one as there is definitely a fan base out there looking for them.

Each one is better than the last! Ellie is pregnant in this one, causing the friends to step away from the growing family in an attempt to give them space. Sid soon finds three eggs that he decides our his new children, bringing more laughs and baby dinos. As they wreak havoc amoungst their baby peers, their real mom comes to get them back, taking Sid with them. Now his friends have to go to a whole new world, undiscovered under layers of ice, to bring him back. The mammoths quickly realize they aren't the biggest ones in the world anymore, and they all meet a koooky, crazy weasel who aids them on their way. We cracked up watching this and I'm glad I bought it as it is one my kids will rewatch many times in the future! Ellie's baby is also so adorable and I look forward to more in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fitting end to the Ice Age trilogy","review":"The makers of Ice Age have done it once again! Ice Age 3 seems like the perfect capstone for the Ice Age trilogy. It might not be quite as hilarious as the first two movies, but it is pretty funny. Sid is as clueless as ever. Manny becomes a stressed out parent. Buck is a decent addition (best line: \\"He who has gas, travels at the back of the pack.\\").More importantly, Ice Age 3 is a good all-round movie. The blu-ray version has great graphics and amazingly rich sound - easily the best of them. The movie has some exciting action scenes, including a ride on the back of a pteranodon reminiscent of Star Wars.Granted the idea of a lost world filled with dinosaurs below the Ice Age snows doesn't make a whole lot of natural history sense. Then again, we're talking about mammoths who make fart jokes. That being said, the dinosaurs are well done (better in my opinion that Land of the Lost).If you liked the first two Ice Age movies, don't miss out on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Example With What Is Wrong","review":"Understand where I am coming from.

Now you get a DVD with only the movie on it for $15 (remind anyone of VHS?), but if you want the Special Features you got to spend $8 more for that. To top it off, it's not like they don't have room for the special features on the Movie DVD. They give us another container...twice as much storage is required of the buyers. The Marketing Wizs at Dream Works then package this as the Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs Scrat Pack and tell you that you get extra. YOU DON'T GET EXTRA. YOU GET NOTHING SPECIAL. INSTEAD YOU GET ROBBED. While I'd like the features on the Scrat Pack, I am not spending $8 more to get my special features. I'm boycotting and others should boycott this also. I bet if you look on the Scrat Pack there is about 30 minutes of material.

In this book, Cathy O'Brien has named the perpetrators who tortured, molested, abused and enslaved her and her daughter repeatedly over many years, and, some are national leaders. The events depicted in this book will shock you. It is a must read for every concerned American who values freedom and the pursuit of happiness.

It is probably easier to accept now than when it was first published, especially with all the disclosures of drug use and sex among our \\"respected\\" politicians.The book is graphic and shocking. The story of her being recruited into the mind-control program, and being used as a drug mule and sex slave for politicians, is so sensational, that intelligence agencies can and do use this as their defense.

Something about this book that annoyed me was Cammie. I absolutely that girl and she should just get this stupid vendetta with Anna over with because it gives really no personality at all.Like I said before a much better improvement from the first book, and I think Ms.Dean has a pretty strong hold of the book already, where I felt it took Ms.Von Ziegesar 3 books into the series of Gossip Girl before she could do something decent with her characters.Good work Ms. Dean & keep it comingCiao"},{"rating":"2","title":"The A-List #2: Girls on Film","review":"I liked this book just as much as the first one, and I was so happy with the ending I could just die.

He must be incredibly intelligent to have finished law school and practiced before he was 22. Another thing, he and Cag Hart were both Special Forces, but they served in a mechanized division (I can't vouch for the 1st Mech Inf Div, but I know that my unit, the 24th had no SF guys in it).

I have been disappointed in several of her latest books but this one is the worst. Number one I expect the hero to confess undieing love for the heroine, or I have missed the point of \\"Romance \\" novels. Secondly, Blake states early in the book that his dad ran away with a french woman and his mother died of cancer. Later in the book his dad dies when he was young and the mother of a heart attack. Which is it? Sloppy editing at its extreme. I expect more for Violet than for some man to use her for sex and then want out after she is pregnant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"In other books Blake has tantalized with the possibility of a good romance but when his turn came, I found his story a dissapointment. It was the same for Dr. Coltrain & Cash Grier; the possibility of a highly charged romance was hinted at in stories where they had 'guest appearances' but it seemed that when it became time to tell thier stories Diana was tired of them and just threw a combination of old plots and contradictory situations together. Diana Palmers works are either very good or very bad and I won't spend the money on hardcover any more. I'll wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheres the hero?","review":"Typical romance by Diana Palmer. Violet is a strong character, unlike a lot of the females in the other books. However, the male character in this one comes up extremely short. He has no attractive attributes whatsoever.

Even to the end, he makes Violet settle for a measly relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Palmer Book EVER!","review":"Horrible! I have read just about all of Diana Palmer\`s books, so I understand her normal character type: the man is a misunderstood jerk who is fighting feelings for the soft, young, optimistic virgin who loves him. While the alpha-male/shy virgin type can seem a little out of date, normally the characters have some redeeming characterstics that you can buy into --making you really want to see them get together in the end. NOT SO with this book. The male lead was horrible ! HORRIBLE! By the end of the book, he hasn\`t even told the main female that he cares for her. At the most, he expresses his happieness that they are sexually compatible. I was hugely dissapointed by this book after looking forward to finally reading the main character\`s story.

I really dislike this book because it brought up people from other books who's story has already been told and a happy ending was given (ei Libby, Cash, Tippy Jordon).

Ms. Palmer has long been a favorite author, however, the older I grow, the more antiquated her dialogue becomes. Also, in book after book, continuity is a LARGE problem for Ms. Palmer. Does she forget what she has written from the day before? Also, is she so out of touch with today's youth that she truely thinks they still use words like \\"swell\\" and \\"dishy\\"? Come on, Diana, if you are going to continue to write, then please try to keep up with the jargon of today. I applaud the high moral standards she continues to give her heros and heroines, but just because you are a \\"throwback\\" to another time doesn't mean you will express yourself like a 50's television show. I agree with the request of another reader for Ms. Palmer to take a step back and look for the magic that she had when she wrote Amelia, Nora, and Diamond Spur. By the way, in case there is some confusion, Night Fever is a reprint from back in the early '90's."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this is a Diana Palmer story.","review":"This story made me so mad, because usually in her books the woman is just as mule headed as the man. Now in this book Violet is a weakling who acts as if she can't go on without her boss. In all the other books that connect the characters of Jacobsville, TX the woman would have left the state to start over in another state. I can't believe that if her mother knew about his attitude she wouldn't have wanted her to be with him. This book just kind of let me down. I loved all over the other stories involving this series. I have read them time and again so I really hope the next book is like the others and not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance?","review":"There was no romance in this book other than Violet loved Blake. He doesn't love her. Married her only because she's pregnant and he feels some sort of lust for her. Violet almost had a backbone when she broke off their engagement when she found out he's only marrying her because she's pregnant. She then allows him to walk all over her when he publicly announces she's pregnant and that she now has to marry him. TERRIBLE. I waited for that moment when he would have some feelings for her besides lust and responsibility. Never happened.

Each offers their unique styling that serve to compliment the heavenly sax work of Koz.The medley of favorites that serve as the basis for the \\"overture\\" sets the stage for the entire disc. Each subsequent song is right on the mark as a blend of pop and jazz, so familiar to contemporary audiences.An album highlight is Loggins taking the lead on \\"December Makes Me Feel This Way\\", a tune written by Koz and performed by him on the album of the same name. While Koz is passable as a singer, Loggins definitely has the vocal tool to get the job done.A \\"fun\\" extra is \\"Twas the Night Before Christmas\\" with all reciting (Or is it \\"rapping\\"?) a verse to the perennial favorite, while a nice rift plays in the background."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Holiday Favorite","review":"I bought this CD many years ago on impulse as I was leaving a store, and I was (and still am) very pleased with it. It has a collection of cream of the crop Smooth Jazz artists collaborating together like crazy. Yes, it has several musical styles, but that's the best thing about it. Instead of a bunch of Christmas Standards played in the so-called \\"Smooth Jazz\\" instrumental style, this CD has some standards, some new songs (new to me), and some unusual choices like Patty Page's \\"Boogie Woogie Santa Claus\\", all played and sang with a sense of fun and flair. If you're worried you won't like this CD because it's all instrumentals, fear not; this CD is mostly singing.Another CD I would also recommend isPeter White Christmas with Mindi Abair and Rick Braun. Again, a lot of energy and collaboration from some of the best in the Smooth Jazz genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I usually love the music and styling and Dave Koz. I expected this to be exactly what the title said --- Smooth jazz, but it's more an assorted mix of styles. I played it one time, ended up burning the 3 titles I did like to a Christmas CD, and will probably never listen to the original CD again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Christmas Album","review":"This album is filled with inconsistency. Even within a single song, the artist moves from mellow to racing. This is across songs. Vocals could be left out altogether, and what was there was not good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous CD","review":"My CD was received very well packaged and in a timely manner.

She does an excellent job of listing questions every owner or perspective owner should ask themselves regarding the responsibilities and expectations of that come from sharing one's life with a cat or cats. Cat lovers of any experience level should find this a helpful and informative book. My only criticism, if it can be taken as such, is her almost-exclusive focus on purebreed cats. I share my home with twenty mixed-breed cats and volunteer at the local animal shelter, and would have enjoyed this book much more had the author not limited her comments to cats of established breeds. Since the vast majority of companion cats are of mixed or uncertain parentage, I felt this was a major oversight that may leave those who got their cat from the parking lot at the grocery store feeling second-class."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"Milani's tedious, boring writing style made this book a chore to read. Her attempts at warmth and humor seem stilted and not natural. I also found the information in this book to be rehashed versions of previously released cat books.I also fault the editor of this book for allowing Milani to labor on in such long paragraphs without giving the reader a break.If you're new to the world of cats or you're searching for help with a problem, I highly recommend that you check out Pam Johnson's book \\"Twisted Whiskers\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's cheap--what more can I say.","review":"You get what you pay for. That's still true. The station tuning button didn't work well. When I tune in for a station, the station number didn't show up correctly. The radio station that shows on the front window always screw up. I get some stations though. It would be good enough for those listening to a few stations (not radio surf) and stick with them. I bought it for the speaker feature. Not many small or tiny radios have the speaker function, most require a headphone. I give it a small credit for its overall small size and the decent sound that comes out of its tiny speaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I couldn't find a Sony Walkman so I tried one of these. The appearance of this piece of junk is deceiving. It has a digital display however tuning the tuning knob is very crude, sticky and analog.FM tuning bands are very broad and overlap allowing for considerable interference. AM sensitivity is very poor compared to my Sony Walkman headphone AM/FM radio and compared to the lost Sony Walkman pocket radio I hoped to replace. Ironically a wire antenna that plugs into the earphone socket is included but does ZERO for the AM band.There are separate power on and power off buttons; dumb. An additional annoyance the power on button defaults to the AM band.The most useless feature is the built in alarm clock. I can only imagine this piece of feature-itis was added to make up for the deficiency of this product in the area of its intended purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all Ages","review":"I ordered this product for my special needs clasess and they enjoy it alot!

The name Anathallo has been around for a while, but my lazy, uneducated impression was that they were some dumb Sigur Ros knock-off or something like that. But the packaging of \\"Floating World\\" was so esquisite when I saw it at the local indie record store I picked it up anyway.And they proved me just about utterly wrong. While I won't deny that there are some Sigur Ros elements, there are many more times where artists like The Animal Collective or Sufjan Stevens are more apt comparrisons. Yet unlike other indie groups who are nothing more than paint-by-numbers wanna-bes, Anathallo bolsters their sound by writing exceptional songs. They impress you by what they do... not how they sound.Undoubtedly if this CD finds an audience, Anathallo could be topping many year-end lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"none","review":"Morehouse is fascinating and wholly original in this grim and gritty cyberthriller.

Great first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Album has more roots than you think","review":"Although the old Irish feel of Do or Die is lost with the new singer, After listening to this album for a few months, you discover the abundance of trad. Dropkick style.\\"The Fighting 69th\\" has that feel as well as the fiddle in the \\"Wheel of Misfortune,\\" the bagpipes in \\"Amazing Grace,\\" and the irish styled \\"Gangs All Here.\\" The one downfall on this album is the lack of good hardcore songs. \\"Blood and Whiskey\\" kicks maximum ass and is probably one of the best Dropkick Songs, but alot of them just drain on and aren't very melodic. But after listening to the album for a while (I didn't like it at first) you find the strong irish folk music mixed very well in half of the songs which you didn't notice before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oi!","review":"Dropkick Murphys in a new line up that is (in my opinion) is just as good as the original. Al's gruff voice is perfect for Oi! music, and the punding drums seem to support the fast guitars perfectly. The album is very different from the most recent Sing Loud, Sing Proud, which has alot more irish inspiration to it. The Gang's All Here is much more Oi! and less folk. Whether it is a better album, I don't know, it is different in it's style, it is a matter of taste I would say.By any means it is a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Today's Oi! - Heroes","review":"No doubt, Dropkicks are today's heroes! With their brandnew record the bois proof again that they're the best US-(OI)Band! Although \\"The Gang's all here\\" is not as good as \\"Do or die\\" (how could it??), it's still blowing yer head off!! But sadly their new singer isn't as good as the old one (how could he?) and the sound's a bit less-melodic and more hardcorish or what... Nevermind, ... still better than the most!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about...","review":"Every other Amazon review I've read sort of panned this release. and sure, if you've only listened to this album a few times, you might agree. But in my mind, it is a more mature and even album than Do or Die (their previous, and benchmark album) and whereas Do or Die is filled with sorta more catchier stuff, I prefer this album; hand, fist, and broken bottle over Do or Die. It's an amazing release, it grabs you by the throat with the thunderous guitar intro of Blood and Whisky, and keeps rocking right on out until the last. After listening to this straight ahead, cajones to the wall ROCK'N'ROLL, you'll realize how cheesy Do or Die can be. And you'll also realize why these guys deserve to reign supreme over punk rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"The songs are not that great!","review":"Having owned all of the Dropkick Murphys CD's for over a year and a half, I would have to say I listen to this one far less than the great \\"Do or Die\\". I don't believe it's because I think Al Barr sucks or anything, I actually think he's great. I believe its the songs themselves on this CD that makes it nowhere as good as Do or Die. Do or Die had alot more of irish drinking type of music, but this one has more normal non-irish punk band type of music that simply isn't as good.Proof that it's not Al Barr's fault is that their newest release comming out, \\"Sing loud, Sing Proud\\", seems to take them back to their roots with the CD being full of drinking songs and irish music, full of bagpipes, just like Do or Die. This disc isn't bad, but its not really excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as Do Or Die","review":"now..i'm not really putting this album down because of the new lineup ( only two of the original members )..and because of the big difference in Al's voice compared to Mike's ( I am a fan of the Bruisers too)..but because the songs really arent all that good . There are some good songs \\"10 Years Of Service\\" , \\"The Fighting 69th\\" and \\"The Gangs All Here\\"...but everything else seems to be boring filler tracks that are nowhere nearly as catchy and memorable as anything on Do Or Die..or The Singles Collection. Alot of people complained about Barr's voice , but it's really a good oi! voice , it's just these songs are (...)Maybe Sing Loud , Sing Proud is better..I havent heard it..but I was really disappointed with this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO OR DIE! DO OR DIE!","review":"Its obvious that the original line-up of the band on do or die is way better.The songs are better written,better sounding and the versatility and raw power of Mike Mccolgans voice is much better than Al Barr's cookie-monster-hardcore-voice.The record(gangs all here)is a disappointment.I miss the old line-up and so do a ton of people.Nice try but no way can this new line up match up with the older version.The Do or Die record will always stand as their finest moment.......Songs like baroom hero,caught in a jar and finnegans wake are priceless! I seen the original line-up with Mike play in northampton ,ma a couple years ago with the amazing royal crowns and they blew the roof off the place with the older songs.....I know I sound like sour grapes but its true that the old is way better than the new,,,,,,,,"},{"rating":"2","title":"I never knew the sacrifices our army made in the 1800's to protect our settlers","review":"Bess Streeter Aldrich is a classic writer of the old Midwest. Her novels draw from real stories, I'm sure, of the hardships endured and sacrifices made by our settlers. I never thought about why our army was stationed throughout the midwest and west of our country until I read The Lieutenant's Lady -- they were here to protect our settlers. The Lieutenant's Lady is a classic love story of a woman falling in love with her cousin's fiancee, a U. S. soldier. When the cousin jilts her fiance for another suitor, the protagonist in the story journeys to the base where he is stationed, at the risk of great danger, to give him the news, and ends up marrying him. He is displeased that she has come, and there is nothing for her to do but stay, so they marry to avoid raised eyebrows. In the end, they fall in love and it is a successful marriage. I enjoyed the love story and the view into our military's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO HOT","review":"I did not like this CD - neither did my kids.

The Rick james DVD was from the late 70's to the 80's and it was not the finest quality, but not bad either. The ONLY BAD video was the \\"Ebony Eyes\\" video. One of the reason I bought this is because everytime I find a verison on the net, it is an old \\"Video Soul\\" VHS low quality copy. Sadly, that is what we get here! The other official videos are DVD quality. Still worth a buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rick James Lover","review":"This dvd is not the best. Although it allows you to see Rick from a very young musician until he hit the big time, I expected a little more insight on Rick -- maybe a little more upclose and personal. If you need a reason to buy this dvd, then buy it for the mere fact that the Temptations (\\"Standing On The Top\\") perform with Rick -- which is the best segment of the dvd. The dvd is worth the purchase simply because of this performance; otherwise, pass it by."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Musical stew of the Funk King","review":"Rick James was always the truth and this compilation showcases his talents and his humor on so many levels.

The explanations are wordy, sketchy, and poorly related to each other and to exterior topics.The contents fall into thirds: Turing machines, aspects of decidability, and a hodge podge of topics from other parts of logic. The 4e is 50 pages (17%) longer than the 3e. The changes were mainly adding exercises and making the chapters more independent.

I contacted Casio and they said to send it to them AT MY EXPENSE and they would let me know if the repair would be covered under the warranty. Well, you guessed it, it wasn't covered. Can you believe that? 9 months and they wouldn't repair it! Casio said that they don't cover the case under warranty. Well, gee, what is a wrist watch without the case?

I like the way that Cy Curnin changes his voice within the songs. There is one song on this record that seems maybe a little out of place. That is \\"Precious Stone\\". Lyrically it fits well with the rest of the songs, but the music and singing are a little odd. If you are a fan of the Fixx but don't have this one yet, then I highly recommend getting it. It has plenty of their signature sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic fixx","review":"was skeptical about purchasing for years.

Overall he gives it four stars, despite a couple of minor reservations.He says that the vinyl can stick and make funny sounds but you can oil-up in advance or wait for the body fluids to start flowing - both resolve the problem. The Velcro straps work fine, although he isn't happy with their positioning as it is impossible to kneel in his favourite 'bad boy wants disciplining' pose.Finally, he found that after 12 hours of continuous use, it deflates a bit. Personally, I don't think it's a problem for others: few people are as 'big-boned' as Phil, even fewer would be able to endure the abuse that Dalton dishes out to him during their sessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fun","review":"Really added some spice to an already exciting sex life!

This type of gear puller design has been around for a long time, and I'd used a larger version with ease many years ago. The problem with this one is the jaws that are suppose to grab the rear of the gear being pulled slip off due to some manufacturing tolarance issues. Having a 3rd jaw, or some way to securely hold the gear would be a big improvement over the two opposing jaws that this model uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very frustrating ........................","review":"The author does not let the stories speak for themselves. I found many questions arising about the strangeness of the stories, but no attempt was made to answer them. And because there is no probing reflection applied, some stories look contrived. Strangeness that is not scrutinized just looks like someone seeing what they want to see.The stories read as if all involved enjoy being mystified and have no interest in rationality and understanding. In fact, one story seemed like a pathetic justification, born of regret.The author says, \\"...I have no explanation for these strange romantic encounters.\\" There is no indication anywhere that he tried to find one, and plenty of weight of evidence that he actually tried to avoid one. Otherwise, guess what? Maybe no book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and rugged.","review":"Gives off a nice bright light, extremely rugged. A bit on the heavy side.

Not knowing the heritage of these lights beforehand, I was stunned by the brightness--literally. These things are seriously crazy intense for their size. Don't look into them, and don't touch the lense. They're so bright that I unintentionally looked into mine only slightly and had a spot in my field of vision for long enough that it scared me. These are so powerful that even the light cast on your hand from a few inches away feels warm.The overall build is rock solid, and it feels like a high-quality machined metal product. If I had any complaints, it would just be that this thing is almost too dangerous to use regularly, especially around children, and the batteries are rated for a relatively short period of time (about an hour). Plus, those batteries are proprietary, not your regular old AAs or something.All in all, this is a slick piece of gear for the right use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Shoes!","review":"Love the black and white wingtips.

When I tried to walk in them my foot kept hitting against where the tongue of the shoe ends in front. Trying different lacing strategies did not help.

I finally figured out with my last few purchases (after 15 years of wearing them):If you are ordering a model MADE FOR WOMEN go to the next whole size bigger (i.e. US 7.5, should order a US 8)If you are ordering a UNISEX pair go DOWN a half size (i.e. US 7.5, get US 7)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered and NOT received after 4 months, and still waiting","review":"Hi.

It gives loads of wonderful advice that most people need (i.e. you don't have tomajor in Chemistry of Biology to get into medical school). It is also a good investment- it'll take you from you college years all the way to medical school. It's a joy to read because of the humor thrown in here and there. It's clear and precise. Another thing is that they also talk to actual students and get their opinions. This is a good thing because every student is different and have all sorts of reasons for going to medical school. Everyone doesn't decide to follow in their parents footsteps at the age of three- you may decide to go when you are thirty-three!

No one seems to have noticed that the liner notes in the accompanying booklet (which was otherwise nicely done with some great photos) gets all kinds of facts wrong. This is not mere nitpicking, as there are literally too many mistakes to list in this review. As Rhino needed to work with Simon Robinson (founder of the UK-based Deep Purple Appreciation Society and writer for all of DP's remastered album booklets) to get many of these tracks, one wonders why they didn't ask him to write the historical essay.

If I want to see a film about a movie experience within a movie, I'll watch Last Action Hero. If I want to see a film about teenage romance, I'll watch Mischief. And believe none of them contained annoying child actors and actresses. They really killed the film for me. The best parts of the film were the extra theater special effects.

He's a low-rent 2Pac who wouldn't be anything if the infinitely more talented Mr. Shakur was still alive. Folks wouldn't pay any attention to this clown if the real thing was still churning out CD's, but whatever. This CD is a lengthy wallow in the worst of hip-hop, from unimaginative beats to gangsta-ish lyrics that glorify crack dealing and other such mindlessness. Although P manages to rise a bit above the muck for a track or two (notably \\"I Miss My Homies\\"), the vast majority of the cuts here are simply pedestrian attempts at capturing the lucrative gangsta-rap market. It's obvious P is just cashing in on what's hot at the moment. Here's hoping the moment passes and P goes with it. He's the least talented rapper this side of Puff Daddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is that?????","review":"Master P sounds like he is in pain when he raps (AND HE CAN'T EVEN RAP!!)

I snapped that one up...this cd was as close to a soundtrack to my suburban white thug coming up as any cd could be. But, the rerelease cd was sadly inferior. I actually didn't play right in any cd player I tried it in, and skipped about every other track. I could see no flaws on the disk, but it still did it after I had it cleaned professionally.

Even Snoop dogg latest album aint up to par with Doggystyle. Everyone on their label sound the same. Let me her you say ahh, nah, or whatever the hell he is saying. Master P is a good businessman, but he should leave the rapping to the real MC'S like Vanilla Ice.(just kidding) If you like real rap, listen to Cube, NAS, TUPAC, OR some B.I.G.

Great read....if you want to start at the beginning of the series...this is where you start.....RIP Robert B Parker...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"Don't choose this title for an introduction to Spenser. Choose one later in the series preferable after Hawk's appearance in Promised Land. I have read and enjoyed most of Parker's later Spenser novels. This one is not as good.In this novel, Parker has yet to figure out how to make Spenser tough and believable. For example Parker has Spenser sleeping with a mom then her daughter. It is kinda creepy in that both seem obligatory. It is almost as if he couldn't decide what age he wants Spenser to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rolicking start to a great series","review":"I've read about a half-dozen Spenser novels, not in order, and finally decided to go through them chronolgically. This is the first, and it marks the birth of the original wiseass, Spenser.Reading these books, one realizes that the plot itself doesn't count as much as the character of Spenser. Wiseass, smart-aleck, and sometimes efficient detective, he is fun and it's always a pleasure to read these novels.But this one doesn't deserve 5 stars, if only because the nascent character hasn't yet ripened. Read on for more stories about Spenser, as Parker develops him and creates a real character."},{"rating":"2","title":"unknown","review":"would like to know what Robert B Parker book that introduces Paul Giamotti (might be spelled wrong)if you know e-mail me at izmine@yahoo.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Promise but no punch.","review":"This is the first of Robert Parker's books that I've read, and were it not for the general raves by Parker fans and the continued popularity of the Spenser character I might not be willing to read further into the series. Stylistically, I'd say the work is embryonic (at least I hope so), and the plot & characterization simply have nothing new to add to the detective fiction genre. I'm told that Spenser is quite the wit but that must develop in future books because although he occasionally has the witty quip here, there was nothing that really made me sit up and take notice. But I did pick up a copy of 'God Save the Child,' and I'm hoping for something more substantial as I read further."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Spencer Novel","review":"Robert B. Parker's first Spencer novel, The Godwulf Manuscript is a fun and sometimes addictive read of thievery and murder. While not high literature, this book is a classic in its own right, written in 1973, where Spencer became the typical cardboard cutout detective that we see in many B-movies. Witty and sarcastic, and many times flattened emotions to send the \\"I am not amused\\" lines of dialogue. While today this might seem blah to some readers, if read with the idea that this is the first of its kind in the back of your mind, it may be more appreciated. Aside from this, the story is well told in the simplest way without getting fancy. This series went on to some 12 novels and a TV series, 'Spencer for Hire.'For a fun quick read, those who enjoy mystery will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A smart, sexy, and strong character...","review":"If you have not yet begun your own Spenser adventure, you're in for a real treat. Robert Parker has created a delightfully brilliant character in Spenser. He is a renaissance man - a great cook, philosopher, and a fighter. He is a \\"lone wolf\\", but with a deeper sense of humanity than most people posess. A good reminder that doing the right thing isn't always as compicated as it seems. If you are familiar with Boston, the trip is all the more familiar and realistic.

After ordering the cd, I popped it straight in my cd player. Before I knew it, I was rocking out with the songs cranked! It was hard for me to choose a favorite, but I would have to say that track #5, \\"Sick\\", is the best. It blends pop/rock with a creative edge. That was a completely new sound to me, though it really formed a different love of music in my head. After showing the cd to a couple of my friends, I know that I'm not the only one with a Lillix obsession! Buy the cd now, it is TOTALLY worth it!

It's rare that a Group can put out a CD the has more that a few hits on it. Lillix has accomplished what many bands that have been around for years couldn't. Every song is as good as all the others. Falling Up Hill is not a CD full of \\"filler\\" songs and only a few hits. The entire CD is good. You can put it on and play all track started through and enjoy all the songs. They even found room for a great cover: \\"What I Like About You\\".You have probably heard the first single 24/7 on the radio a lot. It is a very popular song. If you are even the slightest fan of this song I urge you to get the entire CD. It's full of great songs both musically and lyrically.

It's honestly hard to pick a favorite because each song has something that i love in it. You may recognize their song \\"What I Like About You\\" from the hit tv show on the WB of the same title.This cd has been produced by many but the ones that stick out for me are The Matrix and Linda Perry. I feel that they really added to this cd. It's AWESOME! The girls are soo sweet and their lyrics/musical talent amaze me!

I bought the album the day it came out and it's one of my most listened to CDs out of the albums I am currently playing. I honestly do not skip any of the songs on the CD.My favorite songs on the album are It's About Time, Quicksand, Sick, and Dirty Sunshine. But I like them all and most of them could make it on my favorites list of songs from the CD. For me, I don't think any of the songs are bad.

The parts where they are not screaming reveal that there is very little vocal talent to be had within this group. However, the songs were catchy and I don't think this is a BAD CD, just a very sophomoric debut. I personally think I could write lyrics and sing better than these girls.

In the past there have been maybe one or two female/female-led bands that I have liked or at least respected.

I like Jonathan's instruction very much but have some reservations about the video. There is very little floor work or work on flexibility as most is focused on standing work. There is lots of repetition. With all this prep I think he should have gone on to a bit more floor work esp since you are certainly warm enough to be very ready for some flex work. and to me it certainly is not an intermediate level video. Advanced beginner maybe. I consider myself to be almost intermediate and and I am 53 yrs old and I did not find much of a challenge here. But all that said, his instruction is lovely. He is informative and very genuine. It is a good tape to use as an alternate I think or when you just want to come back to basics,do some sweating and kind of be on autopilot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen one Heat Live..seen em all","review":"I've seen Beginner, Interm, and advanced.

The last few albums ('Blackout', 'Only in Amerika', and 'Back 2 Base X') have continued to get worse, and this trend has continued with 'Insomnia.' I'm not sure what has happened to their ability to write lyrics or their ability to make a cohesive song/album. Each song starts out promising, good beat and what-not, but then the downward spiral begins. Each song seems like 3 or 4 extremely different songs/beats/rhythms strung together, its pathetic. It seems like they have lost their direction completely. I'm also not impressed with the new political overtones they have in their music or the misplaced references to the free masons. Overall I just felt the album was oddly put together, and I probably won't listen to it again (eventhough I bought it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highest raves!","review":"I've heard these songs many times by many recording artists and local bands, but there is nothing like Jordan's brand of jump blues and swing.

Thoroughly enjoyable. Her voice and phrasing is just wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written and disappointing","review":"I agree with an earlier reviewer about this book being poorly written. That said, the biggest disappointment is that the author fails to observe one fundamental truth: that Castro was pathologically obsessed about not being upstaged or replaced by any other Batista opponent. His monomaniacal motivation was to be recognized as Batista's top nemesis. If the city and university \\"student\\" revolutionaries had succeeded in killing Batista, Castro would have been left behind. He knew this and greatly feared it. He didn't cooperate with anyone except where it served his purpose.The sad thing is that this author is now one of the leading exponents of appeasement with the totalitarian regime in Cuba and part of a business and congressional leftist movement that stands to profit from trade with Cuba."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectual dishonesty","review":"The author of this book certainly knows Cuba well and has been a strong advocate for constructive engagement with the Cuban regime for quite some time now which is commendable. Nonetheless her complete lack of objectivitity and intellectual honesty are evident from page one. In essence she is much too close to the subject matter and therefore compromised to offer anything credible on the topic. She is also excessively emotional in her obsession with all things Castro. The author once had the audacity to say that the only thing Castro wants before he dies is to be able to feed his people. What a farce! Anyone who wants to get \\"Inside the Cuban Revolution\\" should visit the island and not waste their money on this worthless propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inside the Cuban Revolution","review":"I was disappointed with the research presented by the author. The argument presented by the author seems to be an orchestrated initiative by the Castro dictatorship to exonerate Castro of any responsibility for the killing of many leading anti-Batista revolutionaries that were sacrificed to eliminate any potential leader that could challenge Castro's communist design for Cuba. It is significant that the author is so close to the leaders of the current leadership and that some of the arguments that she presents are also presented, word-by-word, by Enrique Oltuski on his Vida Clandestina. Overall, this book is a waste of money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry as toast","review":"I never realized someone could take such a facinating subject and make it so boring.

I highly recommend this book to family, volunteer and professional caregivers alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written Beatles book","review":"I've read a ton of Beatles bios, and this is not one of the better ones. The author tries to make it an academic work, bogging down in minute details and completely losing the charm of the Beatles story. Quotes are added in places that were spoken long after the incident being recounted took place, which doesn't let the story stay in a time frame long enough to get a sense of being there. It just isn't well written. It's not worth space on any serious Beatle fan's shelf, unless you're just collecting all the books about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riddled with errors","review":"I grew up in Liverpool in the sixties, and I can tell you that the part of the book that deals with the early days is riddled with errors.

I can understand some mistakes but how can he write 'Harry the Horse' insted of 'Henry the Horse'? Other mistakes abound. I also find his attempt to use colorful language stilted (he sometimes resorts to obscenities for no apparent reason). Then, there is the problem where he 'takes us into the mind of the four lads' and tells us what they were thinking. Hey, the two surviving members probably don't even remember what they were thinking for most of that mad ride! I've read a lot of books on the Beatles. This one doesn't rate highly in my estimation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I admit I haven't read the whole book, only excerpts. I also looked at the photos, some of which I've seen before and a few new ones. The excerpts I read didn't tell me anything new that isn't contained in other Beatles books (Hunter Davies, Philip Norman). I found two glaring errors in the photo captions. One photo caption purported to show George & Patti at Paul's 21st birthday party. Paul was born in 1942 and turned 21 in 1963. George didn't meet Patti until the Spring of 1964 while they were filming \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", contrary to another photo caption which claimed they met on the set of \\"Help\\" which was released in 1965. These are elemental facts known to most serious Beatles fans.

Also, 75% of the way through he is still on 1966, and the pace accelerates as it goes. There are a few paragraphs devoted to the more famous songs, but in general each album is described for its studi recording atmosphere.I liked this book, but if you're a John fan, you may not since he comes across as rather a jerk. But, Spitz is not controversial the way Goldman or Brown were, so you can enjoy what you're reading more as you go.Either way, if you're at all interested in the Beatles, this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story is spellbinding;","review":"The story is spellbinding; I couldn't put this book down. From their childhoods and earliest beginnings in Liverpool through the struggles of finding their voice to the break-up of the band Spitz offers great detail and insight woven into a refreshing complete picture of the Beatles. By far this is best book on the Beatles that I have ever read. It is a must read for any Beatles fan or for anyone looking for insight into an incredible turning point in our culture. I highly recommend this book and I know what I'm getting for many of the readers on my holiday shopping list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major fact wrong","review":"This book states that Hey Jude is The Beatles' best selling single.

There are paper references including this years Top Ten of Everything. It's even on The Beatles own website:[...]Why am I making a fuss?

I had read that Bob Spitz had written quite a bit more, but the book was edited down quite a bit. i wondered what ever happened to Dot Rhone (USA Today said that Bob found her in Canada-did she move there with any help from Cynthia Lennon's mother....or what?) and more info about Neil Aspinall's son (hope spelling is ok) with Mona Best would have been cool. And of course, anythingmore specific about Pete's musical career after being sacked would have been great.I was already familar with most of the stories, and the bits I enjoyed most were the occasional nuggets like the three mentioned above. Could have used more info on those"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay no attention to the photo section","review":"Probably the best book about the Beatles. The photo section is riddled with errors, but the actual text itself is informative, well-written, and distills the essence of each member of the Band. There is no mythology here. You see four individuals and each of their flaws and strengths, and how each fit into the whole. There could have been more on the music, but what is there is welldone and does not slow down the narrative. I'm probably the only person who wanted this book to be longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"fascinating but awful writing","review":"i loved the stories, i hated the overheated over adjectived over adverbed style.i hear they took 2,000 pages out in editing...they could have lost another 200 without any problem just by cutting the overwrought prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to Perfection","review":"Being the music enthusiast that I am, I admittedly spend far more time listening to music than reading about it.

After reading other reviewers -- people who have already read their copy of the book -- I see that my suspicions were correct. The book is full of errors. That is NOT okay. At the price being charged for this highly touted book -- and after all this time -- there is no excuse for passing on errors and getting information wrong. The Beatles have long time fans that know lies when they hear or read them to a degree, but that's not the point -- look at the disservice done to younger, newer fans who are looking for a true history of The Beatles. It's not right to pass on this kind of crap. I no longer have any interest in reading this book. What's the point? This writer simply didn't do his homework."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"This book is full of inacurracies. Patti and George did not meet on the set of \\"Help!\\" as said, and the photo of them in the book is not on the set of that movie, but on their honeymoon. That is one of many.

JUNK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better Beatle books out there.","review":"Short and sweet: I've been a mega-fan for over three decades, read nearly every book on the beatles, etc. etc. etc., there are so many misses in this book I've lost count. Example: Just last week I saw Astrid interviewed on PBS about the death of Stu Sutcliffe..... Spitz' reportage of the same topic couldn't have been more different than Astrid's. He got it comp[letely wrong. And there are many other examples to sight, but I won't. Sorry for this short, perhaps inarticulate review. I just want those of you who are considering buying this tripe to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Credibility suffers","review":"I was at my local library yesterday and happened upon this book. Only needed to read the captions under the pictures to realize that this book is unreliable. First, George did not meet his first wife Patti Boyd on the set of Help, it was A Hard Day's Night. There are a few pictures that are referred to as having been taken in 1964. One seemed to me to have been taken in 1962, because the boys looked too young and there haircuts were way too short for 1964. There was another photo there which looks like 1965 but it's referred to as '64.I scanned through some of the pages but stopped reading because it lost all credibilty with me bacause of those errors in the captions. Rushing a book is no excuse if that were truly the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read Despite the Sloppy Fact-Checking","review":"Other reviews have chronicled the factual errors made by Spitz, which I found annoying. His narrative humanizes the Beatles. Given their working class \\"Scouse\\" background and the temptations that came with success, I'm surprised that at least one of them didn't die by his own hand (i.e., via OD, etc.), although it sounds like Lennon tried his best. At various junctures of the book, John, Paul, and Yoko all come off as rather pathetic and/or despicable. Despite this, I enjoyed the tale and I think most Beatle fans will, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Craziness... a titulating account","review":"I find it refreshing and unusual to find a biography of such depth and beauty on the beatles. The beatles were such a seminal band and cultural experience that it is rare to find anyone who has written a biography that doesn't idolize or mythologize their story. Spitz strips the beatles of their luster through meticulous historical research and in the process produces a biography that I feel truly brings the story of the beatles into a new and exciting light. Kudos Bob!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical inaccuracies abound","review":"Regardless of how readable and enjoyable the narrative, it is impossible to overlook major editorial/factual errors. How can the reader trust anything written when basic, elementary facts are incorrect. For example, one needs to look no further than the picture layouts contained in the book. Errors in the captions include: Brian Epstein sitting on the stage of the Cavern Club in 1964 (the Beatles did not play the Cavern after 1963) George and Pattie on the set of Help! where, according to Spitz, they first met (they met on the site of A Hard Day's Night March/April 1964) the 'gang'-including Pattie Boyd- at Paul's twenty-first birthday party (June 18, 1963), George met Pattie ten months later. The aforementioned examples are far from isolated. I counted at least 75 inconsistencies in the text, totally unforgivable for a biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the picture captions are this badly fact-checked, what about the book itself?","review":"The first Beatle bio I read wasThe Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles, an admittedly subjective but warts-and-all portrayal of the boys written by an insider that opened my then-11-year-old eyes. No doubt some facts were forgotten or fudged, given the writer's relying on mostly his own recollections. At least he was there! I would still recommend that well-written and juicy book, or the excellentA Day in the Life: The Music and Artistry of the Beatlesover the joke that is The Beatles: A Biography. I think it was the caption that had John holding Julian (a child plainly not) on the Beatles first trip to D.C. that had me howling the loudest. Oh my goodness, if the fact-checkers missed doozies like this, why waste time reading the book itself?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Thought I knew a lot about the Beatles","review":"Well, I probably do know more than many people, but I am certainly no expert. I found this book to be very interesting, reminding me of many things I had forgotten since I read my first Beatles biography about 37 years ago. There may be a few errors, but it does make me laugh whenever I read about the origin of a John Lennon song, followed by Paul's recollection that John may have had a line or two finished, but that he (Paul) completed the song and helped with the melody and chorus. It's amazing how much better his memory is, since 12/08/80. If only his songwriting had improved as much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BELOW AVERAGE -- AND AN INCOMPLETE PICTURE OF THE GREATEST BAND","review":"There are literally HUNDREDS of books about the Beatles, and over 100 of them are putative \\"definitive biographies\\" of the band.

Sorry, but the REAL definitive biography will be Mark Lewisohn's massive 3-volume tome, FAB -- due in the next few years. Wait for that one; it'll be well worth it.In the meantime, there are lots of great books out there about the Beatles that are NOT biographies.

It's difficult to accept any of the narrative as being true, because of the many blatant fact errors pointed out by other reviewers (which do not have to be rehashed again in this review). The portion about Lennon and McCartney's youth, for example, seems to be made up out of whole cloth. Like the rest of the book, it lacks any basis upon which the reader feels assured that he or she is reading what really happened, rather than some fanciful assumptions that arose strictly from the author's own imagination. Peter Brown's \\"The Love You Make,\\" for all its faults and gossipiness, is a much more enjoyable read because it at least has the credibility of being told by a semi-insider. Spitz's book strikes out all around, because it does not even have this perspective, at the least, to lend it some credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Mistakes and your out.......","review":"This book is to the history of the Beatles what People Magazine is to the history of American Social Life!The Beatles were GREAT musicians, composers and entertainers.

At first my grandfather was skeptical of my gift to him, but after hearing \\"Ghetto Thang\\" his doubts were immediately wiped clean.

It's designed to be a reading supplement for a one semester, introductory 400/500 level course on medical imaging, so it reviews the principles and mathematics behind the 4 major types of medical imaging: x-ray, nuclear, ultrasound, and mri. If you wanted more specialized knowledge on one subject, buy either a textbook specifically on that subject or maybe realize that ~250 9\\"x6\\" pages covering all 4 probably isn't going to get into all the subtly you're interested in.

Set in the beginning of Smallville (First Season), Colon has almost completely ignored the relationships forged in the first season television show. Yes, Clark and Lex are friends, but that is the extent of anything Smallville. In this book, Clark runs away and lives in the city with a ragtag bunch of runaways. He gets involve in their criminal ways, and falls for one of the runaways, a grungy tough street girl. There is very little mention of Lex, Chloe, Lana or Pete. But worse, Clark seems out of character. In most cases, when Clark is out of character, he is affected by red kryptonite or even kryptonite. Here, there isn't kryptonite to affect him, but he acts reckless and irresponsible. For Smallville fans, this is a letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book","review":"I really enjoyed this book by Miss Colon.

This one isn't meant to be a footnoted volume of case-and-point. It's just a nice high-level essay highlighting the absurdity of the rhetoric of our times. I do have one complaint though. I wish this focused a little bit more on the media than the government. Chomsky blends the two together and speaks of one as if it's the other. Hmmmm...on second thought, maybe he did that on purpose.Anyway, a light read for Chomsky fans and a nice intro for those unfamiliar with his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinnly veiled propaganda","review":"What disappoints me and prompts me to write this review, is that the author, who is considered the \\"father\\" of modern linguistics, who proposes that language is an innate human characteristic and not something developed from blank memory, misses the point that built into the language would also be manipulative characteristics to be used by the aggressive and greedy...or the pacifist...to reach their ends. What I expected upon buying this book, was an in depth discussion of the innate nature of propaganda.Instead, what I read was no more than a thinly veiled media manipulation exercise. Chomsky exaggerates the facts in almost all his arguments in order to rally people against the US government's aggression, himself attempting to achieve his goal through propaganda.How our innate development of language is also linked chemically to all of our various innate characteristics such as aggression, compassion, greed, and love is what I was expecting. All in all a big letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book","review":"I find Noam Chomsky's books to be difficult reads in any circumstance, but this book (more of a pamphlet) is a dreadful book.

This book can be read within 45 minutes and not only gives real-life examples of modern propaganda uses and successes, but also gives a brief history of its use in the United States.The details of Gulf War propaganda use reads prophetically... the same exact tactics used in the '91 Gulf War are being used today (2003). It's as if Chomsky sees the news reports before they're produced. The pattern of media control is made starkingly clear to the reader and is sure to upset you.Few books have generated such emotion in me, and for a book this short to have such an effect speaks volumes. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chomsky continues to prove his point...","review":"It's true that there is little new in the linguistic theoretical treatment of the media in this book. Chomsky uses it to update with facts the validity of the theory he most articulately developed in earlier works. Those who read it with open mindedness intelligence will appreciate and respect his unique contribution to modern thought. It is interesting, but not in the least surprising, that those who write against this book and its author generally, never attack its content with alternative explanations, but continue to vilify and redicule the man himself. It does not go without notice."},{"rating":"2","title":"We live in the Brave New World","review":"If you haven't read this book, do yourself a favour and read it.You will realize that whenever you felt that the official polemic, and the popular opinion were not perfectly pristine; that there were serious gaping holes in officialy sponsored beliefs, most probably you were not alone. Chomsky indirectly encourages us not to abandon reasoning under fear of ostracization.Some readers have complained about simple diction employed by Chomsky in unveiling the \\"spectacular achievements of propoganda\\". In my opinion, Chomsky's achievement lies presenting his case lucidly, without being verbose and without losing objectivity.Moreover, let us leave circumlocution for the propogandists of this world!

So you will have to set your laptop/desktop's ip address to that range between 192.168.0.1 through 192.168.0.254 except 192.168.0.20 (since that belongs to the dcs-900). once you launch the crappy wizard software it will recognize the camera's ip address so you can configure it to your home network address.I hope this helped a lot of you. :) It only took me 2 minutes to configure this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorest service and quality","review":"Save your money and do not puchase this product.

I have enjoyed his books immensely over the years, since I was in elementary school. This book, however, can't be Cussler's. It just has his name on it and a few of his characters. Paul Kemprecos, teamed with Cussler, did well in \\"Serpent\\" and \\"Blue Gold,\\" novels I truly enjoyed while waiting for the latest Pitt novel. But \\"Fire Ice\\" is so poor and obviously un-Cussler that I don't even know what to do with it. For the first time ever, I've stopped reading in the middle of a \\"Cussler\\" novel and put it down. I have yet to pick it back up, and it's been several months. It's much along the lines of the Tom Clancy Op-Center series - books with Clancy's name on them but with none of his style or skill. The same goes for the latest NUMA Files work. I can only hope that \\"Fire Ice\\" won't rub off on the next Dirk Pitt installment......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Competent, but not great","review":"The books have become too formulaic. I don't think Pitt was even mentioned in the book, which is a bit of a novelty, as I think Kemprecos' other contributions to the NUMA series have included bit parts for Pitt.It's a delight to read a Cussler book in which he doesn't write himself into the book; I could do without such \\"cuteness.\\"There's no love scene in the book, not much gratuituous violence, and no foul language. So it's PG or PG-13.I don't know why they made this new character 40 years old. If they wanted to introduce a new generation to replace the aging Pitt, why not make him 25 or 30?The book mentioned the recovery of a box from a shipwreck, and (unless I missed it), the only other mention was a reference to the recovery of a box containing an important list. I had expected a paragraph or two explaining how the box was opened and analyzed, etc. Perhaps it was there and I missed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Clive Cussler had run the Dirk Pitt series into a mindless and boring rut, so when his new NUMA files spin-off series appeared it was a welcome change. It was nice to see him give one of his books more than a minute of his attention. Blue Gold was even exciting, like the old Cussler. However, he seems to have run out of steam again. Fire Ice reads just like any other recent Dirk Pitt novel. I wouldn't even care so much that its totally implausible if it was entertaining. But chapter after chapter of what I guess is supposed to be character development...didn't realize there could be so many different characters that I don't care about. Where is the action?

The dialog was corny, without an original phrase used by any character. I could perhaps forgive one character who is sarcastic and teasing all the time, but nearly every dialog exchange was full of cliches and sarcasm. And when the characters were being serious, they were melodramatic. There were too many coincidences which inplausibly dragged the plot along. Finally, the backdrop against the legend of Imperial Russia and the modern corrupt Russian businessman-mafioso was just the icing on the cake. I'm not a literature nazi, and I'm game for a pulp fiction read every now and then. But I should be able to enjoy a story without uttering \\"oh, puh-lease\\" every few minutes. I haven't read any other Cussler novels, but I'm not inclined to after this one. For a better read in this genre, try Ken Follet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clive Cussler can do better.","review":"As much as I have tried I cannot say that I have enjoyed this novel.

I've been fascinated by his imagination since I read Raise the Titanic years ago, and I've read a number of his books since. First, it is too much a reworking of other novels and too little an adventure based on historical possibilities. Second, it appears to be written with Hollywood, not readers, in mind; one can almost read the script's instructions between the lines and the director's voice in the background. Too bad. It really was an idea with possibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"The book was here ahead of time.The copy was excellent.I call that excellent work.Thank you Dotty"},{"rating":"1","title":"fire ice falls short","review":"Although Cussler is one of my faves, I struggled through this one mightily.

Rowell and Sewell capture the majesty of one the world's most beautiful urban areas to describe nature's ability to adapt and thrive next to mankind. A surprising array of wild animals are photographed within the ex-urban landscape and combine with dramatic Bay Area landscapes to make a compelling story of the beauty that surrounds us--if only we can take time out from our busy lives to see it! This is a great gift to bring back East for the holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for great cause.","review":"This book was very interesting. Not only did it have plenty of photos, the text was actually useful and have a great message. Reading Galen's work is just as great as looking at it.

I read the back of my DVD version of this epic drama and I saw at the beginning of the story that the movie was based on a true story in WWII.The Allies learn that the Nazis are building launch pads for their new V-1 rockets to launch againist the Normandy invasion, but the one thing that keeps them from launching is a special rocket fuel that they need from fuel factory located underneath a mountain inside a Norwegian fjord. The only way to stop the threat is send a group of Mosquito bombers to bomb the mountain because it has a earth fissure inside of it. If the bombers succeed, the mountain will bury the factory forever. Can Roy Grant and 633 Squadron pull it off? You'll find out in this exciting epic war drama. I recemend it for war movie buffs and model buffs too.

(Damn! Those Brits have snazzy rank titles, don't they)? The German Gestapo lady looks mighty sinister and androgynous. The only interesting thing in this film is the actual British airplane, the Mosquito. An avid flier, Cliff wanted to buy it from the owner who wouldn't sell. Watch this in a parachute harness.

I found a used book at our library on the plane in this movie, the Mosquito, and found it was pretty unique. So I thought I'd see if you had any used movies and you did. Nice watching this again. The DVD was a little scrambled a times, but the price was very fair (could be my player too) and nothing I couldn't view around. Nice getting the original artwork (I'm not a collector by any means though!). I'd recommend this movie to anyone interested in the subject matter. From brief research, it seems there is interest (other movies have been made in the men who flew these planes and the plane itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a mystery to me","review":"Its a mystery to me that this music is not considered an essential work of Mr. Coltrane. First heard it as a little Hippie boy back in 1972 when it was first released and I was astounded by the beautiful melancoly of its mood. I like the strings and think they evoke a very spiritual sound which adds a nice touch of mystique to the whole project. This little Hippie boy with his all too vivid imagination would lay on the floor listening to this music late at night and imagine visiting the tombs of Pharoahs above the Nile, meditate on the deep sorrow and lost soul of Marolyn Monroe and then wake the next morning and wonder if reality was more inside me than outside me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken by a 3 year old in 24 hours","review":"I don't get Thomas the train toys.

Kaplan gushing biography buries Gore Vidal under too much admiration and too many useless (and occasionally, repetitive) facts. We learn little or nothing of Vidal as a person or as a writer. Kaplan writes well so even if bored and ultimately without a better understanding of the author in any meaningful way I was able to finish reading the 800 page book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gore Settling Scores?","review":"The jacket tells us that Fred Kaplan \\"enjoyed complete access to Vidal's papers, letters\\" but \\"was guaranteed a free hand by Vidal to write as he saw fit\\". Sadly though the book comes across as an opportunity for Mr. Vidal to settle scores with his old enemies. Mr. Kaplan rarely, if ever, suggests that Mr. Vidal may be the source of the cat fights with his old pals.After an argument with Bobbv Kennedy at a social function in the Whitehouse wherein Mr. Vidal suggests to Bobby Kennedy that the FBI is \\"cozy\\" with the Klu Klux Klan, they clash and Vidal flees from a \\"terrible bad karma in the air\\". Quoting the author, Fred Kaplan \\"\\"he found himself at a table with Ethel Kennedy, Robert Kennedy's wife and two other equally dull people, a tediousness that flowing champagne helped make tolerable\\".It was comments like this throughout the book that made me wonder how objective this bio was ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Gore, don't like this book","review":"As a long-time fan of Gore Vidal (both the man and his work) I was disappointed with Kaplan's treatment. He is overly fawning of Vidal and looks at all events soley through his subject's eyes. The result is a fawing biography with little, if any, critical analysis or realism about Vidal. Kaplan also has a propensity for constantly droning on about Gore's good looks. Every few pages we are reminded that Vidal was \\"handsome,\\" striking\\" or given details about his mesmerizing pulchritude. Enough, already.There was ample gossip and name dropping, so if you're into dirt on the Kennedy's, Capote or Gore himself, you won't be disappointed. But if you're seeking a serious or even semi-critical examination of Gore, flaws and all, you won't find it here.It's a shame, because few men of any generation have had the brains, wit and talent of Gore Vidal, but he has proven elusive to the picklocks of biographers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not an authorized biography!","review":"I have heard Vidal speaking about this book, and it is not authorized- the author refused to show it to him before publication, and he considered trying to block its publication. Since it came out, he has refused to read it, but has made numerous comments about the author's shoddy research, citing several examples of inaccuracies. The author also continually lied to the press about Vidal, saying that Vidal had asked him to write this biography, which he did not do, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many, Too Much","review":"Too many dropped names dropped too often. Too many references to Vidal's good looks: twice in the same paragraph in addition to every dozen or so pages. Too much repetition--of the good looks, of the dropped names, of the same old childish feuds reopened and redissected too often.And yet there seemed to be some serious omissions. No mention of whether Gore's grandfather, T. P. Gore, was related to the Tennessee Gores. No mention in almost 800 pages of the House Un-American Activities Committee or Joseph McCarthy and his infamous hearings, although Vidal was a person intimately involved in both Hollywood and politics.I rarely think a book is too long, but for this one, I'll make an exception. The book was too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough if nothing else.","review":"Kaplan is far to thorough in his autobiography of a man who isn't yet dead. The book goes on and on, and while factual, tries to be too clever, as if Kaplan were trying to imitate Vidal's wit in his own presentation of Vidal. This will probably only appeal to the most feverish followers of Vidal (like me). Everyone else would be better served by Vidal's semi-autobiographical novel, Palimpsest. Alternatively, wait until the poor guy passes when writers will get the chance to give Vidal the same treatment he gave Lincoln and Burr."},{"rating":"1","title":"not completely bad","review":"rather than seeing the cup as 2/3 empty, i'm gonna try to look at it as 1/3 full. there are 3 good things about this album. 1) \\"why i'm here\\", 2) \\"i walk alone\\", and 3) \\"how could i?\\"the only other one you might not want to skip is \\"stupid\\", as this song is fairly mediocre and not painful at all to listen to"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"there is nothing at all special adout this disc. half the songs are bubble gum music. one song even sounds like rick springfield. a couple of decent songs, a pretty ballad if that is what you are into, but otherwise mediocre. very sophmoric lyrics. this band may attempt a second release but if it is not a whole lot better they will be dropped by their label. i can't imagine that there will be another single released from february son."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE GOOD SONG; ONE TERRIBLE CD","review":"I HEARD THE SONG \\"WHY IM HERE\\" ON THE RADIO.

Evidently unaware that grunge was itself metal; Oleander set out to disprove the elusive myth. They are a throw back's throw back, representing the leading edge of metal before it descended in the self indulgent clich��s of the hair bands. Hard, edgy and only slightly screechy, Oleander will doubtless please old Dio fans who are looking for a return to the good old days, when Devils were devils and rock bands thought that loud meant good.

Exporting text thru Outlook is the ONLY option as far as I can tell. major PITA.The sound quality is nearly incomprehensible, the only way it works well is on speaker phone.The operating system runs at a snail's pace, startup and tasks are very slow.To listen to MP3s on it, one needs to purchase special headphones.It has a tendency to freeze.

Mars is jealous, or so i've heard, because Mogwai have not toured there as yet. Maybe in the future they could take their quote unquote POST ROCK to the red sandy beaches and play to a sold-out crowd near the face on Mars. I'm willing to bet after they play Mars, astronomers peering at the face will see a smile.This album is sheer brilliance. Satan Fear Mogwai for making such great music to fill my ears for years.

Every track goes along at the same slow dirge like pace that you often can't tell where one song ends and the next one begins. Just once you wish they would speed up the tempo a bit and get a good toe tapping rhythm happening. Intead they insist on trying to stun the listener with loud \\"emotional\\" bursts of guitar feedback in between the boring claustrophobic soundscapes zzzzzz... If you want album that does the same type of thing but much, much better, get Sonic Youth's \\"Murray Street\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"what am i missing?","review":"I purchased this, listened, listened, and listened some more and I just can't figure out why people like this album at all. It doesn't help that the band is outrageously ripping off Slint. The album also sounds very schizophrenic, every song sounds different, but NOT in a good way... sounds like a band that is just starting out, trying to cover a lot of sonic ground, but not doing a good job of it. The one exception I don't mind is 'Tracy', although the track is 7+ minutes and only 3 minutes of it is actual music, those 3 minutes are pleasing to the ears. Sorry but adding ironic phone conversations and having tracks of just noise does not help, Godspeed can get away with that, because they know how to use it in their songs in an effective way. The stuff done on this album has been done before and better by others, just go listen to some slint, godspeed or my bloody valentine instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Guy No Like","review":"What the heck makes this \\"post rock?\\" It sounds like second rate guitar rock to me, repetive in a boring--rather than blissed out--way, with dynamic extremes that sound gimmicky rather than cathartic, opaque production and uninspired playing (I hesitate to mention song-writing because these guys are a jam band). A hopeful prediction from the 47 year old guy contingent: you 20 somethings who are slobbering over this will eventually come to your senses and go after some REAL noise: Bardo Pond, Flying Saucer Attack, Spacemen 3, Amp, Jessamine, Loop, older Flaming Lips, MBV, Lovesliescrushing, or maybe even the Stooges or MC5. If you insist on the post rock thing, Sigur Ros or GSYBE.

I bought this CD after hearing and reading a lot about Mogwai. What a disappointment! This is a 'nothing' band. Honestly guys, to be fair to the band, I gave them a lot of my time, over and over again, but it just does nothing. In fact it is one of the worst CD's in my vast and varied collection.

This ain't progressive. Let me tell you why it is absolutely horrible.First, the indivdual level of skills in the band are horrible. Second, they play bad together. After 2 years of piano lessons, I could play better than whoever did in a couple tracks.The purpose of the percussionist in a rock group is to be the leader - there were times when I could imagine a far better beat at about 2x or 4x the pace with more creativity.

Also, if you listen too much to this you will probably warp your ability to enjoy any decent music for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not popular music","review":"Was persuaded by the positive reviews (which sounded very educated mind you) to try something different. OK, so I found out I really value rhythm, continuity, and meaning in music. Which means I can appreciate the likes of Pink Floyd but not this inharmonious bunch called Mogwai. This is actually more like Heavy Metal, not \\"Pop\\", so I wouldn't have wasted my money if it has been properly labelled as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seatbelts please...","review":"Despite all comparisons to Slint, Tortise and Aerial M, Mogwai really kick-started the brand of music played by the aforementioned bands along with GSYBE!, Sigur Ros and Labradaford with this album. Right from the start they establish the buoyant, exhilarating, aggressive mood that runs throughout the record. However, darker, calmer tones emerge in tracks such as \\"Tracy\\" and the haunting \\"R U still in 2 it.\\" Yet the highlights are by far \\"Like Herod\\" and \\"Mogwai Fear Satan.\\" The former rumbles along for a bit, peters out, and then hits the listener on the rebound like a freight train. The first time I heard it I flinched. The last track on the album is a perfect conclusion, a gradual crescendo into all-out riffs, and then coming back down on the high, simple melody of Barry Burn's flute. This is by far the best album on my shelf, and should be prequisite listening for any true rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Essential Post Rock Album...","review":"This cd is great. No, its excellent. It's one of those albums you can put on repeat for days, and no matter what your doing, it is enjoyable. The final track 'Mogwai Fear Satan' is probably their best song, and its just a glorious track. Other standouts are 'Yes! I Am A Long Way From Home', 'Like Herod', and 'Tracy'. Mogwai draws from bands like Black Sabbath (and I swear there is a hint of Smashing pumpkins in there at points) to make beautiful instrumental rock. My not giving it 5 stars is only because several of the tracks (more specifically 'With Portfolio' and 'R U Still In 2 It') are a little weaker than the rest and because of that, almost sound like filler, which is a shame. However, that is no reason to NOT go out and buy this record right away. It is Mogwai at its best, and one of the few reasons to be excited about rock music today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Control","review":"A truley wonderful record.

I genuinely felt for the main character, Zoe, who has had a lifetime of hardship and pain, and who is still managing to cope gracefully. Reading about the budding romance between Zoe and Keevan filled me with anticipation -- it was absolutely delicious! Fields does an excellent job with the setting -- the descriptions are so vivid and accurate that they matched perfectly my memories of having lived in the same neighborhood. The story's subplots, too, were expertly woven. When I finished this book, I found myself thinking it would make a terrific film, if handled sensitively."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DEFINITE SURPRISE TO ME","review":"I bought this book for all the wrong reasons. #1. Because my best friend from high school lived in Park Slope, the setting of this book. #2. Because it had Brooklyn in the title. #3. I felt nostalgic just looking at the cover. What a surprise it was to me when I finally got around to reading it. A thoroughly enjoyable love story (not gushy at all) with terrific descriptions of living in a \\"neighborhood\\" and all that that brings with it. It ended up to be one of my top 10 picks in '98."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific, poetic, and a great love story to boot!","review":"Crossing Brooklyn Ferry is a great book for anyone who cares about neighborhood and continuity. It is set in Park Slope in Brooklyn, but its theme is universal. Jennie Fields has the knack for capturing the beauty of the neighborhood and the importance of its history. There is also some pretty sexy writing-- it is a love story, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont know if it's the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely a contender.","review":"The complete, utter, and absolute lack of intelligence or originality in this movie might have been something I could have overlooked had the producers given it even the remotest suspense or brio. They entirely failed at this though. Basement Jack features risible acting even by C-movie standards and is so ridiculous and even cartoonish in its portrayal of its events I couldn't even try to bring myself to suspend disbelief enough to appreciate its supremely amateurish antics. Aside from having Michele Morrow as eye candy and a semicapable actress, there's literally nothing redeemable about this worthless flick. I regret having wasted two hours of my life sitting through this cliche-ridden, utterly unsatisfactory dreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basement Jack is one of the great slasher films!","review":"Basement Jack is an excellent horror film that reminds me of the great slasher films of the 80's. I was skeptical at first wondering if this movie will deliver what it promises with all the praise this film has been getting from critics and festivals, so I really needed to check this film out. And I'm so glad I did. It does deliver with gore, a top notch bloodbath scene in the police HQ, and Lynn Lowry as his screwed up mother. WOW! I really enjoyed the dark atmosphere of this film as well as the pacing, it was very steady and didn't lag like you can find in some slasher films and the dark atmosphere really helped keep an unsettling feel as Jack drifts from kill to kill. I truly see this as a birth of a new horror icon as long as they don't do any supernatural hijinks like the Friday The 13th franchise did. This film is proudly displayed in my horror collection, and Long Live Basement Jack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible","review":"I like a romance as well as anyone. I not only don't require books be brilliantly written to enjoy them, I don't LIKE literary fiction, or books where the writing is more important than the story. But this book is so badly written that it distracts from the story. If you want a book about gay men in professional sports, read \\"The Dreyfuss Affair.\\" This particular book is really dreadful, and doesn't even have any good sex scenes to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on indoor aeromodeling!","review":"Ron William's book Is an incredible resource for indoor flyers. Indoor models have seemed mysterious even to many outdoor flyers, but this book shows how to go from a simple Delta-Dart like glider to world class F1D planes weighing around 1 gram. Although the Aircraft types are a bit dated (Easy-Bee is now rather difficult, F1D planes are now much smaller and covered in plastic, Superthin plastics replaced many other coverings...)The building techniques are the same, and so are the formulas for loading and prop-form carving. Contest flyers should also get Lew Gitlow's newer book \\"indoor flying models\\" but William's Book is a truly indespencible resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbly illustrated and still the best book","review":"As the other reviewers state, this is the book to get on free flight indoor model airplanes. The author illustrates / draws for a living; his well crafted and instructive drawings are better than photographs in showing you how to build such models.I agree with the other reviewer that Novice or Limited Pennyplane is by far now a better class to build and fly for your first competition class model.As others comment, some aspects are a bit dated but it is still the best book.

So you aren't getting a bargain no matter how low the price looks. (Reminds me of the old addage about when something looks to good to be true...). That said, I only paid $60 including shipping and I will not have a chance of getting the shipping costs returned at this point, so I am going to hang on to it. The needles do look only about a 3.5 on a \\"real looking\\" scale of 1-10. It is sparse, but that's OK with me. What I really hate is the way the lights are strung. Very messy - like they were wrapped onto the tree by a chimpanzee. If I had it to do over again I wouldn't buy this tree even at the $60 (including shipping) price. That said, the cheap trees at Wal-mart ($40 range)looked worse.

I ordered the DI-624 wireless router, DWL-G810 wireless bridge, and DWL-650 Cardbus adapter in the hopes that replacing my current 802.11b infrastructure would be easier with a single-source solution. I was very, very wrong.This product simply did not work with the DI-624 wireless router which supposedly was based on the same standards as the DWL-G810 (802.11g). After tech support recommended I install the _beta_ firmware upgrade, this device lost 1 out of every 2 packets received from the router. This after struggling with this machine for 3+ hours just to get it to connect to the router.

For example I've plugged it into my Playstation2, my computer in the garage when I want Internet access, a laptop when my friend came over, and even my Dad's PDA with Ethernet adapter installed.The setup is rather simple, just follow the instructions, reboot the box and plug it into whatever you want. Just make sure it is within range, and sometimes fiddling with the antenna helps with the signal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This isn't a wireless bridge, it's a wireless jammer. It works for about 60 seconds, bridging flawlessly, and then it jams my access point hopelessly (it won't work again until the DWL-G810 is turned off for good and the access point is power cycled). And this is after flashing the unit with the latest firmware. The firmware that shipped on the unit was 2.13, which the D-Link website says is beta firmware and not to be used for anything but testing. Say what? They shipped that?I should note that I tried it with WPA encryption. The unit may work better with no encryption, or perhaps with WEP. But those modes are unacceptable, especially in an 802.11g network, where you expect WPA as a matter of course.Beware this unit, unless you're in the market for an 802.11g jammer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even work with other D-Link Products","review":"I purchased the product to use with a ReplayTV unit. I followed the instructions for configuring it (a pain; see other reviews). While the DWL-G810 would \\"see\\" my D-Link DI-824VUP (router with wireless access point), it wouldn't connect to it even with the DWL-G810 within a few feet of the router, using all default settings, and encryption turned off. I found D-Link's customer service to be unhelpful and ultimately returned the product. My D-Link router works fine with my wired network, but I would avoid their wireless products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad DLink dropped the ball.","review":"I am usually a fan of DLink products but they really dropped it on this so called bridge. This is absolutely not a bridge.

I'm happy to say that, after switching firmware, I'm bridging my network at 54mb/sec. The web interface even says DWL-G810 on it.

My only pet peeve, and that's all it is, is that the connector is NOT waterproof and when there is 12V across it and it rains, the plating comes off the electrodes.In the future for long term connections, I'd wrap a piece of electrical tape around the junction to keep water out - that would prevent the deplating of the conductors inside from leakage current.The nice part is that it has a cover on one end to keep water out when not in use, so you can keep it nearby your car, capped, and ready to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery tender","review":"Does as advertised.

I followed the directions for each strip for each body part and the strips had no effect whatsoever. There was practically NO hair removal. I even tried heating the darned strips for 30 seconds before application - only then did a small amount of hair come off on any body part! Now, I'm not hairy Hannah or anything, but these strips wouldn't help even if I had one strand (trust me, I tried on one strand with no success!) Run, don't walk away from considering this option; it's a waste of money. Use Veet or Parissa; both are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt work","review":"i got this thinking it would work at least somewhat but it didnt work for me at all. all it did was leave my skin red and sticky and took off no hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant wash off","review":"Bad product.

I read and follow the instruction, applied to my upper lip (that's a big no no), then pull the strip according to instruction. It burn bad and left a red mark. I should have tried on hidden area first. Please do yourself a favor, do not BUY this production. I am going to write my review to all sites related to this product. It is horrible and inhuman. STAY AWAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave me hives!","review":"I tried this product just once for my eyebrows... or shall I say eyebrow. At first I was impressed that removing the strip wasn't as painful as I had anticipated. I put the lotion on and examined the results. Within seconds I started to break out in hives that looked like blisters! I had to scrub the area with soap and water and then keep an ice cold compress on my skin for it to go down. After the hives finally went away, I examined the area- the hair was still there! That was last night. This morning I woke up and my skin was STILL red where I used the strip. So this wax somehow miraculously removed my flesh, but didn't take my hair with it. I will NEVER use this again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I've tried the product once and didn't like it...i've used it on my legs and arms..it irritated my skin so bad and it didn't remove all the hair...I don't recommend it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"SH wax strips","review":"I think this is a great product.

You have to use a lot of strips just to wax your bikini line. Plus, when you warm them up in your hands, you warm up two at a time, but only use one at a time - so while you're using one warmed-up strip in a set, the other one cools down and it's hard to warm it back up without making a mess. It also hurts quite a lot for something that doesn't remove very much hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a woman's product...","review":"Which is to say, if you are a dark-skinned male with coarse hair it probably will not work well for you and cause you mild to moderate annoyance trying.

Now I have a huge \\"strip burn\\" on my chin 1/2 day later. Took forever to get the wax off of my chin. Piece of crud. Returned the product. Will try another brand and hope that it works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky skin and no hair removed","review":"These wax strips are awful! I read the instructions carefully and applied the strips even more carefully, but I still ended up with no hair removed and blotchy, red, sticky skin. The adhesive hasn't been able to be removed with face wash or dish soap, either. Plus, none of the strips are small enough to wax under eyebrows without taking off more brow than you intended. Colossal waste of money and waste of time! Save yourself the trouble and just keep tweezing."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"I thought these strips would be great and I was SO wrong. These strips left a horrible residue on my skin that would NOT wash away for days. Plus they also left this residue on any hair that they did not pull out that, again, would NOT wash away. This residue was extremely sticky and when I tried to wipe it away with an old cotton wash cloth, it actually pulled lint off the wash cloth that I could NOT get off my hair/skin without picking at it with tweezers.

BUT, if you follow directions--these work like a dream--I use them on my 12-year-old daughter, just in the very middle of her brows to get rid of unibrow (at her request, not my suggestion!)

(He confidently informs us that, contrary to the word of the novel, the tunnels in the Dora V2 rocket factory are not S-shaped - but in fact, as a glance at a map of them will show you, they are.)

He is so far removed from his best days that it is not funny. And there is no reason for it. GS could be turning out some great albums, he still sounds fantastic. But he is on autopilot and you can tell. Whoever it is that is choosing these songs - be it GS or someone else - needs to be canned immediately. They are horrible. GS has completely changed his style and has become part of the modern country music scene...that's too bad. Don't expect any more albums as good as \\"Does Ft Worth Ever Cross Your Mind\\" or \\"chill of an Early Fall\\".

George Strait just can't do no wrong when it comes to selecting songs for any of his albums. All the songs are good, but my favorites are \\"Meanwhile\\", \\"What Do You Say to That\\", and \\"I Look at You\\". In terms of country tradition, only Alan Jackson comes close. I saw George last year during his stadium tour and he's just as good live as he is in the studio. If anybody is planning to see him this year during his 18 city tour, you'll have the time of your life. I'm sure the Christmas cd and the Standards cd will be great as well.

But, when I started reading, I found myself putting it down, then picking it up and reading some more. Finally,I realized I wasn't enjoying this book and really didn't even like it. So, I put it down for good. My problem was I didn't like the heroine. I'm not sure what it was, but she never really clicked with me.

I read one of the author's other books and I remember I didn't care for it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it...","review":"This was a book I just couldn't get in to. I had gotten almost half way through, when I put it down for good. Up to that point, I still hadn't gotten to know either of the main character's personalities. Also, neither had a sense of humor and there wasn't any lively, interesting, or meaningful dialogue between them.I had high hopes, since the situation sounded like so much fun.

It lacks two main characters with substance behind their good looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Potential, Low Delivery","review":"The title is provocative, the story line is very promising, but the book ended up only so-so.Peter is so cute, earnest, and funny, but he seemed a bit one-dimensional in his pursuit of Leslie. Katherine Deauxville didn't reveal much of his personality. I could not for the life of me figure out why he was so head over heels for Leslie, who seemed pretty uptight and lacked character and vivacity.Overall, there were a handful of drop-dead funny scenes, but pages of drawn-out prose and descriptive scenes of high-society DC life in between. Around 120 pages into it, I was disappointed to find myself looking at how many more pages there were until the end.

Leslie, the heroine is one of the most irritating creatures I have come across in a long time, childish, hysterical and just blah. Most of the time I felt like smacking her upside the head and telling her to grow up! The leading man is no better. He is totally trite and always clueless. I could not bring myself to care for these characters at all! Further, the writing itself is long-winded and bulky. Many of the scenes and dialogue add nothing to the plot. If you are looking for a fun contemporary romance with snappy dialogue, a good story and characters that you can care about try Carly Phillips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better...","review":"This book left so much to be desired. It had a great idea, and I thought for sure it would be a good one. I had several big problems with this book. The hero and the heroine are actually in this book talking to each in only a few scenes. There was so much interaction between the heroine and other people--or there were just paragraphs of prose. There were so few scenes with them together and the ones that were there were very short. With a book like this, I didn't understand how either could fall in love because I never felt like they even knew each other.To end on a positive note, the few scenes where they were together were quite cute and funny. Too bad there wasn't more of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Male Vifrgin","review":"Having surepticiously viewed the conduct of ladies while they watched all-male reviews I can appreciate Ms. Deauxville's candid and clever foundation for the character, Dr. Peter Havistock.Her handling of the New Guinea locale and the pidgin language is skillful. As she weaves the story, from the fatal airplane crash with the loss of both parents; advancement through puberty on to his adult life without shame for his body and absence of sexual promisquity is excellent support for the mystery the reader will uncover.The Last Male Virgin is one of those books you cannot put down without wondering: What next?I liked it,found it moderately sensual, funny, serious and well worth recommending to others. Great cover, but far better on the inside. Don't cheat, read this one from page 1 to page 355.

If you have ever seen one of Gursky's images in the flesh you will quickly realize that this book only hints at what his prints really look like.

Of all of the Star Wars games I've owned, this is one of the worst...of all of the video games I've owned, this game is so-so.For the DS, the graphics are decent. Some of the puzzles are pretty tricky, and the minigames are enjoyable. Overall, however, the FPS aspect is pretty weak, and the game doesn't take all that long to beat. The \\"alliance\\" aspect of the game adds to the overall experience a little bit, but this game really isn't worth the price.All in all, I was pretty disappointed with this game. If you're looking for a Star Wars game, there are better games out there (Lego Star Wars is great, and the Complete Saga is out now, I've heard EPIII for DS is good, and Force Unleashed is coming out next year).

Lots of money, lots of technology to make us lazy and lots of overly relaxed morality. _Crystal Phoenix_ is the perfect example of that \\"future\\". In a world where anyone can clone themselves and have their memories stransfered to the new body, for a price, drug addiction and prostitution runs rampant. It's a violent vision of the future, to be sure, and almost a kind of morality play slightly disguised as a murder and revenge story. It's clever for what it was, but it's not the best example of science-fiction from that era.I picked it up as a kid from the paperback rack of a drugstore. At the time, I was quite titilated by all the sex and violence, but in retrospect, that was just a cover for a weak plot and a tired idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"This is a big bang for your buck, my olympus sp-510 has proven itself in many areas of photography. the only drawback, is the amount of memory, there doesnt seem to be enough memory for me if i am taking high quality shots... i would recomend a larger memory card if you plan to take lots of high quality pictures. overall great camera for the money"},{"rating":"1","title":"lack of support for olympus Digital Camera","review":"Have a S-2100 Ulta Zoom Digital Olmpus Camera had to upgrade from 2000 ME to Windows X/P and software supplyed by Olmpus does not work now must pay for new software. feel that olmpus does not support its equipment.

You can take pictures under conditions that would be impossible with a lesser camera. You have to set up the camera for the type of project you are shooting. For instance a soccer game is different than shooting a band concert. This camera is not for the beginner or a point and shoot photographer.

Great documentation, packaging, and accessories included. The music isn't going to knock your socks off and the flow is odd. It runs the spectrum from classics to a couple of rare blues tunes to silly pseudo rock 'n' roll ditties. It does include some great old automobile commercials peppered throughout. This set is a refreshing effort in these days of watered down, high margin, thoughtless packaging that goes into 90's CD releases. Hats off to Rhino!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You've finally got your own car.","review":"This is a four CD collection of \\"car songs\\".

In fact some songs, like Hank Williams' \\"Lost Highway\\" and Rod Stewart's \\"Gasoline Alley\\" are not about cars or driving at all (they are both great songs, though). Songs are in a wide variety of styles, with rockabilly and surf being represented the most. There are also a few old radio commercials for car related products thrown in.

Listening to four CDs worth of hot rod music will cement that in your brain forever. Like any genre of music, that about hot rods bore some classics (Hot Rod Lincoln, Little Deuce Coupe), and a lot of junk that's hard to listen to. This collection has a full range from the great to the awful -- a true historical perspective. This release's packaging, however, is only top rate (no junk). Very creative, and it helps make it a collectable. The essays included in the accompanying book give you a look back in time that will help even the non-hot rodder understand what all the fuss over chrome and burning rubber was all about. When I received the set, I was really hoping it would include a song called \\"Chicken\\" (I can't remember the artist -- I was less than eight the last time heard it), but perhaps one of you might know where I could lay my hands on it. Happy listening you hot rodding fools!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's A Lemon","review":"Rhino blew it with this one. Great packaging, as usual for them, but the music is slight and it's not a good value. The disks average about 50 minutes each; if I'm shelling out 60 bucks for four CD's I expect them to be packed. They could have easily put this on 3 disks. But my biggest gripe is the song selection. Rhino used to be great about choosing the perfect theme mix tape collections--they did it with the doo-wop collection, Nuggets and many others. Here, there are maybe 5 or 10 songs I'd put on my personal \\"Driving Tape\\". A car album without any Springsteen? How about \\"Drivin' Sister\\" by Mott the Hoople? \\"Cars\\" by Gary Numan? \\"Driving\\" by the Kinks? \\"Autobahn\\"? OK, I know they have to get the licensing agreements, but there are hundreds of car and road songs--many here are forgettable or just plain bad. I agree that the album doesn't flow well. However, I can't wait to put together my own driving tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This CD is great. I liked it a lot more than the other CD's. Not that they weren't great. But with Dominic actually having a band to back him up, it gave it more...intensity. There's just more there to hear. His guitar solos have also gotten extremely good. He seems a lot more comfortable with it all, and you can really tell that on this CD. It all sounded really neat with the \\"Un-American\\" instruments. And the 12-string guitars are so cool.

But this is my favorite of Theo bars, not just for the spiciness, but also because the spice quickly dissipates as the chocolate melts on the tongue, and the sting is soothed by one of the best milk chocolates I've ever tasted -- silky as it dissolves.

I thought I was really going to like this, but I thought it was terrible. There is almost no blend of the curry/chocolate flavors. It tastes like putting a big spoonful of dry curry powder in your mouth, and then taking a bit of a chocolate bar.

Buckley writes from the perspective of a high-ranking aide to Reagan's fictional successor, President Tucker, jotting down a diary as self-important as his real-life counterparts (one subplot turns around the writer's attempt to keep his parking spot, which seems to be of equal importance as the rest of the nation's business put together).Buckley is not just amusing, but often insightful. While the events of the book are absurd, the characters are often all too realistic. A must-read for Buckley fans, and highly recommended for anyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Great entertainment, humerous, insightful, easy to read, and, I suspect, more than an element of truth to how our government works."},{"rating":"2","title":"One To Return To","review":"One of Buckley's earlier efforts, The White House Mess is a slight, inconsequential book, good more for chuckles than the guffaws some of the writer's later books induce. Still, I find myself pulling it off the shelf every now and then just to pass some time.It's easy to dip in and out of Buckley's imaginary White House, a goofy place more akin to \\"That's My Bush!\\" than \\"The West Wing.\\" Putting a Democratic governor of Idaho (!) in the White House after the 1988 election, Buckley leads the reader through the most inept administration in modern political history, while also casting light on the petty maneuverings of those aides clamoring to be close to the crown, however tarnished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone explain this","review":"I haven't yet read this novel - and of course I know I should not be \\"reviewing\\" it...

Like Sistermoon, I am an anthropologist and semi-pagan, and I agree completely with her praise of this book and the others in the Eileanan series. I'm getting a bit tired of the accent (since the fairy races aren't originally from the Celtic lands of Earth, why would they have Scottish accents, too?), but it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of a tale well told."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite Fantasy series","review":"Hello, I am from Germany so please forgive me the basic language and the grammar mistakes :)I really like to recommend the whole series of the witches. The story is absolutely thrilling and keeps you reading all night long.. so be aware to have the next day off or at least prepare enough coffee :)Especially I like the relationship between the 2 twin-sisters which are so different and yet become best friends. Isabeau's struggle to find her destiny in the land of the white gods and the struggle of the whole kingdom to survive the attacks of the merciless Fargean are told in such a brilliant way that only George R.R. Martin's \\"song of ice and fire\\" series was able to involve me more into the plot and to \\"feel\\" more intensely with the characters.This fantasy series is unbelievable good.. so don't hesitate: get all 5 available books (and pre-order the 6th) and take a week off to read them all in a row.. but be aware: you will hardly sleep I promise !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Unlike others that have reviewed The Forbidden Land, I must be the black sheep and only give it 2 stars. I couldn't understand why Kate Forsyth would switch perspectives on us like that without warning. And why pick Finn to write about? She was an unworthy subject. I found it difficult to relate to Finn as a protagonist, and forgive me for being blunt, but I thought she was a twit and just wanted her to go away. I also thought it was a dirty trick for the author to leave Isabeau out of this book.However, in all fairness, Ms. Forsyth does write beautifully. Perhaps my criticism is too harsh, considering I never made it all the way through the book and allowed myself to be lead where Ms. Forsyth wanted to lead me. I struggled with this book, but halfway through gave up and went on to The Skull of the World."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finn, period","review":"Thus far, out of the first four, this is the best. Kate Forsyth has managed to create a late teen female character who literally makes sailors blush; when she's not picking their pockets. No mother has had a more troubling child and future noble - mission impossible. The author manages this, while still retaining a G rating. Don't buy this book for its plot, theme or propensity to pressure Hemingway. It's a simple book and you read it because Kate has a light and fun time creating a rich and fantastic CHARACTER. The character language is outstanding as well. It matters little where Kate takes you if you find yourself continually enjoying the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finn the Cat..","review":"This was a great side story. It really helped you get to know Finn better. It also went a little more indepth of why Dide acts the way he does. I feel like these characters are my friends. I don't ever want to part with them. It's such a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, no doubts","review":"Ahhhh! Wonderful book. Perhaps slow starting, but still interesting. While the story line is rather far and away from what we have been reading in the last three books, it is a vital portion in the story. Please remember when reading, this book and \\"Scull of the World\\" are in a way one in the same book. While the stories are different, the time frame is the same, and if these two books had been combined, all you would get would be a confusing mass of story, whereas by pulling the stories apart, it helps negate confusion. All in all, if you enjoyed the first three, you should enjoy this, so read on! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forsyth is an excellent writer...","review":"... however frustrating it may be not to finish the story of Isabeau in the previous books. This is not to say that you shouldn't read the others in the series before this one (I highly recommend that) but you could still slip into the world of Eileanan with ease. But now, who knows how long this series could be? I went into the book a little peeved that I had waited so long to read a book about a side-character (I've followed the Witches of Eileanan series from the begining), but I was taken over by Kate Forsyth's masterful writing-- I completely forgot my frustration and wound myself in the novel. Of all the side-story books I've read, this one is the best. I highly recommend it.[Also recommended for this type of medieval-ish fantasy: Patricia McKillip... she writes like a tapestry!

Fine, but perhaps somewhere it ought to be mentioned that the majority of those are double-counted by counting both of the skinny strips that are together on one sheet? And, even when warned properly in between my hands, they did not separate well, and worst of all, left lots of residue on my legs and nearly all of the hair. Horrible Horrible product.

Anyway, when I tried it out, I was surprised that it got most of the hair off, but I still had to pluck a few strays. On the box, it says that it lasts for 8 weeks after you've waxed an area. This is a lie, because after I waxed, it grew back a few days later just like regular shaving would have done. Another thing, the box also states that the hair will grow back thinner, which is also misleading. I waxed my underarms, and the wax strips got some extra hair around the area, and after a few days, it grew back darker.

It was also really interesting, but at some points it is very surprising. The end was just so spectacular for Jessie and Ras. Ras was the African boy that Jessie taught and became friends with, after the shipwreck. But, during the book at some points it makes you want to go into the book and slap Captain Cawthorne and Benjamin Stout for what they have done, and what they continue doing to the Africans.

Oh, I forgot, you also get a briliant Ripples; the instrumental Los Endos with the drum duet; the classic hit I Know What I Like (like the old times) and of course all the hit songs from the 80's. I think When in Rome represents their greatest live action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful experience","review":"All these glowing reviews are absurd. Why? Simple.This is one of the msot boring muscial videos ever made. Director David Mallet tried to capture the experience of being in the middle of the audience. But apparently his intention was to make you feel as if you were at the bottom row of the audience! The whole thing seems so far away, so punchless, that sometimes you feel the concert is in a galaxy far, far away.Also, the endless (I repeat, ENDLESS) shots of the audience are ludicrous, never seen such a thing in a rock video.All in all, a DVD so forgettable and so unfair to the quality of Genesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD !!","review":"This DVD is one of the best music DVDs ever !

No, warning from Wal-Mart (the official supplier of the set), no warning sticker, no warning on the screen. I was very disappointed with this product.

A few weeks later, I can honestly say this appears to be the best Portugese Language Book on the market. It covers the basics of verbs, more then 12 tenses, irregular verbs, pronouns, idioms, and has both the Portugese and Brazilian form of many words and phrases.My only small compalaints are the lack of a more comprehensive dictionary and no accompanying cassette or CD to actually hear the words spoken. However those could easily be purchased on the side. I highly reccomend starting to learn Portugese right here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-promoting and flawed","review":"When i bought this book i looked up the word 'pessoa'. This means person and plural 'pessoas' means people. Grammatically this word is always feminine but applies to both male and female. This does not fit in with what this grammar teaches. I sought help. Then i was shown several faults in this book. The worst apears to be the verbs.I bought this book because i believed what it says, that it is a practical guide to the mastery of Portuguese. I fell for it and am quite annoyed with myself for being so gullible. Perhaps some good will come out of this bad experience. If this review stops other learners from making the same mistake, then it wasn't a cmplete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbled, not concise","review":"This book claims that its explanations are concise. A concise text is one that grasps the essence of its subject matter and expresses it in a compact, brief manner. In this book brevity of expression is achieved not by grasping the essence of its topics but by cutting corners. Most points are garbled, some entirely wrong. For example, 'erguer' is not a radical-changing verb as the book says. Its spelling change has nothing to do with root change. Unfortunately unless you have some background knowledge of the language you may be caught unaware. I teach Portuguese but will not recommend this book to my students."},{"rating":"1","title":"80% gimmick 20% substance","review":"This book boasts it gives you verbs and grammar (as if verbs were not grammar!).Sweeping statements, muddled notes, this sums up what you find when you open the book.

It is far from being an authoritative grammar book that will lead you to the mastery of Portuguese, as it appears to think it is. It lacks the background knowledge of the language that will enable to streamline what is important and what comes second. It is very much, as I said, a tentative work of a beginner learner, not the competent guide a master can devise. Not good enough.As someone who can speak the language quite well, I was asked my opinion on this book. That is how I came across it.

They are replacing the earpiece for $65 which includes a new battery. That's a great price plus I can re-use my existing battery.

The people I talk to hear me fine. I hear them fine. But my own voice sounds a bit distorted to me.Be prepared that it is NOT a bluetooth headset. You must still answer the phone by picking up the handset and then engage the headset. And if the call ends and you are away from the handset you have to return to hang it up. There is a separate handset 'lifter' that solves this but I think I will wait until I find the type of device I really want. For now it works.As headsets go this is a lower cost unit.

Just wanted to clarify the compatibility as it would've saved me a fair bit of aggravation had the description stated this for use with a corded phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"After spending a lot of money for a wireless replacement to my older wired office Plantronics S10A headset, I was sorely disappointed. The sound quality on both the transmit and receive is tinny and distorted. A buzzing sound accompanies the voice in the earpiece, and each person I spoke with complained that I must be using a cell phone with a bad connection. I spent two days trying all the many adjustments for different sound levels on both speaking and listening, but nothing got rid of the buzzing, hissing, and distortion. I went back to my old wired S10A, and was rewarded with a HUGE improvement in sound quality - a reasonable tradeoff for living with the wire. I sent the CS50 back for a refund!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent wireless headset","review":"This product is purchased by my employer for some employees as the latestgeneration wireless headset. My wired headset was on the blink and I wantedthis one, but my manager could not authorize it unless he was prepared tobuy one for all 15 people on our team. So I bought it myself. It was $300at Best Buy, but only $200 here ($190 if my company buys it). It iseverything I expected. Clear to follow setup directions had me up andrunning in minutes (except for the charging period, of course). I've onlytested it to 100 ft., though it claims 300+ ft. I really like that thereare 3 different ear holder sizes to use, for maximum comfort and best fit.Get one- you won't be disappointed. It's a bit pricey for home use, formy purposes, but it's a dream at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it would be","review":"As a serious collector of Tarot Card decks and sets, I added this one to my collection right away.

But the coating on the cards makes them stick together at times. I was really disappointed by this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personality at Work","review":"I was disappointed in the book and would not recommend it.

Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Lesson Indeed","review":"Happy Lesson is a story about an orphan named Chitose. 5 of his teachers learn he is an orphan and decide to live with him and be his surrogate mothers. Incidentally all of his mothers are hot, and a little bit crazy. That's pretty much the story in a nutshell. It's all very simple and entertaining.The animation isn't bad and the music adds a little bit of a lighthearted mood. It took me a couple episodes to get used to the voice actors. I wasn't familiar with most of them. There not too bad. It's a series you can watch more than once. I would compare it to Tenchi Muyo, or Magikano. Tenchi is definitely better, but Happy Lesson is definitely better than Magikano. I really enjoyed this anime and I think it's worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD does not play","review":"I purchased this as a christmas gift and unfortunately it does not play.I was not aware that the DVD was supposed to be for blueray only!?I even sent an email to the suppliers but customer service is a bust.I guess better luck next christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"The fact that Blue Ray is becoming popular, now I can get the DVD for super cheap!

The Disney copy protection if OVER THE TOP! I am a major geek so I was able to break the copy protection and play my disc, but the regular human being that wants to watch on their computer is going to be very disappointed. Shame on you Disney, don't you know if the pirates want to copy this, they will?

There is no question that you get a top quality cartoon...but the rest is just rude.Lion King is to my opinion the best Disney cartoon there has been made. The plot, the characters and just everything about the cartoon is fascanating. Five stars fort the actual cartoon.How ever, you get an insight in what kind of a \\"dinosaur\\" Disney has become when you try to play the DVD.First of all; you are forced to watch all the other disney commercials -1star.If you wish to watch it on PC, you are forced to install a special program from Disney -2stars. Just not necessary since the VLC player can play the cartoon perfectly and is not as boring as this Disney player.To summerize; you pay for a top product and get commercials and boring program.

For one, the layout of the DVD is a total disgrace. I had to sit for hours trying to find the \\"real\\" version of the film (without that silly Morning Report song) and finally found it under \\"Languages\\". Of course, I should have looked there first. How silly of me.The animation has been completely changed - if you have the old VHS version you should compare them. The crocodiles with the birds in their mouths are completely different in I Just Cant Wait to be King, and the colors in the film have been changed to brighter, more bolder colors which make the scenery look totally unrealistic compared to the VHS. Seriously, is this some sort of joke? I grew up with this movie, and now that Im older I was excited to see it again after all those years, but I was just disappointed. I am hoping that disney are trying to trick us and will release something much better than this. This DVD was the biggest waste of money.

To be honest with you, I didn't really enjoy it that much. I didn't have a problem with the animation or the sound, it's just the story. The story is the most important element, here. But, Disney plaigerized the idea for this movie from another source, and didn't do a good job, to be honest with you. This movie was so boring and sappy that it sickened me. I found movies like Aladdin, Mulan, Lilo and Stich, and Home on the Range to be much more enjoyable than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER VERSION","review":"Great DVD but you get a little tired of how Disney plays the marketing game.

The audio is the same. The colors are the same. And the details in the moving characters are the same.There is a slight difference in the details of the background, but not enough to justify upgrading from DVD to Blu-Ray.And I have found this to be the case of all hand-drawn animated movies. Of course, Pixar's computer-animated movies are a different story.However, if you do not as yet have the DVD, this Blu-Ray set is worth purchasing (but not at typically-high Disney prices). The Lion King certainly has one of best musical scores of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missed having this one.","review":"My son had a copy of this and when he moved away, he took it with him.

In my opinion it is one of the best animated films ever made. After having watched the original on VHS for all these years it was exciting to see the crisp and clear version of it on Bluray. The audio and video in this edition are amazing, and there is a version of the movie with a new song. And though I found the new song a little out of place, my son loved it.

It seems like it was thrown together at the last minute. The story, and even the songs, are nothing but a montage of still pictures. The only good thing about this DVD might have been that you can learn foreign languages from it. The story and a couple songs in German, Italian, Castilian Spanish, and French are included. However, even that isn't perfect. I can speak German, and I noticed that a lot of words in the German story and songs were spelled wrong, or even in some cases, words were stuck together because someone forgot to hit the spacebar. For a $14.00 DVD, they didn't even bother to spell-check. Which is a real shame, because this DVD could've been a great tool to practice a foreign language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lion King 3D","review":"This is one of the best blu-ray transfers that Disney has come out with yet. The picture and sound was top notch with the effects and sourround stage immersive and quite possibly the best use of 3D since the release of Avatar. Those expecting a \\"wow\\" 3D effect will be disappointed, the 3D for this movie is to create an immersive effect not have things jump out at you because they can. The best use of 3D in the film is the opening sequence, Stampede sequence, Simba running through thorns, adult Simba running through undergrowth and the Scar fight sequence. Highly recommended for anyones collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood Classic","review":"This was by far my favorite movie as a child. I just recently got a 3D TV and Blu-ray player so as soon as this came out I ordered it. The shipping was fast and free, as great as ever. While watching it so much as a child I had essentially memorized the whole movie. When I first put the 3D version in I was instantly blown away with the detail and impressive 3D effect that even the title menu had been given. The whole movie all the way through impressed me with how well it had been redone in 3D.This is an overall great movie, from the plot to the graphics.

This movie is a classic. It's not your typical child's movie. The \\"Circle of Life\\" theme moved me when I was 8 and again many years later.

Here is a tip for 3-D movie buyers - if the movie was not originally filmed in 3-D, it will not be that wonderful. Perhaps one exception is the Titanic, as the director in his usual professional way, took great care with every single frame. Most of the movies that are converted are just cranked out to make money. The Lion King had so few good 3-D effects, we were shocked. Our policy now is pretty much just to buy the movies that came to the theaters in 3-D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uh...

I would have bought this and given it five stars even if it didn't have a new song. But unfortunatly disney decided they needed to add a new crappy song so they could market it and sell more copies.

Some have suggested that this movie is too rough for young children. To the contrary, the action scenes were realistic (remember that this is children's animation!) and necessary. The violence played an unfortunate but requisite role in the \\"circle of life\\" the story portrayed.I may be a bit behind, but am looking forward to viewing the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a masterpiece","review":"I'm not sure why this film resonated so deeply with me, but even though it's animated (and I'm no Disney movie fan -- I don't shun them, it's just not typically my thing), I can honestly say that THE LION KING is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. It really is that good. I was in my mid-20s when this movie hit the theaters (and ran up some huge box office numbers, if I recall), and I remember being amazed at how many adults were in the theater -- without kids! Like many others, I am eagerly awaiting the DVD release of this wonderful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sound Effects","review":"If you have good stereo system this movie is great to see,especially if you have all speakers set-up in \\"surround\\" studio or layout you'll hear the sound effects crystal clear.Some examples in the movie:1) Simba meet Uncle Scar2) Simba's dad (Fauso), got angry with the laughing Hyena...3) Towomba & pomba singingJust to list a few that I can remember...Have fun"},{"rating":"2","title":"The last great Disney movie...","review":"To me, this was the last Disney production that was excellent. The animation is astounding and the plot keeps you watching. Im 15 years old and i still watch it. The music is stirring and the emotions of the movie almost move me to tears every time i see it (you cant help feeling incredibly sad when Mufasa dies). The bottom line is, if you havent seen this movie, no matter what your age, see it. Then see it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reworking of Shakespeare's Hamlet.","review":"When you see the Lion King unavoidably for the 70th time like I have, you grow really sick of it. From the music to the storyline, it all breeds contempt. But the movie itself shouldn't be punished for its overexposure. It's a good story, even though it is similar to Hamlet. And it's a good movie. I won't venture to say it's the best cartoon ever because there are still other movies like Cinderellla and Snow White in existence; but it is definitely ONE of the best.The only picky issue I have is with the voices. They have the strong commanding voice of James Earl Jones as the father, which is right on point; yet they have Matthew Broderick as the voice of the son. He sounds like he hasn't yet reached puberty even though he's grown.Other than this, the film is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"The movie showed great promise when it first came out and has been loved by children and adults ever since, and will be for many years to come. I enjoyed seeing it with my family happy that there was finally something that will bring them together. I thank you very much for the making of this movie and all other Disney classics. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any youngster's library","review":"This classic story is filled with important life lessons presented with appropriate viewer language. My kids have been introduced to how all life is connected on this planet. It is a great resource for kids to associate how life works between species. The family story is also important. All of this packaged with great songs and enchanting performances from the actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for kids who don't have the critical thinking skills to realize this is a terrible Disney movie.","review":"I saw this when I was a kid, but I had already formed critical thinking skills, so the movie was ruined for me. The mere fact that the story is plagiarized makes it lose all credibility. I don't know why that isn't talked about more, but regardless I don't think that this is all that people hype it to be. The musical actually is much more impressive and has a lot more creativity and talent behind it than this. Disney is responsible for some of the most influencial animated movies of our time and this does not deserve to be one of them. I'm suprised Disney did not rise from his grave to haunt the producers. At minimum, i'd call this one of the most overrated movies of our time. At most, it is a bloated perversion of credible animated film and a violation of the creative spirit that drives the animation industry forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it as a kid still love it now!","review":"This was one of my favorite movies as a kid, and I was so excited to get it on DVD! I had not seen it in years! It was cool watching the movie and remembering bits and pieces of it. It has a lot more songs than I remember tho! Overall great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"always been a great movie","review":"Great movie!!! Yes I am 34 years old and always liked this movie...its great for everyone and anyone!!

Why would you not want this movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lion King","review":"The cover was torn and ratty. The discs looked fine but the appearance.... I bought this dvd for my children for Christmas, and it looks like I got it from a used bin at Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Version","review":"Although the new version of this classic is beautiful (I don't care for it- don't like alterations of originals) I bought this DVD for the sole purpose of owning the original version in DVD format. This DVD claims to have both versions of the film and that the viewer will be prompted to choose one. However, the screen that is supposed to give the viewer that choice NEVER happens. I am very disappointed with this DVD and am hopeful to hear from the seller soon. Perhaps he/she didn't know about this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lion King -- Absolutely Wonderful!!!","review":"This movie is probably one of my very favorite. The animation and beautiful colors are wonderful throughout the whole movie. I know that I sat with my oldest granddaughter through this movie 30 times, and now that my youngest grandson is born... we sit and watch it another 30 times and love it each and every time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected","review":"I expected the DVD to carry the original Lion King movie/story. Instead, it is a modified story book edition with little if any animation, although the cartoons are all faithful to the originals. However, it really fails in achieving anywhere near the entertainment value, emotion and wonder of the movie or theatre performance. All in all - a big letdown. The only saving grace was that the price fell dramatically by shipment time and there are a couple of neat little inter-active games that keep young children interested for about 15 to 20 minutes. My suggestion - save your money; wait and see if they ever release the actual movie on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"I got my movie and it was in perfect condition and arrived in a timely manner.

I have to say that James Shaw (at media_fun) sent me out a new dvd right away. Well, number 2 dvd also stoped in the same place the first dvd did. They did not seem authentic. On the DVD I purchase from Redford entertainment on the back was writting in small letters The lion king 2 Simba's pride, there was no writing on the back of The Lion King. I sent them both back and hope to get a full refund.Cheri Reynolds"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD WAS NOT NEW AS LISTED, VERY DISAPPOINTED AND WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I was very concerned when I opened the DVD package and the DVD case cover graphics looked as if it had just been photocopied.

I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED and will not be ordering from Amazon or another seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD didn't work","review":"DVD I received was unbalanced and doesn't work.

I ordered The Lion King because I was always impressed with the graphics and soundtrack. The disks I received had a huge pause in one of the tracks and finally stop playing all together on the first play. I removed it from the player, made sure that it was clean replaced it and it never played correctly. I am not one to send things back because of the hassle but I expect that when I purchase something that it work properly. I did not get a chance to enjoy the movie at all. Money down the drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lion King","review":"\\"The Lion King\\" is a classic Disney movie. Nothing surpasses it!

I also have to give Disney credit, cause it looks like they are really starting to get the hang of 3d. Can't wait to see what they have in store next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant movie perfected!","review":"The Lion King still stands as one of my all time favourite Disney movies and as thrilled as I was to get the Special Edition DVD, the Blu Ray really surprised me. What great detail! The cover is superb and the menu has a lot more options than the dvd player and not to mention multi-region as well, all advanced!The picture quality is superb and my old VHS copy was very watered down,. It looked like a poor remastering of an old colour tv. Thankfully, the dvd and blu ray got rid of all that and contrasted the colours.The same thing goes for Bambi, which I have also got on blu ray, Pinocchio and Beauty and the Beast. The rest are still being planned. I am looking forward to 101 Dalmatians coming out on blu ray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE","review":"I HAVE A 3 YEAR OLD NIECE AND A 12 YEARS OLD SISTER AND THEY BOTH LOVED THIS MOVIE.

A cheat! A scam almost! Disney was in competition with the company creating Kimba: The White Lion. Kimba...Simba...wow. It really took a long time to come up with that. -_- Also, some shots of the show, Kimba, and the movie, Lion King, proved that it was rip. Even the thorns part of the movie was taken from Kimba! Lion Fink was a Disney Ripoff. They don't deserve your money. Save it for something better. MUCH better. Not Lion King 2 either. Believe me, listen to this review, and you've made the right choice. My advice: Don't Buy Any Lion King Movies. Whether it's 1, 2, 1-and-a-half, don't buy. 1 star. I could actually go on, but this is just brief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary and regressive","review":"I may be the only person on the planet with this opinion, but I did not like the message of this movie. The story is paternalistic in the extreme, displaying an overt and highly conservative agenda. I couldn't believe it. The Lions are a dictatorship supported by the animals in the jungle with a Nazi-ish zeal. A male child is born and seen as a savior? Where's the mom in all this? Where are the females at all except to giggle and bat their eyes, and to create male heirs?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Donkey Was Right.","review":"The reviewer Offensive Donkey was completely right. This is VERY overrated. We thought this was going to be SO great. But it isn't. It is vulgar, coarse, and filled with awful songs. Who made this a musical. If you want a good cartoon, go watch Porky Pig. You are better off watching some cheesy Fred Astaire movie than this. Lemme give you the pathetic story: A horribly irritating young lion cub is driven away by some overly evil uncle. Then he returns as a square adult with the help of his two obnoxious friends and his egotistic girlfriend. He drives the evil king away. But who made this a musical? The songs are horrible. I'm sure they were okay when Elton John sang them , but no! Some silly woman is singing them, botching them up in the process. This is truly a band movie and ought to be banned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music","review":"My son is three years old and he loves all the Lion King songs we even sing them before bedtime, how crazyy are we.
