It's very oversized--larger even than most coffee-table style books--and has lovely pictures throughout which cover every aspect of wedding celebrations. Included, of course, are many samples of Wang's own work as a bridal gown designer as well as photos from her own wedding. As a wedding planner, however, this book is less useful. Although Wang does include her own commentary, some of which is interesting and helpful, there really isn't enough information for the book to be used as comprehensive planner. Furthermore, the organization of the book is somewhat confusing, as it does not follow a typical wedding planning chronology. Despite these issues, brides-to-be and others are likelyto enjoy this book, if only to \\"look at the pictures.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't impressed","review":"I'm sure in its time many years ago this book was fabulous.

Explanations to the set of tales, and each section of tales is provided by the author, along with why he believes them to be of importance.

Can I hear an amen, brothers and sister?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord Almighty","review":"Being Irish Catholic, (ok, a ways back) it was sheer blasphemy to pick up this CD. More so that it became like a new religion. The Tom Waits comparison is the most obvious compliment. What isn't so obvious is the perfect blend of new & early music forms - like Stravinsky in reverse. I hear Italian folk, carnival and Nawlins influences mixed with dark moody indy swagger.With the Tom Waitsesque vocals and the brooding Stone Roses / Morphine style atmosphere, this is new territory which obviously strikes a chord with the musicians who take time out from their main projects to make a go of this vision. Worth their time and worth selling your soul to take the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"mixed bag","review":"The first side of this review is all praise, Norah Jones, everything about her, from her outstanding musical abilities to her eye catching good looks are in this dvd. What is lacking here though, is good acurate proportional sound reproduction. Norah\`s vocals are right on, most instruments are heard well, the base fiddle and drums however, are distant sounding and over bearing. This judgement is made being heard on a very capable sound system. What this comes down to is to listen with this flaw or not to listen at all, I\`m still glad that I own this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was wrong the night of this performance?","review":"I am a fan and have all of Norah's CD's and DVD's in this DVD Norah did not seem her her usual humble self - has she become a diva or did she have an argument with the band on the way to the show? The songs seems rushed and detached as if the performance was an obligation to get over with - she even made a comment as if the audience was not into the show -I know I was not. I would love to know what was wrong that night and I hope it was temporary issue that has been worked through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norah Jones","review":"What can be said about Norah Jones that isn't positive?

The author divides the book up by region with a section on China, Japan, India, Tibet, Arabia, the Americas, and Europe. She talks about the healing traditions of each region and the types of teas they used. I especially enjoyed the section on HIldegard von Bingen. This woman contributed much to herbal healing in an age when women didn't have the privilages and opportunities they have today. The book also contains recipes and the photography is superb. It was the picture on the cover that caused me to pick up this book. -- Val Lull"},{"rating":"2","title":"great scifi soundtrack of an underrated show","review":"Lexx is either adored or hated. This soundtrack is universally adored. I have known people who have never seen Lexx break into Ya-a-o fight song. My best friend who cannot stand Lexx chooses this CD as his prefered gaming music.

Skeptics open your mind and take a ride on the Lexx to a new universe of music. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant! A must for all Lexx lovers!","review":"If you love Lexx then buy this!

Go on, treat yourself. :-) Space Cat"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre From a Talented Writer","review":"I really like this author and have read a lot of her other work. However, this novel was a disappointment: the heroine is insipid and passive (she's the daughter of a famous novelist with a cult following but it never even occurs to her to wonder why she and the grandparents who raised her don't have any money from her mother's work?) and the subplot about the raised riverboat is too factual to really serve as a plot point for character growth. The timing of the events at the end also felt really rushed and contrived. IMHO, the relatively minor \\"father\\" character was the best one in the book.Take my advice and read _Summer's End_ by this author instead (highly recommended), or _More Than You Dreamed_, or _Again_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Resort","review":"Read this book only if you have nothing else to read! Both the characters and dialog are boring. I cared less about the characters after I read it than before I started. The author does capture the feel of small towns, but without interesting characters who wants to read about small towns! If you can't sleep, this is the book to pick up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!!!!","review":"This book is so poorly written that I thought it was a writing project for a high school class. The characters' thoughts are silly one liners without any depth. Their feelings for each other are shallow and the heroine's excuse for remaining aloof from the hero is trite. The story contains the usual fare rehashed into a silly romance without any connection between the characters and a limited story line. I could live with anything if the writing style were not so amateurish and the plot had more depth and the lovers actually connected in a believable manner. Eleanora's Ghost is just a means of moving the story along, but you never really believe in her possible existence and never feel her emotions. I'm not sure what else this author has written, but I for one will stay away from any of her romance novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book for learning C#","review":"The book is best one I have read about C#. Its logic very nice and explanation very clear. Reading it is an enjoyment for me. It will give you a solid foundation of object oriented programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, generic approach, good for VBers","review":"This book is clearly written, with no fluff. The approach is especially good for VB programmers who have some familarity with COM techniques, although this is not a requirement. Meant to be a first reading, the focus is on console applications, with only a taste of Windows forms programming (to be continued in another volume).Object-oriented programming is probably here to stay (for awhile, at least), and this book will help you to become more comfortable with this technology using C# as a vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zeroxed Book?","review":"I didn't like this book. It does not go into the individual concepts enough. I found it to be really unhelpful. And sorry, but my desk already has a paperweight.

Cooper's readers seem to want him to continue to do what he did so brilliantly in Closer and Frisk, when he's outgrown that approach, and written a novel much more complex and deep, but with all the power of his earlier books.

To be fair, the scratches were deep, most going through to the metal. Still, I had hopes that the scratch stick would at least fill in the scratches with a temporary waxy plug.After several attempts, I realized it was hopeless. It was basically like coloring over the scratches with a waxy crayon, but as soon as I wiped off the excess wax, the scratches came clean as well.I tried the black fluid polish, with the same result. No matter how I applied it, or carefully removed the excess, the scratches were unveiled as if never treated.So if you're just looking to improve some very minimal surface scratches it might work for you as it apparently did for other reviewers. But if you have scratches to the metal, even hairline ones, don't expect anything at all from this treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Was really excited to try this on my black Chrysler 300.

EXTREMELY pleased with the results - decent wax and the tinting really filled in the scratches which had been highly visible white, now are a slightly less than black color. This is the best my car's finish has looked in years, inclusive of professional wax jobs I've gotten on occasion."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than regular wax","review":"I tried this on relatively new Mercedes Benz with black paint. The \\"Chip Stick\\" is basically a black crayon or tube of hard black lipstick. It works somewhat, but doesn't solve the problem of chipped paint. Only touch-up paint can do that. I guess if someone wants to fill the chip with black wax that will melt or fade in a few weeks, they could use the sick.The black wax is no better than any other wax. It also stains all of your applicators and buffing cloths black. I compared this wax side-by-side with Meguiar's Gold Class Clear Coat Wax Liquid. Meguiar's still is the gold standard and, with a black paint job, it's the only wax I've found that will totally eliminate swirl marks and give me that glossy liquid black look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sketchy at Best","review":"An adequate overview of car bodywork - but not an authoritative, or exhaustive treatise on the subject.

Dewalt has made the worst grinder ever.The DW402 was designed with very serious flaw which could send you straight in the ER. (several of my co workers ended up in the hospital)1. Where the exhaust blows out, everything that is grinded will blow right in your eyes. Believe me I know it happen to me.(with safety glasses on) Also so many people were getting eye injuries the Company I work for pulled them from the shop floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"This tool ROCKS!","review":"After years of working with metals and different tools, I have to say, this Dewalt is the BEST.

I used my grinder with a masonry blade to slot the chimney. It worked flawlessly.With it's small size and 3 position handle you can really get into some tight spots.Add the switch lock and the spindle lock and you've got a real winner.My yellow grinder is now orange from the brick dust but,it's not complaining.I do recommend this tool it's works as hard as you do. Now get out there and grind away."},{"rating":"2","title":"well made and tough","review":"I love my little grinder , its never missed a lick . I am as hard on tools as most pros and to be honest I own 3 of these !I keep one for welding , 1 for masonry , and one for heavy grit sanding .I rated 4 stars because of the pain in the wrench safety ! I have disabled all 3 of mine ."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can't make use of this tool, just give up.","review":"I've been around these things for 40 years, see the bigger ones every day at work. Some lazy helper is always wanting to use a 4 1/2\\" instead of a 9\\", that's why they don't last long in a welding shop, they burn up with heavy use.Do I like this grinder? You bet! It has plenty of power, fits my hand and I love the paddle switch. It grinds welds, cuts brick and tile, brushes off paint and rust, removes wedding rings etc.To those reviewers that cried about the type 2 guards being too costly why not just modify the type 27 guard? If you can't do that you ain't much of a craftsman. And who is so dumb or lazy that they can't blow the dust out from the switch and motor? Doh!I think I've seen all the 4 1/2\\"ers that are available and used most of them. This is the one I bought for my home use."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Good Tool!","review":"Angle ginders are made primarily for grinding metal, not cutting concrete, diamonds, cutting down trees or for use as a fan or trimming your beard.

The directions were fairly clear, except for the one main part about attaching the springs. I'm still wondering if I did it correctly because the toy is quite stiff - it takes a lot of pressure to make Clifford bounce (I was hoping it would be really bouncy like the old spring horse I had as a kid). Also, the springs themselves are very thick and tight and don't give at all. My 20-month-old granddaughter is happy to sit on it for a few minutes, but can't get it to move much. I'm hoping that as she gets heavier and stronger, it will be more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"adorable, sturdy and fairly priced","review":"I was very pleased with the Clifford rocker. It appears to be very well made. My 17 month-old granddaughter loves Clifford so she loved this. At first she needed a little help getting up on it as it is quite large, but with practice and supervision, she is able to get up on it by herself and rock.

The \\"wood grain\\" is actually some sort of plastic coating, applied over plastic or cardboard. For $15 at a garage sale, it might be tolerable, but $95?

It was also much smaller than expected - check those dimensions!- and appears to have been poorly soldered as it works only intermittently. Luckily, my electrical contractor husband looks on this cheerfully as a problem to be solved, but I, as the gift giver, see it as shoddy workmanship."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE GARBAGE","review":"A one star rating is too much for this piece of garbage.

Derek Acorah's work on the Most Haunted programme is terrific. But like the television show, the book doesn't really give a really comprehensive understanding of Derek Acorah's world.Questions that I would have posed to Derek weren't covered in the book in great detail. What is the other side? How does the other side work? Who are our spirit guides? I've read a lot of Sylvia Browne's work and was hoping that Derek's book would provide some synergy between the two mediums understanding of the other side.In summary I did enjoy this book and would recommend it if you wish to learn more of Derek Acorah and his life. Personally I thoroughly enjoyed both sections of the book unlike the previous customer review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither Love Nor Rockets","review":"As a huge fan of Jaime Hernandez's work, I never really 'got' that of his brother Gilbert, and generally ignored his sections in the comics. The artwork seemed sloppy and unattractive, the stories seemed a touch sophomoric - relentlessly and earnestly beating us over the head with obvious truths in P.C.-themed narratives. Perhaps all that could be forgiven if there was some warmth or humor at the core of Gilbert's world, but there seems instead to be an atmosphere of nastiness. He loves to use (and show) brutality to make a point, and the characters don't have any empathy with each other. In summary, avoid and concentrate instead on the awesome stuff from Jaime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very small!","review":"It is clearly well made, substantial, and protective.

This unit had no problems playing all of the 'problem' DVDs. I do not like the remote control though. It needs too many keystrokes to access most of the features, and you have to coordinate between pressing different keys on the remote and looking at the on screen display to see where it is in the menu system. I also like the 'upgradeable' feature, where the firmware can be updated onsite by running a special CD from Phillips. I have not tried it yet.However, overall a great unit. I would buy it again, if I had to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even I Can Work This One","review":"The Phillips DVD711AT is a great system. You get more options for the price than almost any other DVD in it's class. It takes some getting used to with the new menus but once it is set up the way you want it you should be off and running - DVD's. I was even able to hook it up to my TV and receiver with only having to rehook-up one cable. If you are considering a DVD I would certainly recommend this one. If you are considering any DVD vs. VHS - there is no comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it for the audio capability","review":"DVD play is good. I purchased this model specifically because of its CD-R and CD-RW audio capability.

I returned the player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all cost!!!!","review":"After minimal use, the DVD player did not work. Although able to recognize audio CDs, it failed to recognize any DVDs, ejecting them after attempting to read the data. I bought a lens cleaning disc for $10, thinking the laser had to be cleaned. Still, no DVDs played. After calling customer service, they told me there was little I could do since the product was no longer under warranty. In addition, I was told that no Philips authorized retailers would be able to repair it. So, after such minimal use, my DVD player is simply a CD player.Now that DVD players are a little more advanced, playing MP3 CDs and DVD-R, do not fall back on the Philips DVD711 because it may be the most inexpensive. You'll end up having to buy another DVD player anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible VCD Support","review":"This player is great if you just want it to play DVDS.

It is an original story and Diana Gabaldon has an incredible gift! Her writing style places you in the story, the details are such that you feel everything that is going on within the story. This collection is a remarkable tail of Claire, a nurse from 1945 and Jamie, a Highlander from 1746. The story is not your typical romance novel...It is much more, and it offers a great escape into a world that contains History (fictional), love, passion, death, murder, betrayal, adventure, and political intrigue!I recommend all of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Stop!","review":"Started with the first book and am now on the 6th of the series.

Jamie and Claire will keep you breathless either from their action packed adventures or their tender love story.

There were way too many mini-stories in this novel, way too many characters, and a lot of the story didn't sit well with me at all. I enjoyed the beginning (that's where the 2 stars come from), which was set in the 1960s, but the book dragged on and on and on. I thought I would never get through it.

It has actually made me laugh out loud, scaring my co-workers. Jamie, the leading man, is larger then life, and I go around with a horrible scottish accent after reading this for a while.The story goes that that in the 1940s, our lady Claire fell into a fairy hill in Scotland and was whooshed back in time to the 1740s, meets and falls in love with a big burley Scot, and they get into trouble everywhere they go.

Great book, good storyline, interesting characters, and it definitely holds up for a second read. Can't wait to read books four and five! My only complaints (and the reasons I gave it 4 stars rather than 5) were a) waaaay too many sex scenes. After a while, they all started melding into one and I skipped most of them - they didn't add to the story just pulled it to a grinding halt, and b) the book is TOO long. 800 pages or so is fine but when they get to be over 1,000 pages, it had better have a little bit more to it than this.With a good editor though, this book could have been amazing.

I LOVED #1, thought #2 was good, and loved this one as well. The second one had a little too much political drama for my taste, I had trouble following all the characters and war-related stuff. This one was just as addictive as the others and easier to follow. The storylines are a bit ridiculous, there's no way so many things would happen to one person, but as long as you go into it expecting a story instead of realism, you'll do just fine. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting pretty darn ludicrous","review":"Outlander was a really fun book to read. Dragonfly in Amber was weird, but still fun. This book is pretty stupid, though. Claire keeps losing her clothes and getting pretty new ones -- over and over. The book jumps from one bizarre calamity to another, without enough story in between to hold it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother","review":"This book is so poorly researched that it's a crying shame. The history of the time could have made up for poor plot lines, no backbone and sheer boredom. At least if the historical storylines are accurate you can get caught up in \\"believing\\" in the story. But in this case this, the lack of research is glaringly evident.One quick example. At one point Claire asks a character when he was born. 1713 is the answer. Claire than says something about betting her clothes on the chance that 1713 was the Year of the Rat. OK, so Chinese New Year is in February. Ms. Gabaladon had two chances to get that right and she missed by a mile.All respect for her as an historian was lost right there.And keeping to the story she tells and her lack of follow through... what happened to Gaellie's child?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Picks up Jamie and Claire's story without missing a beat.

I also enjoy the medical background and the ways medicine is practiced in different times. Its kept me going so that now I'm on the 4th novel in the series.

The history of the war, the detailed medical happenings and the deep love, true love found between two people of ONLY different time tables. Ms. Gabaldon made all of her books seem perfectly correct and real. The time traveling was exciting to the very end with Jamie and Clara's daughter, Brianna traveling as her mother once did.

I can't believe all the surprises and return characters. Another savory morsel in the feast of the outlander series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dinna Trouble Yourself","review":"So, OK... I admit that I liked Outlander and Dragonfly... but Voyager was just ludicrous. But after slogging my way through Voyager, I feel complete with the series. I realize that this book is supposed to be over-the-top action and people admire it because the lovers aren't in their 20's. But Gabaldon over-uses phrases and all judgements about people are based on what their eyebrows are doing. The setting of the various boats they are in are claustrophobic and Claire is taken hostage so many times in the three books I have read, you would think that she would be used to it. If you want non-stop action, then go for it. But this is definitely a book for plot junkies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted!","review":"Voyager by Diana Gabaldon is the third book in the Outlander series. In this, the continuation of Dragonfly In Amber; we hit the open seas and set sail for tropical locations where vodoo, mystery, slavery, kidnapping and smuggling make up the plot; and of course there's the usual Jamie and Claire stuff we can't get enough of. Very exciting reading; it reads like an Indiana Jones adventure. We also get to see some loose ends tied up and also new questions raised that only make you say-where's the next book. That's easy enough, the next one is Drums Of Autumn. Once you start reading these books you can't stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I love all of the Out lander books. I have read them all and nowI own them and will read them over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voyager Audiobook - Abridged version","review":"Cheated of the whole story, this is a version you do not want to own or listen to. After listening to the first two books in the unabridged version - narrated by a different person, this rapidly read, less than excellent version will leave you wishing you hadn't ruined the book in this way. Diana Gabaldon is an excellent author, that can tell a historical tale that has you gasping and looking for the next installment. This ABRIDGED version leaves too much of the story out and is read at a frantic pace, with little emotion. Don't waste your time or your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fasten your seat belt!!!","review":"I am absolutely engrossed and charmed by this story.I have never had a novel make my heart pound and my palms sweat!!!!Once you hit the road with jamie and claire leave a note for the family because you'll be gone for a good long while and you won't want to come back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even half way through","review":"I have to keep reading, because I started and have to know what happens. Like the 2nd book, I will skip through pages. How many more to go?"},{"rating":"1","title":"These Books Get Worse and WORSE","review":"I liked OUTLANDER. I found the next book in the series, DRAGONFLY, to be a bore. It's wholly flashback. But mostly it's too longwinded. By the time I got to VOYAGER, my patience ran out. Good writing comes from revising and cutting those precious pages. I didn't bother with DRUMS because she's lost me as a reader. I wish she'd kept the style (freshness) she had with Outlander."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read, but not as good as the first two","review":"I enjoyed reading about the continuing adventures of Claire and Jamie. They managed to find just as many problems and scrapes to get into as they did in the first two books, and it was always interesting to read about how they'd get themselves out of trouble. But it could be shorter if not so many pages were devoted to repeated and detailed descriptions of every little thing. Also, the majority of chapter 61 - the weird fireside voodoo ceremony of the slaves - could have been left out. It really didn't have much to do with the story and wasn't very interesting. All in all though, it was a pretty good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Great Book, I highly recommend it, but you should read all of the books from start to finish! They are all good in their own way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite romance books for all time","review":"Great books. You hate to finish them and look forward to the next one. She's a great romance writer.The couples interaction with each other is strong and honest. A great great love. I have read many manybooks..romance and otherwise, I just adore this series of books. You will too.I must warn you tho, if you have no tolerance for homo-erotica you will not like these books as Jamie hasa few men that love him too. It is not a reciprocated love but it can be a bit rough to take for a gentlesoul.As I said, I love all of Diana Gabaldon's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly Harlequinesque... yet worth the read","review":"The first two books were utterly compelling and impossible to turn off my kindle. This one is not quite in the same league as the first two but nevertheless riveting. My biggest complaint would be the recycling of all the characters. Well I think Jaime would say it best: \\"Christ Sassenach, who do ye think Gabaldon's going ta be resurrectin next? The entire Highland Army?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fictional history with passion and a great story","review":"I just finished book 3, \\"Voyager\\" of the Gabaldon series \\"Outlander\\" and am still entranced with the characters and their adventures. I've ordered the next three books so I won't have to wait long between finding out what exciting journeys Gabaldon has in store for me next. Her Jaimie is the man most every woman dreams of but never finds, because men like that don't exist in real life. Or at least in my 69 years on this earth, I haven't found them. Having visited Scotland this year and studied up on its history I admire this series even more because it follows the facts in the history books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voyager","review":"I've read all of Diana Gabaldon's books at least three times. They're so rich with detail and so well developed you can get lost in her books. One thing I like is that even though it's listed as romance, it isn't smut, there's a whole story behind it and it isn't just about the characters' romantic relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voyager","review":"I love Diana Gabaldon and am only 3 books in to the 10 book series! Cant wait to get the others!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad....","review":"Outlander is my all-time favorite book. I am so sad that the subsequent books seem to get worse with each each edition. I will have to stop with this one, but I grieve that I will never get to read the great series this could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the first three!","review":"This is by far the best of the first three installments in the Outlander series! It has it all -- action, adventure, mystery, romance, intrigue, zany characters, etc. I loved the first two Outlander books, but this was the one I literally could not put down! I have ordered the fourth one and can't wait for it to arrive to see what happens next. Ms. Gabaldon is an EXCELLENT story-teller and I highly recommend this book (and her others) to anyone who loves a good story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another exciting installment","review":"I was hooked on this series from day one...the adventures of Jamie and Claire are thrilling, heart touching and exciting...you won't go wrong with these books..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's long, but not one page too long","review":"This series just continues to get better. There lives are adventuresome, but it never seems to reach the over the top stage. I think what I like best about these books are Jamie's and Claire's love for one another that binds them regardless of the many harrowing things that come their way. They fight, no doubt, but their love is never to be doubted. While each of these books are of epic length, I never think, \\"Get on with it already,\\" as I do with other long books. Each of these seems just long enough to leave me ready for the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"user_friendly","review":"The book is very well written - no fancy style, but a nicely flowing language which is user-friendly to readers - and Im satisfied with the fact that, while reading a nice romance with a hint of fantastic, I can learn a lot about the history of the time and about the Scottish dialect which, not being a native English speaker, I found very interesting. Therefore, the novel is an amusement and a source of education at the same time, which is exactly what I'd wanted from it. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Outlander series","review":"Reading the \\"Outlander\\" series has been fabulous. The idea of time travel piques the interest and Gabaldon makes me want to learn Gaelic. I am now on the 6th volume and am praying there is a 7th. Voyager rates very high in my estimation."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was ok.","review":"I enjoyed the book until it got to the ending. It seemed as though she tried to get too much material into it. What was with the voodoo stuff? What was the purpose of the minister who ended up a serial killer? Too much for me. I couldn't wait to finish it and not in a good way. I'm hoping the rest of the books will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supremely disappointing.","review":"I am a huge fan of Diana Gabaldon and the Outlander series, however, this installment came up grievously short. While the Jamie and Claire reunion was great, the rest of the book had too much going on and was too hard to follow, she just went a bit too far. Be that as it may, I'm still looking forward to the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating story","review":"I don't think I've ever been so eager to read a book as I was to read Voyager. After being left with the cliffhanger at the end of Dragonfly in Amber, I devoured the third book to find out what happened to Jamie and Claire. This is the most humorous book of the series - both in Gabaldon's exciting saga of our lovers' reunion, and in the way she makes fun of her own genre. I loved the scene where Claire is introduced to the typical bodice-ripping romance novel while working at the hospital - what a great bit of tongue-in-cheek humor! And Jamie and Claire's antics as they try to get some action while on the boat are truly hilarious. While the descriptions of boats and other such historical details were a wee bit much (even for a history major and lover like myself), the story overall carried me past that and into the world of the past like few others have done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book I could read again and again.","review":"I have never read a book that kept me thinking about it even after I was finished with it. I have since started to read the series again but this time I'm going to read it slower so that I don't miss anything. I hope that DG writes more books like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book-especially as a mystery","review":"I was given this book as a gift althought it was not the one I asked for. It was a surprised to find a \\"series\\" book that was so self- contained. Not knowing the history of Jamie and Claire turned this book into a mystery for me. D. G. Does an excellent job of building suspense within a historical romance frame And still get a sense of continuation for her previous readers. I haven't yet read Dragonfly or her the other sequels yet, though I look forward to it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's quite different","review":"After reading the first 2 books in the series, I was overjoyed to sit down and delve back into the lives of Jamie and Claire. How disappointed I was as I got further and further into the book. I didnt like the changes that were made to the characters, and at points, I actually was disgusted with them. This book pales greatly in comparision to the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book, however...","review":"I have been entraced by the Outlander series for the past three weeks. I found this book to be wonderfully exciting and fun. The best part was Jamie's story. It was great to hear him tell the tale. In fact better than when Claire bores us with all her medical jargon. He really brings the books to life and makes you want to keep reading. We need more books written from Jamie's percpetive. Plus Jamie has more control, not to say Claire's not a strong character, but she has to follow Jamie around a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting annoyed with the characters","review":"Basically speaking, this book is not as good as the first two by far. A lot of the excitement and freshness of Jamie and Claire's relationship is not there, and I found myself getting annoyed with many aspects of the book. Overall I would recommend this book for anyone who simply loved the first two, but do not expect the same power from this novel. I would not recommend this book to anyone who thought Dragonfly in Amber was just okay. Reading this book will not add anything special for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible headache and stomach unease","review":"I love Now products but for what ever reason every single time I take this Omega I get a nasty headache and stomach unease.

Buy that one, this one is only good for background music for an Asian-themed dinner party."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good stuff is missing","review":"Unfortunately, the most memorable music from the movie is not included on the CD. This borders on fraud. What is included is rather boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit of a Sleeper, this is an A+ Romantic Thriller","review":"Don't miss this movie! Linda Hunt's Academy Award winning performance, playing a male photographer, is just stunning. It's also fine early dramatic work of Mel Gibson - before his head got very large. Segourney Weaver gives a nuanced, intelligent and passionate performance...and it is lovely to see her in her absolutely beautiful younger years. This is a very compelling and completely entertaining movie about international politics, espionage, poverty and hunger under Sukarno in Indonesia, with an overlay of powerful character portrayals. It is also a great drama of friendship, commitment, personal sacrifice, professional priorities, international journalism, and love. The music by Vangelis is completely haunting, especially L'Enfant from Opera Sauvage. A wonderful film, equally enjoyed by men and women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely yet missing one song","review":"I found this soundtrack haunting the first time I saw the film and have enjoyed it for years. I always wondered why, though, they left out the opera song, which was so important to the film's mood and theme. I still love this compilation and it is gorgeous stuff. Jarre at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the others, pretty boring actually","review":"I couldn't wait for this book to come out. I love Jane Green's books, but this one was a dud. Not at all as funny, engrossing, or captivating as the others. I put my toddler to bed, poured a glass of wine and curled up w/ the book - and was hugely disappointed. It's ok, nobody's perfect. Still love her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book started off interesting but I kept waiting for it to go somewhere and it never did. It was overall boring and repetitive. It is well written for a fast read, but overall no real plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another chick-lit","review":"I usually love chick-lits but this one was annoying to read. I had no sympathy for any of the characters. I couldn't stand how oblivious Alice was and how Joe kept on with his infidelity without even a bit of remorse. I managed to finish reading the whole book and happy now that I can move on to a better book. But I mean, if you're a girl that enjoys reading about people being unfaithful and reading the details about it, then this book would suit you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I got about 1/3rd into this book and thought I didn't like it. I was really having a hard time with the main character changing who she is for her cheating husband. That theme was dragged out a bit too long for my taste. However, her husband's cheating is discovered at his job and he is transferred to New York. There his wife starts to change and begins to acquire a \\"real\\" side to her personality. This is when the book picks up for me and I couldn't put it down. Jane Green is a good writer; she pulls you right in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Green - this isn't your best!","review":"I loved Jane Green's Jemima J. I loved her other books as well, although none compared to Jemima J. This book, however, was not up to par with the other ones. I bought the book at 10:30 am, forced myself through the first 73 pages, and returned the book at 12:30. I have never returned a book because I didn't like it before, but this one drove me to it. I could not identify with any of the characters, and the spinelessness of Alice made the book a chore to read. I have not lost faith in Jane Green's ability to write, and I will definitely pick up her next novel when it comes along, but this one was definitely not her best work. I gave it a two stars only because the writing style is still Jane's easy-to-read style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Main Character","review":"I was looking for a good read, but I couldn't finish this one. The main character is just too boring to care about. I mean, if she's willing to spend years with a philandering husband in a dissatisfactory marriage, why should I want to read about it? There wasn't enough conflict or plot here to engage me and, coupled with an doormat protagonist, I just couldn't be bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly enjoyable","review":"Like many other reviewers, I found this (my first book by Jane Green) to be a mildly entertaining beach read but ultimately disappointing. It was spoiled for me by Green's rather wooden style of writing, flat, unconvincing dialogue and one-dimensional characters. A pity, because I thought the author did an excellent job of creating a sense of place and I could tell - even though I didn't enjoy this book as much as I'd hoped - that she could do much better. I look forward to reading her other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a disappointment!!!","review":"I really wanted to like this book but I couldn't like the characters. Oh I got that she just didn't really want to know but come on how could she not make him suffer some. I so wanted to see him hurt! I wanted him to realize that he can't do these things to people and expect to walk away unscathed!!! It really was slow and there were a lot of descriptions of him with the others. I suppose that in the end she was just totally indifferent to him but . . . well I wanted to see him down!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly poignant","review":"This book was in my to-read stack for about a year before I ever picked it up. This wasn't because I didn't want to read it-it's just that of all the books by this author I have read I only really liked one of them (that was \\"Jemima J\\" which is very good actually) and found the others to be, frankly, quite badly written (especially \\"Mr. Maybe\\".) But finally I picked this one up, expecting it to be a quick, uncomplicated read. I was wrong.This book is actually a very in-depth exploration of marriage and infidelity. I was honestly surprised at poignant and sweet it was. This isn't the story of a wife who finds who finds out her husband is cheating on her and falls apart, it's the story of a wife who catered to her husbands every whim because she was terrified of losing him and then found herself again. And it's not corny or lifetime movie-ish at all. Quite a feat really.It took me several days to read this, and I enjoyed it. I recommend it.Four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane, what's happened?","review":"I am so sad that I didn't love this book. It felt very unpolished. I bought it last week along with a group of other novels, thinking I'd read Jane Green's book first and then get to the other books when I had time. Didn't happen. I put Jane down after a few chapters and moved on to the other titles, which I wound up liking better. It's a sad day when new, lesser known writers can top Jane Green. Out of curiousity, here are the other books I bought and liked better: The Next Big Thing by Johanna Edwards and Ice Princess by Liz Maverick."},{"rating":"2","title":"not so terribly bad...","review":"True, this book isn't exactly War and Peace, and the characters aren't as clear as they could be. But this is a wonderful read if you want something light, something to make you smile just a little bit when you're done with it. Don't read it expecting a literary masterpiece, but do read it for the fun of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Jane Green has done it again! I've read almost all her books and this one you can't put down! She's right on about the fake barbie doll and ken marriages...yes, there are still women out there like that sadly...love the twist and turns of the story so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love Jane Green!!!","review":"As always, Jane Green makes me laugh out loud and leaves me wanting more. I truely recommend this book, Mr. Maybe and Jemina J."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I absolutely loved this book, I read it a few years ago and it was the first I ever read by Jane Green but thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't read it","review":"This time, you should judge the book by its cover. The cover is obvious and so is this horrible horrible novel. And I say it after reading (and loving) Jemima J. The story is predictable, there isn't a single surprise on it. It's written in such a plain way, it made me sick. I really had to make an effort to finish it, and I hated the fact that I knew exactly what was going to happen. Jane Green didn't even try this time, I bet she had to deliver a book and just wrote it in five or six days.Anyway, if you love those great female novels, please, just don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment! ... not worth your time or money","review":"I have long been a fan of Jane Green books and I was counting the days until the release of this book. After 160 pages I could not take reading another page! It is completely stereotypical, cliche, redundant and its plot goes no where. I did however enjoy Mr. Maybe and Jemima J... definately pass on this one, it's trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A light read, nothing more","review":"This book tackles some pretty heavy subjects -- illusion vs. reality, love vs. passion, the enduring nature of friendship. But it handles them in a rather superficial way. I know women who have dealt with the issues Alice faces, yet I never felt she was a flesh and blood woman. Likewise Joe really never came to life for me. And I wish the author had actually shared more of Rachel Danbury's life story and work with us. This feels like junk food. It's enjoyable while it lasts, but it doesn't stick with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Better Green Novels...","review":"Personally, I think that this is one of Jane Green's better \\"chick lit\\" novels. The characters were interesting and while it wasn't completely enthralling, the book kept me rather entertained. Green has the great ability of coming up with inventive plots, instead of writing the same story over and over with different characters.Alice, the main character, is charming and readers can't help but root for her throughout the story. The other characters were also well-written and the story's ending isn't obvious from the beginning, like so many other novels. There were a few things in the novel that Green could have toyed with more to throw a few more plot twists into the story, but I believe that overall she did a nice job. Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTE: \\"Spellbound\\" is \\"To Have and To Hold\\"","review":"When I saw this on Amazon I thought, \\"Hey there's a Jane Green novel I haven't read before, or even heard of.\\" Turns out, I had read it. Called \\"Spellbound\\" in this UK edition, the American version was retitled \\"To Have and to Hold\\" but it is still the same story. So while this cover art is much better than the US version (in this graphic designers opinion) if you've already read the US version, you've already read this too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhere in the fair to poor range","review":"I bought this book while on vacation in London back in March (it's titled \\"Spellbound\\" in the UK- wierd!) Just finished reading it. I agree that it was pretty intereting 2/3 of the way through, but I definitely began to lose interest towards the end. I was rooting for Alice, but she became so DUMB about what was going on with her husband that it began to annoy me. As a married woman myself, it was hard to read some (ok many) scenes where her husband was cheating on her. Disturbing.I would suggest reading some of Green's other novels first, they are much better. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I loved Mr. Maybe and Jemima J by Jane Green, so I thought I'll read her newest novel, which is titled Spellbound in UK. It's the story of Alice, and her husband, who's constantly cheating on her. Too many descriptions and the story is going too slow. And then, suddenly, Alice changes totally. This book really got me frustrated, annoyed, depressed, anything but to have a good time ! I forced myself to finish it, but I couldn't, because it was really too hard to continue until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring... REALLY boring...","review":"I've enjoyed Jane Green's other books, but this one reads as though it was written by a different author. There is way too much character development--to the point of being redundant... There are five real characters and each one is painfully explored and then recapped repeatedly; thus making the the middle of the book difficult to get through.In sum I would say that the premise of the book is far too simple. I don't think an entire book can support it. I guess that's why there is so much chatter about each character... there isn't much else to say.In the end I was relieved to finally finish it! I've just started The Other Woman, and although I am reserving judgement, so far it is 100x better than To Have and To Hold. I wish I had read the reviews before hand... would have saved me 10.00!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Jane Greens Best","review":"I have been enjoying Jane Green books very much just recently. This had very mixed reviews but I tried it anyway. I could not sympathize with the heroine at all. She was utterly spineless and I was never really convinced of her love for Joe and obviously not his love for her. I really thought the mystery surrounding the house would have more importance in the plot besides Alice living with a philandering man. I won't give up on you Jane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-Title","review":"I hate when they re-title a book or put a new cover on it and trick us into buying it. Chances are, if you are an avid reader of said author and you see a new title or a cover you haven't seen before you are going to buy it! Get it home and whoa la! You've read it before! Such a bummer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I like a good \\"chick lit\\" book as much as the next girl, but this one was tough to get through. The heroine is just pathetic, constantly changing her ways to please her horrific (and cheating) husband. I know it's just a story, and certainly not the first to cover infidelity, but nothing about it drew me in. This was my first Jane Green read, and although some of her other works may be deserving, I'll likely pass on any more - there are too many other great books out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anxiety Attack on a plate","review":"I've become a big fan of Jane Green and her first books. I found exceptional especially becuase I often find my self relating to the characters. This book however was not the same experience as the previous ones. I wouldn't recommend reading this book if you have any anxieties about a cheating boyfriend/husband or if you are reading to get a pick-me-up. I almost had an anxiety attack becuase this book was so depressing. She tried desperatly to make you not hate the other woman but its in vain. And you ride such a roller coaster with alice and joe's marriage that by the end of the book I just really wished I hadn't started the book to begin with because it depressed me for the rest of the evening... especially when your home alone.

Rather than bringing creative and fresh characters to life, Green has fallen back on stereotypes. There is no one in this book I would *want* to know in real life, and the book's plot is entirely predictable. Of course, all chick lit books go in the same direction, but this one is just flat as day-old champagne.What happened, Jane? : ("},{"rating":"2","title":"A Return to Excellence","review":"I have really enjoyed all of Jane Green's book. The first I read was Jemima J, and that is still her best, but this was a very close second. Unlike others, I found the main character to be entirely likable and believable.

This case cures that problem. It makes playing sessions longer than 20 minutes quite comfortable. As for protection, it doesn't seem all that sturdy, but its been banging around in my carry-on bag for about a year now, and its still holding. The clear plastic top seems a bit flimsy, but this case is really about the comfortable hand grips, which are awesome. It also stores 3 games and a spare stylus behind the DS as a bonus. I'd give it about 3-4 stars for protection, but 5 for comfort. If you've got big hands but love some DS gaming, this is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Now that my son has broken our 2nd case in less than 2 months.

Yes the grips are nice if you like holding an xBox controller but there is no access to the power button. If you play a lot of stylus games than it just makes the DS heavier, rather than easier to hold. The case doesn't seem to be very protective either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"This saw doesn't seem well made. I didn't get much use out of it before it stopped cutting. It became underpowered and the RPMs were reduced to the point that it wouldn't cut much of anything. I removed the cover from the motor to find that part of the brass spring retainer for the motor brushes was broken, which meant the brush was just laying loose on the commutator causing excessive sparking and a severe lack of power. I used to consider DeWalt a good brand, but after this experience and problems I've had with some of their other tools I don't think I can buy any more DeWalt tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pile of junk","review":"I have this saw. You can't put any pressure on the saw because it will kick the breaker. It vibrates unbelievably. The threads on the vise screw got messed up the very first time I used it. I've only had it for a couple of years with little use and the motor burned out already. I'm looking to buy a new chop saw and it will not be a Dewalt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Love","review":"Someone should blow the whistle on these Dewalt Characters. This model is not even a D.I.Y. tool, the best thing I did is save the reciept and the box for returning every couple of months, use two blades up and replace the brushes, use six blades and it won't cut more than one stud or one piece of 3/4\\" conduit. Time to return/exchange for the next one, and repeat. To the defense of Dewalt is that several other manufacturers have been the same and several of those were made for each other, change the color and decal. Poor work clamping and miter adjustments of any accuracy are not able to be done. This works fine if you want to cut a brick or two and a stud once in a while, steel over 1/8 inch is a load and results in brush/motor failure. You wonder why I own several, purely price. Save a little longer and buy a portable band saw and later a stand for it and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst power tool I have ever owned!","review":"I bought this because I liked my brother's DW-874. Bad move. This thing is a piece of junk. The clamp is horrible, It comes loose, the screw striped out after 6 months. If you make 45 degree cuts the back of the clamp is so far back the blade can not cut all the way through the metal, to correct this you have to put an extra piece of material behind what you are cutting to space it out far enough to cut through. It vibrates no matter what you cut. I've used saws with less horse power ratings that have more power. It trips breakers all the time on circuits that don't trip when I use my 110v welder. If I had it to do over I would buy a hack saw!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the high price","review":"I've had this for ~ a couple of years now. It's ok, and has decent power. It trips the ciruit breaker constantly when I try to cut through 1/4\\" square though, which gets annoying. It'll cut angle or thin stuff pretty quickly though.But worst of all, is that weak miter clamp. First, it's hard to set it at the angle you want b/c you're never sure if you're exactly hitting the angle you want.. But when you do finally set it, after you tighten the work down, the whole clamp will move, and now you're at a different angle. Cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a SAD!!! peice of work!!","review":"I'm a dock builder that uses chop saws reguarly and I found this saw to be a JOKE!! It lug's down stalls out trips the breaker in the breaker box ( a 20 amp breaker using #10 wire at 15 feet long cord ) won't use all the blade like the old saws. WILL NOT cut a miter cut without angling off crooked it even cut the base of the saw itself, is how bad it angles off!! The saw acts like it has a mind of it's own. it works when it wants to. The only thing I have to say good about it is, the handle is more easier to grip being horisonatal. Other than that it would't make a good trot line anchor!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great saw","review":"This is definitely an improvement over the older model it replaces. It packs more power and I like that. We also got the Makita 2414b which has a double pivot cutting arm. ( not the 2414nb) It cuts faster because of that mechanism. Other than that using the saws is about the same . They both have plenty of power.They have quick release material clamps. The Dewalt has a horizontal handle whereas the Makita is angled. I think I like the Dewalt handle better. All the other chop saws seem to be made in Taiwan. If I could only have one I would go with the Makita.I really like that double pivot mechanism. It lets you rock the whole cutting head back and forth to engage the workpiece at differing angles giving both a cleaner and faster cut. If you really want a nice saw get a dry cut saw. They run at much lower RPMs and use a carbide blade to give the fastest and cleanest cut available today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still ticking after 3 years","review":"This is still in my car and I simply buy the refresher pack every year.

I found this book far to obtuse and inflated with 'chat' to be useful. The author expresses ideas such as 'lifting with the thighs' and 'bearing down', and certainly it is understood that there should be muscle tone and activity in these areas of the body. However, beyond expressing anecdotes of the miracles created by using these muscles there are no solid explainations. The promise of biomechanics leaves one to believe there will be explicit detail but instead the descriptions are more poetic.

In addition it has a charming profile of a professional cat trainer (!) putting his 4-week-old novices through their paces, and then performing with the adult cats for a room full of enthralled children.

In fact, all I will note is that I spent four and one half years in the air force, and yet I seem to know more about naval operations than Mr. Rovin.One jarring thing that kept leaping out is Rovin's insistence on using full rank titles, all the time. This is done only when the person being addressed is in deep trouble for something. Constantly calling someone \\"rear admiral\\" is a sure way to get a stern talking to.This had all the makings of a good, maybe even a great story.

It's all too obvious that government regulations and subsidies that support industrialized agriculture have created one of the greatest risks to our health. The doc focuses on interviews with farmers, many of whom tried to go along with federal government programs and who found the system seriously flawed and foolish.

Side 2 is horrible looking, I thought when I bought this product that the other side was going to look like the front, but it doesn't. Since my bad purchase I have found better card guards out there that have both sides finished and are much higher quality. Just do your shopping and you will be glad you did. There are some other websites that I have bought from that have a much superior product and better prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointed","review":"I expected a little more after reading the first volume, but several negative points about this manga became clear only a few pages in. The artwork is decent, but I lost track of where characters went and where they came from often. There was no smooth transition from scene to scene. Additionally, the storyline came off as highly sexist. I thought there would be some shounen-ai, but the main character's former status as a woman was over-emphasized, and any weakness or deception was criticized as a feminine trait. As the second, and final, volume of the series, there wasn't much development, nor a clear resolution. I was annoyed halfway through the manga, and downright furious by the end. I don't advise buying this, let alone reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"Seems like a good value compared to other brands.

To my horror, I found multiple small sized maggots in the pudding (I didn't see them until I cooked the pudding and started to look closely). When I received the box yesterday, I noticed some of the boxes had leaked, and was worried about items sneaking in holes in the boxes. But I figured it would be okay since I have purchased the pudding in grocery stores many times before and never had a problem. I don't know if it's a problem with the way Amazon stores the items, or the way they are shipped, but I will never order this product through Amazon ever again. This is disgusting! And because it is a grocery item, even though I will now have to throw out all $22 worth of boxes, I will not be able to get a refund. So this is just wasted money, and I'm left a little lighter in the wallet, and horrified that this stuff was in my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humour and candour","review":"Of all the books on Apollo written by the astronauts this is the best. The author treats his story with candour and a good degree of self-effacing humour. He really conveys the feeling of being on the spacecraft with him and explains technical issues well.Mike Collins comes across as the astronaut you'd most like to meet in the bar. An excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The best (and one of the earliest) book by an Apollo astronaut. Very witty, with candid appraisals of other astronauts. Actually written by the astronaut himself. A must for anyone interested in the Apollo program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tops for tongue in cheek humor...Space Style...","review":"I first read this book when I was about 19, in the Army in Europe. The saying that comes to mind is \\"They who wait, also serve.\\" Excellent book. Mr. Collins tells it like it is in such matter of fact ways. You will not be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is our next generation of heroes?","review":"Collins writes a richly detailed and intelligent account, laced with smart-alecky humor, of what it was like to join the astronaut corps, the training and planning that go into a mission, and what it's like to go into space. His description of his anxiety during the period that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon really puts you in the moment and makes you realize that making it back was no foregone conclusion.It makes me sad to see how this book has become dated. We as a nation gave up on manned space exploration 35 years ago, and the shuttle has been a dead end. While I reading the book, I felt a sense of futility that Collins, who wrote the book in the '70s, could never have anticipated.Carrying the Fire is an excellent astronaut memoir; maybe one day there'll be a reason for somebody to write some new ones.Reviewer: Liz Clare, co-author of the historical novel \\"To the Ends of the Earth: The Last Journey of Lewis and Clark\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny stuff!","review":"I thought Collins's book was the best of any I have read about the golden age of the US space program. Collins was funny; made me laugh out loud a bunch. I also recommend \\"Deke!\\" and \\"A Man on the Moon.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The inside story -- well written","review":"I read it, and re-read it. I couldn't put it down. Along with the information on the US Space program itself, it has insights into the family life of the astros as well as how they interacted with each other. As a bonus, a strong sense of humor comes through in the writing that makes the sometimes technical nature of the book spring to life. It is very entertaining! Far from a dry account of \\"I did this,\\" you are left with a clearer sense of the incredible magnitude of the US Apollo and Gemini programs. If you ever wondered what went through those men's minds as they made history, this is the book for you! Thank you Mr. Collins!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good insight","review":"This book is both fascinating and tedious. Mike Collins is a very good writer and does a great job of describing the system and people at NASA, especially the astronauts. His many anecdotes on incidents and happenings can really give you an insight and appreciation for the space program and everything that was involved in getting man into space. Having said that, the many technical details are very heavy reading for anyone who doesn't have as brilliant an engineering mind as he obviously does. If you can just skip over all those details, it's still a good read and will leave you in awe of the achievements of man in science, as well as a personal look at the people involved and the toll on their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond any doubt the best biography of an astronaut","review":"Carrying the fire is beyond any doubt the best of the astronauts biographies. As I'm sure you will know if you are looking at this page, Mike Collins was command module pilot of Apollo 11. Whilst Neil and Buzz went down to the moons surface, Mike remained in the command module and conducted experiments, took photographs and was there in case any emergency happened during the lunar rendezvous.Mike has a great style of writing and his humour comes across excellently in the book. He leaves no stone unturned and one of the most entertaining and unabashed passages in the book is when he is detailing his thoughts on the other astronauts.This book is often quoted and any NASA or Apollo buff has at least 1 copy sitting in his collection. Even if you are not a NASA or Apollo buff but just want a good read, then this book comes very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeing Stars on the Moon?","review":"In the Press Conference just after coming back from the Moon, Michael Collins said, \\"I don't remember seeing any\\" (Stars).Later in his book \\"Carrying the Fire\\", he says that he did see Stars. Which is it Michael, Stars or No Stars? One way or another he is Wrong.I won't be reading a Book Of Lies from Michael Collins.Of course, seeing No Stars then seeing Stars means, we DIDN'T GO TO THE MOON.There is proof of Mr. Collins on Video, saying, He Did Not See Stars,then in Print saying He Did See Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong battery for U205","review":"in Amazon product description, it listed the U205 as the compatible model.well, it's not. the bulge on the back of the battery prevent the LCD screen from opening. yeah....the battery fits in the compartment but you can't open the LCD screen; thus, cannot use the laptop.so, ONE star for wrong description. when you buy stuff online, the only thing you rely on is the product description and previous buyers experience. i hope my review save the headache for other potential buyers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laptop Battery for TOSHIBA","review":"Did not fit the laptop battery conveniently as advertised.

The animation may not be as good as things that are coming out now, and the story line may be kind of lame, it is still a good story. It was one of the first anime shown on american tv that actually kept most of the whole series intact, without letting the american cenors at it, which as those of us that watch toonami on cartoon network know about what they do to a series. I am really looking forward to being able to complete this series, and to hopefully continue on and get the next two series.

The approach is kind and gentle with a focus on keeping things enjoyable while making slow and steady progress. What I found particularly helpful, beyond the non-threatening, encouraging tone, is the specific advice about how to move from walking to running by doing ever increasing (very gradually, mind you!) intervals of walking and running. I ended up buying the dual timer that Mr. Galloway sells on his website for about $20 and have found it to be immensely helpful. I read the book three weeks ago and bought the timer two weeks ago. I have already progressed from running 30 seconds then walking 1 and a half minutes for 45 minutes total to running 1 and a half minutes and walking 1 minute for over 60 minutes total.

Every man within a five-mile radius looks completely smitten, but she does not justify these reactions - she does little but speak in monosyllables and look smug. Nor is her impassive, somewhat frog-like beauty enough of an explanation in itself - Paris is crawling with more beautiful and charming women. The funniest part of the whole thing is watching Ms Beart pretend to use a word-processor - she keeps some of the keys pressed down, never uses the space bar, and moves her elbows in and out as if playing the piano. Those who praise this movie, I suspect, would consider it a crashing bore if played in a U.S. setting by American actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how great films end","review":"Yes, people mock the French and their films. However, this is one of the great films of recent years. It upsets me that the Amazon review mentions how the ending is facilitated, because it takes away from the punch that comes and leaves such a deep whole inside. The very idea that in life one can never really know how deeply one person can affect another, or who that very person may end up being, is better expressed in this masterpiece than any film I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece","review":"This is best movie made in France ever.I enjoy in every minut.This movie is masterpiece of Claude Sautet,and everyone should see it.I saw this movie year ago,but it is now in my heart,and it will stay there forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film ruined by mistake in DVD transfer","review":"I can confirm what the previous reviewer remarked, that the editors did something wrong with how they recorded subtitles on the DVD and that they are not readable on a widescreen TV on at least several types of DVD players, while the picture itself is recorded in widescreen anamorphic. The only way we could watch it with my non-French speaking wife was to set the TV to 4:3 aspect, set the DVD player as if it was pluged on a 4:3 TV and watch the movie with gray bars on the side and black bars on top and bottom.

It's also an easy read - you can start on page 120 or page 1. You don't have to read it in order since the advice is divided into sections; job, love, finance etC.

We installed the fence, not in the ground, but on the existing fence a few inches off the ground and looped back some 3 feet above that wire. To begin, I should have set the collar at level 3. Instead, I set it at 5 and gave the poor dog a really rough shock. I set it to 3 and she feels it but doesn't yelp like she's being tortured.

Her older sister is bent on fast tracking Belldandy's relationship with Keiichi and her little sister wants to break them up. There are also demons and classmates that have it in for them.This anime is adapted from an older, short OVA and manga. It is more detailed and takes the story further.

But later on we realize that Martha is equally dependent on Jennie for her own particular reasons.Fast-paced, original, excellent plot and dialogue. My only complaint about the book was that certain parts seemed repetitious; however, it's possible that the author was simply trying to emphasize the repetitive nature of obsession.In general, I enjoyed this book very much and stayed up late at night to finish it. A real nail-biter with scary yet believable characters.Sigrid Macdonaldauthor of D'Amour Road"},{"rating":"2","title":"marvellous book but with a poor ending","review":"Jenny and Martha are next-door neighbours and also have children of the same ages and sexes. Jenny is completely besotted with Martha and slowly she becomes her reason for living. The author takes us into the twisted workings of Jenny's mind and makes her peculiar and devious behaviour understandable to us. Each chapter is written alternatively by the two protagonists and the writing is clever and very addictive.Both characters are completely rounded and three-dimensional and we come to know these two ladies very well. The other neighbours are more shallowly dealt with and the portrayal of Jenny's husband, Graham, makes him almost too good to be true. I don't think many men would put up with this kind of behaviour and still remain loving and supportive.Unfortunately it had a very unlikely ending which I felt was a let-down. In view of this I gave the book only 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"God! This was terrible","review":"This book was a big disappointment.

Although, for the most part, the EP dwells on a repetitive atmosphere throughout, that atmosphere is a many-layered and uplifing one. Like another reviewer said about Githead's music, I agree that the music isn't all too riveting and entirely unique, it mixes very well with the vocals, making an exceptional 21 minute piece of music. I would have to consider 'Reset', an instrumental, and 'To Have And To Hold' my favorite selections from Headgit, though this really is one of those collections of tracks that should be listened to in whole.I'm looking forward for obtaining further pieces of the Githead catalogue. I also heard, for the collectors out there, that for those who order either 'Profile' or 'Art Pop', you can obtain a few bonus CD's, a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Russian Rock Group","review":"Gorky Park gives a listener an idea about the state of the Russian Hard Rock. It is a great group and should be rated as 5 stars. It does not matter that the guys rock in USA - songs are still great as always. Buy this CD now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EWWWWW!","review":"I'm sorry Mr. Horner, but what were you doing making this score? Instead of your normal tones, we get this dreary, annoying, piece of music (I call it that loosely). Just listening to the track samplings here is enough to get someone suicidal! I just hope too many people don't subject themselves to this unmercilessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete and Un-original Score","review":"The music heard in \\"The Right Stuff\\" is monumental, exciting and mostly NOT Bill Conti. As another reviewer has pointed out... THIS CD IS THE COMPLETE CONTI MUSIC. Conti had very limited time to score the already-completed film. He generously borrowed the main theme from \\"Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto\\", and other compositions such as \\"Holst's Planets\\" and \\"Debussy's Claire D'Lune\\" are heard in the film. For these reasons, there will probably never be a \\"complete original soundtrack\\" of \\"The Right Stuff\\" since so much of the music in the film was not original to Conti. Unfortunately, some of the classical music is not even credited to the classical composers, so it appears the score is entirely Conti's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for North & South","review":"The score to North & South is fabulous, and there is nothing else like it. It suited the mini-series perfectly, and it's too bad all 12 tracks are not devoted to the score. Some tracks from The Right Stuff score are very nice as well. I think both deserved their own soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enought \\"Right Stuff\\"","review":"The Right Stuff is one of the finest movies ever made. The acting is first rate and the story is a very compelling one that focuses both on the original Mercury Astronauts and also the test pilot career of the legendary Chuck Yeager. But this representation of the film score is not very satisfying. It is more like an appetizer and you feel hungry for more soon after listening to the brief snipets presented on this album.The Right Stuff is a brilliant score if it could be presented in its original and uncut form. And all of it should be there too. From the Holst Planet's music to the Military hymns to Waltzing Matilda and of course the original compositions by Conti.If you buy this CD, don't expect it to satiate your appetite for the music of this fine film. Buy it only if you want a quick fix and hope and pray they release the rest of it soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Conti strikes again the strings of our heart","review":"Therefore it is outrageous that the whole score is compressed in the way it is presented on this album. Answer our demand and give us the whole score on CD. I hate using my vcr just for listening one of the most exciting scores ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive for what you get from \\"The Right Stuff.\\"","review":"The music from \\"The Right Stuff\\" on this CD isn't even from the original soundtrack -- it's re-arranged and performed by a different orchestra, and, as noted in other reviews, includes alternate music that's not in the film. I agree with the reviewer who suggested simply recording the end title music from the DVD. The \\"North and South\\" music is quite ordinary, and for fans of that mini-series only. Maybe this is worth it if you can find it for $3 used, but it's a major rip-off at its normal selling price. Meanwhile, shame on Warner Brothers for not giving us a Music Only track on the great DVD Special Edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice solution for those who do not like tool belts","review":"I purchased this vest because tool belt rigs fall off my pear shaped aging torso. It performs as I hopes it would. I purchased only after contacting Skillers and asking if they would guarantee the stitching for a reasonable period of time. I do not believe they can be expected to guarantee the fabric for any great length of time but stitching should be covered. After talking with Johan and being assured thet they would stand behind their workmanship I purchased a XXL vest with a screw gun holster, a hammer holder, and a tool pouch. Everything works well and I have not had any problems after nearly a month. I wish that I had found something like this years ago as I have owned at least three tool belt rigs and always ended up working out of a bucket. I highly recommend this vest and only hope that Skillers will add a hang up loop so that I do not have to lay it on the seat of my truck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one...","review":"Poor sound quality mars this collection of unremarkable early \`60s doo-wop-ish girl group recordings.

These recordings do not sound (and are not credited as being) digitally re-mastered. The sound quality is just terrible. And the last two tracks (both previously un-issued) have loud scratching/feedback on them. \\"The Early Years\\" may be the only available collection of Patti, Nona, Sarah, and Cindy's 1962-1965 recordings, but I would advise waiting until a better quality collection is issued in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST OF THE EARLY YEARS!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I THOUGHT THE MUSIC ON THIS CD WAS EXCELLENT!!!!

Add another 100 pages or so, and you would be a definite five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"I have the original 1976 first edition from Doubleday, small and handy and a great read specially when you're on vacation somewhere tropical. The premise is fairly simple about honeymooners in Bermuda running into some really bad people and sunken treasures. The main characters David, Gail and Treece come alive as Peter Benchely weaves mystery, danger and the possibilities of finding long lost treasures in the deep. Treece is more well defined as a character but I was a bit shock when he actually kills his own brother, Kevin for telling. The plot is easy to follow but it got a bit dizzy during the underwater fights. If you're not a real mystery reader but prefer to read something light, away from the biographies and non fiction, this would be a good break. Benchley builds enough mystery and defines his characters skillfully for you to care what's in the next page and how the story ends. And ofcourse this is the hallmark of a good mystery novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not suspenseful. Not scary. Just great!","review":"The thing about the Deep is that you can't let yourself get wrapped up in the idea that you need to be terrified to enjoy Peter Benchley. What THE DEEP is is this book about a shipwrcek laden with thousands of ampules of drugs. And our three characters, one of them a lady, new for Benchley, are trying to bring them all up at the whims of drug lord Cloche. But there's also treasure down there too. A lot. Its fun to read becasue it appeals to this, childish, almost immature sense of adventure in us. There's a lot of diving down into the deep for treasure and drugs. A whole lot of diving. Its simply fun becasue at times it is complicated, but mostly, its just simple diving with lots of adventure and danger.END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"More boring than Jaws, the novel.I suppose it was no surprise that something similar to the big bad fish book, or at least that looked similar on the cover would be given a shot, given the success of the other time.

It's extremely long, boring, HUGE, and very difficult to get through, especially when you have to read large chunks at a time for class each week. There's comparatively few cases. The authors say in twenty words what they could easily express in two, and unless you REALLY need to know that senator Clair Engle was suffering a brain tumor when he voted for cloture during the passage of the Civil Rights Act, the authors go into way more detail than you will ever need as a 1L.The only good thing about this book is that it solved my insomnia problem - it puts me to sleep every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"best halloween movie and track!","review":"i don't usually listen to this kind of music but i love the scores and mr.sandman,i usually listen to god lives underwater and sevendust."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Destroy Oh-Boy!\\" rocks!","review":"One of the greatest raging full-on rock records of the nineties, right up there with Zeke's \\"Kicked in the Teeth\\".

I own probably about 700 albums, everything from Elvis to the Beatles to Dylan to the Stones to Iggy to the Clash to the Sex Pistols to Nirvana to the White Stripes, and this tops them all. To call it the best punk record ever, or the best garage rock album ever, or the best obscure album ever, is to damn it with faint praise. In the age of the iPod, the old question of \\"top five desert island albums\\" seems obselete, but if I could have just one, it would be \\"!!Destroy-Oh-Boy!!\\"It's not a flawless album. The recording sounds a little tinny, and the dynamic never really changes. But everything else is epic: Jim Weber's buzzsaw guitar, the bass rumble that opens \\"Suckerpunch,\\" Eric Davidson's whip-smart lyrics and raw-boned delivery, and Bill Randt's cacophonous drumming.

Harry is nice.\\" over and over again. The editor's comments on the letter that were supposed to clarify it for the people who haven't read the book usually just restated what the letter said- I doubt seriously that Moore read the books herself.A lot of the information in the kids' letters were fraudulent as well- some made comments about teachers called \\"Madame Pooch\\" and made comments about \\"Filch's cat having to die\\".

Instead, all I found was incomprehensible gibberish (and proof that few of those children have really understood the Harry Potter stories), and boring and pointless comments like \\"I love Harry.

This book is an example of someone doing something completely uncreative, simply throwing the name \\"Harry Potter\\" in the title, so it would come up in searches for the genuine thing. The Harry Potter series is wonderfully successful, and rightly so. It is full of magical adventures, real trials and tribulations, and enchants adults and children alike. Let's discuss why we love Harry with a neighbor, cousin, neice, grandchild, or friend, not with an inane book that manufactures these conversations for us.I would have given this cheap knockoff negative five stars....and thrown an invisibility cloak over it, and shipped it off ot Azkaban!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing, I thought it would be so much better.","review":"In this collection, children talked about the Harry Potter books.

I was bored out of my mind by these reviews, which told the storyline but not what the children enjoyed about the books, and HELLO, we already KNOW the storylines, right? The last part was some letters and recipes and other things, and overall the title \\"We love Harry Potter; WE'LL TELL YOU WHY\\" is completely false.

Though I'd never read any Campbell, I will now as I get a chance. A well-planned and tightly woven tale of intrigue, murder and pagan beliefs still held secretly in a corner of England is coupled with a young woman and her friend searching for a copy of a movie made several decades before by Karloff and Lugosi, but which never made a screening and had seemingly vanished, so no copies were available. Side plots include the wandering \\"Enoch's Army,\\" a group of people who believe everything is pretty much going to hell in a handbasket and they want to settle on land by themselves and away from everything in the outside world. Secretive villagers, a smug and rude lord of a manor, and research into the world of old movies blends seamlessly into a tale that is difficult to put down.

Of course Clear and Present Danger was longer, and Clancy yacked about how powerful a rifle is, and how big a ship is, Eyes Of The Hammer ignores ALL OF THAT, and gives us the full action. Eyes Of The Hammer is about Special Forces that sneak into Columbia and to destroy the drug labs.Bob Mayer of course was a former Special Forces soldier, and the action felt real, and was quite exciting. The plans and the tactics felt real and how the soldiers fought very realistic. Eyes Of The Hammer ignores all of the CIA business, and it just deals with the military operations.

Everything I have ever read about Lillith is that she supposedly was the first wife of Adam and I have read nothing about her being the consort of God.

I was looking for more fact than speculation on this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different way to view history","review":"This book opened my eyes to a whole new way to view the history of Christianity generally and the Knights Templar more specifically. The author's theory is that a group of families have worked, from before the time of Jesus through today, to ensure that worship of the Goddess or Sacred Feminine(which some today call paganism) would not be snuffed out by the patriarchal religions. These families, he believes, were the force behind the Knights Templar and later Freemasonry. I read this book while I was researching my own novel on the Knights Templar,Cabal of The Westford Knight: Templars at the Newport Tower, and Butler's theory allowed me to understand many things which otherwise made no sense to me.

We are using it in high value CFRP repairs, and at this price we are very pleased, however, even the smallest leak will draw air into the oil sump and blow enough smoke out the breather to kill any flying insect within a five block radius.

I know this novel has like 10 volumes but I read the shortened one which had only 3 volumes. But still, I was bored to death reading it. I was just looking at the book, not actually reading it. That's how boring this book is. All there are in this book are war and killing. Guys, go ahead and read it but girls, I'm afraid you might not like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good history that doesn't seem like it","review":"The book is set an ancient china from 184a.d. to 236a.d. or something like that. the reason i got into this is because of Koei's Dynasty Warriors series especially 3. It has political features and also has a bunch of betrayals."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to maximise the enjoyment of this tour de force","review":"I first became familiar with the Three Kingdoms period through the video game \\"Romance VII\\" (on PS2). Through the game, I was able to understand what each charecter is capable of doing, which illustrated a clear narrative of the basic concepts involved. After playing \\"Romance VIII\\" & \\"Romance X\\", I more or less understood what the novel had to offer. After playing these games, I decided to go to the main source - the novel. While reading the novel, I started associating the images and scenarios from the games with the text. Although you will know how most events will unfold, the endless names, ranks, locations and procedures, will make sense; which without, you will be bored to death. So to sum things up, I highly recommend you play some of the romance games (in particular \\"Romance X\\") so to know how significant some events (like the meeting of the brothers, or the battle with the 'strongest man under heaven') are."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of War and Deception taken to ridiculous levels.","review":"The tactics of The Art of War is pretty much used throughout the book by many of the warlords.The multiple layers of military deception and feints gets so deep that it creates the oddest strategy of all:Predicting that your enemy will anticipate a trap or deception, and go the obvious route instead.Basically to sum it up.1) China splits up into a dozen warring states and warlords.2) The \\"Mandate of Heaven\\" seems to motivate the warlords to continue fighting, thinking it's heaven's wish to eventually reunite China (which probably keeps China from becoming like Europe, with a dozen states coexisting).3) The Art of War is known by nearly all the warlords, all the battles are very tactical.4) If you're interested in Game theory, there are many complicated alliances, breaking of alliances and betrayals between warlords."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the greatest chinese novels of all time","review":"The title of this review truly says it all for this martial epic. One would not make an overstatement by comparing this bbok to such powerful works of literature as the iliad or the nibelung.Everything from characters to plot is richly portrayed.Characters are epic and complex and he storyline is iaginative and rich. The only chinese novel that cann supposedly surpass this book is The Dream of the red chamber and I can't wait to read it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a big fan of The Three Kingdoms saga. I wanted a version that in my mind was worthy of the wonder and significance of the work. This version, for the cost, is very disappointing. I am through the first nine chapters or so, and I must say that this version does not live up to expectations. I see typographical and spelling (!) errors on seemingly every other page. There are also numerous references within the text to other works and versions that make me think there have to be more comprehensive, superior versions out there. I wanted a version that I could hang onto for decades, something worthy of prominent display on my bookshelves, and this one isn't it. If you are new to the ROTK world, this could be a great introductory work, but only if it were $40 cheaper. Avoid and instead try the local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THE MAY 30 2010 KINDLE Version","review":"I have not bought this kindle version.

Eventually, if u actually enjoy reading or aren't lazy, you will want to read the full blown edition, which is far better then a rehash, as it will actually feel like a novel instead of just clifnotes, as many parts i found, didnt stand out as they should have. i feel that if u get this book, get the full, unabridged version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story of heroics and loyalty: Truly an epic","review":"This is the unabridged version and truly a masterpiece. I was familiar with a very small portion of the history during this time period before I read it, so that encouraged me to try it out. If you love epic stories, this is a great one. Guanzhong based his novel on solid historical facts while adding some fictional elements in order to bring out the characters and events for the reader. I've heard it said, and I agree with it, that it is 70% history and 30% fiction. Addtionally, this is a must read for any fans of the Dynasty Warriors gaming series. My recommendation is that if you have any interest in this period of Chinese history or stories of heroics and loyalty-to-the-death, buy it, and I guarantee that you wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you thinking about buying this series?","review":"You should. Three Kingdoms is the number 2 bestseller in the history of mankind after King James Bible. Couple billion readers cannot be wrong so have your faith in this book.Three Kingdoms.... I read it about 8 times now. Everytime I read it, I learn something new or see a different point of view according to my own maturity.You can talk about Tolkien, Jordan, Martin and other masters of fantasy novels but unless you read this one, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.Part fiction, part history, get ready to immerse yourself in epic that is equal to none. You have just found the book of your dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this book","review":"If you are alive and know how to read you should read this book, no one in the world would give it less than 3 stars. It is a very long book but it will be very much worth it to read anyway, and when you're done, you can brag to your friends that you've read a 2000+ page book. It will go by much faster than you would think."},{"rating":"1","title":"The notes are not available with the volume!","review":"I bought Volume I thinking that I'd see if I liked the book before I committed to the massive whole. I figured that if they sold it separately in multiple volumes, it's meant to be owned and read in chunks. It was sitting on my shelf for months until I had the time after I finished Tale of Genji, which I purchased at the same time. When I finally started into it, I was first confused then upset that these highly-touted explanatory notes were nowhere to be found!!! I can only assume they are provided at the end of the third and final volume, which isn't even available (new) by Amazon! And now I can't even return it because it's well after the return date has expired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality of Materials","review":"This is the most difficult to read book I have ever read. I mean this literally. I am not talking about the reading level or the quality of the translation. The pages are the thinnest I have ever seen in a book. You can clearly see the text from the other pages quite clearly. The low contrast makes the page literally difficult to read. I know they did this to cut costs, but this is stupid if you can't even read the book. I would have rather paid an extra 10 to 20 dollars for some thicker pages and an extra volume. Try and find a better version if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Story with one flaw","review":"The story itself is amazing, the translation lively and I like that it had little pictures once in a while to give me a picture in my head of what these characters looked like.HOWEVER...There are quite a few spelling mistakes, out-of-place words, and mixed up letters (b,d and p,q). I bought a set directly from China so I'm not sure if the edition for sale in North America has these flaws. They don't cause any major comprehension problems, but they're frequent enough for me to knock off 1 star.Still, this is the translation you should get, even if their proof-reader should have been fired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was greatly disappointed when my granddaughter opened the jar. 90% of its contents is shredded paper.

I will use it to stuff gift bags. It shows projects on the outside but they certainly aren't projects you can do with the items in the jar. You are better off buying supplies at a craft jar and creating your own craft jar.

If you use it as rolling cart, the seams at the corners at the bottom of the bag, beside the wheels are not protected and will wear away quickly causing the bag to open up at the bottom.

Too bad cuz the backpack itself is nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it for Tony Leung Kar-fai","review":"First-rate Taiwanese drama about the tainted politics of the island. Despite having two leads from Hong Kong, this is not a Hong Kong movie. Mak's taut direction moves the well-thought-out script along in a compelling and gritty fashion, and the drama never slackens. Andy Lau plays a righteous cop trying to track down proof of the corruption; he looks good here, but he is no eye-candy (for once). But Lau is upstaged here by a staggering Tony Leung Kar-fai of \\"The Lover\\" fame (no relation with Tony Leung Chiu-Wai), who plays a ruthless gang leader - he is worth the entrance fee alone. This performance proves once again that the best of Hong Kong is more than a match for the best of Hollywood. And you get more than a glimpse on his tattooed butt. Definitely worth catching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do what I wanted","review":"Either I am doing something wrong, or the letters are not stamping clearly enough.

This is one example that sometimes you just have to give some movies a chance even if it doesn't seem that good before you actually watch it. The last fight scene which was between Toby Wong and the \\"advanced model\\" has to be one of the best (if not the absolute best) I've ever seen in a movie (live-action or animated). I wish I knew what it is that keeps him from being as well known as any other martial arts, action star because he's just as good as anyone else. The story is good enough and so is the acting.

It was as good as any Jackie Chan movie. I especially like his flying screw driver move. Marc Dacascos is one of the best Martial Artist in the world, and it's a pity that only a few people pay attention to him I'd realy like to see him working together with Jackie Chan or with van Damme.

I was severely disappointed. I had learned more from 30 minutes of talking to a friend of mine than the entirety of this book. One major qualm I had with this book is the uncountable errors, misspellings, punctuation errors and errors in word usage. If it was one or two errors, it would've been ok, but there were probably hundreds(literally), which was extremely distracting to reading. I don't know how this book got through the proof readers!

I signed and have upheld my promise to \\"never\\" divulge anything about the \\"Jennifer Project\\" including those words \\"Jennifer Project\\" to anyone.I'd like to know how the author, claiming to be a former CIA employee can get away with writing a book about this program without spending the rest of his life in prison for violating a security agreement."},{"rating":"1","title":"the jennifer project","review":"I found this book very boring and don't recommend it to anyone. The author focused to much on the recovery of the submarine and he ruined the book. Save your money and buy a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as riveting as I expected","review":"I had heard about this book some time ago while watching a documentary on television about sub warfare and the Cold War. Naturally, I kept this book in mind. I finally found it at a thrift store and paid $1 for it.I felt that the author skimmed over the entire matter and wrote about the fetching of the submarine at a \\"high level\\" - meaning not enough real meat and details to be that interesting. I think that some of the digressions about the CIA didn't really help. I also felt that the author did not go into too much detail about how Hughes was involved with the ship.Most of the book dealt with the recovery of the submarine. I would have preferred more technical details. But, at only about 170 pages, it is worth a read only if you find a deal like I did. In retrospect, I wouldn't pay full price for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as technical as I had hoped","review":"OK, I'll admit it.

Now obviously, DePalma ordered Pino to write in the vein of Herrmann, but Pino does more than pick the bones of a dead composer (which is more than can be said for dePalma when he's not up to snuff). DRESSED is a really lovely, I mean, LOVELY, score. In fact, it's so lush and awash in emotion that it may simply frighten some people because it almost topples over into kitsch, but I'd argue it doesn't. The title tune makes you feel like that girl in AMERICAN BEAUTY bathing in rose petals, and THE MUSEUM cue is a six minute kind of rondo thing that just takes you higher and higher into its erotic frenzy.

The key areas of the palm, the print patterns and the lines are broken down. The author says the palmist is like a detective, sifting through details to build a picture of the individual.You get the feeling the author really loves his art and is keen that you should love it and take it seriously as he does. After just a couple of hours with this book I staggered my girlfreind with a quick reading, and this was only after reading through the first two chapters! I'd recommend it to anyone interested in palmistry. The key to getting the most out of this book is to take it slowly, chapter by chapter and not rush.

It should have ended with the Queen of Kay finally being at rest in her new kingdom. I am wondering if there are more episodes after this, but you never know.This show also dealt with some deep issues of pain, sadness, judgment, incrimadation, and much more.

All trouble breaks loose when hired guns are sent after him. Roc Ashton will stand against these 'ruthless hard cases' not only for himself but also for Sarah Bucklin, \\"the beautiful, willful daughter of his sworn enemy.\\".Another 'raw action western' from the pen of Lee Floren.

Then Gary moves on to show how most UFO's sightings are explainable.

If you are like me and other books on this subject have left you with more questions than answers you will find that this book is different.

The title \\"Alien Intrusion: UFOs and the evolution connection\\" is a little of a misnomer as the so called \\"connection\\" is weakly dealt with, however the imagination the author in explaining the UFO phenomena in a biblical context is top notch. One is always unsure how much Mr Bates has his tongue in his cheek but to his credit he had me in stitches several times and chuckling for much of the remainder. Whether explaining light from galaxies a billion light years away or ice cores kilometres thick, the inventiveness of creationists can be breath taking and this author does not disappoint on his chosen topic. His critique of Ufologist Von Daniken would have made any sceptic or non-believer proud but is made more powerful by the author's understanding of the ability to suspend disbelief.

However, there was only one small section on language and culture that actually peaked my interest. I thought that the bulk of the book was taking up by Hargreaves throwing statistics about ethnic groups in France and not so much analyzing these stastics or how to better the situation of these groups.

What happens is if the keyboard is clicked (which it is all the time) it goes on to the next group of fish to count. So basically your child is just hearing the number 1.

Carrie must deal with more than one killer and she is betrayed by one of her friends. I highly recommend WHITEOUT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHITEOUT IS A STRIKEOUT","review":"Kate Beckinsale plays a U.S. Marshall stationed in Antarctica. (Do they have them there?) She investigates a murder which develops into a series of murders including an attempt on her life. The number of suspects is slightly more than a Scooby-Doo episode, but not by much.The film opens with a Russian plane crash in 1957, then shifts to the present with a gratuitous scene of Kate peeling off layers of clothes to take a shower. However, that is not the \\"some nudity\\" promised in the rating box. It is male streakers. Yup. So don't get your hopes up.In addition to the murders, Kate has to battle the elements as well as frequent annoying Miami flashbacks, explained about midway through the movie. I found Beckinsale unconvincing in her role. In fact all the characters are stiff without any memorable personality traits. Not worth a view. Soundtrack wasn't that good either."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHITEOUT","review":"This movie is about what I expected.

He keeps getting you these s*** parts and you're way better than that. You're talented and you have reassuring puppy dog eyes. I love you. Stop making s****y movies.\\"Whiteout started out godawful and never got any better. After a while, it numbed me with a constant barrage of bad: bad acting, bad writing, bad direction. The word stultifying comes to mind. And, in a film of this \\"quality\\", making me wait 35 minutes for Gabriel Macht to appear is just unforgivable. I knew it would be awful, but the promise of Gabriel Macht gets me to watch some awful movies (I'm looking at you, The Spirit). Well, at least what I saw in the trailers and read in the reviews wasn't misleading. It was every bit as terrible as it looked. Bad movie lovers, rejoice; your search is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even good horror","review":"Typical teen scream horror movie, except set in the South Pole. But, unlike good horror movies that keep you on the edge of your seat, this one is implausible in a bad way. C'mon, face masks would be a minimum, snow would stick. None of the characters is likable. I wanted to like it but just could not. If you really have nothing better to do, you can yell at the screen with a friend -- otherwise don't bother.

The loneliness, the foreboding awe of the polar wilderness, the terror of hopelessness. If you're expecting that kind of feeling from WHITEOUT, you might be as disappointed as me!The plot is almost indiscernible. It's shot so sloppily, there are times you can't even tell what's going on. Kate Beckinsale who CAN act (e.g. THE AVIATOR and NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH) looks totally disinterested; Alex O'Loughlin, Gabriel Macht and Tom Skeritt are flaccid and dull.

This pile of dung will be as quickly forgotten as Kate's other \\"masterpiece\\" from 2008 \\"Winged Creatures\\" aka \\"Fragments\\". Kate needs to start making some better career choices before she gets type cast as a \\"B Movie\\" star - but maybe it's too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Blizzard and 'Who Dunnit'","review":"Whiteout is a chopped together mess of a murder mystery movie. A murderer at the South Pole must be caught and it happens a U.S. Marshall is stationed there. There were several sub-plots in Whiteout that just did not flow well into the main idea.Whiteout focuses on the activities at Amundsen-Scott Research Station and the exotic setting of Antarctica is the \\"hook\\" for the movie. The wind and snow are blowing as the first ever murder is discovered.Kate Beckinsale plays the lead as Carrie Stetko, a U.S. Marshall, stationed in the remote station. In the opening scene she has been sent out to investigate the first murder in the snow and ice. She realizes the body must have been thrown from a plane and the investigation begins. Whiteout then produces way too many slasher scenes as well as disjointed logic throughout.The script was uninspired and lifeless as the winter landscape it was set in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"Kate Beckinsale, Tom Skerritt - cool setting but it adds up to near nothing. Even the basic script was decent but the execution took care of that. A lot of poorly and overdone CGI didn't help much either nor did the actual cause of everything add up. Or the storyline - which in parts was silly.In total a really bad movie in a nice package. Kate and Tom could do nothing to salvage what was or wasn't there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and intense!","review":"A masterpiece. As always, Kusturica combines surrealism with reality to tell a story of profound implications. I would recommend you to take a look at the history of the former Yugoslavia to understand all the symbols Kusturica uses in the movie. Besides the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the movie intelligently portrays the twisted nature of human beings. If you like simple, shallow, and obvious stories, this movie is not for you.This is a movie to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, goofy art-house C**P","review":"Frankly, I'm astonished by how many people worship this puffed up comic book of a movie.The judges at Cannes must have been smoking crack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly intriguing","review":"I used this film as a platform from which to base a term paper I wrote. I didn't quite like it the first time I saw it, but the more I read about Yugoslav history and politics, the more I understood it. It's very clever. Lots of symbols and imagery and philosophical dialgoue. I wouldn't quite call it a fantasy, but it has that feel of magical realism. It skips a bit too much in time, but it does have a concurrent theme which keeps it together. I recommend it, whether you know about the region or not, because it has so many layers to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"underground, it's dark but funny","review":"after loving the 'film black cat white cat', it was but natural that i eagerly wrap up underground. and it did not disapoint me one bit.the better your knowledge of the history & politics of the region the better you can appreciate the wine but the lack of knowledge cannot take away from the enjoyment of it.layered and intelligent under a veneer of sheer mindlessness you get entertained at the rate of thrill a minute and then you might like to see it again to marvel at the story narration, screenplay and characterization.the dvd only frustrates for not giving out special material, something the film is begging for."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty worthless/disconnected","review":"Quite disconnected from my point of view.

For those who still seek a non-existant complexity in the former Yugoslav wars, Underground may be just the delusion. Being a well-informed viewer, however, it strikes me as a poor apologia for the crimes that have occured in the Balkans. Moreover, the characters of Underground represent no one but Kusturica's nightmare vision of a Yugoslav past, present, and future. The film is exaggerated, without taste, and vulgar in all its representations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Palme d'Or? Palme D'OH!","review":"Those crazy Europeans. They suckered me again. Finally I realize that Europe's prestigious \\"Palme d'Or\\" award is not awarded based on artistic merit, but rather on political agenda. Take for example this years recipient, \\"Farenheit 9/11\\". I rest my case.While not as politically in-your-face as F911, \\"Underground\\" is very much a political commentary. To be honest, I agree with that commentary. But that doesn't change the fact that this is not such a great film. I've never seen such a good plot/theme wasted on such a lousy presentation. The characters are so 2-dimensional that you find yourself not caring about anyone. And if you don't care about the characters, the story becomes pointless.I give it 2 stars (instead of 1) because it was a good effort, and I'm willing to cut Emir Kusturica some slack because he did \\"Arizona Dream\\", an excellent film which is nothing like this one. My last words of advice: beware of any film Cannes praises!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great life, Underground life!","review":"This movie is full of sounds and images, sometimes you will feel that you must be there, because living Underground, is a happy living.If you have enough money buy it!

Without any intention to be melodramatic, I have to say that the loss of my homeland was expressed so purely in Kusturica's film that it tore open old wounds and healed them at the same time. I used to dislike Kusturica's style; now I see how wrong I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern classic","review":"This film is truly a masterpiece. Kustarica deserved his \\"Palm D'Or\\" at Cannes for this one. It is a remarkable statement about the insanity of the Balkan wars, and war in general. Further, it is funny, touching, and extremely memorable. I don't want to give too much away (some reviews really do too much of that), but, this is truly an 'essential film of the 1990s'. Further, Goran Bregovic's soundtrack is spectacular. There are so many memorable songs, such as \\"Mesecina\\" and \\"Kalashnikov\\" that will be running through your head years after you've seen the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review on IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT DVD Quality only","review":"RE: DVD by \\"Image Entertainment\\" only.

I found this CD to be a bit monotonous and unfortunately flat. Each song sounded like the next and I found the words to be lacking in any sort of depth. Is this the same man who wrote songs like Nexus and Wild Places?? His emotional attachment and need to express his inner most thoughts and feelings (his strength in his past albums)seem to have disappeared. What's left is a bit shallow and lifeless. SORRY to be so hard on ya Dan but I've been a fan since the very early days and really expected just a BIT more.

The album starts out well with the haunting HALF MOON BAY (too short), the melodic WHEN YOU'RE NOT NEAR ME, and the quiet but likable REASON TO RUN, but it quickly falls into the all too familiar with FULL CIRCLE - hello HIGH COUNTRY SNOWS. ONCE IN LOVE, WHISPERS IN THE WIND, and DRAWING PICTURES are dull and all too reminiscent of the dreadful days of WINDOWS AND WALLS. THIS HEART and ICARUS ASCENDING show a little more imagination, but not much. REACH HAVEN POSTCARD can at least hold its head high.

Herc drinks from an enchanted pool of water and forgets who he is. He ends up with Queen Omphale, convinced he is married to her. Ulysses pretends to be Herc's deaf mute servant and tries to restore the Big Man's memory. There are other political elements to the plot but not much of it makes sense.

The resultant film imagery is like a very old VHS tape.I would not recommend you buy from this distributor. This is symptomatic of a wider problem in which classic films that were made before the advent of the digital age are being treated disgracefully by producing bad low budget DVDs transfers. Show some respect to the director, actors and movie viewer and do it properly or dont do it at all and leave the market open for some other distributor to do it the way it should be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hercules Unchained","review":"My review is not about the movie, that would be a high 'camp' 5.

Clone wars are what the movies should have been, at least for the feeling of it, it truly has a more \\" new hope\\" feel to the way is \\"shot\\", and although, yes it is a series , and yes has more space to grow and explain and expose information, it is just taken more serious than at least episode 1, with more reverence to t he story and a better plot.Having said all that, season one is still the show testing waters, and finding its place ( season 2 has been better, and more consistent with the way its been told) the animation is great, and the stories are for the most part good, but there are a few hit and miss ones there.The blu-ray is definitely the way to see it, since it brings out the beauty of the cg animation, and the extras are great if you have already enjoyed the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the kid","review":"My son loves this.

I liked the Clone Wars feature film, but this method of expanding the Star Wars universe really comes into its own with the first full season of THE CLONE WARS. The series has been a great way of introducing Star Wars to my young sons, but I brought the Blu-ray of season one for me...and I've enjoyed sitting down by myself to watch this great-looking, entertaining and superbly cinematic show. TRESPASS and HOSTAGE CRISIS were, for me, the highlights, though a high standard is maintained over all 22 episodes (even, amazingly, the ones 'starring' Jar Jar). The BluRay presentation does the quality of the production justice. My single gripe would be that I don't know what to do with the onsert that comes with the gorgeous book-style packaging.

I was really hoping this Clone Wars series was going to make up for the turds Lucas put out with those last three movies, but I was sadly mistaken. The show looks great, but the characters are sooooo wooden. Who hires these writers? I understand it's a kids show, but there is no fun or joy to these characters. \\"Avatar, the last airbender\\" was a great kids cartoon...the characters in that series were dynamic and fun to watch, you actually care what happens to them.Also, i personally think every writer on this show should be fined $1000 every time they make one of the characters say \\"I gotta bad feeling about this!\\". Bleeech, my womprat could fart out better dialogue than this....and he's been dead for 15 years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty awful show","review":"The old animated clone wars is far better, this is just full of ridiculous and embarassingly bad droid humour.

But do not let either deter you. This is a must see for any star wars fan.In the spirit of things, it more closely relates to the first trilogy than the second (because that is when it takes place).As others have said, the picture on the blu ray is near reference quality.

But it is difficult for me to express in words how Horwood utterly fails to capture the characters and just creates an absolutely painful experience. The original was a masterpiece and the characters - even toad- were gentle, loving creatures, with transcendent subtle nature. These characters are somehow mean, shallow, and just plain awful. Reading it (and I promise you I longed to do so and meet them again) just so ruins these characters that it made me cringe page after page. Why did he do this?

I don't know if my dog is just a horrible case but it's been months and there is no improvement. My dog won't chew on anything I give him as a distraction. If he even hears the door, forget it, he's howling. I live in an apartment and I really need something that works. I've practiced desensitization techniques when it comes to my leaving routine, leaving for short periods of time and then increasing it, leaving a sock that smells like me with him, giving him a stuffed Kong to keep him busy, a citronella collar, a comfort diffuser with dap, and just about everything else and he is still a nightmare when left alone. I guess if your dog's anxiety isn't too bad this might work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off","review":"For $11, I thought I was getting a BOOK. This was a big pamplet, maybe more like a booklet. Not worth $11. I have another McConnell booklet and one that's an actual book, and I will read them because her info is good. But not worth $11. Please don't gouge me again - I cannot afford it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful unless your dog has separation anxiety","review":"I was looking for a book with advice on how to care for my dog while I'm working, but this was not helpful at all. It may be more useful for people who own dogs that have separation anxiety. I would recommend buy Happy Dog by Arden Moore instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quick read","review":"This book is brief and small but I liked that because it contained a lot of good information and gave me some great pointers to do right away.

After reading it, I realized I was doing things to reinforce my dog's anxiety. This book has given me much hope on helping my dog's separation anxiety. It's a great resource!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective! Intentionally short.","review":"Patricia McConnell knows how little time many of us have which is why she makes this series of books only 30 or so pages long. She is direct and to the point to solve your training problem without lots of fluff and cute little dog stories. When we have a dog training issue very few of us have time to read a novel on how to solve it. I for one want to cut to the chase and start solving the problem right away. The methods used in this book are clear and easy to apply and they work. My dog has stopped destructive chewing when I'm away and is clearly much happier. Thank you Ms. McConnell (oh and Daisy my APBT thanks you too) A few reviewers gave these books a low rating because they are short. Amazon clearly indicates how many pages this book has and it's priced accordingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good start if your dog has Separation Anxiety","review":"This is a good start if your dog has mild Separation Anxiety. This gives you the first few things that you can try and gives you a good understanding about Separation Anxiety. If you try everything in this book and it does not help your situation, try the book \\"The Dog That Loved Too Much\\" and see your vet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Separation anxiety counter conditioning","review":"I bought this little booklet because I have had a dog in the past who had problems with separation anxiety, so I already know I don't know what to do to help such a dog. Also, the breed I am considering for my next dog has a high need for companionship, and I wanted to know how to forestall any behaviour (on my part or the dog's) that would result in separation anxiety. The author defines what separation anxiety is (and is not) and explains how it can develop. She then gives examples and exercises that will help you and your dog, inch by slow inch, learn a different behaviour and become sound of mind again. It's a short book that doesn't sugar coat the seriousness of the problem or the work and time involved in solving it, but it is also sprinkled throughout with good humor and clear evidence that the author loves dogs and wants to help them lead happy lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book out there for separation anxiety","review":"We adopted our rescued puggle nearly four years ago, and when he came to us he had a severe case of separation anxiety. I did tons of research on how to help him - materials from our vet, other books - but it was this little book that gave the most thorough, effective and sensible approach to overcoming the problem - and IT WORKED :-)! McConnell doesn't downplay the hard work it takes to get your dog past this difficult problem, but she also tells you that once it's solved, it's solved forever - and this has proven to be absolutely true. We thank you so much, Ms. McConnell, and so does our dog Hank!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, geared more towards those that don't understand dog behaviors","review":"This book gave great insight to the differences between separation anxiety, boredom and similar issues. Previously working in the Veterinary field gave me some knowledge on these issues anyway, but this book was a great refresher and really broke it down.I recommend this book to anyone who is considering getting a new dog or puppy and to those that do not understand the behaviors that dogs use to communicate with their people."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"Overall this is a good refrence book to keep handy as review incase you forget something. Most of the things in here we had heard before"},{"rating":"1","title":"No new information in this book","review":"I bought this book thinking I would learn some new information that could help with my dog's stress level.

This being a Hollywood romantic comedy, there are a lot of bumps in the road before they can get together for a lifetime of happiness. This is a good, enjoyable comedy-recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read this book in 3 days","review":"I loved this book. Olivia Goldsmith is great at creating characters that you love to hate.

Nobody fashions the characters you love to hate like Olivia Goldsmith. I sometimes have gotten impatient with her heavyhandedness in other books (like Young Wives--hyperbolic in its vindictiveness), but over-the-top is what Hollywood is all about. I couldn't put the book down, reading it for eight hours at a time, hungry to know what happens next. I also found this book satisfying in its biting ridicule of \\"the beauty myth\\" in America.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember the cliche-'trees died to make this book'? Waste!","review":"Paper-thin characters, implausible plot, way too long. The writer includes a pet peeve of mine; she pretends to show outrage over violence against and physical exploitation of women while offering drooly examples of violence against and physical exploitation of women. Just an example of how carelessly this book is written; the book is set in the 1990's and one of the major characters, Lila, is around 18. However, Lila's mother was a star in 1948."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was so long................","review":"and I wish it was even longer. This is my all-time favorite Olivia Goldsmith.

Miss Goldsmith, please write a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I disliked the characters so much I quit reading it","review":"Not since Gone With The Wind have I so wanted to reach into the pages of a book and slap the whiny women in it.I had great hopes for a fun read with industry insider plot but was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid!","review":"I was overjoyed with how quickly the item shipped to me. Upon opening it, I encountered many user errors. For one, I had a hard time removing the inner thread bracket, which is removed by simply unscrewing it. Secondly, my Samson CO1U got stuck on the mount and I had to call my friend to help me get it unstuck. After the initial trials, I finally got it up and in working condition! It works pretty well and looks amazing with the CO1U."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits other mikes","review":"Does indeed fit the Audio Technica 2020, but needs a custom nylon washer (or cardboard), as it is not a snug fit when the rotary knob at the bottom of the mount is screwed in to secure it. Also tried it with the MXL 990 and it is a good match, and fits very well. Weight of both mikes seems in range for the suspension. Not usable with the Oktava MK 319, though. A very nice mount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shockmount for the money.","review":"Just received this shockmount and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of construction and stability when used with a \\"heavy\\" condenser mic. I purchased this to use with an Audio-Technica AT-2020 and it works perfectly. Because the mic actually screws into a rotating threaded ring, you can orient the mic any way you want. Time will tell, but my initial reaction is a very positive one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock steady Shock Mount from Samson","review":"I was gifted this Samson SP01 Shock Mount at Christmas from my wife along with an Audio Technica USB Microphone and other accessories.

But when I opened it up I found a very solid product for a great deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessity","review":"I ran a few recording tests on my microphone with and without the shock mount. It seems that ambient noise is generally reduced with the shock mount on. It's especially effective when the microphone is on my desk, where my computer tower (which has 7 fans) is directly under it. It's not perfect, but the level of noise reduction really is amazing. On top of all that, it looks nice too. If you are planning to buy a condenser mic for your desk, you should definitely consider getting this, along with a solid stand and a pop filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine mount, but DOES NOT FIT the AT-2020","review":"In May 2012 I bought two of these to mount a pair of AT-2020s based on the pic in the listing and the reviews suggesting the threads are the same.They are not - no ifs, ands or buts.The AT-2020 is so much smaller that the threads on the Samson mount barely bite. That turns out to be a good thing, as the pitch on each thread is different and if engaged could damage one or both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily modded. Nice unit.","review":"This Sam SP01 can be easily modded for use with the Oktava MK319. I found instructions through a google search. The metal piece on the bottom of the mic holder must be removed. Instead of hammering it out, I used two screwdrivers to pry it out. That leaves a nice hole which is just a little too small to use. Using my dremel tool, I was able to enlarge the hole just a bit. As a guide the piece you remove fits in a small groove. You must file down the sides til the groove is almost not visible. Then your Oktava will fit just fine. This mod is not easily reversible so keep that in mind before starting. I'll post up a picture later.I found the screw-on connector to not be that high quality. It wanted to cross thread as I putting it on my mic stand. So I wouldn't want to be taking it off and putting it back on frequently. That's my only complaint about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit Yeti condenser mic","review":"I saw the title \\"Samson SP01 Shockmount Spider Mount for Condenser Mics\\" and bought it, my mistake. It doesn't fit any condenser mic, just Samson mics looks like. Looks a good product, but it's not for my mic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shockmount","review":"When you get it, it looks so simple, so basic that you can't believe that it doesn't come with the mic, but companies got to make their money right? I use it with my Samson CL8 condenser and it is perfect. Works great for podcasting, vocals or anything else you want to record. The adjustment knob is a little tight but whatever, it does its job well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for AKG mics","review":"Bought this for my AKG Perception 220 mic ... doesn't have the right thread. Aside from that it looks pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent unit","review":"This is a terrific, lightweight, sturdy unit that does its job wonderfully. Any resonance it might have picked up is negated well by the suspension (even when on the floor next to the piano at our church). The machining is first class. Worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"It don't fit","review":"This shock mount doesn't fit my V67G consendensor mic. Maybe they forgot to pack a suitable adapter ring. I'll have to take it down to the workshop and have it modded."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Noise","review":"Added the shockmount and instantly started getting white noise. Didn't even think to attribute it to the shockmount so I was checking all my settings/etc... doing the whole routine. Took off the shockmount to have the white noise stop immediately.Not sure if I am the only one who has experienced this... perhaps it's just a fluke, but sucks on my end. Wasn't expecting a shockmount to create noise.Bummed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous!","review":"Made in 1986, this series hasn't lost any of its beauty, which is enhanced by the wonderful narration by the late Richard Kiley. Especially poignant is the fact that the second chapter shows an early liftoff of the Space Shuttle Challenger, which is featured in that episode and which had just been lost in January 1986, just before that episode aired. The series is ahead of its time in many areas such as \\"The Climate Puzzle\\" with its discussion of greenhouse warming. The photography of the series remains compelling and fascinating. Yes, a little bit of it is out of date, but for the most part it's a wonderful introduction to geology and earth science. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"I bought this primarily because I'm a huge Brian Wilson fan and I wanted to hear him and Carnie sing together. They do a great job on \\"You Are So Beautiful\\", the song that Dennis Wilson used to sing at Beach Boys concerts. Brian sounds as good here as he has anywhere recently, which is saying a lot. His vocals since 2004's release of \\"SMiLE\\" have been excellent.Lots of the Wilson clan perform on this CD:Justyn Wilson sings on his father Carl's \\"Heaven\\"Wendy Wilson sings on \\"With The Sun\\"Daria and Delanie Wilson sing on \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\"Marilyn Wilson (The Honeys) sings on Dennis' \\"Forever\\"At first listen I enjoyed the classic songs like \\"Over The Rainbow\\" and \\"Wonderful World\\" the most, but the original songs are quickly growing on me. Carnie's voice is soft and soothing with a Karen Carpenter quality to it.I'm giving a copy to my grandchildren. Meanwhile, it's a relaxing and pleasant listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"This CD is wonderful. The way she sings these songs just go right to the heart. Track #3 Lola Sofia and track #6 Heaven are just absolutly lovely and catchy melodies too. Wonderful, Wonderful album !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'A' for effort :-)","review":"This is quite a lovely cd. You can tell this is a labour (excuse the pun) of love. Even though I'm not yet a mother, I absolutely love Carnies voice so I had to scoop this up. I've always loved Wilson Phillips as a group and I knew that Carnie would pull off as good a solo effort.Her voice is stunning and soft and soothing and very appropriate for babies to quiet down to. She's done some great songs on here and even written some new ones with her hubby. I love the classics and I really enjoy You Are So Beautiful, Lola Sofia and Over The Rainbow. The only song I'm struggling to come to grips with and get used to is Love Me Tender. Yes in fact it is the same Love Me Tender that Elvis did but she's 'made it her own'. Other than that, the songs are lovely and she's done a great first solo cd. This is a great gift idea for your friends or even if you yourself are finding it hard to drift off at night. It's relaxing and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than expected, Seriously","review":"Ok, I know if you came to this album, you're probably a fan of Carnie and her music. To be honest I wasn't. After siting down and really listening to the music, I started to like it, and eventually loving it. Her rendition of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" and \\"You Are So Beautiful\\" are really really good. Brian Wilson really surprises me his performance. He still has it."},{"rating":"1","title":"headache band","review":"Being a migraine sufferer, I was really anticipating trying this item BUT the product has an EXTREMELY strong perfume/soap ODOR that is from being on a shelf next to strong smelling items or possibly being packaged w/ them. Therefore,once I have a headache, it is not possible for me to even try the product because strong perfume smells ALWAYS make migraines much worse. So, I am extremly disappointed that I can't give it a fair shot. I used to work in a natural foods store so I am very familiar w/ this smell. A lot of the natural soaps have a very potent smell.

Your thumb can easily overlap buttons.- The buttons feel cheap and make loud audible clicks. Very distracting in a class.I'm highly suspicious of the positive reviews here. This is a really terrible remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not last","review":"This device is great when it works. The green light is a bit dim but that is OK. However, the device started to malfunction only after half a semester. First, the prev button acted as next and the next stopped working. Then the receiver was off completely. I thought I could just use it as a pointer. Surely. My only trouble is how to turn it off. I examined the electronics. It is probably due to cheap and crapy pushbuttons and circuit.

It lasted through two semesters teaching one class per semester. However, once I started full-time (this past year), it was so inconsistent that I finally just had to stop using it to avoid constantly interrupting my classes. One press of the button would either skip through 2-3 slides at a time, or the delay would be so great that I'd push the button again and after several seconds it'd follow orders. Other days it just wouldn't work at all. I was literally standing 15 feet away from my laptop whenever this happened.

I ordered it with next day delivery for trip out of country, it cam exactly on time and I put it in my carryon. At the other end, pulled it out, quickly tried it, and was very pleased. If I were to redesign it, I'd find a way to have the mouse be a little more \\"mouse-like\\" with a trackball or equal; and I'd make the laser dot a little bigger and brighter.

With that said...I thought I'd wait a few months before actually finishing my review. The last 2 wireless presenters I purchased only lasted 6 months (different brand), which is why I decided to go with a different brand this time.I can't comment on 'button life' or 'battery life' yet.

When the USB is inserted, it proclaims that it doesn't recognize the keyboard and you have to jump a couple of hoops to get past that. Once you fuss with that and try to start the presentation, it knocks Powerpoint out of slideshow mode and back into slide view - and then won't do anything else. The pointer works fine, and the mouse is controllable as long as you don't mind it being really slooooooooow - but otherwise this is a worthless piece of crap. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT reach even 50 ft.!","review":"This pointer would be fine for in-class use if you are a teacher; however, if you are wanting to use it in a large room, go with a Targus. I purchased this remote specifically because it said it had a 100 ft. range. It does NOT. Once you exceed about 30 feet it begins to behave erratically, not moving when you push the button, then skipping through 2-3 slides the next time you press it.

I saw the great reviews and felt that these would be a win. Unfortunately, the mouse function is less than functional. The bidirectional movement does not allow an educator in front of a class of 75 students to be able to quickly move to the desired icon or location on the screen. That low functionality coupled with poor/inconsistent reception to the USB device located in within 50 feet created multiple embarrassed educators. We have a reputation for excellence.

I decided to try a AAA battery powered model because the laser pointer I used before used expensive batteries. I loved this model, but after only a few months of use, the pointer button gave in. It ended up being as costly as the special battery using laser model I had before."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't last long","review":"I bought this wireless presenter to use in my classroom. The price, carrying case, fashionable color,and laser feature made it very appealing. Sometimes light weight can be a bonus, but this product just felt too light and cheap. The laser feature never really worked, but advancing from slide-to-slide was fine for a couple of months. Then it just gave out. I was sure it was the batteries, but that was not the case. Soon after, a guest presenter was visiting our classroom & told me that she had purchased the same one & that it turned out to be a piece of junk. Lesson learned: you get what you pay for.

With the mouse function (a simple click of a switch away), I can also click on the video clips imbedded in the slide show without having to go back to my desktop. With the laser pointer I can highlight parts of the maps without having to go back to the front of the room. It is the freedom I need when delivering lectures, becuase it allows me to interact more with the class and not stay next to my computer to advance slides. It was very reasonable priced, so much so that I also purchased a second one for my mother-in-law (also a teacher).

The first set was perfect and exactly like in the picture with one slot in the shaft for the bearings in the driver chuck to connect. I liked it, and ordered another to have one in a dedicated portable tool chest. The second set was ordered using the same link, but was not the same socket adapters at all. There were two slim slots in the shaft and got immediately stuck in my dewalt 18 volt impact driver. I had to rip it out with the assistance of vice-grips and persistent knocking with a second wrench.

Its fine for what it is, a cheap set of adapters to get you by, but def not high quality. They did hold onto the sockets nicely and didnt crack or bend with an 18v impact on them.Bottom line in my opinion, if you want a set to last you a while and look nice in your toolbox, look elsewhere.

Well you can replace it but it requires a general contractor, a plumber and the loss of the use of your shower for 8 months while you try to find out where the contractor disappeared to after demolishing you shower stall. So six months down the road when you are feeling solvent again after paying for a bathroom remodel you realize you are going to have this for the rest of your life (or until you sell the house) and it could be better. Bottom line is buck up and fork out, buy something REALLY NICE because otherwise you have to live with the disappointment staring at you every morning.

The content here is high bpm electronic music with a light-hearted theme that matches the colorful and tropical cover art quite well. It includes tracks by rising stars in the electronic trance scene such as Minister and Concept, and also features a couple of tracks by more well known artists like ATB and Mirco De Govia. The whole compilation flows together well...I especially like the last song, Monkey Forest, for providing a dramatic conclusion to the album. Consider this CD the \\"Pure Moods\\" of trance music...sort of a soft interlude from the bass intensive psytrance and goa trance genres.

I think this particular book was an excerpt from Milavec's more detailed longer version. Excellent choice for anyone who is researching or studying early church history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable for studies of the early church","review":"This short book is highly recommended for anyone interested in understanding the development of the early Christian church. I read with fascination about the practices of one early group. At least some of the writings must date back to the very earliest years when there were several distinct \\"Jesus sects\\", probably before the writings of Paul were well known. Specifically, I found that the text for the eucharist (Section 9) is truly a thanksgiving, without the Christology of the later church added. (The word \\"eucharist\\" comes from the Greek for \\"thanks\\".) However, one can find traces of later additions, such as the Trinity added in Section 7. Thus we can see layers as the church developed.Milavec has a good introduction to the material, and then gives a strong argument for why the Didache is organized as it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"We got the jack and it was broken.

No, they probably wont jack up your junky import car without tearing the fascia off of it, but they will jack up a tractor or a barn or a fence post or anything substantial that needs lifting. These are tools for work, they aren't made to look pretty. Like any quality tool, they must be taken care of to remain reliable. You leave one of these outside standing up against a tree for a year and it probably won't work well.

It IS a great beginners book. The only way you cannot learn from it, is if you need some one-on-one hands on attention. Yes, most of the patterns are for children, BUT when starting a new project as a beginner, it is best to do a smaller scale project or you will be overwhelmed. The back of the book tells you how to calculate a pattern for the best overall measurements. The book does call for mostly Rowan Designer DK Wool, But they also all have a gauge, so if you want to use another yarn, just knit to the gauge. It is VERY helpful showing all of the techniques from holding the yarn, casting on, knit, purl, increase, decrease, bind off, picking up dropped stitches, yarn overs, knitting w/ beads, all the way to designing your own patterns.

So the whole premise of the book....increasing your skills as you move from beginning to more advanced projects.... does not seem to apply for anyone who either has no children, or whose children are older. Even the final chapter on designing your own sweaters says, \\"In this workshop you will be shown how to compile a very basic pattern for a child's sweater.\\" This book should be called \\"How to Knit for Your Child.\\" Get \\"The Big Book of Knitting,\\" instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Knitting book","review":"This is great for a beginning knitter and the pattern suggestions and designs are valuable for experienced knitters, too.

Her designs are always good looking while being fairly simple and her instructions start with the basics and build on those.

J-Dilla, who is also a solid producer).But besides those 2 songs, the rest of the album is surprisingly forgettable.

I find it extremely dull, but the kids actually like it, and sing along. In some places the CD stays silent in the answer portion, so that the kids are supposed to sing along and fill in the blank, which they like. It does seem to be helping my daughter with the rote memorization of these math facts needed to do well on the timed math tests many schools begin at this age. And it is certainly less painful than flash cards, which both my daughter and I hated.I don't think my kids would listen to it at home though, it is really best used in a car, so if you have some regular car-time and need some math facts enforcement, this is a good option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful you get what you want","review":"Product wasn't what we were looking for.

The section on Group Policy is not bad.However - just go to Borders and compare the difference - Minasi's book on 2003 server is *the* bible to have with regards to decent technical writing and explanantions of real world situatios with regards to 2003 server."},{"rating":"1","title":"MS Press can do better...","review":"I'm a current MCSE in Windows 2000, but as a trainer, I decided to get caught up on the current 2003 titles. I recently picked up this book, after taking this exam already. I can tell you without a doubt, this book does not dig deep enough into what you will need to prepare for the exam. The questions themselves are way too easy, there are a number of topics not touched on, and in geneal, this book is very dry.

I've done the real test twice, making worse the second time even after buying Measure-Up practice tests and re reading the books I have. Microsoft makes the test even harder the second time and have the nerve to claim that they don't. The manager at the testing center admitted that they do but he doesn't know why.I'm beginning to understand why a lot of people don't really like Microsoft.I'm disappointed in much of the so called training material that is being offered for this test and am beginning to think that it's all a big plot to relieve poor slobs of their money, me included.Read and use this book at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless for veterans or newbies","review":"If you get handon experience with Windows admin, you will pass even without this book.

Oh well...at least I tried them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible stuff","review":"I am a great lover of licorice. And I don't know what this stuff is, but it ain't licorice. It has a strong ammonia taste, and reminds me more of droppings in a cat's litter box than any sort of candy. I've been told this is just a 'different' sort of licorice, and it's meant to be slightly salty, instead of sweet. But I'm not confusing ammonia with salt. This definitely has a urine odor, and since I've never tasted cat urine, I can only guess this is what it would taste like. Don't waste your money.

If the manufacturer had spent another nickle on licorice extract this candy might be palatable. The consistency is fine, like a soft gummy bear. The flavor is severely lacking. What flavor there is is almost acrid. The manufacturer also missed the mark on the nutritional information. Each package is 7 oz. The per serving information is listed for a 42 gram serving with no indication as to how many pieces that is. There is also caution about eating too much will cause you lower tract distress, but again, there is no indication as to how much is too much.

Though, Badalamenti's adaptation of the song is nice. The standouts: Doggett Trio, Love Letters, Mysteries of Love, Aakron Meets the Blues. NOTE: If you want to invest in \\"Bobby Vinton's Greatest Hits\\" for Blue Velvet, adjust the balance clockwise to about eight to make the vocal harmonies sound distant as Lynch did. The song was also originially recorded in B-Flat, and Lynch speeded the pitch control to the key of B, which actually sounds better.

The problem is that quantity does NOT equal quality. The 1980s saw TD score a ton of movies, and judging by some of the titles, they sure didn't discriminate. TD's soundtrack output started wonderfully with Sorcerer (1977) and continued with great work on Thief (1981), The Keep (1983), and Firestarter (1984). Then it went pear-shaped, and they started banging out soundtracks like they were paying the rent. They went from scoring moderately big Hollywood movies that people had at least heard of to doing flicks like Dead Solid Perfect, Deadly Care, Catch Me If You Can(!) and Three O'Clock High. What happened? And this says nothing about the music itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our baby boy loves this furniture!","review":"Our 9-month-old son loves this furniture!

Again, I think this is one of the better cheap grinders out there, but definately not what it easily could and certainly should be.

The first part of the book concentrates on \\"What is lean?\\" and \\"How does it change things?\\" The second part of the book looks at how the accounting function changes from one of bean counter to one of high value business partner.An important concept is the idea of accuracy vs. precision. While much information is both, accountants tend to spend a great deal of time making information precise, while being accurate is good enough. As a past accountant for over 20 years, I myself have fallen into the precise trap.

S. Macaulay and the Clarksons) but I still was unclear on exactly how to implement the program with my child. Catherine Levison's book took me by the hand and gave me concrete examples of how to implement the CM method. Especially helpful were the sample schedules, from Levison's own home school and from Charlotte Mason herself. This is the book that actually got me started on implementing the CM method in my home school!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Children's Sake is better","review":"This book gave a pretty good synopsis of Charlotte Mason's methods. I guess if you just want some quick ideas on how to get started it will give you what you're looking for. However, I believe everything she says can be found in For the Children's Sake, by Susan Schaeffer McCauley (in a section in the latter half of the book... no need to read all of the book before you start. You can just flip to the section that summarizes Mason's methods). And McCauley also has a wealth of other information on Charlotte Mason's philosophy and methods. So I'd say, save your money and buy McCauley's book - you'll be getting two for the price of one, so to speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell Me More","review":"I could tell this book was written by a homeschooling mom and not a professional writer...not because of grammar, but the book was lacking in information and flow. I know homeschooling mom's are great resources, nothing against them, I just was very frustrated with this book. I have read many books about Charlotte Mason and her methods, and I think this is the reason I was dissappointed with this book. My friend read it and learned a lot. I think Catherine Levison's second book \\"More Charlotte Mason\\" does a much better job. The second book is basically a rewrite of the first adding all the information that was missing from the first book, like more detail on Charlotte Mason and what she stood for. So if you are wanting to read this book, just skip it and read her second one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catherine's books are most helpful","review":"I have really enjoyed both of Catherine's books. The first book really intrigued me and piqued my interest in the Charlotte Mason method. It was so easy to apply! In her second book, More Charlotte Mason Education, she gave us a lot more information and how-to's.

I highly recommend this as a must read for anyone wanting to quickly learn and implement this approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and Concise","review":"I enjoyed reading A Charlotte Mason Education because it gave a clear and concise overview of what a CM education might be like. She included her own schedules and that of the PNEU schools as a guideline, but also acknowledged that many CM families are more relaxed.

I even started a notebook in which I went through, chapter by chapter, and recorded information that was particularly inspiring or instructive.The author does a fantastic job of condensing the writings of Charlotte Mason and her peers and, for me, made the method seem far less daunting. This is in contrast to Karen Andreola's \\"A Charlotte Mason Companion\\" which made me feel a bit overwhelmed at the very idea of implementing even one of CM's ideas into our homeschool!This book gives the \\"what\\" - \\"why\\" AND the \\"how\\" in a very accessible way.I recommend this book to parents and teachers - whether you homeschool or not.

It does include a lot of information about the Charlotte Mason method, but does nothing to explain to me why I should use that method myself.

Admittedly I understand Cantonese and some of the translation is dodgy, but this shouldn't stop you rushing out and buying this.Contrary to what has been written before, this isn't a parody of Chow Yun Fat's 'God Of Gamblers' but rather the trilogy of 'Saints of Gamblers' films (itself a paroday of God of Gamblers, yes complicated but bare with me), which, you've guessed it, stars Stephen Chow too.

There isn't anything redeeming about God of Cookery.

The beats are simple and Im pretty sure I have already heard them in all the other meaningless rap hits of the day. So my problem with the Big Tymers is that they have no real ryhming talents and it's like the only reason they make a beat is to fill up the background of their 3rd grade ryhming ablities. And rapping about all the money/jewelry/clothes/cars you have just dosent do a lot for me...i mean how am i supposed to relate to that? There is just no substance on this cd and its sad that this cd was ever #1.

The guest apperance doesnt sound like the usual Cash Money family on everysong. Boo & Gotti doesnt cut it, the new Cash Money crew is weak, without Juvenile and BG, it just doesnt sound the same.

This is a perfect flash if you want to take some more serious pictures. I use it with a Sony DSC F707 and the result is great. The pictures turn out great both indoors and outdoors. The only bad thing about this flash is the battery problem. It eats up the batteries so fast.

Because it communicates with the camera, it fires a pre-flash to determine ideal exposure and then takes the shot.

It's strong enough that when used during daylight it fills the shadows (i.e. under the eyes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it - You'll like it","review":"If you want better indoor exposures from your compatible Sony camera this is definitely the flash to get. With this flash you will automatically eliminate red-eye, have the ability to exceed 10 feet of distance between you and your subject (which is about the maximum effective distance of most Sony built-in flashes), and one feature I especially like with this flash is being able to bounce the flash off the ceiling for a more natural look, avoiding the \\"washed out\\" look that happens with many flash exposures.

I immediately recognized that the splotches were a FUNGUS (I knew because many years before I had seen such splotches on someone else). I stopped using the shampoo right away and put lotrimin on my back where the splotches were (since lotrimin is anti-fungal). Within about 2 days (with continued lotrimin use), the splotches cleared up. I had never before had such a reaction to any product. It was scary...Maybe the Icelandic Sap Moss in the shampoo I bought was contaminated with some fungus somehow and it is not the norm but I can assure you I am NEVER buying this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good grinder, but they stopped thinking a little too soon","review":"I just got this unit from Amazon (a GREAT store)and put it together. I am very pleased with the smoothness of operation (inifinetly better than my old Craftsman grinder), but less than pleased with the not very well thought out scheme for attaching the plastic vision safety guards and and the aluminum pedestals for supporting the piece you are grinding. The former attach to steel brackets that can easily come in contact with the grinding wheels (not good) and the latter are only supported on one side and as such can tilt when you apply pressure to a piece being ground (not good, either).The instructions are also quite poor in showing how to assemble the accesories. It reads like it was written by someone for whom English is a second language.Also, wish it had a brake as the grinding wheels spin a LONG time after you power off.Overall, a good tool, but one whose designers stopped thinking too soon when designing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"As far as I know it's doing great.

So I set out one day for the basics, a drill press, a table saw, an air compressor and a bench grinder. That day I came home with the 6 inch DeWalt bench grinder. Since that day, I've used it to sharpen lawn mower blades, remove burs from angle iron I've drilled and many other chores. I've used other makes of the 6 inch bench grinder, and they just simply don't have the guts of the DeWalt. The DeWalt bench grinder starts up fast, doesn't have a problem removing neccessary material, and runs very quietly. It is relatively easy to change wheels, the only improvement I would make on the grinder would be to use finger tightening screws to make it easier to change grinding wheels. Other than that...Great Job DeWalt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dewalt DW756 review","review":"This was not my favorite Dewalt purchase. It's very difficult to use the grinding wheels as they are located too close to the motor housing. There is not a lot of room to manuever your work. The other downside is that the motor diameter is almost the same as the grinding wheel itself. I installed a 6\\" diameter wire brush on one side and could not keep the arbor nuts tightened. I should have saved up and Spent the extra money to purchase a Baldor grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"wheel wobble","review":"I looked for a cause of the wheel wobble and found that the step on the shaft that the clamping washers bear on was not machined accurately, also the step is quite narrow and doesn't leave much of a surface to mount to I concluded that this was not anything I was willing to put up with and sent the thing back. The good thing is that Amazon paid the return shipping. All in all lots of this imported stuff doesn't measure up. Not that quality isn't possible but the $ rules and you get the result in the finished product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Grinder With Bad Wobble","review":"The grinder seemed to be built strongly. After mounting to my bench and turning on, the grinder had a terrible vibration, enough to make tools vibrate off my work bench. After looking closely, I found that the course wheel was close to an 1/8\\" out of balance. When I tried to remove the wheel, I found that it was impossible to remove the wheel cover with first unbolting the grinder from my bench due to it having 2 screws that go in from the bottom. I decided to return it and look for a better, more user friendly alternative.Pros: Seems like a very strong unit. Good tool rests.Cons: Very bad wheel wobble. Unnecessarily hard to remove/replace the wheels due to the design of the wheel covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good grinder","review":"This is a good grinder as far as grinders go, but not particularly useful for everyday use. I only use it for sharpening my lawn mower blade. For small jobs, I have switched to a Dremel. I like the idea of clamping a small piece of metal, and then grinding away, rather than having my fingers close to the grinding wheels.Also, there is no speed control. That means you can not use it to sharpen anything that you care about, as the speed is way too fast.This is likely the least used tool in my shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dewalt Grinder","review":"The grinder works as stated. This is the first grinder I owned. Therefore, I need time to try it for a better response. To hold the blade correctly without having the motor in the way, is a problem.Making the proper angle consistent with the length of the blade needs to be deliberated.

This was a score I longed to purchased many years ago for one reason only: the sequence of music composed during the Marines escape upon finally discovering the aliens for the first time. On the CD, this lengthy track is \\"Futile Escape.\\" In the movie, the music is drowned out by the sound effects, but on your stereo the true nature of this amazing track depicting the terror of the marines and their desire to escape can be heard properly. Additionally, this CD has a track (Bishop's Countdown) which is routinely used in movie trailers because of it's adrenaline pumping climax. It's sensational. The CD overall is a great listen. It has very solid action pieces and very quiet moody moments that keep the suspense hanging. If you want wall-to-wall action cues, you won't get it. Some may also get annoyed with the handful of quieter tracks. But, it's a good balance. A great score to a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic sequel with a distinct sound of its own.","review":"ALIENS had little in common with its predecessor other than the return of Ripley, the Alien, and the production design of the first movie. So it is not surprising that James Horner's excellent score goes in a different direction. Using the spooky sound of Jerry Goldsmith's score as a starting point (with all the clicking and clacking of sounds in the background and the faint moaning of melancholy woodwinds and brass) the score has echoes of military motifs during the suspense cues and a fierce pounding rhythm for the action ones. Great stuff, no library would be complete without it. Highly recommended. But you might want to hunt out the expanded edition rather than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horner's Best Racket","review":"It is one Horner's best put-together performances with elegant LSO playing. The much-fetishized score itself is the usual collection of rewrites of familiar repertoire, from Goldsmith's original 1979 progenitor score to Kachaturian and Leonard Bernstein. It all mostly is effective in the flic but resonates more as a lot of orchestral effects-- crash-clang-trill-- simplifying and making literal the qualities which the original film and score left mysterious and threatening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This has got to be one of Horner's best works.

It is passionate, fascinating and full of good advice for a layperson like me. The explanations of the ideas of the major philosophers are crystal-clear, but these one can find in quite a few other good commentaries. What I found most valuable in this book was its advice on how we should approach a philosophical work: that the logical progression of ideas is not everything in a work; that philosophy is more a work of art that should be approached as such; that one should not just look for proof of the validity of ideas, but instead see if those ideas are helpful in explaining reality.

First, it looks great! But it also protects the player if dropped or tipped over. The case's leather is a substantial density but still sleek enough to fit comfortably into a pocket or small space in your handbag. The kickstand keeps the player upright on your desk when using it while working and the back of the kickstand has a very substantial belt clip on it. The kickstand also snaps tightly into place when not being used. There is also a sturdy silver ring at the top of the case should you want to clip it onto your belt or bag that way or maybe even wear it around your neck on a chain. This item comes in a great variety of great colors, too. You can mix or match with your player's color to suit your own style."},{"rating":"1","title":"It protects the Zen... from outside damage","review":"It decently protects the Zen Vision M from outside damage. I do not feel worried if/when I drop the unit. However there are 2 big things wrong with this model, which I'm not sure can be fixed by any other product:1. It collects dust and lint from my pocket, and traps it between the Zen's screen and the case's screen cover. Taking the Zen out to clean off the screen is very annoying.2. The stitching that attaches the plastic screen cover to the leather scratches the hell out of the Zen unit (this is VERY noticeable on my black Zen Vision M).However, the kickstand is pretty nice when placing it on a table for viewing.Overall, though, I wish I had not purchased this case, and instead got a slimmer case that is more comfortable in my pocket and doesnt scratch the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but requires work","review":"The leather is so new when you get it, that's it's too tight to operate the Zen through the leather until it stretches out. I've been keeping my Zen in the leather case for about a month now, and I still have to take it out to push the play, menu, back and shortcut buttons. The beltclip is nice, but when I was walking with it clipped on, it flopped around a lot, and wouldn't be good for jogging or exercising. Also, the 'kick stand' didn't work very well; it kept folding itself back up, causing the player to fall over. Lastly, the black leather is leaving stains on the white parts of my Zen, so that when it's not in the case, it looks really dirty. I don't recommend it, but I'm not planning on sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"didnt get what I wanted","review":"When ordering this product it just list the colors available and no where does it allow you to choose a color.I ordered the green zen and we got a pink case?

The belt clip works well, the stand has proven handy (who knew?), and the functions all are accessible and it keeps fingerprints off.

The convenient hole in the bottom of the case allows the attachment of the Zen's proprietary dongle for charging/connecting to computer and I really never have to remove the Zen from its case for any reason. The kickstand is extremely useful for standing the Zen upright when attached to external speakers or just viewing video. The case is sturdy and protects the Zen from falls, dust and dirt very well. When I first received it, the leather was a bit stiff so manipulating the Zen's buttons was tricky, but after a few days it was not a problem. My case is in the baby pink color and it has never stained the back of my Zen and I have not experienced any scratching. I couldn't be happier with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonfunctional!","review":"I got my Zen for Christmas, as like another poster said, accessories aren't plentiful for this device.I did buy this leather case, and also the gel one.

Eventually I don't use my ZEN for watching movies. So monitor cover doesn't bother me so much. If I did I would have to clean that cover and protect it.The case is comfortable on my belt. The only complaint is headphones cable is always under tension and the seams go down first always. But it is not the case.Pressing buttons became a matter of intuition. I managed to cope with that after a couple of days.Using the case and the sync adapter is a tricky operation, because the adapter is prevented from fitting by that case. So, if you don't want to lose you data you'd better to remove the case before connecting the adapter.Overall is good. Having Zen on a belt is better than in a pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost ruined my ZEN","review":"I was excited to get this case and right off I notice you CAN NOT charge it or download music unless you take it out of the case (I have the green one) next I could not navigate at all with it in the case, and what almost and really may have ruined my Zen was the fact that while in the case, it held down the navigation buttons which made it inoperable.

For isolated power systems where the large power consumers such as solid state motor drives, electronic equipment, etc. are 80-90% of the total load, this standard is rendered virtually useless in those applications because the Point of Common Coupling is the entire power grid.

The spent hours trying to fit all the pieces together using glue and quite a bit of perserverence. I think they made it to the 3rd floor and gave up.

Ever.","review":"I love building bricks. I love Batman. I HATE THIS SET. This was the most disappointing \\"kit\\" I've ever had the misfortune to purchase. I complained directly to the manufacturer about their ill-fitting bricks, but naturally never heard back. Most of the bricks fit together loosely causing them to pop off at the most inopportune times. The flat base pieces are made of poor plastic and too thin, so unless you are on a very flat very hard surface (and sometimes even then), the bricks pop off. The floor on the \\"upper level\\" was completely warped because the bricks were so poorly shaped and fit together so badly.Thank goodness LEGO got the Batman license and built a decent kit. It is too bad about the this set, the building plan was nice and the design was nice. But it wasn't worth the frustration nor the price. Not even having the mini-figs was worth it.And what's up with the freaking LAVENDER bricks anyway? I don't recall that being a Batcave colour. UGH UGH UGH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst and most frustrating toy ever purchased","review":"Bought this and several other Minimates for by son's birthday.

We finally had to hide the entire lot from my son too keep him from breaking down everytime he or another family member tried to put the Batcave or any of the vehicles together. Do not buy.

Plus, there's some good general bartending advice at the beginning of the book.So far we've tried two of the drinks. We had some friends over last weekend and my husband made the Champagne Punch, which has light and dark rum, lemons, and champagne. It was delicious! Even one of our friends, who isn't a huge champagne fan, really loved it. We also have tried The Rebecca, another champagne drink.

The CSO used for location footage in episodes 5 & 6 undermine what is a decent eco/political adventure. The Doctor having fun while BOSS tries to torture him is good for a few chuckles.

Dr Who did not start getting decent until season 14 - I'd avoid purchasing any videos prior to that.

For some reason many iPod docks lack this obvious feature.Cons:Three of the buttons (shuffle on/off, backlight on/off, repeat on/off) simply do not work. Perhaps this is because I am using it with an older iPod, but that still seems pretty lame.Sound quality is mediocre, provided cables are of poor quality.Dock does not seem to turn the iPod off when powered down.Video out supports photo or movie viewing but does not support a browsing interface while listening to music.Overall, I am not impressed with this product and will be returning it for something that works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still needs work","review":"The HomeDock is nice looking, but there are fundamental flaws that make it unacceptable for most entertainment systems. These are:- Unresponsive remote. The remote works of you aim it just right.

If you want to do anything more than jump to the next song/picture, you have do this directly with the iPod.- Menu not visible on the screen. Given that you can't do much with the remote, this isn't such a big deal. But this would be a necessary ingredient to what is really needed to include the iPod in an entertainment system.I'm still looking for a piece of equipment that solves the problem that the HomeDock is suppose to solve.

I agree with other reviewers that the remote is somewhat temperamental but functioned. HOWEVER, after using the dock for 7 months, it suddenly quit. I called technical support and was told that seating my ipod on the dock should cause the light to go on regardless of the remote. No such luck. I'll probably shell out more $ for a battery for the remote but doubt it will solve my problem based on the advice I received from DLO tech support - their suggestion... buy a new unit. Based on the advice of other users, I removed the battery from the remote, banged it, reinserted the same battery and the unit turned on.

Perhaps wine tasting sessions only.Bottom line: Soundtrack without the opening Bauhaus song doesn't capture THE SPIRIT of the film at all.Put Bauhaus on there!Otherwise: It's a limp-wristed rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have nothing to declare...","review":"I have nothing to declare but the potential damage to your eyesight from the absurdly tiny print in this edition of otherwise wonderful selections from the work of Oscar Wilde.

Good reviews and so on. Nothing on the box or other product literature suggests that as packaged this product will NOT import or export MPEG Video (the industry and internet standard). There is no mention of video plugins in the manual, on the box, or on the screenblast website, but when you try to import or save a *.mpg file the program asks for your Credit Card number ... to \\"unlock\\" the MPEG plugin. ...

As stated by others, I too am extremely put off by the fact that you have to purchase additional modules in order to export videos as mpeg's. This is a feature that is fundamental to burning video cd's and to much of the video editing world!! The only positive aspect to me is the fact that the software did not lock up and ran very smoothly for me compared to Video Deluxe 2.

My significant other did the same. I like salty stuff, and I love licorice, but this was just plain nasty. Not only was it too salty, but it had a terrible rubbing-alcohol-type flavor that went up to my nose and made me wonder if perhaps the candy had been tampered with or manufactured incorrectly.

After selecting the Garmin eTrex Vista HCx GPS from Amazon, I made sure I selected the correct case by first going to the Garmin website to confirm Amazon's recommendation. Garmin showed this case and part number for the GPS so I also ordered it from Amazon at the same time as the GPS. When I received it, it was obviously way too big. You could probably fit 3 eTrex Vista GPS' in that case. I think Garmin must have determined size of their largest portable GPS and created this case, thinking any and all Garmin GPS' would fit.I didn't cut into the plastic packaging, so Amazon took it back and refunded the price. I had to pay shipping though since it was my (really Garmin's) mistake. I found a generic bag for the GPS that fit a lot better than the one by Garmin.

He is definitely southern and has a southern outlook on things. He has some funny songs of his own composition and a few of them appear on this recording. Unfortunately, many of them have appeared on his other recordings. A number of the routines on this recording are a bit dated, being based on the Clinton siege of Waco or the Clinton/Gore campaign.All this being said, it is still an amusing bit of work. One of his signature routines is his talking about \\"Uncle B.S.\\" who seems to have been everywhere and done everything. He has added a new twist to it here and from there goes on about a front porch philosopher. These are the type of routine he does best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complete and Concise Hot Springs Guide","review":"As a Colorado resident I have been fortunate to have visited several of the larger, more popular area hot springs. My search for new hot springs experiences led me to Wambach's \\"Touring Colorado Hot Springs.\\" This book is well organized and lists the springs according to the region of Colorado where they are found. The included maps are clear and easy to read.

I found this book so good that I have now ordered 4 more copies to give as gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"What About Price?","review":"This book was exactly the same as the other book by George, only George's book included more springs. It was somewhat informative, even though all the information is 10 years old. Unfortunately for me, I found a website that has all the same information included in the book, so there really is no need to buy it unless you want all that information in a binding. The most disappointing thing was that no pricing information was included. Mr. Wambach should have realized that the price is one of the most important factors for most people, especially since some springs are $10/day and others cost hundreds. The book was useful in finding things to do in the area, if you can pull yourself away from the pools long enough to do something else. Sure would like to see a guide with the prices included. It would also be fantastic if a newer guide were written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"Thought the cover looks fresh, the content is outdated.

Still, it's good to know what you're getting into. This is a pretty good anthology of American literature, starting all the way back with Native American myths and Columbus's journals and continuing through Puritan, Enlightenment, Transcendentalist, Romantic, and modern periods of literature in America.The introductions to the pieces are good--as good or better than Norton's--and the selections themselves are generally good. Still, though, there are a few notable things missing, but that is to be expected in any compendium, I suppose.One of the highlights of this volume is the full reprints of Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography and Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn. If you have to buy this book, it should be useful and may even be worth keeping around after the class is over.

Let me cite one egregious example. On page 274, the authors explain that Elia Kazan's naming names fed Joe McCarthy's ambition which resulted in the blacklisting of the Hollywood 10. In fact, McCarthy had absolutely nothing to do with the Hollywood 10 (who were blacklisted in 1947--McCarthy didn't rise to fame until 1950), and Elia Kazan wasn't brought before HUAC until years later. Any high school history textbook will be clear about this. Also, the melodramatic quality of this book, especially in its fictionalized dialogues, leads the reader to question whether the authors had any intention of writing a factual book, or whether they wanted to invent a history that was dramatic and would sell a lot of copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Mind He Had!!!","review":"I'm enjoying this book -- I'm almost finished.

Maybe I missed the point, but it seemed to me that almost nothing about this movie was real. Robert Redford's character wore clothes and had furniture that seemed mostly lifted from the Sundance Catalog. Michelle Pfeiffer's character never seemed to be doing any research but rather staying late at work to play solitaire on her computer. And we later are expected to believe that she gets up from her wedding bed to work at her laptop on a news story.

The characters animations look like they're one of the paper dolls you can buy at a doller store.

Shirley Temple Wong sails from China to America and there is where she learns much. Shirley doesn't know how to speak English so it was difficult for her to make friends. This shows that she has perseverance. Then it was like a dream. Jackie Robinson, a famous Baseball star, proves that a black man, a grandson of a slave, can make a difference. I especially loved this book for its wonderful description. One example of description is this, \\"The sea was not calm, nor was it deep like jade. It writhed like a fierce, black dragon with chili peppers up its snout.\\" I also thought that Bette Bao Lord wrote a great book with historical and fictional facts that create a delightful book about a young girl who immigrates to America."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chinese Jackie Robinson?","review":"I loved this book. As a teacher, there is nothing better than a multicultural children's chapter book, with American history and a plethora of vicarious experiences. This is a great book to teach children about immigration and traditional Chinese customs. It wasn't until college that I learned some of these customs and it was also then that I learned that all I had to do was read Lord's book and I would've had the knowledge that it took me 20 years to get.

It refreshens the mind and lets you think of all the things you can do, because there is nothing that is impossible or that we cannot do. I think it is great -- all of Shirley's adventures has lead her to the point of the view of Jackie Robinson and that is one of the reasons this book is very interesting. Everyone should have a chance to read this book because it has such a extrodinary story to it. Telling all of Shirley's inner thoughts, and even how the author describes all of the details. The vocabulary is so great, some of the words we don't even know. I gotta say, it is a great book to read and I think there are many more reasons you and everyone else should see this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book","review":"Wow.

At first Shirly gets bullied by the other kids. Shirly learns to fit in with her new friends Mabel and Emily, and also learns how to play stickball. I love this book beacause it is interesting listening to Shirly's thoughts of all the new things that she encounters.

It was a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even though it's an easy read, this book rocks!","review":"This book has a very interesting plot, along with an excellently researched picture of Chinese and American culture in the late 1940s. Although I expected something quite different to happen near the end, I believe that it is quite good if the author decieves you. I, as a ten-year-old (but entering sixth grade, not fifth), was appalled by Marc Simont's depiction of a ten-year old as being about two feet tall. Furthermore, I believe that Lord's writing was quite simple, but that's fine, because not everyone has a high reading level. And that conludes my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I think the product is very interesting but goes a little to far in feeling bad for main character Shirley Temple Wong/Bandit. Now the very optimistic things about the story, first off, it teaches children about baseball legend Jackie Robinson in his roll for the famous baseball team the Dodgers, and Shirley's love for baseball in the middle of the story.It also has some moderate violence and starred inappropriate language. Other than that, it is a great novel which involves new wording and language that takes kids reading and vocabulary skills to the next level. The book is 1-170 pages long."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Year of the Boar and Jackie Robinson","review":"This book In The Year Of The Boar And Jackie Robinson by Bette Bao Lord is meant for children about 12 or 13 years. The story starts in China but most of it happens in Brooklyn, New York in America. The author's descriptions are so good that I can picture most of it in my mind. I think the main character Shirley seems like a real person because she has the same problems as most of us would have. The book is a story about friendship and sport. This type of book is \\"coming of age\\" (teen years). At the beginning of the book we learn about Shirley life in China but then she had to move to America and everything was new to her an d she felt lonely. Same than me, when I came to New Delhi, India, from Austria I felt very lonely, too. In the beginning she didn't have any friends.

Was a bit concerned, however, upon their arrival, to find that the beard had just three tiny pieces of two-sided tape on it to attach to the face. The tape came off the beard during the process of pealing off the outside paper to reveal the sticky portion and then would not stick back on the beard backing. I ended up having to sew on a piece of elastic in order to get the beard to stay on. The hat stayed on nicely, but I was thankful no one had to see it up close as the felt material was very wrinkled from being folded up in its packaging. Faced with a similar situation in the future I wouldn't order this type of costume again unless it was about half the cost!

That offers a glimpse of the band's many influences and of its two most visible members -- frontman/flute player Ian Anderson and fiery guitarist Martin Barre. Want samples?

Gamera, a giant flying turtle, really didn't star in any good movies until the mid nineties, but the late sixties-earlier seventies films were fun in a sort of goofy way. This first one, \\"Gammera [sic] the Invincible,\\" is perhaps the dullest and most slow moving one, but hard-core Japanese monster fans will no-doubt find pleasure in it. In addition, this DVD features the not-very-good American version, with inserted American scenes (some of these are pretty funny in their sheer technical incompetence).This DVD, from Alpha, isn't really worth buying. The print is very scratchy and faded, and is in the pan-and-scan 1.33:1 instead of the intended 2.35:1 ratio.

The lousy plot. A giant flying turtle who likes little kids? C'mon!4. The little kid. Someone finally found a kid more annoying than Ichiro (notice I said Ichiro not Godzilla) from Godzilla's Revenge (even though he was not as annoying as the Pepsi girl).5.

It has some refreshing moments when it comes to relationship: do they want a long term one, or they are just looking for a one night excitement? The performance by soem of the hottest Hong Kong pop star is of a decent standard, given that more than 1/2 of the cast are pop singers and not really actors. Eric Kot is as usual very energetic in his humorous takes. Overall, if you are looking for 90 minutes of fun and laughter on teen romance, I am sure some of the scenes will make you smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Abbie Hoffman","review":"I bought this book for a customer.

These are the 2 best books in the market for Power Electronics . I bought a lot of books on Power Electronics such as the one by Philip Krein , one by Kassakien , one by Rashid , one by Bose and this is my advice --- ONLY BUY THE ABOVE 2 BOOKS and SAVE YOUR MONEY . The concepts in this great book on Power Electronics are explained better than the one by Ned Mohan but I think the Ned Mohan book covers more concepts . If you are a student taking Power Electronics course and need a solid textbook , this is a bargain . Highly recommended -- 5 stars ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very limited in phone mode","review":"I was quite disappointed in the phone aspect of this toy (the hippo game is fine for a 3-year-old). The entire number pad presses as a single unit and makes a random tone with each press (you cannot press different numbers individually). Also, when you close the flip phone, it doesn't hang up like a real phone would, rather it keeps dialing/talking until it finishes its conversation. And the buttons on the outside of the phone are merely decorative (other than the phone to game switch). Also it is a bit large for a child's hand. On to the positive: the voices are fairly realistic, and not too annoying. And the hinge seems pretty sturdy, I expect it will withstand quite a bit of abuse from a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I was a little disapointed in the toy cell phones - it was a lot bulkier than expected and the actual numbers don't press - it is just one big button.

I highly recommend this album!!! You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good.","review":"I am a fan of Billy's. Not a rabid fan, but a fan all the same. I didn't get my hopes up too high for this release, but for nostalgic reasons, I picked this up. I have to say this is a really strong release. Much better than most of the stuff I hear today and I think stronger than many of Billy's past releases. I however was one of the few people that didn't hate CyberPunk. So you may not trust me.I happen to enjoy all but 1 track on the entire cd. I have listened to it 5 times now and it's actually getting better.One comment, is it me or does the song Cherie sound like Billy channeling Neil Diamond. I just love it. Anyway the album kicks off with 2 really strong rockers. Both are very hooky. There is quite a mix of styles on here but all in all, it's just good old fashioned pop-rock done Billy Idol's way.If you like Billy Idol then just make the jump. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album - Great Tour","review":"This is a great album and I have been to two current Tour concerts and both have been awesome. I have been going to see Idol live since 2001 when Steve Stevens got back together with Billy after 13 years apart. Every concert has been one of the best I have attended in ages.Billy and Steve really seemed focused again. Hopefully more great new songs and concert are to come the next several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy does some serious kick ass rocking","review":"I'm a life long Idol fan and all I can say is this CD Kicks butt. Although some songs are a little out of place ( Yellin' at the Xmas Tree), they have a tendency to grow on you. My faviorate tracks for in your face attitude are \\"Super Overdrive\\", \\"World Comming Down\\", \\"Screem\\", and \\"Sherri\\" (mellow Generation X ish)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is great to hear the dynamic duo hard at work again","review":"The best Billy Idol is revved up music driven by that guitar wildman Steve Stevens. It is here in all its glory from the opening 2 tracks \\"Super Overdrive\\" & \\"World's Comin' Down\\". The hyper Stevens just lets loose on this comeback CD and when the final 13th track is finished, you want to start the ride all over again. Idol's voice is in fine form and you just have to wonder, what took them so long. The album does slow down a bit here and there but as a whole, a very enjoyable listening experience. It is not the greatest album but still one of the best releases of 2005. If you liked \\"Blue Highway\\", \\"Rebel Yell\\", or \\"Do Not Stand in the Shadows\\", you will like this, same vein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have enjoyed artistry, but not fan on this album","review":"I like Billy and his music, this album did not hit me like I had hoped...strong rocking sound, but did not connect for me to feel the message and energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Few Diamonds In The Rough","review":"Billy Idol's DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND features three of the best songs he's ever recorded--\\"Scream,\\" \\"Body Snatcher,\\" and \\"Summer Running.\\" The first two are thrilling rockers; the last is an eloquent, disarming ballad with a bomb thrown in. All three sound like natural 21st-century extensions of Idol's distinctive and spectacular \\"80s sound.\\" Too much of the rest of DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND sounds like Green Day, and that was as surprising as it was disappointing for this fan of Idol, guitarist Steve Stevens, and drummer Brian Tichy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Billy return!","review":"Billy Idol is really a great rocker, man!!After all these years and he is still one of the stronger voices in rock n roll!

The first two songs are a little too fast and over the top, but the rest of the album is great and at times I felt like I was listening to Neil Diamond! (\\"Cherie\\"). \\"Lady Do Or Die\\" is reminiscent of \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" from his golden years, and there is even a campy Christmas song, \\"Yellin' At The Christmas Tree.\\" Good job, Billy."},{"rating":"2","title":"BILLY IS BACK!!!!!!","review":"With Steve Stevens at his side (who's riffs make me HOT) Billy has shown he is BACK and here to stay.

Billy's back...WOW...and that's very cool. Well, here it is...the Devil's Playground IS billy Idol's best album. I still think Rebel Yell is awesome, but this new one is heavier and metal-like. All I put into my cd player is metal now-a-days. This Devil's Playground is a nice addition to my metal collection. Every song on this cd rocks and at times it rocks very hard. Hey, I even like Yellin' at the Xmas Tree! Rebel Yellin' at the Xmas Tree!! Billy's vocals are outstanding and the musician's are excellent. Scream, Billy, scream all night long! My fav's are: Super Overdrive, World Comin' Down, Scream, Body Snatcher, Summer Running, the only song I'll skip at times is Plastic Jesus. Got to see this live! Come on, Billy, keep it rockin' I've missed your screams and snarls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves all these great reviews...","review":"I would consider myself a casual Billy Idol fan, just owning his greatest hits CD. I recently got a chance to see him in concert and he was great! After that I ordered this CD immediately. It is quite good, lots of good songs on here my favorite being Body Snatchers, though I also like Yellin' At the Christmas Tree. All of the songs are decent and I am glad that I picked this up. To me he sounds as good as he did 20 years ago, you can't say that about everyone. I hope that he comes back in concert, I would definitely go see him again. In the meantime, I will enjoy playing this CD. It is great just like all these reviews say it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't do it for me","review":"First off, I'd like to say kudos to Billy Idol for trying... and I'm sure a lot of people enjoyed this album, I'm just not one of them. I wasn't around for most of the 80s, but a friend got me listening to him couple years ago. I loved his music (and still do) and saw him in concert last summer. However, though I agree that people and their music do evolve, I just thought that Devil's Playground was a little too flat and Good Charlotte-ish. These were the songs during the concert where everyone sat down. I would say to listen to Devil's Playground online or borrow it from a friend before spending the money. I think it's one of those love it or hate it albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ole Billy is not up to standard","review":"Not to me, he isn't. I got the mp3 version of this album before deciding whether I should spend the money on it or not, and I'm glad I did, otherwise it would've been 10 bucks chucked out the window. For quite a few songs I couldn't believe I was listening to Billy, they sound like those rubish wannabe rock groups back in the 80's. I promise you, if it weren't Billy's name on the cd, this record would have only sold accidentally. And I forgot to mention I'm a Billy Idol fan, got all his previous albums, including Generation X's. I really love his old work, but this one is just disapointing. The man is going to perform live in my city promoting this album on his first visit in my country, and I can't be bothered to go there. Had he come before this release, ahhh, that would've been a different story, I would've been first in line to get a ticket. I'm sorry, but unless you are a die hard fan that just HAS to have all his album, I suggest you skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down again..........","review":"As is typically the case with all Billy Idol records we get one kick-ass cut and the rest are filler to justify putting out an entire CD. I am a huge Billy Idol fan and wish that for once he would quit making music that sells and just kick ass like we know he can. Scream is one of those blood-pumping, spine tingling, hair standing up on the back of your neck kind of cuts, but there's little left for us to enjoy afterwards. Does anyone remember, \\"Beautiful Star\\" from his Self-titled release? That's what most of these songs remind me of. Who produces this crap? What else is there to say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A mixed bag, perhaps, but no clunkers...","review":"This book might have a mixed bag of stories, but there's no real clunkers in it: I disagree with the previous reviewer... most of the stories are at the very least \\"good\\", and I would recommend this and its companion \\"True Names and Other Dangers\\" to any Vinge fan. The \\"singularity\\" is also a background element in more of the stories than is immediately obvious.One other thing to keep in mind, as you read \\"The Blabber\\" - Vinge has said it's not intended as a sequel to \\"A Fire Upon the Deep\\", the names of the characters notwithstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"So simple, so great!","review":"Not a lot of people have listened to this album but those who have say it's a masterpiece.

A couple of buddies have tried competitor covers and they come off easily and just don't feel as solid. These are tight, well-made, look very nice, and the numbers are just the right size to easily spot what club you want without looking gaudy. Any iron cover can and will slip off, so just need to make sure every time you stop to hit a shot that when you put it back in the back you kind of glance to see if any covers are \\"riding up\\" and may potentially fall off.

It does so in a very approachable manner, and it does so without boring readers with unnecessary specificity.As a newer Nebraskan and someone who is even newer to Omaha, I very much appreciated having a text to fall back upon as a means of learning about Nebraska's largest city. It was a worthwhile read for anyone interested in how Omaha came to be and a worthwhile companion for anyone interested in the urban midwest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Williams/Hartnett Big Bang Agenda","review":"I bought this book believing it to be a critique of the Big Bang model, done with scientific rigour. The book is useful in presenting and reviewing work by others (notably H. Arp) that seriously questions the Big Bang (and by extension, current cosmological wisdom).However, the authors' sole purpose - agenda - was to promote a religious paradigm with primary reference to the Big Bang theory.There is no effort to review work being done by scholars on alternative models to the current gravity-based cosmology.For those who wish to persue scholarly discussion, I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This book is probably slightly above the average person's reading level, but with a little patience I believe anyone can read it. Hartnett and Williams explain the history of cosmology and then describe each step of Big Bang cosmology. As each chapter unfolds, Hartnett and Williams help the reader understand how improbable the Big Bang really is. Contrary to a few reviews I read before buying the book, I did not find much in the book that wasn't science. It's true that there is some speculation, and, since the authors are presumably Christian, there is some theology present. However, the theological aspects of the book are minimal, actually. I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE ALPHA GARBAGE","review":"Ignore the Alpha Video shill.

Second, the Love Potion remake is barely recognizable as the original song, it is done so poorly. This is a CBS jumping on the hair metal bandwagon circa 1989. Formula by the numbers first song an anthem, fourth and ninth song ballads predictable formula that killed music like this. But my Amazon used copy is autographed by the band members..woo-hoo.

Although it did get the job done (on site hanging of eleven doors) it didn't make the job very easy. I had to be very careful when I was adjusting the distance guide for setting the top hinge because when I tighten the holding screw it would move the spacing bar causing the door and the jamb hinge pockets not to line up as they should and the back of the jig was not made heavy enough so the back of the hinge pocket had a curve to it. Also the hinges fit sloppy in the finished pocket. I am glad that they provided more nails than needed to secure the jig to the door as the kept bending when the jig was removed from the door. As I stated earlier it did get the job but I should have waited for a better one to come available and it does reinforce my belief that you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect much","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer that you get what you pay for. This applies to the customer service as well. Call long distance, request accessories (the router bit is not provided), and never receive them.

Call Mike he'll help (not!). Anyway, if you don't have the template guide or the mortising bit you can obtain them for about $25 total from MLCSwoodworking.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent review of galactic structure and dynamics","review":"It is a difficult but inspiring book written by one of the leading world experts who, in spite of the relatively young age, has obtained an impressive record of new results in the field of galaxy dynamics. If compared to the standard reference in the field (Galactic Dynamics by Binney and Tremaine), the book stands out for conciseness, clarity and homogeneity of treatment. Bertin, in fact, puts emphasis on physics rather than phenomenology and succeeds in compressing the huge field of galaxy dynamics in a relatively short book structured in few chapters. Each chapter is focused on a different physical mechanisms which is then used to gain deeper and deeper insights into the structure of the stellar systems.The book is up to date and provides the reader with an exhaustive list of references. An excellent book to be recommended to graduate students as well as to researchers active in the field"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Revolution: Who I Slept With, Almost Slept With & What I Wore....","review":"I chose this book for a writing project in a college Women's Literature class almost 10 years ago, and have been unable to forget how shallow and useless I found it to be. The entire story has the air of an adolescent girl who is experimenting with autonomy. I kept waiting for the author to reveal some sort of epiphany or demonstrate some growth in the depth of her character, but that moment never arrives. I would have given a one star reveiw, but I want to acknowledge that I was reading an English Version, so perhaps there were some cultural nuances that were lost in translation.On a side note, the other book I read for the project was Edwidge Danticat's, Farming of Bones, which I loved (sad, but excellent)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very well-written book, can't say much about its substance.","review":"A woman's \\"diary\\" about how she came to risk her life and family for her own Sandinista \\"ideals\\" and sexual/feminist liberation.

Another thing that really bothered me, was how they made it seem like she was a crazy loon, a huge junkie and a stupid person! She was not any of those things. Anyone who has ever read a book or interviews with her, would know that. So I'm telling you now, if you want to \\"know\\" about Marilyn Monroe, your better off buying a bio about her.

Her performance was much better than Mira Sorvino was. Mira¡s acting makes Marilyn to seem to be stupid. It was very embarrassing. I had not known well about Marilyn Monroe before I saw this film. She lived in obscurity in all her life and died when she was 36 years old. Some people said she was just a stupid sexy movie star. However, this film made me to understand her.

If you want to see a quality portrayal of Marilyn, try and catch a repeat of Quantum Leap when what's his name leaps into the body of her driver or bodyguard or whatever.

I suspect that real life on the 1930s Cannery Row is far more sparkling in retrospect than people felt at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not another Portishead","review":"Unlike many of the sample rich sonic sensations popular today, this one has staying power. That's probably why, even though I only gave it a nine, it'll surely be on my ten best list for this year. The first thing that strikes you about the music is Gina Birch's voice. Who does she sound like? Dylan? At times. Lou Reed? Perhaps. At other times there is a blues singer with a haunting, raspy timber weaving into the foreground, then back. Gina used to be with the Raincoats, who broke up, but you'll have to read about that somewhere else. I also like the words, though I will admit I don't always know what they mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"The great hits are there, as well as other good 50s-60s dancing music.

Her feelings that Mother's Day & Father's Day are unfair show that she has not moved on in her life.Her 12 step program (similar to Alcoholics Anonymous) does not relate to infertility and did not provide any comfort for me. While infertility and alcoholism are both diseases, I did not choose a life to include infertility.Don't buy this book if you are expecting to feel better afterward.

I have given alot of my energy to becoming pregnant and things that I once enjoyed have become a hard chore. With this book, it will give you a sense of peace regardless of your religion. The 12 steps are very helpful and something I have ran copies of and placed them around our house. Another thing was the poems, each and everyone touched our heart and soul.

The topic could have been quite interesting, but I don't think the author has a great analysis. The first few chapters combine too much information that doesn't really fit together or contribute to a point. Near the end of the book, the author dedicates a whole chapter to BANANAS. I have no idea why this topic would be covered in this book, and the chapter seemed forced and silly. Overall, the problem with this book is that it wasn't specific enough in its intentions. The author should have been more careful about which subjects to include because she seems to go on and on without getting anywhere.

I found myself not realy careing about Rusha, or any of the other Characters. This may be do to the fact that the author introduced almost all of the characters and did not spend time developing them. The Dragonlinch Cypress and the ship Captian Fowler were the only desirably interesting Characters. I was dissapointed that the author did not use them to the potential. Lastly, the book overall was missing that key ingredient that makes a Harper book, a Harper Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha???","review":"This is the worst novel Troy Denning has ever produced. I found Parched Sea to be entertaing enough that I read VD immediately after, and I was really disappointed. The main character, Ruha, was left of in Parhed Sea, having finally found her place in her tribe, in VD she has left her tribe to become a Harper with little to no explanation. The Shou are treated as though they had the language skills of a monkey. Were I Asian I would be very upset. Basically, this story could have had anyone in Ruha's place and it would have been the same tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the stereotypes already!","review":"I think if I were Oriental I would be offended by this book. It's not uncommon at all for FR authors to incorporate real world nationalities into their stories, and its usually done to good effect. But for some reason, when some authors write Oriental characters, they always have ridiculously poor English. It was so annoying, reading the dialogue of the Shou characters. All of them were wealthy, socially high ranking, international figures, so is it too unrealistic for the author to imagine that they could have mastered English better than a native-speaking 3-year old child. Come on already! As for the rest of the book, Ruha is about as interesting as cardboard and so was the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Report","review":"Blind Date was an okay book. I thought it was confusing sometimes though. I don't think that it's the best book, but it was alright. Blind Date was about a guy named Kerry who was set up for a blind date with Mandy from his school. Mandy was kind of strange. Like the time she picked up Kerry dressed up in a poncho(which is a rain coat). I thought this book was kind of neat though when Mandy would stick up for Kerry, because the football players would pick on him. Thwe reason they picked on him was because he broke the starting quaterback's leg on their football team so he quit. Later on you'll find out if Mandy is the girl of Kerry's dreams or a real nightmare for Kerry.

After all, it's about Truman's life -- what's so dramatic about Truman's life and presidency that you can make an exciting movie about them? The movie about John F. Kennedy, who was a lot more interesting person than Truman, had to focus on the Cuban Missile Crisis in order to make it interesting. And so this movie about Truman focused on the decision to use the bomb on Japan, and if you asked me, what moral dilemma was there about using the bomb? As far as I can seek, they should have used it far sooner to end the war. So, I ordered this DVD without expecting a lot, and I could barely watch the entirety of the movie, because I felt it was so slow-going. I'm sorry that I can't be more generous about the movie, but I am being honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Bio-pic","review":"Other productions that have portrayed Harry Truman have presented him as a caricature.

I think I should have read the description better as I was expecting a book and got a 38 page booklet.I didn't find the information all that helpful in dealing with my three-dog household. I felt most of it was in umbrella terms and there were very few specifics. Also many topics on things to do with your dogs, but for more details or the how-to's you were referred to a book-list in the back of the book.Most of the information was common sense.Probably good for beginning owners of multiple dogs but if you have owned multiples for awhile, I don't think this information will be new."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Intro","review":"This is a good place to start for those with multiple-dog households.

I found it very helpful in teaching me how to train my dogs together (seperately), as well as defining what is play and when it's time to cool off.

Along with him comes his mother (potrayed by Eva Darlan). And things are getting a bit difficult...Although my coming-out had happend some time ago, I could easily identify with the main character.

When I started to watch and had to read the subtitles as the movie was in French I almost turned it off but so very glad I didn't as I enjoyed this movie as much as any other I have seen. Laurent is a young gay man trying to come to terms with his sexuality and afraid to tell his parents and Cedric who doesn't care what people think takes Laurent under his wings and the two fall in love. Unfortunately things happen and the relationship strains because Cedric gives Laurent a choice of coming out or loosing him. My favorite scene is at the end of the movie where Cedric is driving Laurent to the airport so he could go to Paris and start over but along the way Laurent finally realizes what he is about to give up.

If you read Jefferson for yourself, and believe in his strong feeling for a \\"wall of separation between church and state\\", you will not like this book. Hence, my 2 star review.

A search of five minutes with Google will tell you that the kind of education advocated in this book is nothing like the education Thomas Jefferson received. Thomas Jefferson began his education at an English school at the age of 5 and then began studying Latin, Greek, and French at the age of 9. He began college at William and Mary at the age of 16 where he studied natural philosophy (physics, metaphysics, and mathematics) and moral philosophy (rhetoric, logic, and ethics). His five years of studying law with George Wythe, whose \\"mentorship\\" is the entire crux of the methodology in this book, did not begin until after he graduated college. Not only is this nothing like the education Jefferson received, it is nothing like the kind of education Jefferson himself advocated in Notes on the State of Virginia or in his founding of the University of Virginia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I highly suggest that everyone read this book.

Collage was something I had given up on.After about 6 months, we are still struggling to follow the path set forth in the book. It is, after all, a complete lifestyle change as well as an education. (It is me who struggles, not my child.) Now I wonder how far she could go. Collage is not only a possibility, but a sure thing, if that is what she chooses. I see no limits to the possibilities.If you have read \\"Dumbing Us Down\\", and you should, you know that \\"school\\" is not \\"education\\".

I realize how much I missed and am thrilled that it is not too late to benefit from reading classics myself as well as share this education with my own children. They LOVE family reading time as we tackle Treasure Island (and others)and engage in spirited conversations. Even before I read this book, I realized school was not teaching my children to think on their own. My son's teacher even admitted in frustration \\"we have to teach for the test\\", meaning the dreaded EOG. What's nice to know is that there is still much we, as parents, can do even if we are not home schooling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction to educating with the classics","review":"This book helped shape a reading program for my kids (and it helped me focus my reading as well!). Based on the \\"great books\\" method, DeMille encourages parents and teachers to dig into the classics as a means of teaching.DeMille differentiates between teaching and educating, claiming that only the student can educate himself, and that no matter how passionate the parent or teacher is it is up to the student to learn. You cannot force knowledge or understanding into someone else's head.A little light on the \\"how\\", DeMille offers a lot of motivation to engage the classics as a means for learning, but does not give you a nuts and bolts approach. In this sense, this book is a lot more theoretical than practical. He does, however, point to numerous references that can be useful in shaping your curriculum.We used this book to help supplement our kids' public school education which we felt was lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informational","review":"I used to be a classroom teacher and now I am considering homeschooling my children.

Anyone who is willing to do the 12 steps exactly as written can attain all these folk have and more. The voices in this book tell exactly how it works. The experience of each writter is believable with no pulled punches. It is my belief this book will be a great addition to any sober alkies library. I like the idea of the same writters telling how they got sober doing the steps, and later describing how they found a 'Power Greater than themselves' as stated in the book 'Alcoholics Anonymous'.

While this CD does contain some amazing guitar playing and a few very strong pieces, but I think that the attempt to make the whole follow a story-line was, put mildly, rather unsuccessful--a lot of the intermission pieces seem to have no point at all. That isn't to say that this album is all-bad--quite the contrary. The opening theme is amazing, the long track \\"Computer Master\\" shows Buckhead's versatility, and the \\"Home Run Derby\\" main theme is easily Buckethead's best.It has its great moments, but only moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"A message to Johnson, below:","review":"Hey, can you write a review WITHOUT cutting and pasting everything from the All Music Guide website?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a Disappointment?

Yeah the samples from Japanese monster moveies is cute, and the kids oohing and aahhing over Bucketheadland has a shard of charm to it, but over the long haul, and it is long, (Double CD), I kept waiting for something of substance and it never came.

The dance remixes are completely throwaway as well, making the second disc nothing more than a great coaster.If you're new to Buckethead, start with Monsters and Robots or Giant Robot -- this one took about three listens to grow on me.

The film stars Alec Baldwin as a professional theif with a subtle tough-guy demeanor and a love of vinyl jazz. Baldwin combines his dry wit, his myriad of facial expressions, and his trademark .45 auto into a thoroughly interesting character. Michael Jai White comes in as a reniassance hoodlum and Rebecca DeMornay is way out of type as a not particularly attractive cop. All of these actors plus a great performance by talented character actor Andre Braugher will keep you chuckling through the whole film. Keep in mind this film is a showcase of acting ability and not a testament to big pecs or explosions, but as smaller budget independent films go this one is on the A-list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discover a hidden gem","review":"There are 2 films I like to recommend to others seeking smart, fun, ADULT oriented movies, OUT OF SIGHT and THICK AS THIEVES.

So far, no one has ever said the film disappointed.I myself always rue running across it on cable (for awhile, HBO was running it constantly as late-night filler) as I will end up watching at least 20 minutes. Every single role is cast to perfection, especially the smaller ones. But it's the dialogue that truly makes the film.

The fact that the original design remains unfinished, and the implications of this fact for our evolving nation , is especially important. This is information that is not easily available anywhere else. It will certainly be news to most Americans, and should be included as a part of our nation's history.

Set in the 1950's, the book, based on the memoirs of Jennifer Worth, follows the experiences of a young nurse named Jenny Lee who (to her surprise) arrives at an Anglican convent in London to work for the National Health system in one of the poorest parts of London. The stories are compelling, the setting completly believable, and the acting superb. While I find the main character both strong and sympathetic, I confess that I think the supporting cast steals the show, making this much more of an ensemble effort and endearing it to me even more. My favorite storyline (so far) envolves an older father completely smitten with his baby--so surprising and poignant.

They live in a nursing convent, and the nuns also assist in midwifery.The stories are sometimes sad, as they deal with birth and death. However, the performances of the lead actresses win you over and there is always a feeling of hope as these ladies continue to persevere.

IT IS NOT COMPLETE---IT IS MISSING THE VATICAN EPISODE... Whose to blame? The distributer? Penn and Teller? The Vatican? I don't know, but it is not complete and this is censorship. When we complained, Amazon sent us another copy, but it also was missing the episode. Amazon quickly refunded our purchase as soon as we returned the DVD's.

The astrology and organic foods episodes were spectacular! There was all the humor, the criticism and intelligence I've come to expect from this fine program.You know what else was spectacular? The Vatican episode. Rather like the \\"200\\" and \\"201\\" episodes of \\"South Park\\" the powers that be, in this case the same parent company, if I recall correctly, are content to remove this episode from history. It is not on this DVD, and it is no longer listed on the site for the show.Due to this I shall sadly not be buying this season on DVD. That's what torrents are for. I'll be happy to buy other seasons that aren't butchered and when Showtime puts this episode back into circulation on a DVD set, I'll buy it. But until then? No. Sorry, guys.

As a result, I will actively boycott ALL Showtime productions in the future-including Penn & Teller. And shame on Penn & Teller if they remain with Showtime for another season. If they have any integrity whatsoever, they will walk. I hate Showtime, will never buy/view any of their productions in the future, and strongly urge everyone to do the same. Pandering to organized religion should never be tolerated, and the best way to express this point of view is to make the corporation responsible suffer financially as much as possible by abstaining from the purchase of any of their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot - This is B.S.!!!","review":"Say it ain't so - the brash, invincible, self-proclaimed vanguards of free speech so emphatically emasculated by the Vatican?!

Sadly, it fell far short of my expectations. For starters, the maps are woefully inadequate. There aren't enough of them, they lack sufficient detail, and there is no number and letter grid system. That last problem is inexcusable and made it nearly impossible to find many of the sights mentioned in the book. The overall organization of the book is also not done well and does not seem very logical. Making matters worse, the book is not bound well and actually started to lose pages before my relatively short trip even ended. I have had far better books than this when I have visited other parts of the world. I have to think someone makes a better Mexico City guide too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this guide book","review":"Although this book is now almost 4 years old, it is still the best Mexico City-only guide I could find. The text information on sites, restaurants, hotels, etc. is generally excellent, and held up well during my recent trip to Mexico City. Some of the maps and graphics could be updated, but generally I found this to be a reliable, entertaining and useful book. I'd recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Mexico City unless and until something better comes along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camera bag for Canon A630 digital camera","review":"The item came quickly, and was in perfect, brand-new condition.

Same type of style but Lina's music takes it one step further with R & B and Hip-Hop rhythms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but some very good stuff here","review":"I've got about 30 Zorn albums, and love his many different sides. Grand Guignol comprises two collections--the Torture Garden sections (the later, short pieces) don't generally do much for me; too much grindcore and not enough of the more interesting pieces a la the first awesome Naked City album.However, the first part of the disk, with the slower and dark pieces, is very nice.All in all, this isn't on my must-have Zorn list, but if you're into the hardcore short punk stuff as well as the darker softer stuff, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dem boys can play!!!!","review":"I tell you what!!!

As a woodturner, I was prompted to buy one to facilitate power sanding in small vessels that was impossible with a conventional drill. It also proved ergonomically well designed for routine drilling, and the variable speed feature allowed accurate starting position. The higher speed range (2500rpm compared to 1300rpm for the 8000S) permits faster, cooler drilling, and the high power was demonstrated by boring a 3/8\\" hole in 2\\" thick hard oak in just a few seconds.

There are so many trully good sniping books out there, don't waste your time and money on this joke. I hope Culbertson was a better Marine than writer.

If you want a good read on the daily grind and horror of war this is good book to read.

It seemed that every time he had something good to go with, the chapter ended and nothing came of it.As far as a link to the title, I'm lost. Culbertson related only one instance in which he acted as a sniper in the Arizona. That was when a tank officer ordered him to shoot two unarmed enemy, who turned out to be prisoners of war, escorted by friendly troops.Save your money and try something like John Del Vecchio's Thirteen Valley or Herr's Dispatches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony KV-32HS420","review":"For the purpose I got this it does a great job.

If you are new to Naked City I would strongly suggest that you start your collection with either \\"Radio\\" or their first self titled release and work your way to their more abstract and hardcore material (e.g. Heretic, Absinthe, Torture Garden/Leng Tch'e). Enjoy the ride.I thought it was kind of amusing that in the liner notes for \\"Radio\\" that Liberace and Conway Twitty were listed among Extreme Noise Terror and Napalm Death as \\"Inspirations and References\\".

That said, the first half of this album has some of the best jazz I've ever heard, while the 2nd half of this album heads more into some form of \\"speed-metal\\" territory. Most people I've met seem put off by all the screaming on the latter half...while some find it hilarious (like I do). This was the first Naked City album I bought, and it remains my favorite.

In fact, I think this album is easier to listen to than the first Naked City album.That being said, the first Naked City album is far better in my opinion--it just hangs together and has many truly unforgettable pieces--in comparison, Radio is great but has many *forgettable* pieces.

The examples are not very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please think before you buy it!","review":"With books available in the market for each topic covered in this title (unlike the java 1.1 days), this book is useful for beginners who want to understand what are the advanced concepts available in java."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent overview, but no depth","review":"This is a decent overview of the topics covered, but goes into very little depth. Not enough depth to seriously develop using any of the topics. I use this as an occasional reference book, but don't rely on it as a guide. I also found the explanations and organization inferior. Many of the same topics are covered in about the same detail, but in a much better organized manner by Bruce Eckel's Thinking in Java."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old wine in new bottle?","review":"I bought this book thinking that there will be a lot of new stuff as compared to the previous version - Core Java 1.1 Advanced features. Although a couple of new chapters have been added, the book basically presents the material and examples from the previous edition wrapped with \\"Swing\\" wherever applicable. If you already have a copy of Core Java 1.1 advanced edition and you been curious to visit the Sun's Java tutorial Web site for Swing and Java 2D examples, it is really not worthwhile buying this \\"Swing\\" wrapped edition.Plus, with books available in today's market that exclusively cover each of the topics presented in this book, I wonder what is it that is \\"advanced\\" one would learn from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"DO bother with this book","review":"In the three months I've been programming Java I've gotten a decent handle on the basics, and even on some more advanced concepts (inner classes, design patterns, etc.). So if you're at that level, I think that like me you will find this book to be helpful.For instance, it took me just an hour or two going over this book's section on Advanced Swing, and I was creating a tree view of files/folders for my current work project. Like Flanagan's \\"Java Examples in a Nutshell\\", it's a good intermediate book with lots of code, but with more explanations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying Fushitsusha's cd","review":"This is diffenitly one of the worst cd's I have heard in my entire life.

I was able to retrieve it, and bought another whole unit while traveling. The tip also broke on this new unit and now I cannot find any replacement for the now infamous Smartip N23, not even at Kensington. Spent over $150.00 on these two units and they are now no more than paperweights. Mediocre quality and no customer support whatsoever. Back to Apple where at least their customer satisfaction is far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I bought the identical product @ CompUSA (when the actual stores were still around) for $150.00. I found the exact same product on Amazon in new condition for $29.99. Wow talk about price gouging, the F*$#@%@ should be sued. Awesome product, awesome price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maintaining connection is tricky","review":"I bought this unit when my other travel adapter would not maintain a connection. I still have the problem with this unit, though it is not quite so extreme. The tip will make a connection only when it is in precisely the proper position. I have to secure the cord under my Al PowerBook so it doesn't move, then rotate the tip and bend the cord until a connection is made--and watch for several seconds to be sure the connection is maintained. Without an indicator light on the tip, the only way I can be sure I still have a connection is by continually looking at the battery indicator on the menu bar. Many times I don't notice I have lost the connection until I get a low battery warning. Never a problem with the original Apple adapter. I use this adapter only because my setup makes it very inconvenient to take the Apple adapter with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea - Not So Great Execution","review":"I needed a new power adapter for my Powerbook, so this seemed like a great idea. For for a little bit more than Apple's AC adapter I could get AC and DC with connections for auto and airplanes.The only problem is, it doesn't work very well. The Smarttip connector for the Powerbook will not keep a connection. I continually have to check the power indicator on my Powerbook and twisting the connector to make sure the battery is being charged.Kensington also seems to have fudged on the power specification. They claim 70 watts, but the Powerbook's System Profiler reports 45 watts. This means that the battery takes much longer to charge than Apples adapter. In fact, while I am using it, it barely charges at all. If I set the Powerbook down, likely as not the Smarttip loses its connection and I come back to a dead battery.So, there's a great idea here. Perhaps someday, someone will implement it in a competent way."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of those situations where 1 star is MUCH too high","review":"This was the only product I could find locally to replace the power adapter on my Mac when it suddenly went up in flames. I had this less than a month when the tip broke off inside my laptop. According to the local repair shop, my motherboard was destroyed and it will cost $1000 to repair. Even if it doesn't damage your laptop this isn't a good product - falls out frequently, isn't great at holding a connection. Buyer beware!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kills your battery","review":"I was still getting over 3 hours per charge before I bought this charger as an extra to keep at my office. After a month of using it, my battery now only holds a charge for 30 minutes. I'd recommend just ordering a new charger from Apple. Hopefully Kensington will give me my money back so that I can immediately spend it on a new battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is junk!","review":"I bought this piece of junk and built 5 doors. I used this toy to bore the holes. It's made out of plastic! It split wood out on the other side of the door! It caught on itself and buggered up the jig! This is a toy for use by the non professional. I am very dissatisfied with this Boring Jig. If you want a good one, Templaco Tools Inc. or Kwiklocks.com or just get one that is not made out of plastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased this item expecting to be able to use it on a job that required pre-hanging a houseful of doors. I was very disappointed. It would not perform even to minimum standards and I had to purchase a different brand of jig in order to complete the job. The plastic houseing was of very poor quality. I would recommend anyone considering this item to re-think their purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"I bought this jig for my carpenters to install locks, assuming a Porter Cable jig would be of good quality. When I opened the box, I laughed to discover the plastic housing. The drill fit very poorly, did not spin freely, and did not fit through the hole on the other side of the jig without manipulating it. Tried the quick release and could not get it to disengage without a pair of pliers.Just to see, I gave it to my lead carpenter and without my saying anything, he laughed too. Mr. Pike's review is from 1999 when, I believe, the jig was metal not plastic. It's shocking to me that a company that presents itself as selling tools to professionals would ever present such a low class toy. Thank you Amazon for taking it back, I could not risk even trying it on one door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I recently purchased this item to bore a house full off doors. Unfortunately, I relied too heavily on Porter Cable's reputation. The housing is made of thermoplastic, and would not cinch up tight to the first door I tried to bore. After talking to other manufacturers, I returned this item for the classic engineering door jig. What a difference! The PC is for weekend warriors, while the CE is truly for the working man. Don't waste your money on this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor execution","review":"Sorry P-C, I can't give you the five stars.The third time I used this kit, the 2 1/8\\" bit bound in the door and the plastic arms that hold the guide bushing snapped right off. Fortunately I was able to exchange for a new one. The jig really needs to be solid metal, not plastic.The 1\\" bit is a self-feeding auger bit - works great! The 2 1/8\\" bit unfortunately is not. I had to put a LOT of pressure on the bit to get it to work. For the price, I was expecting a self-feeding 2 1/8\\" bit.If they could fix these two major flaws, I would give it 5 stars. As I said in the title, this is a great idea with poor execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cylinder boring jig","review":"Personally, I like uneventful. Products that arrive on time and sometimes even early. I like products that live up to the advertisement. I like products that perform like they were meant to perform. I like products that are priced and made to last, not just for the first job but for the last job too. This Porter-Cable Jig does all of that, well pleased with the order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing.","review":"My gut told me not to buy this after reading some less than stellar reviews. Well, I did it any way and I regret it. The jig is flimsy, which makes it hard to drill a straight hole. The 1\\" auger bit is WAY TO AGGRESSIVE! I'm not trying to hog through studs, here! After making my drill smoke, I switched over to a spade bit to finish the job. My \\"quick change\\" drill adapter wasn't quick. I could not get it to release the bit without beating on it with a hammer.There is not one good part in this kit, nor is there one good thing to say about this kit. I think I'll be putting this up on eBay and step up to the Classic Engineering. I'm a big PC fan and I feel this is a huge let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design","review":"I would buy some other brand next time. I dont like the plastic construction of the jig. I've used it on about 70 or 80 doors and is about time to retire it. The jig flexes and doesn't clamp to the door good. I would not buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it away","review":"I got about eight (8) doors out of this piece of junk. I would have given it zero stars. Threw it away and got one of the five star rated, all metal jigs and I am now very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money if you plan to use it much.","review":"I looked at this and had to pass. It is not well made. It has way too much plastic in it. I waited a little longer and got a TEMPLACO Bore Master BJ115. I only payed $270.00 on Ebay. It is made for commercial use. It also will cut cleaner wholes and is more versatile. If you have a good router it has gigs to make the latch and strike plates cuts. It appears the Porter Cable doesn't include the smaller bit used for deadbolts. The Templaco also uses spur bits instead of whole saw bits or flat bits. The only thing I will add is a 7/8\\" bit for use on some locks. I have never heard a bad word about the Templaco's. For a few dollars more you can get a much better product and more importantly do a better job. I do not want to use a piece of junk and mess up an expensive door or have to hang a new door for that matter. Like they say you are only as good as your tools. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING PRODUCT","review":"I bought this jig to bore the passage sets on 9 doors for a job I was on. I've always depended on Porter Cable to supply me with pro quality tools. This is not even close to home owner quality. The supplied 2&1/8\\" forstner bit had almost no clearance ground onto the cutter. The result? Like trying to cut your way through a 2x4 with a butter knife! I had to hand file it on the job in order to even use it. The 1\\" self feed bit boring worked better, but is VERY aggressive. The self centering guide that it fits into doesn't center the bit, and won't necessarily guide it correctly either. I had one door I almost blew through the stile into a door panel because it went off at an angle. It was a very UNSATISFYING tool purchase, and very frustrating to use. When I pay this much for a tool, I expect it to work as advertised out of the box.

As for the \\"star\\", Mr. Wall, listen to the title song once (I think it's repeated at least 3 times throughout the main program) & see if you don't agree this guy's a legend in his own mind. Most of the dvd consists of him & his buddies talking about what a great guy he is & his apparently invaluable contributions to martial arts in America.I would recommend this only for diehard Bob Wall fans, but I can't actually imagine there being any. What's his claim to fame other than spending some time with such genuinely famous & influential people as Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris, & Elvis Presley?

However, a number of the main dishes are just odd (beef heart, anyone?). The recipes are consistently loaded with unnecessary fat - cheese on the vegetables? ground beef in minestrone? more than one creamed chicken recipe? More importantly, this book didn't contribute much to the frugality of my kitchen.

Unfortunately no matter what research I did I was unable to pre-determine who the narrator was ahead of time, but the cost was not too high so I bought it anyway.If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive series with some great photography then I would recommend it.

There is also a bonus - the recordings are encoded in Ambiasonic sound and will decode nicely on a home theater surround system. One caveat - the recordings were done in an accoustically live environment and if your system tends to the bright side, the recording will seem a tad on the bright side.

I bought two boxes - 24 packages - they were very stale which made them dry and exceptionally hard, almost brittle. I think they must have been warehoused too long. The packages do not contain a sell by date. I know the difference because I buy the exact same product locally and it is softer and much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fish Flavored Licorice - Disgusting","review":"I love licorice and have tried licorices from all over the globe and nothing compares to these nasty little things. This is the first time I have tried the salted licorice. These are absolutely gross! Everyone I have shared these with agrees and all have spit them out without finishing, including myself. They have a disgusting fishy flavor and no licorice flavor at all. They almost taste rotten. I also purchased a case of the cats (which I have had before and love) and they too have a fishy flavor, albeit much milder. Perhaps they changed recipes since they have also changed packaging. The photo is not the packaging you get. I would recommend that everyone stay away from these, unless of course you like pickled herring, sardines or anchovies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Taste","review":"I really like the taste just a touch of salt but they are more chewy then I would like.

Lead vocalist Ronnie Hammond reunites with three other members of the band he made famous and performs four brand new tracks with the vintage ARS sound. The remaining six tracks are unplugged versions of ARS classics that present an unusually introspective sound as Hammond interprets these hits in light of twenty years of life after their chart success. A lot has happened since 1980 but this album is a very good one that will take you back to the great years of southern rock sound. BUY IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth & Cool","review":"This 1997 reunion CD brings together vocalist Ronnie Hammond with guitarist Barry Bailey and keyboardist Dean Daughtry from the classic line-up of The Atlanta Rhythm Section. Joined by three younger players: R.J. Vealey (drums) Justin Senker (bass guitar) and Steve Stone (rhythm & slide guitars) and it's a very good blend of old and new that brings back one of Georgia's finest bands the legendary ARS.This package is close to serving as an greatest hits package with the inclusion of: \\"So Into You\\" \\"Imaginary Lover\\" \\"I'm Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight\\" & \\"Do It Or Die\\" redone and sounding very much alive and fresh. Newer songs are mixed in such as: \\"Child Of The Video Age\\" stand their ground well along side the classic hits of decades past. These versions are acoustic based with reworked new lead guitar lines added on top, and they are produced to perfection. This is an ARS record for the fans, and it is so very welcome to the ears of this one.Four Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Buy this freakin' album ... absolutely incredible... the updated versions of their hits will blow your mind.

No worthless filler here; just logically organized, to the point text, diagrams and screen shots that help the reader understand AD from top to bottom.

If your going to spend the time trying to learn this stuff, learn it right. A much better book on the subject matter is the active directory technical reference for windows server 2003, also by MS Press. In fact save some time and money... Just buy the technical reference. It will prepare you for both the 70-294 and 70-297 exams.

I'm a huge gay movie watcher and unfortunatly, I bought this before seeing it first. The acting is in the same catagory as a basic (very basic) soap opera. It seems as if the director asked some of his neighbors or friends from the bar to act in this movie. It is decent for a rental if you're really, really, bored on a weeknight. Sorry guys, this just doesn't cut it in the list of good gay themed movies. Try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really enjoyable show","review":"I liked this show. In fact, I've watched it twice now which shows that I really do like it (many such movies I only see once). I buy the ones I really like.Good things about the show: writing is good, acting is rather good, production values are OK (relatively speaking), and the show actually has something to say to a variety of sub-audiences who might see it (meaning there is a wide spectrum of types and interests depicted in the film which adds to its interest value for the sub-types of gay men who might see it).Bad things about the show: writing could be better (and the story expanded a bit), and more money would have helped polish the show (particularly the music used) and thus made it more than a B-minus film.I won't recount the story or comment on the amount of \\"naked skin\\" because other reviewers have done that. I will just say that I rather liked this movie and would recommend that others buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"This is a disaster - tedious, self-indulgent bile, peopled by unsympathetic characters, performed by a cast totally lacking in charisma. The dialogue is trite, the editing is too slow - there's about half a second too long between every single line of the film, as if the director wanted to give time for the audience to receive the importance of the words. A round-table conversation where the characters discuss how poorly gay men are represented in film would have to rank as one of the most savagely ironic moments in modern film history. Not erotic, not interesting, not likebale, not moving, not funny. Just a boring film about boring men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it less than one star?","review":"Thank goodness I did not pay to see this movie.

Really poor acting, totally miscast actors and every negative stereotype (ageism, non-monogamous, gym obsessed and brainless) perpetuated about gay men. The plot was totally boring and you can see that the actors are just trying to get through this disaster and move on with their lives.

So, I thought I just got unlucky and bought the one swing with a defect, so I took it back and swapped it for another one. The next swing had the ropes attached to it backwards, so the back hangs lower than the front, and since the rope is built into the swing, there is no way to shorten or lengthen the ropes. I don't have the reciept or I would return it all together. Also, I noticed that the version of this swing prior to the one that is being sold now has been recalled for the problem with the snaps breaking. I think it is a matter of time before we will see a recall for this swing too.

He loves to swing. However the swing straps on this swing seemed to annoy him. Due to the design of the straps he was able to free himself, and just hang over the safety bar. The design also seemed to push him down and caused him to slouch and lean in unconfortable ways, so he never wanted to stay in this swing very long. The rope was also very short, as the instructions indicate swing should be no more than 18\\" off the groud, and ours was easily 3'. Rope was also hard to adjust to swing straight, so he was always swinging a bit crooked.

The safety bar is great, too - it keeps her in place effortlessly and I like that she's unable to open the release clips herself. This swing is a winner!By the way, after reading one of the reviews where someone mentioned their child leaned forward and tipped the swing over maybe someone needs to say USE COMMON SENSE WITH ALL CHILDREN'S PLAY EQUIPMENT!

I decided to give it another chance and this time, I sat under a dryer inorder to open up my scalp, etc etc for a deep conditioning. Nope, the same thing happened, my hair didn't feel soft and it was once again, tangled. What I did notice was a speed in drying time.

As prolific as Miike is, one would HAVE to forgive him an occasional misstep, but THIS film looks like it could've been made by any marginally talented director looking to milk a few screams from the Asian teenybopper market. Maybe I'm a bit jaded at the age of 48, but I didn't find it remotely scary or even all that creepy, and it really could've gotten away with a PG-13 rating. I suppose in this age in which everyone is so utterly obsessed with their cell phones, a film like this was inevitable and that's why it seems awfully contrived.

The result, a dead person is making the calls because her body was abandoned in an old defunct hospital.

Even ignoring such crass adds such as the car chase and weapons usage, the main problem is that the character behavior was as if the storywriter/director had neither seen previous episodes nor understood the characters (Mullett and Frost working hand-in-hand without acrimony!). In addition, the sub-plot of an advanced relationship between Frost and a young fitness instructor is ridulous and detracts, not adds, to the storyline.

The table sets up easily and is rock solid, there is no play whatsoever in the legs. All the surfaces that will touch the door are lined with a heavy, uncolored rubber bumper that will not leave skid marks on the door. These rubber bumpers are also riveted to the bench. The metal surface of the bench and legs are treated (painted?) in such a way that they are not smooth. This surface treatment allows the adjustable door grip and rests to hold firmly in place, and also prevents tools from sliding around when there is sawdust on the bench.

I still believe that, Even after listening to this largely dissapointing cd. Evidently, Ark Sano doesn't really know much about Evanescence's music. All of these songs are played way too slow, Which causes them all to drag out for far too long and as a result, This sounds like some very bad elevator music. The entire Fallen album is covered here and i must say that this cd makes me appreciate the original a whole lot more than what i already do! I really hope someone else steps up and attempts this again, Hopefully next time another piano player with some actual knowledge of these songs can get this right and deliver a good piano tribute to Evanescence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Super Writing Style","review":"I found this book to be written in a language that can be understood by an amateur at this subject like I am.

I also like that Fortey shares personal anecdotes from a long career in paleontology, including details on expeditions as well as interesting descriptions of other scientific characters he has encountered since the 1960s when he began his work. This book is dense with the real scientific names for things, but Fortey doesnt assume you know what they mean and explains everything.

And he makes this clear to the reader over and over and over again. During the entire page that Fortey spent musing about the early death of the \\"English Mozart\\" George Frederick Pinto, finally to compare it to the early extinction of some Cambrian animal, I found myself thinking how much I'd rather be shown a drawing of a Cambrian animal, or perhaps read a brief definition of \\"mitochondria\\" or \\"brachiopod\\". I don't think I'd exaggerate to say half the book is spent in elegant digressions into his career, pop culture, the arts, and myriad other tangential topics, while the other half suffers from a deficit of detail. Perhaps he thought these would engage the reader, but I, for one, am a reader who found the title engaging and would like to read a good deal more about it than this book offers."},{"rating":"2","title":"It seems like only yesterday!","review":"A book which attempts to cover four billion years in less than four hundred pages is going to have to be a survey aimed at the general reader. If you like serious scientific tomes which discourage humour and a bit of artistic license in written presentations-- this is not for you. Fortney's book is an engaging and enjoyable read that gives insight into the development of life on earth and the scientific field of paleontology. His gifts for constructing an accessible and often charming narrative, quoting poets and bards, noting geniuses and quacks, is a great tribute to English educational system-- which here has developed a devoted scientific mind, obviously entranced by his subject matter, who can express himself with elegance, comprehension, wit and some self deprecation, a refreshing attribute for a scientist."},{"rating":"1","title":"where was the editor?","review":"Do not read this book if you are interested in learning about the history of life.

The production is just fine and the album features many artists, especially some of the Bay Area finest - rappers like JT The Bigga Figga or 3x Krazy and Cydal. It's just pure gangsta rap comming from Long Beach. Swoop g delivers a very surprising album. You won't realize how perfect this album is untill you get it.

Swoop G takes the LBC by storm in 1997 with Undisputed. he is a tight lyricist, and adapts well to his variable beats. Beatwise, the general feel is, of course, G-Funk. A few beats may be a little weak, but then there are several that are surefire classics. The standout track is \\"G's house.\\" The beat takes you back to a time when the West was on top, and fun, relaxing G-Funk beats were blazing in stereos all around. it is perfect for lowriding around the town. Some Bay area heavy hitters like 3X krazy, Cydal, and The Luniz rap on the album, and some others like Bosko produce hot tracks like \\"Gangsta in California,\\" and JT Bigga Figga creates fire on \\"Who Got the Gangsta S--- pt.II.\\" So, there is a medley of a Long Beach and Bay Area feel to the whole record. So, despite a couple of songs with weaker beats, the album is a definite late 90's banger!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"This is a very nice book, price was about what I would expect to pay, and the book is obviously well made and easy to assemble"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Model","review":"Product is a Rev A, not produced since 2006.

If I get really close, it's probably best to use a tripod, but I haven't had to do that yet.I have had problems with getting the autofocus to focus quickly. Usually this is due to being very close to the subject.

(prime meaning there is no zoom stays at 60mm.) sharpness is excellent, macro works well. From hind sight everything is clear.that being said it is not a problem for me to say get this lens if you were thinking about buying it.This could wind up being one of your favorite lenses.

Without spending a fortune or hours figuring out the technical doc. Well, mission accomplished on the first try. The lens worked great. Without a tripod, fancy flash or lighting (bright sunlight works wonders) all pictures are clear and can be zoomed into in Windows.The lens feels well made (it is heavier than the lens that came with my EOS Digital SLR), is very silent and focuses smoothly (with a professional sounding whir)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon EF-S f2.8 60mm Macro Digital SLR lens","review":"This product has impressive build quality and really does the job I bought it to do.

It is more of a action/drama. I cried on a few parts myself. It is a very touching movie that I highly reccomend to everyone.

Early on in the movie you have to suspend disbelief as one of the main actors dodges bullets without any special ability, but all-in-all, the movie should appeal to anyone interested in vampires or asian action cinema. If you aren't used to asian cinema, there will be some peculiarities, but if you keep an open mind you should enjoy it. One aspect of the movie I liked is that it gave a modern feel to vampires. Instead of vampires running at the site of crosses or garlic, and being ancient creatures, it feels like this is more how vampires would be in the modern world. The main actors are pop stars, but I think they did a good job in their roles (not stellar, but not bad either). It was an enjoyable movie, and I encourage people to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"That's all I can really say.

I just finished watching it a few seconds before writing this and I'm still teary eyed. While the ending is sad, yes it's more of a bittersweet ending. There were also points in the movie that made me laugh as well (mostly concerning Kei's teasing of Sho) I would reccomend this movie to whoever likes action and doesn't mind the fact that it isn't your typical vampire movie. It focuses more on the relationship between the characters and the pain of loosing those you love and how they deal with aftermath (mostly not so well :)) and yes there are going to be times where you will be shouting at the screen going why the heck are you going in there you idiot!

The way it will render the blue of a noon sky is unbelievable. These filters are well worth their price. If you only want to buy one, you should definitely buy the circular polarizer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Filters","review":"The filters that I got are poorly finished.

Great packaging with a sleeve to hold the filters and velcro closure. Very good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filthy and greasy","review":"I received these filters covered with fingerprints and greasy smudges that to this day I was unable to clean completely. As other reviewers seem to have had the same issues I suspect this is a Tiffen problem (my package didn't seem used) with poor manufacturing/packaging practices.The filters themselves seem OK, although the UV one creates all sorts of internal reflections with the front element of the lens.

However, because of the smudges I doubt I'll ever buy a Tiffen filter again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Causes a reflection off of the actual lenses","review":"The polarizer works well but the UV filter causes a reflection of lighted objects to appear.

They appear to be optically perfect and well built and a high quality soft case to carry them.

It gets rather disappointing if you put it on some excellent lens, so I can't give it 5 stars. However, with a hood or hand blocking out the sun, you should be fine. The filters are definitely a great value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbeatable value and perfect for the FZ28","review":"The filters fit my FZ28K perfectly. The UV filter is perfect for protecting the lense, which seems more important since the camera doesn't have interchangeable lenses.The CP filter works well to produce brilliant daylight photos. However, I do get a little bit of vignetting when I use the CP. I'm not stacking filters, so I'm not sure why it's happening. It only occurs right at the corners of the photos. I haven't had any problems just croping the dark corners out.Even with the vignetting, this set is a great budget addition for the FZ28 hobbiest."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPOINTED!","review":"As some of the reviews I read online had said, the package/kit of 3 filters was an overall disappointment. The polarizer was the worst. I have a six dollar pair of polaroid sunglasses I bought at Wallgreen's that remove more reflection off of objects, deepen the skys blue better than this junk. Of course the filter did not even come any where close to a Nikon filter that I've had and used for 25 years. Also as reported from others here the quality of the metal finnish and threads was bad! I sent it all back within a hour of recieving the delivery of the delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiffen Filter Pak","review":"The pak was excellent. It was very reasonable in cost, and, although not the fanciest filters you can buy, are good quality and very reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome set of filters","review":"This set of three filters is great for several reasons.First, I have been taking photographs since 1984 and I have always liked Tiffen filters because of their crystal-clear glass they use to make them and their lack of distortion.Second, buying these three filters as a set is less expensive than buying each filter individually.Third, this filter kit comes with a wallet-type pouch to store the filters that aren't being used. The pouch fits quite nicely in my camera bag next to one of my other telephoto lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent for the money","review":"these lenses were decent for the money that you pay. I'm a beginner so i don't have anything profound to say about the filters. The polarizer definitely helps remove glare off of water and reflective objects. Haven't really used the red.

The only filter that has been somewhat of a problem to get used to has been the polarizer. It has on 2 occasions really distorted the light on my composure. It may be something I'm doing wrong but it has only happened with the polarizer. I don't really use the UV protector and the 812 warmer filter is really useless given that you can just increase the temp on any photo editing software to achieve the same effect. The neutral density filter works great, though my dad tells me there are better ones available. Overall, for the price it seems that you're getting a great deal. It's a great buy for beginners/non-hardcore photographers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Digital Starter Kit","review":"This was an outstanding value. The kit includes three often needed filters as well as an excellent filter wallet. The wallet itself, along with the included Tiffen Booklet is an added extra value.

You get all three for less than the price of one filter and the filter wallet is an added bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"62mm Tiffen filter kit is so-so...","review":"Very affordable, but that comes with a quality trade-off. The threads are not the greatest and the \\"laminated\\" filters can have slight manufacturing defects. One of my filters came with a small air trap bubble in it. Its small and near the outer edge. Perhaps tiffen would replace, but since it doesn't affect image quality, I am not to worried about it.

This is not a blood and guts war story but a human perspective of how a guy thrust into day by day combat from an ordinary life as a school teacher made the best of his situation. His mission while there was to learn how to stay alive and how to help the other soldiers around him survive. I certainly would love to see this produced as a movie.

If you understand everything in this book you will pass the exam! The book does not cover SUS and ISA server, you will be tested on one of these two topics. The CDRom exams are buggy in 2 ways. The first is that sometimes I couldn't get the Exhibits to display....fustrating. The second is that some of the questions are very vague and you can't understand what they are asking for. The Microsoft test will be more specific. However, I do suggest taking the CDRom exams and then make sure you understand why you got the questions wrong, you will be able to find the Technet references when you review the results of the test. If you are a Windowz/Networking beginner you may have issues with the 70-291 test due to the concepts needed, this comes with experience. The book -will- give you the info you need.

I really should have read the reviews here first. That was a terrible idea. There are technical errors, the activities don't work, and there are lots of surprise requirements. The hardware and software requirements listed at the beginning of the book are not all you will need to complete the labs. What a major pain this course was for me to use.

So many times a little diagram could have been be very helpful in explaining how the various components of such a complex system work together. It's not there. The authors leave it to the reader to reconstruct the diagram from the textual description. Takes time.The book also doesn't have a single table. Up to the reader to reconstruct the tables from the text.Also missing in this book are normal page numbers. Page numbering restarts from 1 at every chapter. Not very handy if you're working with the register.This book is not the best resource for what is was intended: studying Exchange 2003. You might want to complement this book with technical articles that you download and print from the MS website, that will give some diagrams to complement the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"The negative reviews are spot on","review":"This is without doubt the worst MCSE book I've read. There were no reviews here when I bought it (worse luck!) but I wish there had been - I wouldn't have wasted a month of my life studying it.It is error strewn (major errors, not just typos, only some of which are mentioned in the errata web site), badly written, disorganised, unclear, full of redundant information and it will - as other reviewers have noted - force you to reinstall AD/Exchange every second chapter if you want to do the exercises.I postponed the 70-284 exam twice as I felt I didn't understand the material even after going through the book TWICE.In the end, believe me, the exam wasn't too difficult.

The only truly hostile areas of the shore involves government agencies (how can that be, isn't that us?) and \\"The Ranch\\" owners. Exclusivity is a real mark of the elite, is it not?

The choice of pieces reflect the various moods of execution to a particular purpose : performance.The selection of pieces is for sure, bright and uneasy one, starting with the First Sonata of Guilmant and its acrobatic final, the Final of Vierne's First Symphony, followed by two monumental masterpieces from Franz Liszt B-A-C-H and the Ad Nos, ad Salutarem Undam. The only meditative piece is from Rheinberger, Abendfriede, which serves here as smooth transition between Guilmant and Vierne.For sure, Felix Hell brings lot of fresh air in the conservative world of organ. Furthermore, the performer who's already worldwide known as a north American star with a personal touch, is a grant holder from Julliard School.This CD is just a preview of what Felix Hell can do live in concert.

The way the author goes into the various aspects as well of the ninja boom of the 80's as well as the arch-types in psychology with trying to come to an understanding on the fascination of the ninja among so many and the so-called powers associated with the ninja makes this a book for the more serious martial artist and having it written by a student of the art who is also an instructor makes it all the more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"YET ANOTHER ODE TO GOD HAYES","review":"It is obvious the author of this book is yet another worshipper of the great GOD Stephen Hayes, after all if he said it, it is gospel.

Over time FogBugz has grown to include discussion groups, tracking of tasks via RSS and email on the technical side, and due dates and escalation reports on the management front. This book provides a worthy introduction to all these.If you are looking for an introduction to FogBugz and its main features, or an easy to follow end user guide you can hand out, then this book is worth 7/10. It's concise, easy to follow, covers the important features and should be included with FogBugz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the information from the source","review":"The book describes how to setup a basic configuration of FogBugz on your own server.

However, the author's self-indulgence in cuteness in this book renders it inappropriate for me to recommend in a professional context.If you don't mind all the cat pictures and personal references, it is a good book to browse for tips on improving your writing. Dupre states that her goal is to help the reader develop an \\"ear\\" for good writing. As you develop an ear, you will gain a sense of which of her rules to take to heart, and which to take with a grain of salt.

Should we be surprised that a computer science professor doesn't like books that have a personal touch? Should we also be surprised that such a professor criticizes the author for not using Latex, the favorite of computer science people but probably nobody else?The book is not perfect but for a college graduate looking to avoid a lot of writing landmines, this book is a fine thing and has a lot of practical advantages over such classics as Elements of Style."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor service","review":"The service was terrible.

THEN I GOT MIDNIGHT BLUE, THE FIRST STORY IS RATHER SLOW BUT EQUALLY AS GOOD AS THE REST. THIS IS A WONDERFUL COLLECTION, AND I AM NOW AN ALL TIME READER OF NANCY'S. PLEASE READ THIS BREATH TAKING BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I can see I'm probably in the minority here among reviewers, but I could not get into this book. The characters seemed very unappealing to me, the plotting weak, and whoever did the editting on this volume should probably be fired for all the mistakes I spotted with paragraphs that should have been in italics but weren't, or that changed back and forth in the middle of a word. Overall, reading this book left me feeling bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Vampire Literature I have read so far","review":"First off let me say this work has absolutely nothing in common with Anne Rice's work! I read all of Anne Rice's vampire chronicals and a couple of extras, like Pandora and Blood and Gold, before I even heard of Sonja Blue and let me tell you, after you read Midnight Blue you will never want to pick up another Vampire novel! This book has no Vampire love, and especially no homo-erotic tones ala Anne Rice. Sonja Blue is the coolest character ever created, hands down. Everyone should read this set of books if you are into horror, Vampires, and aren't easily offended. These books are Gory, explicit, and cool as hell. The only problem I have with this series is that there are only three books. After you read this you will hope for more but, sadly, there isnt. I Give this book 2 thumbs up, 5 Gold Stars, etc.... Pick this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best","review":"Sonja Blue. The name sends shivers up my spine. This is THE BEST book I have ever read. Forget all about Anne Rice. This books got all that vampires truly are. This book made the punk vampire genre what it is today. I have read this book well over twelve times. I am on my thirteenth time and I am not yet tired of it. I have read it so many times the book has all but disentigrated. I highly suggest it to anyone who reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vampire stories","review":"This is a nice collection of three different stories -- all featuring the same character. Did you like the book \\"Interview with a vampire\\"? Remember how dark that story was? These stories are somewhat similar, but much more visceral. The main character is fun and adventurous, but Nancy Collins wisely holds back from making her a superhero and keeps the overall mood of the story dark and somewhat tragic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"This is NOT one of Lola Beltran's finest performances. She only comes out 1 time in a cameo appearance and sings one song. I am a huge fan of Lola Beltran and this is totally marketed wrong. It was a deceptive cover (using a beautiful picture of Lola) and the movie only showed her 1 time. I was very bummed out. Happy I got to see her at least sing one song. But the movie is very boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"lola beltran","review":"This is one Lola's best films. Her characher is a simple well grounded person, who is easy to identify with.

Of course her songs are the main reason we watch this entertaining film."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUY BIEN,MUCHO MUCHO","review":"TI QUIERO, CELITO LINDA!!I am not Hispanic but this video stirred enough passion in my heart that I wish I was. I've always enjoyed the fire and romance of Latin music from Tito Puente's jazz treatments to Julio Iglesias' ballad crooning. But Linda Ronstadt brings a new dimension to the music of our southern neighbors in this video. She definitely can get your feet cha-cha'ing away in the upbeat numbers. And her slow,smooth treatment of the love songs makes you want to reach out and kiss those ruby red lips of hers.

My hair is abit wavy and thick and usually gets abit frizzy on rainy days and the first day of shampooing. Well, after shampooing and even blow drying it so it's just abit damp, my hair looks the same after it's completely dry. This product is no better than the Pantene conditioner I use on a regular basis.I'm really disappointed and will continue to use it because it does smell good and it was so expensive (won't want to waste it)!

Songs are also over-complicated rather than seeking a purity of sound and harmony. This really jars, as this is where Massive Attack excel. It also feels over-produced (trying to make up for poor composition?).I was hoping for something intelligently re-worked to fit the instruments used, such as Christopher O'Riley did superbly with Radiohead.

The authors explain that there has yet been any evidence proving evolution theories, such as the missing link. They show a variety of different types of fossil snails, that are the same today as they were when fossilized - no evolution there. They also explain how fossil fuels are created and the fact that there are fossil fuels proves Noah's flood and God's grace and mercy on humanity by perserving mankind and a kind of each animal on the ark. I think it is nice to see some truth, which is presented in this book, in contrast to the bulk of books published from an evolutionary stand point, presenting a theory as fact.

These small binoculars are great for kids and travel. These are the only binoculars (for the price) to have if you where glasses because of there long eye relief. Since I stopped taking off my glasses every time I wanted to see through binoculars I use my binoculars more often. These are clean crisp plastic optics that are super light weight and easy on the eyes. I have purchased a second set of these and found the 10X a little to much magnification and like the 8x better. For kids the 8x is much easier for them to find targets quickly especially when birding. I have tried the zoom models in the store and the images are not a sharp as the standard models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for size and weight","review":"I'm very happy with my purchase of these binoculars.

Any of Bernard's other CD's are much, much better -- and if you want a great live performance, buy \\"Bernard Woma in Concert\\" (I don't know if it's on Amazon yet, but search in Google and you can easily buy it).Someone here wrote that the problem with this \\"Pito Bar\\" CD is that it was a bootleg, which would explain it. And give another big reason to pick up a better CD by this great artist!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the sound quality","review":"This is a live field recording. It sounds like it.

Though Melungeons have been characters in Appalachian fiction for many decades, no one has yet analyzed the way in which these misunderstood people have been presented. In this book, the first to address the issue of Melungeons in fiction, Vande Brake has filled that gap.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. While Vande Brake imparts a great deal of information, her style is quite conversational. Reading the book feels like sitting at a kitchen table in conversation with an old friend over a cup of coffee. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a good book about books or anyone who seeks information about the Melungeon people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got the job done","review":"I was always paranoid that someone was hexing me because I continually suffered from bad things happening to me.

As a free-jazz and DnB fan, I was really looking forward to someone combining two of my favourite genres! It was awful. For starters the DnB is some of the worst I have ever heard, I don't know what gave people the idea that Ninj was a reputable DnB producer (I think Bill Laswell used him on a bunch of [awful] stuff too).The only redeeming factor of Mr. Bailey's performance is that he couldn't make his backing sound any worse. But given that, he could just as well be playing over a taped newscast or a recording of peak hour traffic.

This whole mentality of askewing melody, rhythm, and harmony, the very foundation of music, is ignorant. The important thing to learn from this review is that you shouldn't waste your money on someone who's ignorance is painted on everything he's ever done. He may be a respected avant-garde jazz guitarist, but he isn't respected by me. My jazz guitar heroes will always be Bill Frisell, Pat Metheny, John Scofield, Mike Stern, Wes Montgomery, Kenny Burrell, Jim Hall, and John Abercrombie.

Garson's work with Bowie demonstrates that he is more than just a compitent musician but his solo work shows you how a lifetime of piano really allows music to happen. i recomend it to anyone who loves piano music or jazz. if you are a fan of Garson this is a must. its too bad much of his solo work is so hard to come by these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"I bought this book becuase I love time travel stories and roamnces, and wasn't disappointed.

A truly emotive and touching story, and the authour appears to have thoroughly researched the time period. The concept of Time Travellers INC as a company also appealed to me.On the downside - the book could have done with better editing and tightening of the plot. Quite a number of errors. typos and otherwise, along with a bit of repetition that a good editor would have noticed, which is why I didn't rate it 5 stars. As a writer myself I notice these things.

Their maps and instructions for getting to the trailhead are detailed enough to get to the hike. This reader wished that their trail descriptions included more details on how difficult the trails were to follow, particularly since many of the trails criss-cross streams and since they warn the reader that many of the trails are old and somewhat difficult to find. But there's a huge amount of information in this book, from what's available at the stores in nearby towns to where to get showers to road conditions to trailheads. It's a great resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Wilderness but this book is very bad","review":"I have done about six trips to the Gila Wilderness over the last five years, as well as many other backpacking trips. While I generally like Falcon guides, this is one of the worst backpacking books I have used. It duplicates passages by including the same portion of a hike several times in different hikes. The author is more interested in flowery descriptions than in safety and accurate trail descriptions. Hiking in the Southwest, accurate descriptions of water locations are key, but the author is very vague on the location of springs. Very unlike the other Falcon books, such as the one on the Superstitions Wilderness Area. It may be you are stuck buying this book until Falcon finds a better author but beware as not all the trail descriptions are correct, especially Turkeyfeather mountain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to get an idea of where you want to go.","review":"I thought this book was very good for helping myself and a friend determine where we were going to hike on our 3 week trip to the Gila.If you are planning on long hikes of 3+ nights, as we did, I would recommend more than this. But this is a really great book to give you an idea about the trails. This is truly the wilderness so you need to be more prepared than this book can offer. But it is quite accurate. Good descriptions, and gives you a good idea of how difficult certain sections may be.Is this book 100% accurate. NO. But if you are relying that heavily on a book then maybe you should prepare better before setting out in this vast wilderness.Have fun in the Gila, and happy hiking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hiking New Mexico's Gila Wilderness","review":"We used this book while hiking the Gila Wilderness. We are experienced day hikers and have bought many Hiking Books and have taken many hikes. This is by far the worst book from an accuracy perspective.

So while it might be a great book about the trails of the Gila the inital information is wrong in the review. There had to have been a lot of time and effort put into this book, so I hope the books authors catch the mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a low-end classical guitar, not a real steel string acoustic.","review":"This is NOT a true steel string acoustic guitar. This is a low-end classical/folk guitar made for nylon strings, but strung with steel strings instead. This guitar (as all classical guitars) lacks the metal truss rod in the neck and the internal bracing needed to withstand the tension of steel strings. The result is a neck that curves forward under the strain, resulting in unplayable string height, and TERRIBLE intonation.It is not ethical to market this as a child's or a beginner's guitar just because of the smaller size and low cost. A beginner would go nowhere trying to learn on this. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality","review":"I ordered this guitar hoping for a nice decent guitar that was'nt to expensive. When it arrived, i was greatly disapointed. The glue-job was terrible, the sticker around the sound hole was peeling, as well as the pick-guard.

I am very careful with this thermos, only hand washing, etc., but it seems that in time the color will start to come off of the steel body in time regardless.

You can take off the feet at the bottom and pull the sleeves out until you get to the one that has unseated and gotten misaligned, reseat it, which is not always easy, replace all the others above, making sure that each one of them is properly seated, and it will then become useable again for a few more times, if you're lucky.The idea here is wonderful and when it works, it is a godsend.

The tale of his failed attempt to write a biography of the Duchess of Windsor was interesting, but it had no relevance whatsoever to Polar Bear the cat. His wandering thoughts on his relationship with Harvard was more petty than amusing.

Mostly it's not about the cat at all (which betrays the title). It's about the author. This old guy from New York who insists on telling us, as readers, every insignifigant thing that has ever happened to him in his entire life.

My only negatives (and the reasons I didn't give the album five stars): Some of the material is old; Clinton's routine, for example, comes from a 1991 performance -- ridiculous for a 1997 album.

My two favorite cuts, aside from the title track, are \\"Jeannine\\" and \\"Letter to Hermione.\\" The latter is a lovely ballad concerning Bowie's breakup with dancer girlfriend Hermione Farthingale; the former is a pop paeon to an obviously untouchable girl \\"on the scene.\\" This is a good album in many ways, but the varying styles (thus my feeling that it's transitional) can be a trifle disconcerting at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant","review":"Bowie presents here excellent songs about loneliness, melancholia, sadness. \\"Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud\\" is a pungent song, and Bowie in the flesh loves it.

After doing some research, we learned that we needed a better tent in a dome style. I was hesistant to pay so much for nylon, but it ended up being a great deal. We've used the tent for 4 years with no problems. On one camping trip, we endured a terrible storm with high winds and rain. I was sure we were going to blow away! But, we weathered the storm. The next morning, many of our camping neighbors were taking there items to dry in the laundry, but we had stayed dry despite the rough conditions. Just follow the instructions and tie everything down and you'll make it through.

No corrosion on the poles and the material held up until termites found it. Because of my prior Eureka experience, I bought this one. I find the the two longest aluminum poles very difficult to attach and one has bent quite a bit due to the force it takes to assemble it. The material does easily get caught by the zippers, but you get used to either zipping a little slower or pulling the material away from them. No big deal. The material also seems much thinner than my old tent. I realize it's a catch 22. Do you want it light or durable. A balancing act for the manufacturer. I like the overall design though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Movie!","review":"I wasn't expecting much when this movie came up on one of my cable channels recently.

Jenna McCarthy stars as Santa's daughter. Unlike other Santa's daughters fromOnce Upon a Christmas / Twice Upon a Christmas, McCarthy is a high-powered New York corporate executive who returns to the North Pole to run the Christmas operation. The movie follows her attempts to impose corporate discipline on the hoards of Santa's Elves. Ultimately, the culture clash produces some funny moments (\\"I'd tell you what to do with this stocking, but I don't want to end up on the naughty list...\\"). I love the introduction of computer geeks to Santa's workshop. The movie doesn't have a lot of child characters, so I don't know how much kids will enjoy it, but adults will probably like it.Note: Santa Baby 2 will be showing on ABC this December 13.

Fans will get many chuckles along with a few insights into the game and its personalities. As many know, Uecker was a man of limited talents who hung around for six seasons (1962-1967) as a backup catcher with the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves, St. Louis Cardinals and Phildelphia Phillies. Granted his wit was more gifted than his athletic ability; fans are therefore no doubt lucky this is so. His career as a self-efacing celebrity and announcer for the Milwaukee Brewer has lasted decades since this book arrived in 1982. Besides, how many other .200 hitters practically owned Sandy Koufax? Occasionally it's hard to know when Uecker is serious or joking. Still, these pages should leave readers chuckling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Book I've Ever Read","review":"I recently heard Bob Uecker speak with Vin Scully in the booth during a ball game. He told his signing bonus story and I determined then and there to find out if he'd written a book and if so, to read it. I'm very glad I did. I don't think I've ever had so much fun just reading a book. Uecker talks about his life in baseball and broadcasting. Pictures are included. You don't want to read this book when you are alone. You are going to need another person close by to whom you can read passages aloud.

He also had an interesting career as a back up catcher for the Braves, Phillies and Cards.This book details Uecker's years in the minors, majors and after baseball.His sense of humor is apparent throughout this one. There were many out loud laughs and chuckles in this book.If you love baseball and need a laugh, read Catcher in the Wry. Bob Uecker, the master of mediocrity, really shines in this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In His Own Words, The Man Who Made Mediocrity Famous","review":"Bob Uecker was not a great baseball player, but he is an entertaining man. Still doing play by play for his hometown Brewers, Uecker is still a recognizable member of the baseball landscape. He is recognizable for his sense of self-deprecating humor, not his baseball talent.From growing up in Milwaukee to breaking-in with his hometown team on the field than in the booth, Uecker collected some entertaining stories until this book's publication in 1983. The stories of the guy who makes it big are quite common. But this book is great not because Uecker became a great ball player, but because he adapted to the chances life gave him. His talent wasn't playing baseball, it was his wit and understanding of the game.Rather that recount each of the humorous stories Uecker told, I would encourage baseball fans to give this book a look. I only hope Uecker updates his book in the future with more entertaining tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops, way over my head","review":"I guess I wanted to read more about his genius, didn't know I'd have to be a genius to understand most of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the genius of Nash","review":"I bought this book for my husband who has a PhD in Economics.

I was surprised at how relevant his ideas are to not only academic disciplines but also to decision making in daily life.

Only by reading the writings of Nash can we come close to appreciating and understanding the genius of John Nash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undiluted math","review":"If you have an interest in John Nash AND know mathematics, this is an interesting collection.

However, while he addresses several styles of trim, he concentrates only on wall frames for technique. I'm a big fan of the prairie style and after spotting a reference to Frank Lloyd Wright in the Table of Contents, bought the book. I was most disappointed to find only 1 paragraph about prairie and nothing whatsoever on the size or shape of that style of trim (such as S4S). There were no suggestions at all for its installation - just one photo of one room in the entire book. I returned it. If you like the styles that use wall frames, this may be the book for you.

In a post-World-War-III wasteland a religion has grown up around the God of Wrath, whose human embodiment is one Carleton Lufteufel, the government official who detonated the doomsday device that contaminated the Earth's atmosphere with radioactivity. Limbless painter Tibor McMaster sets off in his cart on a quest to find Lufteufel to capture the god's true visage in a painting. There's some interesting speculation around the encounter between a vitiated Christianity with this life-negating religion (Deus Irae means \\"God of wrath\\") and a somewhat Zen-like spiritual renewal may be found in the novel's conclusion. The religious preoccupation gives the novel interest as a kind of reflection of Dick's other greater novels of the late 60s and 70s, despite the somewhat casual and fragmented history of its composition."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a conflict!","review":"When this one came out I would (and still would) buy anything by Zelazny and avoid anything by Dick, so I was truly conflicted. I bought it, and I could tell exactly who wrote what and loved the good parts and hated the rest. I wish Zelazny had spent time with someone more useful (Jack Vance would have been an ideal candidate).This sounds unkind, but perhaps this was a charity act like the oft-chronicled donation of ideas by Robert Heinlein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"This is a great CD at a great price!

These are re-recordings done by Petula in the 80's to very different arrangements. For the seasoned fan, these are interesting diversions, but NOT nearly as great as the originals. I would NOT have purchased this CD if there would have been a track listing, which would have verified that these were the re-makes from the 80's.Suffice it to say that anything Petula sings is great. However, if you are looking for the original hit versions of HER songs, this is NOT the CD to purchase. I also understand that these are songs she does NOT receive royalties to, so you are not supporting Petula by purchasing this CD.Buy the BMG set \\"The Ultimate Petula Clark\\", \\"Then and Now, The Very Best of Petula Clark\\", or \\"Supersounds from the Superstar\\" if you are looking for the real thing.

BB King, Howlin Wolf, Elmore James,Lightning Hopkins, and John Lee Hoooker will be familiar to almost everyone, but some of the other artists might not be, and that's what makes this collection worth picking up.

Just take a look at the paragraphs under title \\"Building a Private Wireless Infrastructure\\" (bottom of page 88) and see if you can get what you expect from the title. I think this book is only good for either junior high school kids who like to know more about IT buzz words or those high-level executives who love to pay big money for thousand of words (not works) from the so-called consultants (It's not a coincident that the author's firm is called Executive Information Service)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated, not enough meat","review":"This book served as the text for a graduate-level Wireless Network Security class.

I could not get past the second chapter because it dawned on me that all he had to offer was sweeping generalities that talked around, not about, the topic. He calls Minoan culture the center of civilization (Egypt?) and in the same sentence elicits Mycenae as the topic of Homer. All this misdirection has to do with the Celts. The book is devoid of examples or any kind of grounding in specifics. The total is that it is poundingly dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old-fashioned and uninteresting","review":"Cunlife's work, though a good introduction to the Celts, is elementary and old-fashioned.

For those who've seen a smattering of Woo, Yimou, or Kurosawa, this book offers little information that isn't common knowledge among Eastern cinema fans.

Where was Twitchy? Certainly not enough lines and presence for him. And Wolf? Barely present, not to mention poor Japeth the goat who had bad lines and script...the movie blows, plain and simple. They must have had new writers? I mean, who cares about Red and Granny anyway? A storyline about Red being at a convent of sorts, being trained? Very lame.

Nothing like the first movie. Animation was awful--wooden--cheap! I liked Anne Hathaway's voice better as red, the new girl doesn't fit the character. The writing was terrible. Ugh. Martin Short as Kirk was a waste of valuable finances that should have been put towards animation and hiring Anne Hathaway.... Oh, and why is Joan Cusack still around? She is barely tolerable with her brother carrying her, but by herself...just go away. Glenn Close barely sounded like Granny--lazy!

Kids 8-12 might enjoy it, but it doesn't have the sense of humor needed to maintain an adult's interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential to be a hit but missed by a wide margin","review":"I never saw the original Hoodwinked so perhaps that might skew my review slightly as I'm looking at Hoodwinked Too as it's own film and on it's own merits.There is a great cast of voice actors in this movie, and like a lot of animated comedies there are fleeting references to other movies woven into the plot all along (like the bunny's take on Hannibal).With the absolute wealth of possibilities here, taking the childrens classic fairy tale characters and spinning it, along with the talent on offer, this should have been a good, funny animated movie, unfortunately it misses on so many levels.The characters aren't really that engaging, the story isn't engrossing and the comedy is barely there at all. I found it hard to get into this movie and to be honest found it hard to watch all the way through to the end.As such I can't recommend this movie to anyone. A shameful miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandmother Productions?","review":"The heroine of this animated feature is a little girl in quest of purloined bakery recipe with magical powers. The film is extremely repetitive as though one is constantly watching slightly revised loops of the same scenes. I watched this with another adult, and Hoodwinked Too! barely held our attention. In fact, I almost nodded off to sleep because I found the film uninteresting. The grande dame of the film is a wry and wise grandmother. Perhaps youngsters would find the film more captivating than two adults did. There were a few violent episodes, which may deter some parents.Hoodwinked Too! is a far cry from recent classics of animation, such as Up ( [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, take time to read, just facts, not just \\"my\\" words/view.","review":"Umm, glad someone enjoyed it with kids, about the only way to do it, but its rank. I hate to bash, I am only here because I want to warn others, it is bad! I am not comparing it to the first, or other movies, it stands on its own as thin and not worth any amount of money. If you watched the first I bet this movie had some appeal to see the characters again, but that would be about it. I have never seen so many cliché sayings in a movie (even those doing it to poke fun of those) but this one was stale with so many used over and over from the past. Fast paced so you don't get bored or realize there is no content, or story line or good character content. And last, first time the wife agreed with me; the movie was poor. Don't often do this (ever?), but this disc is being returned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's for kids","review":"Sure, this is no Shrek. It's not the type of movie the whole family can sit through and take in enthusiastically. Parents probably won't be drawn in by the plot & humor of Hoodwinked Too!, but the little ones will sure enjoy it. My three year old loved it, she sat through the entire movie and seemed to enjoy it very much. I think it's the perfect type of movie to get for the car DVD player, something to keep little minds from growing board on a car ride but also not geared enough towards adults to where you don't want to miss it (hey, I'm excited for the next Pixar film and happily sat through Toy Story 3).So we've found Hoodwinked Too! to be a decent addition to our collection for when the little ones need a fun movie that's just for them. Definitely worth picking up if you need a distraction for the kiddos for a little while. It takes a classic fairy tale and puts a new, modern spin on it that your children will find amusing and silly. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOO disappointed!","review":"Wow! The first Hoodwinked is one of our families favorite all time movies - we've watched it many, many times. We were very excited when the sequel was announced and could not wait to see it. My first clue to the disaster we were about to witness was when we were the only people in the theater as the movie began. I can not remember being as painfully bored with a movie in my life, which only made the disappointment worse. I have to admit being a tad angry at the makers of this movie as I felt taken advantage of. It will be a while before I can get the bad taste out of my mouth and enjoy re-watching the original. Save your money and your time - avoid this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"The original Hoodwinked was a masterpiece. It used the tail of red riding hood to present the concept that a person might look one way on the surface but the truth can change on deeper inspection. I thought it was a GREAT movie to teach the concept of not judging until you have all the information. And it was done in a fresh and entertaining way.Hoodwinked Too didn't have any point. It didn't go anywhere. It had no real underlying story to tell. It was just a pointless mish mash of plagiarized scenes from Spiderman 2, Star Wars (pod race), The Incredibles and others. About 5 minutes into the show I started thinking 'This is boring. I hope it picks up.' It did not.Like other reviewers I had liked the original so well I was looking forward to the sequel. They must have fired the original writers. This is a looser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Copy Problem","review":"Be careful, the digital copy will only work with a US iTunes account.

No killing at the end like some other kid movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie - maybe not as good as the original","review":"My whole family enjoyed this.

I wouldnt waste your time on this. It has alot of adult humour and situations that I really didnt want my kids to watch. I know that I find my family watching more family oriented movies but this one really didnt work for me. the animation was great and it did have some funny parts but the whole thing didnt work. I guess that was why this is rated PG and for good reason. Overall I would stick with other cartoon movies for your kids.

I did not see the original so didn't know the back stories, but I still felt like I knew what was going on. Nothing jumped out as being good, however, as a mom, I don't think I want my son watching this.Hood goes into training with a group of women known as \\"Sisters of the Hood.\\" There's women there of all ages but there is one old lady who seems to be the comic relief. As in, a rolling pin hits her and that's supposed to be funny. I'm not sure why, but it's supposed to be. Then later on she falls (not sure why, maybe something else hits her) but then the head lady steps on her. Hard. In fact she walks all over her. It's like she did it purposely! Why is being mean to an old lady funny? Is there a back story in which this old lady did something that I am unaware of? I didn't like my son seeing this kind of behavior. Which actually worked out well because even though we saw it once, he never asked to see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just....no","review":"The first was terrible, and this was somehow even worse.

When I filled it up again with water, the water leaked on the counter. I noticed a long crack on the inside, going from the top to about half way down. It had rust around it.This unit was left stationary on the kitchen counter, and nothing could have caused the crack besides aging. After only 1 year, being used barely once a week, this makes my distilled water very expensive indeed.From reading other's LONG TERM user's reviews, I can surely say that this machines do not last more than 2 years, if you are lucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good...","review":"I just bought this about a month ago and so far it is performing very well.

We used it about twice a week. Recently, the machine stopped after distilling water in the middle of a cycle. It did this several times before I took the top off, removed the screws, and cleaned it (but it wasn't very dusty at all). It still shut off shortly after starting the cycle. I then took a closer look at the base unit. When I lifted it, I was surprised to find that it was so heavy. When I tipped the base, water poured out of the outlet for the plug--not a good sign. I looked at the bottom of the stainless steel (?), and found dimples at the welds. There was evidence of rust around one of the welds, and a pinhole crack. I'm disappointed that we didn't get more use out of this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distiller leaks","review":"This distiller doesn't have an effective seal between the stainless steel container and the dispenser/fan top.

Both the box and Styrofoam were not damaged, only the distiller body. I returned the distiller and received a refund that did not include the shipping cost. When I called I was told that that was their policy. On the website under store policies it states that shipping charges are not refunded unless the item is defective. A distiller with a large dent doesn't qualify? I now have disputed the charge with the credit card company. Who needs this hassle and what are they doing sending out damaged merchandise?

We could use it in the kitchen during the day, but it does take up some counter space. You need to clean the unit once a week with a stainless steel pad as the yucky stuff from the city tap water collects in the bottom and needs to be cleaned off. Also we start with hot water to give the distiller a \\"leg up\\" on heating the water. The water tastes so good that it's spoiled me for all the bottled water.. We do two runs a day - one in the morning and one at night for a family of four. I hope we get five year's service out of this unit - it seems well-made but the weekly cleaning of the boiling chamber gives me pause.

Her emotional character is twined with many other characters in the book like a thriller movie. She has to outwit the unknown assassin who wants her life as Sid passes the reader through betrayal, greed, danger and killing phase.

They are all good, but I'd rate The Raider as the best. These stories have all the battles and romance you'll find in Hornblower or Ramage, but Williams' protagonists all have a surprising twist or two to their characters. The novels also have a bloody good time blasting the British, yet don't go so far as to sugar-coat our own shortcomings. And if you're a sailor, you'll enjoy the occasional EXTREME detail as our heroes call out sailing directions to their crew. These are very fine novels, on a par with Pope's Ramage; better, I have to say, than James Nelson's fiction, which is also from an American perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing...........","review":"damn.... the album is just excellent.. better than many DT albums..

The compositions are so cheesy and trite. The earlier review that stated this CD has a touch of Jazz in it is misinformed about Jazz, this is not Jazzy, it's just crappy. The lyrics sound like they were written by an eight year old and the melodies remind me of 80's pop rock trying to make a comeback. This has nothing to do with how heavy/dark the music is (I like lighter stuff too), this is simply a dissapointment because the composotional value is so weak.

I found out it was miss labeled as a side sprinkler. No I am not stupid. I can program a vcr and a dvd.I work in a high tech job. I work with to many computer systems to count. After reading the instructions on the pannel, going on line looking at the manuel, watching videos. I have yet to find a on switch. If you look at this, Do not be fooled by the system on label on the dial. You are directed to the six stations and you can only turn on one at a time. This system is poorly designed. If I had to choose a system with only one feature I would want a on switch. How are why would you desigen a control system with no on switch.

I just used the Qual-Craft jacks to raise a 32X9 foot sheathed wall. It went up with ease. Two clear Douglas fir 2X4 were special ordered from my local lumber yard as they were not in stock. I quickly cut two heel boards to prevent the 2X4 poles from sliding backwards as the wall was raised. Ladders were required to pump the last few feet of wall as my seperately purchased 3/4\\" X 3' pipe handles were not long enough to enable the us to remain on the deck while completely raising the wall. A rope was tied to hole drilled in the top plate of the wall and used to keep the wall from going over too far. The product worked well and was much less expensive than other Wall jack sysems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bang for the buck!","review":"Used this product to raise 9' by 40' wall with very litle effort.

One question left unanswered is what has happened in the intervening decades.This man-made disaster has become a yardstick for comparison to judge other disasters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach-less Baroque","review":"This old friend from Schirmer is one of my favorite Baroque collections. It's a pleasure to encounter a selection of pieces that goes beyond the usual Bach; although there are some chestnuts here like Handel's famous \\"Sarabande\\" and \\"The Harmonious Blacksmith,\\" there are many other things which are less familiar. I'm not a huge Couperin fan, but \\"Les Barricades Mysterieuses\\" is one of my favorite pieces. The staves are a bit closely printed in some cases, but overall it's very readable and duffers like me will appreciate the included fingerings. A minor gripe: no Longo or any other identifying numbers are given for the Scarlatti pieces, nor are there any HWV numbers for the Handel. The generically titled Handel \\"Corrente\\" on p.136 turns out to be from the 14th Keyboard Suite, and I love it to death, but I had to scope out its source on my own.

It's hardly a conventional mystery, though there is a murder that involves a mysterious,reclusive author. Of the plot, the less said, the better. The main characters are two female English teachers in a community college in the Washington, D.C. area; the clientele is mostly minority. These students are being offered a Milton course. The novel has something of the flavor of Fay Weldon but is a little cruder and rather more vulgar.

The lining ripped in about 10 seconds, it came out of the stitching that attaches it to velcro, which attaches the lining to the bag. When I tried to undo the velcro, it remained attached, but the lining blew right out of the stitching with virtually no force. It's ultra cheap material, a plastic bag not much better than what you'd bag groceries in. The zipper is extremely flimsy and feels like it will blow out at any moment. Shoddy materials all around, terrible stitching (the stitch count is very low, meaning it's 5 per inch when it should be closer to 12), really, do not buy this for your dog's food. I'd give it 0 stars. It is clear they wanted the cheapest possible product at the highest possible margin, taking a page from the Walmart playbok.I am returning the hyperbin immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work well but quite heavy","review":"I like the product. It does take two of them and they work well. It allows me to inspect my chimney on a 12 pitch roof. They will not work over a ridge vent though and it is akward getting the ladder with the hooks into position while standing on a ladder at gutter level. It's about the best way I have seen so far to access steep roofs so I give it a thumbs up! Also you will only be able to use half of an extension ladder that will lay flat on the roof because otherwise it creartes a dangerous offset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a pair","review":"This product would be great, if, they came as a pair of hooks with wheels. As it comes, however, as a single item, it is not adequate to move a ladder by itself.

It is quite sturdy and easy to afix to a ladder. I'm not sure what the advantage is to having two units but I went with one. I guess some redundancy would make a safer unit.

As with the other reviewers found that a pair is needed for each ladder.Good point: the wheel swivels.Otherwise: the radius of the hook is too tight and cannot think that this will handle ridge vents; the bearing material on the end of the hook (angle iron) is too sharp and will cut felt; the adjustment of the bearing material is impractical - thought that if I loosened the bolt (the nut is of the locking type so presumed this is the designer's intention)the angle iron would adjust to the roof, instead one end swiveled into the vertical position and gouged the roof surface (am using the ZIP system so surface damage has to be repaired).What to do? Looked beyond Amazon and bought the ACRO 11081 Roof Hook. One per ladder. None of the problems with the above. Only possible con is that the wheel does not swivel: so far not a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price and for partys","review":"I love the fact that they wont change the flavor of the food unlike the metal ones, great price product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"Chinese Porcelain Soup Spoons are an excellent product.

Each page is dedicated to a letter, associated with a word beginning with that letter. Behind a flap is a room that slowly fills with those items, at first simply placed, and after awhile, humorously positioned, often in unexpected ways. My daughter was shouting \\"You can't do that!\\" and \\"That's silly!\\" as we went through the book and it was my pleasure to see her enjoying repeating the letters but more importantly, finding the idea of letters and objects to be playful and fun.

Maximum City is nothing but a string of obervations strung together with none of the brilliant analysis of, say, Naipaul or Dalrymple. My patience finally wore out with the section on \\"Monalisa\\" - a totally uninteresting, narcissistic bar girl of limited intelligence. Unable to explain why he wanted to know \\"why she cut herself\\" Mehta falls back on a bunch of \\"hooker with a heart of gold\\" cliches that would have done justice to the corniest Bollywood production. Face it Suketu: you just thoguht she was hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but woefully inaccurate","review":"Amazed though I am about how author tried to fit all stuff about Mumbai in this book the cost is that- without even reasoning and just mentioning facts it shows a level of inability to understand the actual ground facts and false of authority which is immature though not wrong. Being a Mumbai native does not give any one right to mention or come to indigenous conclusions with stated sense of accuracy. One needs high level of maturity and thorough knowledge to mention facts briefly but with sense of comprehensive authority.Mr.Mehta is seriously lacking these abilities and writing a book does not make one a master of subject as is understandable from this experience.Mr.Mehta needs to update his woefully inadequate sociopolitical knowledge and rewrite this book for everyone's sake and for accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"So much potential. So little delivered. The first chapter of the book is brilliantly written and very readable. Unfortunately the author is not able to sustain this after that. He has to resort to cheap tricks just to keep the book alive. Even with that, the book drags on after the first chapter with the author using way too many words to convey way too little information. Besides being poorly written, the book is riddled with factual inaccuracies and downright lies. Don't read this book if you'd like to learn about Bombay or India because you'll be left with a biased and incorrect perspective.It's a real pity because the subject matter is rich with potential but the authors bigotry and lack of writing ability get in the way of what could have been a brilliant novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drags in parts but brilliantly conveys what it set out to do","review":"A hard hitting book, mostly about the underbelly of Bombay. Suketu has managed to convey a surreal view of the city by getting gangsters, movie moghuls, a transvestite, a beer bar dancer, rogue cops, murderers, even a millionaire-turned-Jain monk to throw open their lives to him. And this ultimately is the strength of the book. While the book drags in parts, most chapters make for a compelling read. The tension of the Ganpati visarjan when it crosses a mosque is almost palpable, such is the power of Suketu's pen. Shades of Naipaul can be seen in Suketu's writing. It is a must-read for all Bombayites and those who wish to learn about the other India."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"Bombay is my hometown and it is also one of the world's great cities inspiring writers from Salman Rushdie to Vikram Chandra and Suketu Mehta. Maximum City is an average work that deserves some attention but not much - it covers the usual suspects - gangsters, movies and the night life - but it doesn't touch on countless other subjects - which is understandable, Bombay has tens of millions of people and each of them has their own unique story. This is not a bad book, but it is not great either"},{"rating":"2","title":"A minimalist's view of a maximum city","review":"As an outsider to India, I've always associated the country with big things. Consequently, I could not help but wonder how this book would manage to cover this behemoth city in 540 pages. Upon completion, it is apparent that Mehta has succeeded brilliantly in examining the big themes of this big city through the transcendent details of those lives who exemplify Bombay: lives of sin, lives of pleasure, lives of devotion. I would recommend this book to anyone more interested in learning about the millions of lives that make up Bombay rather than the city's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"painfully long and pointless!","review":"this book is interesting, don't get me wrong... but the author really went overboard with the length... it's too long... it's divided into two parts: power and pleasure. Power is interesting, but i was looking forward to the second part. I thought it would concentrate on the social aspects that make Bombay the city that it is... religion, food, tradition, etc. All I got was 200 more pages that centered on several characters who are not special at all...It ended up bothering me, how he dedicates such a long part of the book to this dancer that he calls \\"Monalisa\\", when there is nothing extraordinary or remotely interesting about her... complete waste of time...I don't understand his infatuation with her.The endless stories about his experiences in Bollywood are boring as well.
