Yes, popping off.And oddly enough, we have a hose that has a filter in it. Has a button that's either spray or filtered. That's handy. But, she won't use it. Gotta have the britta.

As others have said, the fitting to the faucet is made of plastic, not metal, and thus several times per week when we turn on the water above a trickle, the connection becomes loose and we get sprayed with a face full of water. I don't recall that ever happening with the white Brita faucet filter we used to have, but perhaps that was an older model with better parts. This filter is just too aggravating to use daily so we went with Culligan which supposedly has a stronger fitting, even though it only comes in white."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Plastic Fittings","review":"I have to concur with the other reviewers. I've used these for over 10 years. The first iterations had metal adapters and even though the unit itself was plastic, they seemed to hold up. The one that is currently in our kitchen, for about 3 years, is just starting to leak around the fitting and sometimes, if we're not gentle with it when switching the filter on and off, it falls off.Before this started to fail, we replaced the kitchen faucet in my sister's home with the exact same unit that we have knowing that the Brita filter would fit. We purchased a filter unit for her. The plastic fitting didn't even survive installation. This is a shame as another reviewer noted, we would certainly pay a bit more for metal fittings since the ongoing revenue stream for Brita is the filters. I'll not be purchasing another."},{"rating":"1","title":"It'll fall off, you'll be sad.","review":"This generation of the product seems to have a flawed connection to your faucet. The plastic threads that hold it to the faucet will strip, and it'll constantly fall off. Taking out the washer helps a little bit, but... turn on your faucet to a reasonable level... it'll fall off again.Naturally it does this at inconvenient times, spraying all around with water. You might want to take a pass on this product for a while.Pluses-- it filters! The 3 modes are nice.Downsides-- after a while, the battery (?) will die, so it won't give you the LED indication on when to change the filter. This'll happen after around a year... assuming the aformentioned fatal flaw doesn't kill it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works OK at best when it stays on the Faucet","review":"DO not buy this unless you really need some aggrivation in your life.

I will use this POS until the filter time is up and then it's time to get another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage and a designed rip off!","review":"I liked this faucet filter until... I changed the filter and went on vacation. No one stayed in my house. When I cam back the filter only lasted 2 months(I only use for drinking water). I decided to call Brita.

The poor quality construction is beyond belief! Plastic screws just don't work and eventually leak, with water splattering all over... Save your money, this is garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective by design","review":"I installed this filter having high hopes for it. The first hint of a problem came early on, I had to use a plastic adapter to screw it onto my internally threaded faucet. Seemingly low-grade plastic on plastic I thought? Surely the designers must know what they are doing. Flash to twenty minutes later. The whole assembly pops off spraying water everywhere.I managed to jury-rig it for about three months, but lately there have been a series of failures until tonight it gave out entirely.If you have an internally threaded faucet, DO NOT BUY THIS FILTER. If you get it working at all, it will not stay that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I bought one of these about 6 years ago. It worked well, never fell off. I could taste the difference in my water. The light stopped working, so I decided to buy a new one recently. What a waste of money! It has cheaper parts-the plastic adapter is ridiculous. I went to the hardware store and got a metal one. Now, instead of falling off three times a days it falls off once every three or four days. I will try to use it until the filter wears out and then buy something else. This filter is absolutely terrible. Unbelievable how much the quality has declined from six years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brita has gone downhill","review":"I have been using this system for several years without issue until last year. I bought another system last year to replace one whose battery had died. The replacement system only lasted a few months (its supposed to last 5 years). The battery died prematurely. I called customer service and after doing some tests over the phone, they determined the battery had indeed died. They sent me a brand new replacement at no charge. It lasted less than a month! Same thing...battery died. I'm through with Brita. Sad, because it used to be a great product and works great while it lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Indicator light did not come on. Extremely frustrating, especially because Brita knows, or should know, about the problem. I am -- or was -- a long time Brita pitcher user.

Going with PUR. Never using a Brita product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and flimsy","review":"This filter is cheap and flimsy. I had no problem with attaching it to my faucet with the parts made availabe in the package. MY problem was when I had to SNAP the filter into place. I heard and felt it SNAP into position. When i turned the Brita unit on the filter shot into the air and water spilled everywhere. I nearly had to break my faucet with the amount of pressure i had to place to keep the filter on. It's not worth the hassle. I would just look into another unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"weakest link","review":"This product has great features, and for the first day that I used it I was happy with it, but the second day I flipped the water on and the sudden increase in pressure blew it completely off.

But soon it will pry loose under the pressure, will start spewing and pouring water everywhere before falling off and breaking any dishes in your sink.I've really, really struggled to make this work. Seriously. I wanted it to work. But ultimately a miserable product and $60 (incl extra filters) forever lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic threads","review":"The threads inside this device are plastic. The threads on the piece that attaches to the sink are also plastic. Very bad design.

Back to PUR, which still includes metal threaded pieces (yes, on the device itself as well)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Construction","review":"They really need to use metal adapters and threads on the unit. After a couple uses, I would turn on the filter and the whole thing would fall right off the faucet. I guess I have high water pressure because the plastic threads were striped. No...I did not tighten it with a wrench. I went through 2 units before I gave up and bought a Pur system. Pur uses metal.Followup. I just got an e-mail from Brita. They were shocked this happened and said they would not expect something like that to happen. Then they said the would send me metal adapters. What? If you are so shocked and this is unexpected...why do you have metal replacement adapters to send out? This sounds like a known issue to me, and they only send metal adapters if you complain.So...I got the Pur filter and was not happy with the taste. I researched here and decided to try Culligan. Wow, what a difference. Less expensive, superior quality and taste. Check out Culligan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Fit faucet fine - problem was, it restricted the flow so much that we developed pinhole leaks in the arm of the faucet.

So, it's now in the trash along with our 3 year old Delta Faucet. Didn't save us anything - but it sure COST us a lot! Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage!

The problem was how it attaches to the faucet head. It's very fiddly, and it took some time to get it tightened enough not to leak without overtigtening it and having it pop off when I turned on the water.

I'd have happilly paid a little more for one that wasn't quite so \\"I'm plastic pretending to be chrome.\\", or if it has to be plastic, why make it chrome colored? It's not fooling anyone. Why not make it translucent plastic, tinted in a bright color, so I could see the stuff inside?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"I agree with most of the reviews already written for this. The bottom line is that if you've had this for a short period of time it is great. Water tastes great, everything is fine but after a year coincidentally about the same time the warranty is up the plastic threads holding it to the faucet start to weaken and water leaks until eventually one day you're washing the dishes with very hot water and it springs a major leak and sprays scalding hot water on you.Given the price, even if you bought a new one of these every year or so (my most recent one lasted almost a year and a half) it's still cheaper and better for the environment than bottled water. I'm about ready to switch brands and try something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good...","review":"Well, after reading the conflicting reviews, I was hesitant, but figured for under $30 I can't go wrong.

Brita only provides two adapters in the box, which is fine if they want to save parts. They give a phone number in their instructions that buyers are supposed to call if neither of the adapters work. I called, and the machine I \\"spoke\\" to said they will send new parts in (a whole slew of adapters I assume) in 1-3 weeks! I don't understand why this is so slow. Hopefully it will work when they come. I'll keep spending lots of money on water until then."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE","review":"I see a lot of previous reviews from other people who got sucked into this product. It's the biggest waste of $30 I have ever spent. It leaks, sprays water all over my kitchen, and if I, heaven forbid, turn the water on past low, it will just fall off. I know the initial assumption is \\"operator error\\", but I assure you, as an engineer who works for a consumer products company, I have installed the thing correctly. I have the most standard faucet you could find, and it leaks everywhere. When I contacted Brita about the poor quality of their product, they ignored me and never responded. And you better hope you never have to move. I am moving right now, and the little plastic adapter literally disintegrated in the faucet head and is stuck there. When I tried to remove it, the plastic just kept snapping off until now it is embedded into the faucet, which will probably now need to be replaced because of it.

All of the characters - not just J Fletcher - are so incredibly flat and two-dimensional that the entire book reads like a 1st-grade primer, not an adult novel peopled by believable characters. Jessica was so judgemental, catty and holier-than-thou through this entire book that I found myself truly disliking her character for the first time.

The 6 page/minute is only on the fastest speed, however, which doesn't give the greatest quality -- the letters that it prints out at this speed have lines through them that aren't colored in; very unprofessional. On the normal setting it is a little slow, but still all right. It's quiet, which is nice. Okay, after actually USING the printer, I realized that, after only owning it for two months, and printing out a minimum of materials, the black ink ran out.

On the other hand, if you have no other History Civil War documentaries, all are included here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Video","review":"If you find it hard to believe that a 5 DVD set would cost less than $20, you'll learn why when you watch the first DVD. The visual portion consists mainly of spliced scenes from old movies, a wholly inappropriate way to present history. The narrative is informative if you are new to the topic, and the text contains a few moving moments, most notably when they imitate Ken Burns method of reading eyewitness accounts, but the program lacks a compelling dramatic structure, making the overall result unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good dvd set","review":"I bought this dvd set thinking I would recieve such a bargain, but I was wrong. This DVD set is not very good at all. The dvd quality is terrible! Mostly old movies with a voiceover, I found this to be distracting. The only good part of this set is that a copy of \\"Glory\\" was included but not in its DVD case but a sleeve. I would stay away from this set unless you want Glory with extra dvd's containing info on the civil war. Get Ken Burn's CIvil War for the best experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Just a collection of old movie clips and amateur video.

I was middle of my first pregnancy and was so terrified after some torturous stories about doctors and healthy moms I went to bed shaking. I can't reccomend this book to a pregnant mother, it's too horrific. I LOVED Ina May's Guide to Childbirth. It gave the good with the bad in a loving and gentle way. It made me happy and excited to be pregnant rather then trembling in my skin about being harmed by my doctors. I had already planned on birthing with a midwife, but the images this book put into my head still scared me.

Plus it even has a built in tuner on the side! a well-earned five stars for my treasured new instrument. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reference book must have","review":"I was a little surprised to see Chief Bootknocka's review that this book in any way purports to produce market-beating returns. This book will make you more fluent in your understanding of economic indicators: their import, measurement, periodicity and accuracy. As economic indicators are the tea leaves in trying to read what is happening with economic trends and as these indicators will affect your economic health, you owe it to yourself to cultivate a basic understanding. With that basic understanding, you can sift through the prodigous commentary (and divergent opinions) on what is going on with the economy and make a considered judgment for yourself and plan accordingly. Well written and organized. Who knows, you might be able to strike up some interesting cocktail party conversation and your friends will think you are a genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent primer on US and foreign economic indicators","review":"Like so many others, I have no formal economics background but I do often tinker with my investments and watch the markets. I came across this book last week and read it over the weekend. Great stuff! These economic statistics are known to pound the markets and this is one of the few books, I think, that explains the cause and effect in the clearest terms. Even the tables in the book, something which normally turns me off, worked in this instance because the author shows the reader how to pick and choose the most important news in the data. It's very cleverly done. The book also has one of the best collections of web sites on US and international economic news and information I've seen. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Resource","review":"The author does a thorough job detailing each individual variable that he covers. In addition, he gives a good framework for conceptualizing where each variable fits into the overall economic landscape. Categorizing each variable by High, Medium, and Low impact along with an explanation as to why is another important and helpful feature. The individual variable synopsis can be a bit redundant if you are reading cover to cover but the redundancy helps to increase its value as a ready reference.I recommend that all financial/business analysts have something like this unless they are so fully immersed in this data that it is second nature.The only reason for 4 stars is that it is pointed a bit too much toward the lay reader (but of course this was the author's original audience so, bravo)."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Class Economic Resource","review":"If you're an inspiring investor or seasoned pro; a corporate executive or fresh out of school Mr. Baumohl's \\"The Secrets of Economic Indicators: Hidden Clues to Future Economic Trends and Investment Opportunities\\" holds a wealth of information to assist in making good economic decisions.The book's structure begins with two chapters that provides the reader with a good introduction on how economic indicators help explain the workings of the world economy.

Also, Mr. Baumohl's writing style is accessible to readers without formal economic training."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Totally a Waste!","review":"This book offers nothing that can't easily be obtained by a simple internet search.

A great aid for students.","review":"Gee, I wish my professor had recommended this book on economics from the beginning. It would have made my life a lot easier.

Bernard Baumohl has made this very complex and confusing topic so easy to understand and learn, even for dummies and complete idiots like myself. If you ever want to invest or trade, or just learn how the economy really works, you absolutely should get this book first. Plus it's also loaded with lots of useful links and even important stuff in other countries that affect the US economy. 5 stars is not enough, this book deserves 10 stars, just like other books written by Martin J. Pring, John Murphy, Steve Nison, Kathy Lien and Boris Schlossberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book on practical macroeconomics","review":"Contrary to many macroeconomic books... this is really very useful! It really allows to grasp the main economic indicators of the American economy. It would be great to have an update of this book every two year or so. It would also be wonderful if some other authors could write similar books for the European and BRIC economies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading between the lines of economic indicators","review":"Well, Bernard Baumohl has done us all a great service by organizing the blizzard of economic reports that government and other organizations crank out every week. At the beginning of each indicator, he posts the market sensitivity and the time, frequency, and source of each report. It also gives us some insight into the methodology of the reports, such as stating that the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey involves only 500 respondents.There is certainly an overload of information, but this handy reference book allows you to be an informed consumer.Dry, but well laid out, so you can read it in small pieces. Get it if you're a serious investor.Stephen Morefield"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book on the subject","review":"Easy to read, nicely organized information.

This is highly recommended because what could have been a downer of a book, turns out to be a most beautiful display of hope and understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tapestry of healing","review":"Duclos and Robillard take you on a journey of transformation and healing. Their stories touch your soul and open your mind to life after trauma. They invite you in and the reader becomes transfixed with their authentic, connective, and riveting storytelling. It leaves you with such hope and inspiration that healing is possible. It is a confirmation of the strength and power of the human spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Hold Up When Used As A Toy","review":"Good excercise in building and painting, but not for playing. This didn't hold up well when played with as a toy. I think it's great that the kid can put it together and then decorate it, but, after they do that, it'd probably be better to put it on display on a shelf and not let anyone play with it or else the parts will start snapping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"This turned out to be a surprisingly well-made toy. I put it together in about 20-25 minutes with my 4-year-old, with me doing most of the work. An older kid could easily put it together him/herself. The only tool needed is a pretty sturdy screwdriver, which is included.The directions are pretty clear, the parts are packaged well so it's easy to find what you want next, and -- way to win over customers at very little cost, Tonka -- the kit includes a few extra screws of each size. So it's forgiving if you screw up and use the wrong-sized screw at some point.The pieces are well cut and lightly sanded, and the finished toy seems fairly sturdy. In a time of endless cheap crap toys, this one really stands out. I've never written an Amazon review before, but wanted to reward Tonka for a toy well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return to the Island","review":"I think this is a wonderful book. I have only one problem with it. The author (Gloria Whelan) has Ottawas (Odawas) living in teepees. I go to a Native school. All my classmates are Native, mainly Ojibwe and Ottawa (Odawa). One thing we try to tell people is that we DID NOT live in teepees. We lived in wigwams (structures with a wooden frame covered with bark or a similar material). I feel Gloria Whelan could have researched better and prevented this misinformation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retun To The Island","review":"I think this book was horrible because the author did not do enough research. I am an Odawa(spelled Ottawa in her book) girl. I have grew up learning my culture ever since i started school. One of the things wrong in her book is that she says Odawas lived in TeePees. which is certainly not true. She also spells Odawa wrong, she spells it the way the white man did when they first moved here. i would recommend to not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epson ink jets - buyer beware!","review":"Epson Stylus 1160 -- I rated this a 2 because it does produce beautiful output WHEN it is working.

There's a small cart for storage of \\"energy balls\\" (clear blue 1x1 cylinders) that is sorta neat. The Gungan mini-figs are the same as the Jar-Jar ones, but in different clothes.

The most awful alien life forms ever seen on the TV or cinema screen are brought out in plastic form.

Dad was singing Quizas Quizas Quizas as it played throughout the movie. He said it reminded him of his young adulthood while growing up in Japan. Nat was very big there. Anyway, this is a great collection of Spanish songs sung by the crooner himself with an interesting accent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought this after watching In The Mood For Love","review":"I've always liked Nat King Cole and wanted to get this song that was on a soundtrack but it was overpriced so I got this. Nat sounds great singing in Spanish. A must for Nat KingCole fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nat King Cole ... Mis Mejores Canciones","review":"I bought this solely because of the use Wong Kar-Wai made of this music in his films, chiefly of course In the Mood for Love but I was very pleased to find also on this album tracks that were featured in Days of Being Wild, a film that runs a close second to ITMFL. In particular, 'Perfidia' which is the music he uses when he pans across the Thai jungle scenery at the start and finish of the movie. The album is a collection of gorgeously nostalgic songs that resonate on many levels and bring back memories of childhood in the 50's when parents and friends played such songs on their old gramophones. It's fabulous, exotic, escapist stuff. Yes, his Spanish accent leaves a little to be desired but with a voice like that, who's really complaining?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get past the accent: vocal and musical","review":"I can't say that I wasn't warned - I read the other reviews here - but I was persuaded that his American-accented Spanish would not be an issue. What can I say - for me, his accent is an intolerable distraction. I'm not a native Spanish speaker, but I'm familiar with wonderful renditions of Mexican standards performed by Mexican natives as well as Americans such as Eydie Gourme and Linda Ronstadt, and I hoped that Cole's work would approach those. It doesn't. His excessive articulation just emphasizes how far he misses the mark on expression of the feelings of the songs. He has a lovely voice, but this performance seems misguided.The musical arrangements are woefully American-accented as well. Overall, the album is faux-Latino."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nat en Espanol","review":"I remember as a kid living in Colombia when this album came out. Some of the songs were current at the time and several others were old Latin American classics. Nevertheless, what made this album so great was Nat \\"King\\" Cole's terrific voice and his phonetic Spanish with a very heavy American English accent, which made it that much appealing. Every song was beautifully rendered. Great memories from a bygone era!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this book, but...","review":"I agree with everyone that says Malice in Saffron is what makes this book worth reading. The third story, the empires of Azure, is also interesting and well written. It takes you back to roaring twenties Paris, and although the time frame is more modern, it is just as well written. The first story was what tried my patience, it was a vampire story featuring Andre Saint Jean, meant to be the vampire Lestat, I think of this series, but who was also a whiny, self absorbed fool. This story drones on through page after page of prose, until it finally comes to it's meandering, sniveling end.I understand, it wasn't Tanith Lee's fault though, it was Andre St. Jean's. He just had to have his say.I still didn't like this series as much as I liked some of her other books, such as The Silver Metal Lover, and my favorite of all time (so far) Biting the Sun. I highly recommend them, not only as some of her best work, but as some of the best fantasy that I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Radical Perspective on Ayurveda","review":"This book not only gives one of the best summaries of modern day Ayurveda I have ever read, but also shows how modern Ayurveda must be complimented by a more ancient Ayurvedic model to be truly effective. It's thesis is a radical one so, if you are attached to traditional Ayurveda, be forewarned."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life!","review":"As an Ayurveda practitioner for the last nine years I highly recommend this book which offers a new slant on this ancient system of healing. This book changed my thinking about Ayurveda, and truly \\"revolutionized\\" the way I work with clients. In it, the author claims to have rediscovered a more ancient system of Ayurveda that goes back to a time when Ayurveda and a True Science Of The Stars were one system. This system focuses less on Constitution, and instead places emphasis on the way the body goes out of balance, which he calls the Seven Disease Tendencies. This is a controversial book because it challenges our assumptions about Ayurveda, but if approached with an open mind it could yield great riches for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great PsyTrance","review":"PsyTrance is seeing an evolution this year.

I was disappointed that the whole DVD contains only about 46 minutes of movie and only half of the time is about the actual show.

The only way to go is to see the show in person in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a good glimpse of Impression show","review":"I saw this show in China in Oct. 2007 and wanted to get a DVD background of the show.

Kenyon Hopkins was simply one of the great film and TV composers. Unfortunately, he ended his career as the \\"Music Supervisor\\" for The Odd Couple and died in obscurity. Baby Doll is one of several Elia Kazan movies he scored and is simply wonderful. If you love Henry Mancini (especially Touch of Evil) and similar composers, or if you are a fan of so-called \\"composed jazz\\" a la Shorty Rogers, you should definitely check this out tout suite!

Hopkins provides this here in spades.Some of Baby Doll may sound hackneyed, like musical stereotypes of such a score, and for far jazzier and far better Kenyon Hopkins, go to hisEAST SIDE WEST SIDE - ORIGINAL CBS TELEVISION SOUNDTRACK, done for a series George C.

The 3200 owners manual, software and online service did not solve the constant fax problems. The only saving grace is that after two letters to HP, they replaced the unit with a newer model.

I had to get the printer driver for Windows 2000 from the HP website for my office laptop but again, once I had it, installation without a problem.If you want Laser quality (read: are tired of InkJet quality) and Print/Copy/Fax (Scan) functionality, this is the unit to consider!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An inferior model","review":"I was very disappointed with the HP 3200se.

I will say the bulb did go out with a bang but I had the same bulb & projector for 6 years without incident. HERE'S HOW I DID IT WITH 3 EASY RULES. 1st You have to keep in mind that there is a bulb inside and just like an old tube tv or radio you have to be paient, give it time to warm up(2-5minutes) before you get any real image. 2nd Before turning off the projector press the Standby Button on top of the unit and allow at least 10 minutes of cool down. Just like any other incandescent bulb they get very hot when turned on and the quick change in temperature from On to Off can crack the glass bulb allowing in air and burning out the bulb. 3rd when running the projector normally I focus a small fan on it to keep it from over heating especially if its in an enclosed space. Remember Warm Up, Run Cool, Cool Down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from InFocus","review":"We bought into the InFocus hype about 3 years ago, and this projector has been a nightmare. After a bulb explosion at 180 hours, the unit was returned for 'update' which was free as long as you purchased the 'new' design bulb at full retail. InFocus did offer to trade, but you would have to invest in another product from this company which I would not do. We purchased an absolutely great Sanyo, and use the InFocus anchor with the update as a backup. Supposedly the new design will extend bulb life, but after this experience, I would not buy an InFocus at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average lamp life: 12 hours","review":"I bought an LP350 about two and a half years ago. Since then, I have gone through seven lamps in two different projectors. I sent the first unit back to InFocus twice in the first year, going through four lamps in the process. The third time I sent it in, they sent me a \\"new\\" refurbished projector. The first lamp in the new unit lasted about 15 hours, a new record at the time actually... I've blown two more since then. I got at least 20 hours out of the last one, but I give up. I thought about buying one more lamp, just to be able to sell it off, but I'd feel guilty probably.

For use at home or a small office, the speed is very good, noise level is minimal, and print quality excellent.I have printed on special papers from the glossy to the matt finish and have been very satisfied with the quality of each. I have even put through heavy card stock paper, such as for greeting cards, and it works like a champ.The ability to plug in your digital camera memory pcmcia or flash memory cards is a great feature and well worth the money. Even though you require a PC to actually print, that is usually a non-issue since most people will want to do some manipulation of the photo before printing.

In fact, I have this printer running through a USB port in my docking station so any problems with USB must be the individual computer's problem and USB support may just need updated drivers. Also, my pictures have printed quickly and I just love this printer. The photos are stunning. I love the roll glossy paper, but did have some trouble getting it to feed into the computer. I found out that I just had to follow directions, put the paper in the booklet and roll backward. This flattened the paper and it fed fine. Wow, Epson has done a marvelous job with this printer.

I saw a response by a Harman Kardon rep before on this site saying that if the CD player was made after a certain date then the problem wouldn't show up. Mine was made before this date. Question, why was it still on a retailer's shelf? Why wasn't a recall done? That would have saved me a lot of time, trouble, and money. I would have had it serviced under the warrenty but I mail ordered it from the States while I was in Japan. However, I feel it's ridiculous to have to have such major repairs made to a CD changer after less than 1 year. Denon DCM-370 here I come.

Much of his criticism of modern life seems to stem from the fact that it is unfamiliar to him, rather than inherently flawed.

I suppose I'm mostly irritated that I missed it on TCM and bought it, thinking that Maugham had authored the stage play so it must be good.It's hard to know where to start. The script is bad, the acting is bad, and in the final act an effete homosexual is introduced as a sort of deus ex machina, who is supposed to pull everything together and explain anything you didn't already understand. Now, that would be bad enough, but the deus ex machina only adds to the confusion, is on screen for no more than a minute, and explains nothing!Frankly, I don't know why this is even in print.

As soon as I read the forward I knew that I'd be gotten.This another yet book that seeks to explain the UFO phenomena as Satan and Lucifer driven, by hey another 'author-prophet' narcissist who claims to have been the SOLE recipient of this info and that it was given by God.My biggest problem is that this book is all over the place. And the author seems to tie in all the major conspiracies. JFK, Roswell, Chemtrails, The New World Order, Noah's Flood, The Illuminati and Planet X and The Catholic Church. You name it it's in here. And all are part of Satan's grand scheme. But the Author doesn't provide one piece of supporting evidence other than known hearsay and the now classic \\"God Told Me So.\\"I picked up this book because of an interest in bible code 'technology'. Yet none of that is in here. No screen prints to show a cross matrix or any kind.Don't waste your money on this one...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a dime, or your time!!!!!","review":"Wow where do I start, basically this book is every possible conspiracy theory blended into one huge conspiracy; and she calms that the LORD Yaway is giving her all her info. She uses bible code, but in a way like Dorsin, looking for single words in close proximity and putting them together and anyone who knows Bible code knows that you can find anything you want in this way (see the Book bible Code Bombshell for a scientific look at Bible codes). The proper use of Bible code as an authentication code is to find long code all in the same ELS, that is mathematically impossible (or non probable), not to look for single words and mix and match like Dorsin, who has been thoroughly discredited. I can only conclude that this author is a false prophet or at best deluded."},{"rating":"1","title":"please be careful","review":"Sherry Shriner is one of satan's lead spokes persons.She is an alien in disguise.The things she says mirror herself.She will ruin your life and lead you to destruction.The orgone will invite evil into your life.She is cunning and a master of deception.This is nothing to play around with.The falling star that will drop will be you.All I can say is you've been warned.If you have to learn the hardway be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bible Codes Revealed","review":"Ms. Shriner needs to where her aluminum foil hat more often.

I don't think so, we see from the Bible what is a \\"True\\" prophet which she falls very short of. She is against Jews and Jesus was a Jew. She also has the thinking of a White Supremist, pure racist.A person posted if your not a true Christian you should not read this book,I say again, if you have any wisdom God gave you, read the Bible God's Word, not Sherry Shriner.

At my first glance through this small and thick book, the contents seem to be too much for readers to concentrate. As a whole, this must be one of Barrow's magnificent books.

It's not a cheezy book filled with lies like some others. If the official biography seems too long, this one is a good, fairly short read that is enjoyable.

Make sure ALL pictures shown have pattern in the book","review":"I feel let down with this book, not only because of the outdated look of the afghans, but because it contains patterns for both knitting and crochet. The cover is very deceiving. I bought it for the purpose to get the pattern of ONE afghan shown on the cover. It wasn't even in the book!! I bought the hard cover version and the picture on my book differs slightly that they seemed to have changed the cover to match what's in the book, my copy show a varigated afghan in a wave pattern in the upper left corner. What a ripoff!! ...........there was 20.00 down the drain. I also do not like the fact that the front cover DOES NOT say knit AND crochet. It's fine if you are looking at this book in a store and can SEE you are buying a book with both forms, but online, you can't see the back of the book where it says knit and crochet."},{"rating":"1","title":"These were okay...","review":"These were okay, but there are definitely better out there! Try the liners from Diaper Safari, this is the only place i can find them. They're made from rice paper-so they're softer, plus they are about an inch wider! If they only get wet, or a small amount of fecal matter they can be washed with the diapers and reused! One roll lasted me a week and a half longer than the kooshies, they also come 100 sheets per roll. We have enjoyed cloth diapers and have no complaints!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ricepaper liners much better","review":"I was very disappointed in these liners. They were too narrow and messes invariably covered the leg openings of my diapers. I also like that the rice paper liners can be washed and reused in case the diaper was just wet, these felt much more wasteful. I couldn't wait to use up the 3 roll supply I had so I could go back to the rice paper liners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds great, but not a winner in my book.","review":"When I was researching all the options out there to use with our baby's cloth diapers, this really grabbed my attention. I thought how great to have a product that would make it so easy to change a poopy diaper; just shake and flush! However, the actual product is so scratchy and stiff, I just couldn't bring myself to use it more than once. I have these lovely, soft cloth diapers to use for my little one's tender bum, and then I'm going to put this stiff, scratchy liner in the diaper? Nope! All three rolls just sitting in the closet gathering dust. If you're really interested in finding a diaper liner, try Gerber's EZ liner, they're not flushable, but they are nice and soft and can be laundered with the diapers if they're only wet and not soiled. Most of the time, I go without a liner."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can get toilet paper roll, do not buy this.","review":"I don't know how somebody can give 4 stars for such abad product. Let me describe the product. It is 1cm wider than the standard toilet paper and the thickness is double that of the standard toilet paper. You get the idea. The pack contains 3 such toilet sheet rolls. That is equivalent to 6 regular toilet rolls. It should not cost more than $4.They do not have this in Babysrus store since the only way to cheat the customer is by not showing the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"With a newborn baby, a true household staple.","review":"My daughter-in-law used disposable diaper liners on all of her children for the first couple of months after their birth.

They are so rough I couldn't imagine putting them in place of the soft flannel on our newborn's bottom.

Pass on these and go for the washable flannel liners to keep your baby's bottom happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"helps with leaks but don't flush!","review":"These liners are good because they make cleanup easier and help with leaks if you're using cloth prefolds. However, they also scratch my baby's hiney (they are not at all soft) and i don't reccomend flushing them...they made our toilet flush slowly so I started just dumping solids and putting them in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"What a waste of my money. They are far to rough. The texture is like a fine grade sandpaper. You wouldn't use toilet paper that rough on your own bum would you? Also they are so thick I wouldn't chance flushing. While one may not cause a problem repeated flushing of these could cause a backup."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Peek Under rhe Yellow Feathers","review":"This book is for the most part a simply delightful look at Caroll Spinney's life as two of the best known Muppets. At times it does wander and leaves the reader wanting more information on some of the author's topics. Overall, it leave the reader with a different take on what it was like to be on the early days of Seassame Street, and how one surrived the heartache that losing Jim Henson in such an unexpected fashion caused the whole world but in particular his fellow Muppeteers. One thing I wish this book had more of was Caroll Spinney's drawings, they were out this world awesome on my Kindle edition, so I can only imagine they would be just as good in the print edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Bird Book","review":"cute take on life from inside the Bird and Oscars dark side.

Having grown up (and actually recently watched a few episodes of) Sesame Street, I decided to buy the book to read on a business trip. With a title like \\"The Wisdom of Big Bird,\\" many things came to my mind. I was really expecting a somewhat light-hearted \\"7 Habits\\"-type book with excerpts from past Sesame episodes explaining the philosophical ideals. This was not the case - Little did I know that Spinney (with the help of J. Milligan) would expertly tell his life with an \\"inside-view\\" as the world's best-known educational Muppet. With his tasteful reminisces of the late Henson & Mr. Hooper, Spinney brought back the memories of an era and provided me with an adult illustration of a world of pure innocence. The book provides a beautiful look at the beloved Bird and his soul. Thank you Caroll for taking your dreams and making them every child's reality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Great Read!","review":"Anyone who grew up with Sesame Street, or have kids who grew up with Sesame Street will be fascinated to learn about the man who has brought Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch to life for over 30 years!

It's going back, and I'm going to have to wait a couple of weeks to see if they can get it right next time.One very annoying bit of info: the toll-free support number has been replaced by a toll call to Palm Gear (9 to 5 CT). Rather than play games, I ran through all the diagnostics in the troubleshooting links on the Palm Gear site and still got nothing. It's packed up and going back tomorrow.Assuming that my Visor is OK (everything else works, but I've not tried a Springboard module 'til now), I guess I got unlucky.Hopefully, I'll have a happy story when the replacement arrives, but, for now, I'm not impressed with the unit or the support.

His tone isn't simply \\"pretty.\\" Nor is it burdened by heaviness and grease, breathiness and spit, or exaggerated vibratos or swing era devices. Even when performing ballads, the Hawk talks, punctuating the poetry with those unmistakable, near-vocal articulations.The program is delightful, and those who fear that every Hawkins' solo will be another harmonic clinic based on arpeggios need have no such misgivings: he's economical yet generous and poetic in sound and phrasing. This one helps erase the memory of the unfair, or less than thoughtful (in my opinion), musical meeting that Sonny Rollins hosted for the pair on a slightly later RCA recording. It also exposes the mindless rating system employed by All Music Guide, which should not attempt to attach a quantitative assessment to music about which its reviewer is obviously clueless."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Exp'd EQ users","review":"Ok the game card is VERY nice, because EQ constantly harasses its customers to buy/pre-order expansions when logging into the account, if they have your credit card and you push 'OK' then they quickly charge you in 1/10 of a second, no confrimation required, but if your using the game card they would have to ask you for the credit card number.

That's the most versatile issue this card has, so if you love Multiplayer Online RPGs but are not sure to invest in one because of the payment of monthly service, after purchasing EverQuest and its expansions, along with this card, those worries go like the wind blows. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks it up but a piece of junk","review":"why can't someone make a product like this out of strong, durable parts..it would be such a great concept to be able to vacuum up all the small leaves and debris.This does suck it up...but the product is basically a piece of junk that will be broken in a few months for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless!!","review":"This product has such weak suction that it will hardly pick up dust let alone twigs leaves etc.Don't waste your money.

I use it to vacuum the patio and driveway. It cleans up the debris with little difficulty, and the bag is easy to detach and empty.

Other than that, this device works quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and kickstand issue","review":"This vacuum is significantly louder than my wet/dry canister shop vacuum and the kickstand is poorly designed with the result that the vacuum tends to fall over, as other reviewers have said. It doesn't pick up debris on smooth concrete as well as a standard indoor upright or a canister shop vacuum, and always left fine dirt on my garage flooor that I was tracking into the house. I find I always reach for my canister shop vacuum instead, so I ended up throwing this vacuum out. It looks like a great idea-- and for some kinds of debris it may be-- but it was an expensive failed experiment for me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"shop vac","review":"I have owned this vac for 5 years.

Every concert evokes the same reaction in me: this youngster is Horowitz and Rubinstein combined. Incredible! I have heard his Mussorgsky in concert, and this disc captures it, all the power, all the brooding majesty. It is beyond belief. Maybe it's time to stop buying series tickets and just buy all Kissin's discs, because I can do without the insipidity of others.

He totally transports you to another place and time. What a great escape."},{"rating":"2","title":"modern day steinbeck","review":"Oh how I loved this book! It is the type of novel I have been craving for a long time. It has the works - memorable well fleshed-out characters; evocative descriptions (which I read over and over because they were so gorgeous); clarity and fluency of prose; credibility in narration; subtle humour; wise observations about life; emotional depth (how can a man write like this about girlie stuff?). I fell in love with the Appalachian Mountains through the story and want to visit there now (I live In Australia).

The first one is the ability to give those close-kin characters the similarlties that make them genetically kin, but the differences that mark them as separate creations. The two sisters of this story hold each others hands while living on their own internal planet.His second skill is his ability to hold the reader through perfect descriptions of place in both space and time. No skim reading here!What a beautiful representation of this area of Kentucky in the sixties."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Five Star Writer And Novel","review":"Having long admired the work of Mr. House, I could not wait to read this latest novel. I do declare that it might be his best work yet. His language sings and the story keeps the pages turning.

The surprise is that it's actually the work of another film great, Max Steiner. And beautiful work it is. It's a bouncy, joyous score, full of romance and pomp, and is a perfect addition to the classic canon of swashbuckler scores. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Campaign Press Release or Biography","review":"Perhaps my view can be attributed to the inherent skepticism of being a Philadelphia sports fan, but the tone of this book rings more like a political endorsement than biography. It's very thin on Bunning's early life, devotes very little space to his time with the Pirates and Dodgers, and spends an inordinate amount of time on the campaign trail. About the only time I got a sense of the real Jim Bunning was in the chapters devoted to his minor league managing career. As the Phutile Phillies were apt to do during Bunning's career, Dolson doesn't get enough run support and does an admirable job with very thin material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peabo's Best!","review":"A great CD by one of the best vocalists in the world.

Only links with the origanal film here is the voice of Dorothy which is provided by Liza minnelli, daughter of Judy garland. The story goes pretty much the same - Dorothy is transported over the rainbow by a cyclone and is reunited with her old familiar friends. Animation is fine, its just the lack of any real exciting adventure that lets the whole thing down. The film was actually made in 1964 but it took an incredible 10 years for it to be finally released - watching this only makes you realise why. Young children may be enthralled but lovers of the Oz books will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy service from seller and Amazon.","review":"Lousy service from seller and Amazon.

At the same time he has revealed how this project brought about his journey from an abandoned faith to renewed belief. There is no pious embellishment of the monastic life of solitude and silence. On the contrary, it is a very practical and realistic appraisal of an extraordinary way of living by astonishing numbers of quite ordinary men and women throughout the centuries of Christianity -- with special emphasis on Trappists in the United States. The material is well-organized and well-written. The reader soon realizes this is no boring history text.Waters of Siloe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Real View of Trappist Life ?","review":"If one wants a balanced and realistic view of monastic life and history, three recent books are highly recommended- \\"Cloister Walk\\" by Kathleen Norris, \\"Grace is Everywhere\\" by James Behrens, and, \\"Trappist: Living in the Land of Desire\\" - the companion book to the PBS documentary \\"Trappist\\" (WVTI Charlotte Public Television, 1997.I've been regularly going on retreats to a Trappist monastery since 1988, - I purchased Mr. Bianco's book when it first came out, ( at the Abbey gift shop as a matter of fact ), and was rather surprised and perplexed by his tone and view throughout.If you want the straight story with no spin, look at the above selections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for the Journey","review":"I recommend this book to those who find themselves on a spiritual journey. Having glanced at other reviews of the text, I agree that it is less a general introduction to the Trappist way of life and more of a documentary of the author's personal exploration of their spirituality. This exploration is in the context of the loss of his son; the tragedy is actually the impetus for his spiritual quest. In that sense, I believe readers that are similarly engaged will find the book much, much more meaningful and accessable than those who may be reading out of detached academic interest.More than anything, I think the book provides a great insight into the charism of the Trappists Mr. Bianco lived with, and for anyone considering spending some time \\"off grid\\", it sheds a lot of light on the potential experience. If you are on the journey, or perhaps more accurately, engaged in the battle, I think this book will help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fine Book","review":"This was a very fine book, very moving. It was sad, actually, to have finished reading the book as I thought I was putting away a good friend. The book was informative enough in teaching readers about the Trappist way of life---yet revealed the Trappists to be very real individuals. For those looking for scandal, they are in for disappointment. The humanity of these fine men is amazing. And, do not forget to read Mr. Bianco's introduction as it reveals the heart and soul of the man and what he learns about God and himself in his time with the Trappists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemporary view of Trappist monastic life.","review":"This is an excellent introduction into the Catholic monastic tradition. If anyone is interested in knowing more about the Cisterican type of monasticism and fundamental spiritual principles, this is the book. It reads easily and gives a good presentation of this once very mysterious type of monastic community. Referring to it time and time again, it provides glimpses into contemporary Trappist life and experiences but also provides key if not very basic, yet deep, concepts of the spiritual life. This book can be a springboard going to other reading on monastic values and the Trappist tradition. Highly recommended. I would accompany this book with a recent presentation by Michael Downey called Trappist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and Suspenseful","review":"I liked this book. The heroine was sufficiently flawed to be believable. And the \\"bad guy\\" in this one is sneaky enough to keep you wondering. The \\"getting inside his head\\" is a little creepy. The mystery is engaging. I was sad to see that Eileen doesn't use the same characters from book to book becuase I truly liked this nurse. But I guess it would stretch belief as she is a normal person in an extreme situation"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I read this after seeing several comments on Twitter and thought it would be a great suspense (medical) thriller. I'm actually not sure which genre this should be in... very disappointing. As a former nurse, I couldn't relate to the story OR the characters. Was hoping for much more.

Ms. Jaffrey has a lively writing style that makes for a story that is both informative and enjoyable. However,the task of dealing with a topic on which there is very little prior research is daunting, and Ms. Jaffrey's story sometimes wanders into too many directions. What she provides is an excellent snapshot of some specific \\"hijra\\" groups, and an overview of a very complex social system within the larger complex socialsystem of India."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject, Poor Book","review":"I was very interested when I heard the subject of this book. The eunuchs of India is a subject that very little has been written about. This book promised to tell about this \\"invisible\\" group. Instead I kept reading the author's story of her dificulties in finding any infomation only to find the book end without almost any information being found. This was disapointing especially since the story was hard to follow and I only managed to follow it in hopes of finding an in depth look at this fascinating group. I hope that one day another researcher will write the book that this author promises the reader and then never achieves. In the end this book would be better as an introduction for further studies than a book on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me wanting more ??","review":"I think Zia did a lot of research but after reading the book I have to look back and ask \\"what did I really learn about the Eunuchs\\" ? The answer to that is unfortunately -- nothing. She missed a HUGE opportunity when visiting with a Doctor to find out a lot about the Eunuchs and failed miserably. Great subject matter and it takes an effort to fail with such a great and interesting subject. Save your money !!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising author wanders a bit in this one.","review":"Ms. Jaffrey is at her best when on the subject of viewing India through the eyes of a 'semi-Indian'. The topic as discussed is a bit disjointed and hard to follow. I would like to see her write a travelogue in the manner of Theroux on her experiences in India as one who straddles the fence between western and eastern culture. She exhibits alot of promise, and though this effort is somewhat tedious I'm sure she'll have good things to come"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but hard to read","review":"Ms. Jaffrey has chronicled her search for information about the hijras of India. Her English and grammar is tortured and takes some getting used to. If you've ever actually been to India, you'll be reminded of how you rarely really understand all that people are saying even though it seems to be English. As an American English speaker, reading this book, there were times when I had no idea what she meant.There is also some information about the hijras, but it is repeated to the reader as often as it was repeated to the writer in her search. Mostly what you get from this book is a good sense of what it's like to try to research something in India: the complexities, the subterfuges, the lying, the mix of fact and fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject matter saves (barely) amateurish book","review":"Who knew eunuchs were alive and well in the world on the cusp of the 21st century? Fascinating subject matter. Too bad the writing and reporting here are slapdash and amateurish. In the hands of more skilled author, this could have been a one-of-a-kind classic. Sadly, this is just another example of the publishing world's shortage of skilled editors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belongs In a Dung Pile!","review":"I was out of town visiting my aunt and I was a little bored because I didn't have a book to read and my aunt belonged to a book of the month club so I looked at her bookcase with all of the hardcover books she got through her book club and I saw a book that said Rock Star by Jackie Collins and being a big fan of rock music it seemed like a book I would like to read so I read the book and when I was finished I decided that I just didn't like this book and thought it was stupid, just very stupid, trite and vapid and way too trashy for my taste. I see some people picture the rock star to be based on Rod Stewart but as for me when reading the book I pictured Mick Jagger but I guess Jackie Collins could have based her character on both Rod Stewart and Mick Jagger.

I have taken four years of anthropology classes and still find the book to be way above my head. This is not a book to read for pleasure. If not in the garbage, it belongs in the classroom with extreme outlining of it, for Lewellen tends to be jumpy and almost scattered.

I do wish the production value was a little higher, but then I read that it was the directors first feature... Wow, if he did this in round 1, I can't wait to see his next creation.

It has the first 24 Batman comics. In the first one you will find out how great an action hero Batman really is. In the second one you will find out how good of a detective Batman really is. In the third one you will meet Batman's first arch villain and so on and so on. Then to top it all off in the middle of the book Robin the boy wonder is introduced as Batman's aid and best friend. This book comes in mighty handy for example your parents tell you to stop watching TV and playing games and go and read, well this will come in handy. If your in a long road trip or going on vacation on a long plane ride this book will come in handy. In school you can put this baby in front of your boring textbook and read it instead.

If you take it off it adds steps, bound up the stairs with a bounce it adds extra steps, shake it a tad it adds extra steps. You can also hear the mechanism inside rattle with movement. It drives me crazy. I guess I am spoiled with my Omron. I can take it off and shake it like a maraca and it will not add anything to my steps. It also does not make a bit of noise- at all.

Mr. Burleigh's insights will be interesting to see how this might happen - or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant read","review":"This is one of the most brilliant explications of the contrast and conflict between religion and politics in Europe from 1800 to the early 20th century. The authro delves deep into the underlying values of Europe in the 19th century as secularism swept the continent and unleashed terrible things. This is groundbreaking research that explains, finally, the interplay between Darwining, biblical criticism and the way in which religion and secularism lead to both violence and peace. The French revolution was the ultimate secular crusade the war of 1914 marked the end of that period of secularization and the advent of the communist and fascist period that would arrive after 1922.A very interesting and grounbbreaking study. Easily readable, and brilliantly laid out, the argument is only half developed for this is part of a larger study, but this portion is the strongest.Seth J.

There is not enough harmony and style in their music, songs not well structured and breaks apart sometimes. But from the middle of this disk I start really enjoy the sound. Best tracks are 5 and 6.

Annie Dillard is an unflinching, straightforward writer who has a firm grasp on the strengths and frailties of human nature. She accurately captures the feel of NW Washington \\"high woods\\" and the people who settled the area. By the time you finish this novel you will not just feel like you know the characters, you'll feel like you're related to each one of them and have greived their passing.

However, if you love intricate detail, bottomless character portrayals, exquisite symbolism, depth and just lovely writing you'll want to read it more than once. Without a doubt, it belongs right up there with To Kill a Mockingbird and The Grapes of Wrath.

I was the sole exception. I did not love it. I found it a dark, claustrophic book. Perhaps that was intentional on the author's part - all those big trees blocking out the sun and all. I will admit that the American pioneers hold little faciniation for me, which undoubtedly skews my opinion. I understand that in them there days people probably \\"reckoned\\" all kinds of things. I don't think today's prose describing the past needs to be full of idiomatic accents. I reckoned that was distracting more than anything else. So we have a dark dark book full of reckoning AND it is episodic to boot. Episodic, while occassionally an effective liturary devise, can also strike one as a method to use in stringing together vingettes and never fully realizing the characters' depth. So, now I am left with a dark, claustrophobic, episodic novel full of pretentious accents. I know others love this book.

It has deep walls to hold enough liquid for a pan of spaghetti or moderate amount of chili. It has a nice heft to it, an ergonomic solid handle, and sturdy construction with a heavy duty lid as well. This brings me to the reason I gave it four stars instead of five. It doesn't have a helper handle on the front. It's probably heavy enough that one would be useful.

I was never interested in the fate of Alex, a cold, hard-bitten killer whose motivations are kept under wraps until a (rather contrived) 11th hour reveal. If the story had been built around Massey's doomed attempt to save Alex from trying to carry out a mission that was inevitably going to lead him to disaster, it would have had a stronger emotional hook. But Meade spends much too much time setting up the mechanics of Alex's mission and not enough on giving us a reason to care about Alex. Since this isn't really alternate history, we know he's not really going to succeed, so it needed to be more about the 'why' and less about 'how.'Sometimes evocative, but structurally clumsy and with a choppy writing style (and some really contrived setpieces) that keep it from catching fire. A shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, even for Summer fare","review":"It is rare that a plot turn is so awful, so hackneyed, so deus-ex-machina, so Wagnerian that it takes me by surprise.

The description of the Russian winters are also very detailed. Another convincing factor in this book is the cruelty of Beria,the KGB and the usage of the Lubyanka.

The characters are well defined, each possesing traits characteristic of a hidden past, a parrallel to the book's theme. The action is fast and will engross the most passive reader, while historical accuracy combines with vivid imagery to present the action in a setting richly descibed by the author.

Great surprise ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"great plot, presented in the worst possible way","review":"The plot is great. At the same time the novel does not generate even the smallest level of credibility to be entertaining: the characters act like stupid zombies and the historic background is full of ridiculous projections of 70-s/90-s realities into 1952. Funniest thing is that both USA and USSR are presented with the same ridiculously low quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take Out Uncle Joe","review":"I enjoy Meade's fictional escapes as he always finds a great premise, surrounds it with believable characters, and sets them off at a blistering pace. In Snow Wolf he transcends the 'assassination of a historical figure' plot by not falling prey to Jason Bourne/James Bond pyrotechnics and superhero capabilities. In this case Ike authorizes the elimination of Stalin due to his mental health. Two very human CIA agents, posing as man and wife, are sent to Soviet Russia tasked with taking out Uncle Joe which kicks off a KGB pursuit. By the end of the novel you are asking yourself, \\"did something like that really happen?\\" and that is what makes the book a solid read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making a case for skilled editing.","review":"This book was painful to read. While the plot otherwise would have been interesting, the sloppy disregard of facts and inattention to detail make the book embarassingly amateurish: 1)How can a one-armed man ride a BMW motorcycle that requires left-handed clutch and right-handed throttle operation? 2)How can he kick-start the motorcycle with the start lever on the right side when BMWs of that era had levers on the left side (to allow for a sidecar on the right)? 3)How can the world's best hand-to-hand combat trainer get beaten up 3 times in 30 pages (once by an untrained, petite girl)? 4)How can someone described as wearing a fine suit and a heavy overcoat be given an injection by rolling up his sleeve? Quality is in the details, Glenn."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lazy attempt at writing a thriller. Go back to Tom Clancy.","review":"Glenn Meade depends on too many coincidences to advance the plot of this Cold War thriller. President Eisenhower asks how to stop a plan to kill Stalin when events spiral out of control. The simple answer is simply to put the book down, or grit your teeth until the end of this implausible tale for the limited joy of listing all of Meade's historical inaccuracies. You're better off with the classic thriller writers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbeliavably stupid characters!","review":"I still gave the book a try... When I read that the CIA hitman had his license registered under his own name, I said 'well, maybe this isn't so big a mistake, I can forgive this.' But then a couple of pages later, there is a scene where a KGB thug beat the crap out of one of the good guys all by himself in an apartment room (which wasn't described as a safehouse or anything like that). By coincidence, the CIA hitman raided the room..I stopped reading right there and decided not to go beyond that point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great combo watch with ability to hide digital","review":"Great combo digital/analog watch for the price point.

Big complaint: no hourly chime!!! I need this feature.

She immediately loved it (much to my surprise as I never expected her to try it). The only problem is that the mailstation truncates messages that are more than 5 or 6 lines long. For some reason, mail sent to the same e-mail address goes through most of the time, but bounces back at other times. Also, mail sent from a hotmail account to the mailstation will not ever go through. The mailstation is so limited that it becomes frustrating.

Based on the pictures on the cover, I expected other creative and interesting uses of weaving materials to make attractive finished pieces (whether functional or not).

It is absolutely not a how-to-plan-your-wedding type of book. Readers looking for this sort of thing are better off with one of Martha Stewart's tomes. This is, however, a lyrical, poetic, and fascinating study of dozens (maybe hundreds) of wedding traditions and their origins in all world cultures. Along with meditative passages to help you find your own way. It is, as other readers have noted, lacking an index.

Unfortunately it was more a history on how marriage is the way the man keeps women down( sorry I am not a femnazis), the psycho-social history marriage and some antidotes that were not what I expected. I thought since this book had some things about handfasting and such, this would be great for us. However we did not get anything out of it.

City Life in particular is a very original composition. It uses pre-recorded sounds from thy city (street vender calls, fog horns, etc.) as major thematic material.

As sound samples taken from police radio transmissions infuse the music with a sense of danger. Nothing like this has been written since Different Trains. However this music is not for every one.

So many hacks cashing in.The only person who has any clue is Lou Schmitt who concluded the parents COULD NOT have committed the crime, certainly not in the way alleged. With his extensive experience he concluded that the note could not have been written by the mother after the killing. Also, JB was stunned with a stun gun, then garotted whilst alive (her fingernails cut into her throat as she tried to free the garotte) and finally hit over the head.

When and if they told him they didn't agree with him, they were attacked.The book is very interesting - - as a study of Mr. Andrew Hodges and his overinflated sense of importance.Is it a good book to read if you are following the Ramsey case?

Here he expands on the groundwork previously laid in his first book and spicing things up a bit using \\"new\\" information especially such derived from the parents' book Death Of Innocence. As it is, I lost track of the author's line of reasoning, as he did not really substanciate how the \\"hidden meaning\\" emerges from what has been written.It makes for an interesting read but if you want information on the case that is more believable and understandable I recommend that you read some of the other books written on this subject, especially Perfect Murder Perfect Town and Steven Thomas's JonBenet: Inside The Ramsey Murder Investigation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Late for Justice?","review":"As the never-ending drama of this murder drags on and on in the press, it seems to me a pity that such brilliant analysis as this book offers seems doomed to be ignored by the authorities. Dr. Hodges really appears to be on to something by his assessment of the ransom note's every word and sentence. Too bad the Boulder police seem determined to maintain that this case is unsolveable. Using Dr. Hodges' techniques, as outlined in this book, it would seem quite obvious that at least an indictment ought to be brought and a trial attempted.

As the product is water absorbent, that means that unless the product is used promptly, much of it will be wasted. In addition, the picture you present is very different from the product delivered. The picture you present appears to be of the 10 ounce package which contains a 20-30-20 formulation. The product I received is 24-8-16 which is substantially different.

That kind of review always makes me suspicious, so I checked out the other book reviews by the same reviewer and lo' and behold, they were all one-liner reviews of best-sellers that ended in recommending this book. To be fair, I have not read this book so I can't pass judgment on the quality, however, I would be biased against since it seems that the author, his friends, publisher, or someone is trying to stack the Amazon ratings system. Shame on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Literary Classic!","review":"Wow! is all I can say. This book transends the Thriller genre, the writer is a genius!

Unfortunately, as soon as Garrison arrives in the Sunshine State he realizes that crime just won't take time off from him. A series of murders take place during Garrison's vacation and somehow each victim is mysteriously connected to him. With the killer leaving subtle clues it becomes apparent to Garrison that someone is playing a game with him- a game like no other- one where the rules are deadly. And like every game, there can only be one winner in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited Life","review":"I bought one similar to this and the copper plate rusted through in about a year and a half.

I really did not find it interesting. It is simply a personal memoir and there seem to be no end to the stream of this type of book about growing up in Ireland. Maybe some one who knows the guy or his successful business might find it interesting or would like to know about his family but apart from that he had a uneventful life or not one that was of any significance to read about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this one","review":"The profits from this book are going to charity. That is probably the best thing about this bloated, self-serving exercisein ego-enrichment. Mister Cullen is a remarkable man and he wants you to know that in a desperate way. He could have saved everyone a lot of trouble and just given the money directly to the charities. Mr Cullen tells the reader that he is not a professional writer. That wasn't needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for it in the least.","review":"I found it odd to read an autobiography written in the third person. Not sure why the author did this - all I can figure is that there was so much boasting that he would have felt odd stating, \\"I, I, I\\" as much as he would have had to if written in the fist person. I was not surprised to find out the author divorced his first wife and married a former model - that's just the type of guy I imagined him to be after reading all the bravado in the book. I grew tired of all the bragging by the end - \\"ok, ok, you're really smart, I get it\\" was pretty much my sentiment as I struggled to get through this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchably awful!","review":"Rarely have I hated a movie as much. It's badly shot, badly written and the characters bear no resemblance to anyone I've ever met. Cassavetes supposedly took his inspiration from real life but this is as contrived as any Hollywood movie -- everyone is constantly yelling at everyone else -- that is, when they're not hitting each other or inexplicably making up and playing nice. An incoherent, rambling, poorly shot and edited mess. I like Gena Rowlands but see 'Gloria' instead if you like her. This is, quite simply, one of the worst movies ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make it stop, dear Gods, please make it stop!","review":"I think most of the reviews for this movie are positive simply because the sample of opinions is rather skewed. The reviewers are self-selected, perhaps consisting mostly of Cassavetes fans who are likely to buy DVD's of obscure 1970's independent films. I was subjected to this monstrosity in film class. It was like being in a waiting room in a hospital or somewhere, and some weirdo sits down next to you and starts spouting idiotic nonsense, and you can't get up and leave for almost two hours. I found myself frequently wondering if I could fatally puncture a major blood vessel with a ball point pen. I tried to give this film no stars but the server would not let me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Cult Classic Romantic Comedy!!!","review":"I love this movie! I wish it would be re-released on DVD because all I have now is the VHS version of it. It is SO MUCH better than the garbage hollywood shoves down our throats these days. It is a LOVE story, not a story about bodily functions which is about all hollywood can put out anymore. It is a story about two very different people falling head over heels for each other almost at first sight and the love they feel is so strong that it over powers all obstacles, all their differences. It's just beautiful! It is about the love we all wish we could find and once we find it be brave enough to grab hold and never let go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I HAVE NO IDEA WHY JOHN CASSAVETES IS CONSIDERED A GREAT FILMMAKER. Forgive me for yelling, but I just wasted almost two hours watching people YELL and fight about nothing. I think Cassavetes must have had serious mental problems. I've attempted to watch other films of his - I always give up in about 15 minutes because massive depression sets in. This is first one I've watched one through because my sister said it was FUNNY! Boring 70s claptrap...neurotic people rambling about nothing to various other neurotic people. Oh and beating each other up for no reason. How could anyone make a artless, miserable, depressing film like this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You gotta be kidding.....surprisingly amateur!","review":"This film is shocking in many ways. First that such a first rate director and cast could come up with such a mess. The only thing missing is the shaky camerawork. This isn't a movie.....it's an embarrassment. What's it about? Just imagine a day in the life with some loud mouthed couple who are mismatched and thrown together and someone is following them around with a camcorder waiting for them to kill each other. The only difference is that in this movie they don't die which is a shame considering all the punishment we are subjected to trying to watch it. An eccentric concoction based on a pot brainstorm that isn't worthy of a passing grade in a high school film project assignment. Maybe one of the worse movies I've ever seen. It amounts to nothing more than a loud, eneven, rambling, misguided venture with no redeeming value. Bury it along with Nuclear waste materials and hope it gets destroyed so as to save humanity from it's sheer boredom! Horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"As the first American soldier to come across the carnage at the Little Bighorn, James H. Bradley was in a unique position to record his sights and impressions. Unfortunately, this book is written in the deadest possible 19th-century prose, so pedestrian it doesn't even walk -- it crawls.

My sisters and I argued on what to watch on Saturday mornings so mom made us rotate each hour. I always got the Groovie Goolies during my hour. The dvd is fantastic with great color (without having to stand up and adjust the dial or the rabbit ears!) They should have included the live action color footage from the Saturday Superstar Movie called Daffy Duck and Porky Pig meet the Groovie Goolies that was relased later. I'd much rather have that in this dvd rather than the stupid 90's rock group with the plageurized name that had absolutely no part in my childhood. Again, they should have included the live action Goolies and left out the stupid 90's band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to see the gang again.","review":"Whatever your feelings about the Goolies, they have been lovingly restored. The colors are brighter than bright, and the images are crystal clear in this set. The musical tracks have been re-\\"vamped\\" and pumped up, but for some reason, they couldn't do this with some of the novelty voices in the songs, which sound a bit tinny in comparison. The vocal tracks of the cartoons themselves though, are clean and clear. Overall, I think they look and sound better than they did when I saw them as a kid. We didn't have cable, so I can see and hear them better than I did when they were broadcast. The one notable missing thing, as one of the other reviewers stated, is the laugh track. I don't know why it was taken out, but the programs suffer notably by the lack. A lot of the jokes were always corny, but somehow it seemed more fun with the show laughing at itself. Without that, many of the gags seem to fall flat.Overall though, it is a well-done treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"groovie goolies","review":"been a long time so this was a buzz to show my kids,,,great cartoon ,,corney gags and jokes but i was 10 when i first saw this so i was very pleased"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to have this...","review":"I used to get up literally at dawn and watch this on a 13\\" black and white set when I was a little kid in the really early 80's, I loved it that much.

When I ordered this, I wasn't expecting to get the full series (it was right around when this came out) but I received this version in the mail and was delighted. If you are in your 30's, as I am, a tiny bit of this show goes a long way now. It's just great to have it around now and know I can see it whenever.

The chest harness is great but adds a fair bit of bulk.

I found this one and thought for 100 bucks i could get good bags and a great suspension system all in one. Well the bags are great can't be ripped, torn, etc. (this remains to be seen) But like other reviewers the suspenders are not made for people over 6 foot they just dont sit on your shoulders the way they should. I gave them to one of my subs and they work for him but he is also several inches shorter than me. I like the belt it came with but I am so use to using leather I swapped it out for that.

Beyond belief that a great outfit such as Petra was allowed and enabled to produce such a failure. 1) Petra owes its fans a dvd set that has at least two dvds inside. 2) Petra owes its fans a concert that produces sound and camera work that is a million miles above the filth within this dvd. This dvd is only one in a million representative examples of why \\"Christian music\\" is made fun of and even disliked by Christians. Petra is not a valid witnessing tool. Those fans who say they were \\"saved\\" at a Petra show were simply seduced by something called the power of suggestion. Petra is cool but not GOD.

Focus is mainly on vocals the whole time when the band are good enough to warrant a bit of coverage. But thats all I can fault it on.

This video was made at the end of a fantastic run for Petra at a time when they didn't have the money or the fancy production crews to work with. This DVD was made FOR THE TRUE FANS of Petra as a salute to their love for them! I thank Petra for making this last DVD.

Reputedly, Sinatra wanted to bring her on tour with him, but she wouldn't agree to travel. Her closest American counterpart is Steisand, but I find Mina more enjoyable to listen to, and she has a more contemporary musical sensibility. If you have been waiting for an album reminiscent of her best 70's work [and that oeuvre was remarkable, overall], this is the one to get. In fact, this may exceed that work, as it is totally satisfying from beginning to end. There are 2 songs sung in Neapolitan, which are beautiful.

Massie is superb in his biographical sketches and he gets the general thrust and parry of Great Power politics. Where he comes up short is that the reader is lured into the notion that the Naval Arms race was what really lit the fuse to WWI. The truth is, of course, more complex. He doesn't bring out the inter-relationships among the Russo-Japanese War, the annexation of Bosnia/Herzegovina, and the amoral oneupsmanship of the Great Power leaders and diplomats. He doesn't provide the perspective between the importance of the arms competition on land and that at sea.

The only scientific discussion is about geology but some annexes or notes would help clarify the jargon here.

If you like heroes, action-adventure, colorful characters, and drama, this is a tremendous read. Of all mankind's accomplishments, the ones chronicled by Andrew Chaikin in A Man on the Moon certainly illuminate man's potential for great achievements better than any I've encountered.With his account, Chaikin has given me countless heros that never flew in a rocket. I have known the name of Neil Armstrong virtually all my life, but now I can appreciate many more of the men and women of tremendous courage that made Kennedy's challenge into reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive work on the Apollo missions.","review":"I waited a long time for this book. I have wanted to read an in-depth account of all the moon landings, and this is it. Mr. Chaikin does it all. He tells the reader everything about every mission. It's just that simple. The astronauts, and the NASA experts, the rockets, and the rock we call the moon. Have you ever wondered what the missions were all about? This book describes, in a can't-put-it-down way, the specifics of every Apollo mission. This book is the Rosetta Stone for any space or moon enthusiast. A masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, an incredible masterpiece","review":"You have to listen to this cd, the music is amazing, the lyrics are deep, an excellent exposure of the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book this year!","review":"This is a fun book you can really sink your teeth into...at least you'll be sinking your teeth into something as you read it - lots of scenes involve cooking, food, and an AGA stove. Min and Daisy have a warm, wonderful friendship, the kind of bond that can withstand a 15 year separation. All of the characters are very funny and very human. Min's got to be my favorite. I thought I was a flaky mother, but she makes me look like supermom! I am recommending this to all my harried married friends, and all my controlled and controlling single friends as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, simple but effective","review":"This book is geared for teens or anyone who is unsure of what the Catholic Church teaches. I like the short simple chapters he uses, that makes it easy for teens or people just wanting a quick simple explanation of the Churches beliefs. He does a good job at giving examples and simple comparisions that really make sense. If you are looking for a \\"deep\\" book on all the truths of the Church this one would not be for you. It is a \\"taste\\" of the Catholic faith and YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT !! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled!","review":"I bought this cd for five dollars and that was about how much it was worth!

Though the cover singers are pretty good. Some of the best ones include the first track \\"(Everything I Do) I Do it for you\\" from \\"Robin Hood\\" if fantastic. It almost sounds like Bryan Adams. Other songs that were covered well was Boyz II Men's \\"End of the Road\\" and Eric Clapton's \\"Tears In Heaven\\". Though I'm a bit nit-picky about track five: \\"Unchained Melody\\". I desperately wanted the Righteous Brothers; no one doesn't better then them! Ditto for Whitney Houston's \\"I Will Always Love You\\".All in all, a good buy for the tight-wad who can appreciate songs without the original artists!"},{"rating":"2","title":"as described","review":"Been using this liner for years and it's wonderful and i will purchase more from this site fast shipment. required"},{"rating":"2","title":"DIFFERENT IS COOL!","review":"This is not your average kung fu classic, more of a comedy chase caper. Yuen Biao does his normal share of amazing stunts but what makes this film cool is the unique fighting styles and the endearing relationships between the bumbling protagonist and those around him. Not as hard hitting as YOUNG MASTER or MAGNIFICENT BUTCHER, this film is still a gem worth having in the finest of kung fu collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far from Yuen Biao's best","review":"Yuen Biao stars as a young man who does not know kung fu, but he wants to become a disciple of Wong Fei Hung. His friend Foon (played by Leung Kar Yan) wants to help him out. Leung Kar Yan is just great in this movie. Phillip Ko stars, and wants to get rid of Wong Fei Hung's school. He hires a crazy killer played by Yuen Shun Yi to help him with his evil deeds. It's not a great story or anything, but it's passable. I was a bit disappointed with this movie, but with such a great cast and plenty of good fights, I can't really complain. I just wish the final fight was done differently. Having Yuen Biao not know kung fu hurt the movie, especially in the final fight. I had a good time watching this, but I would put Knockabout, Prodigal Son and at least a couple others far ahead of it as Yuen Biao's best movie.3.5/5I have the Megastar version and the picture quality is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of good talent","review":"I didn't like this movie at all....I thought it would be a good movie , because it had Yuen Biao and \\"Beardy\\" in it..but they don't show off any skills...the fightscenes are really pathetic...better skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful, Serviceable","review":"I've had this dictionary for years and consult it frequently for the exact meaning of Latin words (as opposed to the meaning I happen to guess at). I use it when working on crossword puzzles or trying to understand legal terms. I've even used it to help me turn an English sentence into a Latin one. Another reviewer mentioned that Latin phrases aren't listed here. They aren't, and that's a big drawback. For Latin (and other) phrases I use the Harper Dictionary of Foreign Terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing more than a prospectus for hedge funds","review":"I was deeply disappointed. I supposed this book could tell me a lot how \\"successful\\" hedge funds operated and profited (I inferred so from the word \\"Giants\\" on the title of the book and the back cover which promised to explain the strategies and techniques they employ). However, all I could read was plenty of charts, tables and sales talks, very general in nature, the stuff one could get from any hedge fund sales brochure displayed inside a bank.If you wanna know why successful hedge funds profit so, you will be absolutely disappointed. If you wanna select a fund or two from the sea of choices nowadays which suit your investment objectives (profit making for sure) and risk appetite, you will be very disappointed as well. In the rare case you need to write a sales brochure for a hedge fund that you need to put everything positive but vague, it's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's","review":"I first heard this band on a German music channel. They have a nice style if you are into 80's type music. It's upbeat and it has a nice rythem. I highly reccommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Conquers All","review":"What a great book! An \\"oldie but goodie\\" from the talented Nann Dunne, STAYING IN THE GAME is well worth the time to read. Starting with a protagonist who is secretive, talented, and beautiful, yet reclusive and mysterious, this book will keep the reader on their toes until the very last page. The mysterious woman, Shelley Brinton, has a history of transferring colleges, anger problems, and problems with the law. She fits the description of a serial killer who has been victimizing women at local colleges.Despite the warning signs, Angela Wedgewood finds herself undeniably attracted to Shelley. Even worse, the more Angela falls in love with Shelley, the more she fears the dark woman might actually be guilty.A riveting book, with multi-dimensional characters and an engaging storyline, GAME is one you most certainly should not miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well Told Story of War and Love","review":"Upon the backdrop of the horrors of the Civil War comes a great tale of courage, morals, love and choices. In his novel \\"Dupre's Song: A Story From The American Civil War\\" author Eddie Blanchard takes the reader on an emotional journey of across battlefields of war and the heart. The book is full of energy and emotions!Blanchard brings lots of good story telling elements into the mix as he weaves his tale about people caught up in adversity. The author uses good phrasing and wording to flesh out his cast of characters for this story. He makes each of them believable and important to the storyline. This is good entertainment and well worth reading. The author obviously has a passion for that time period and he treats the readers to wonderfully told story.This book receives the MWSA's TOP BOOK RATING - FIVE STARS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Studying rhythm","review":"The book arrived with a really bad smell . I tolerated it for a while and in fact did not touch it for some time thinking the odor would wear off .

These songs are nice, especially the instrumentals, but I was sad to find that they added singers to many of the selections on this CD. If I want to hear singing, I will buy and listen to CDs with good singers; the singers on this CD aren't terribly good and add absolutely nothing to this otherwise fine ensemble. I wish groups like this would just play the great melodies as a skilled small orchestra and leave the singing to those who do it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Innapropriate for young children","review":"This band is really not what you want your children to be influenced by.

Encadenado and Ahora se me va. Songs on the cd range from soothing ballads to funk-pop. The overall production is \\"A class material\\" with many exquisite arrangements, especially the strings. Mijares sings very well on this album and the music was arranged and produced by Juan Carlos Calderon. Calderon is considered one of the most prolific composer of our times. All of his compositions have that Calderonism that it is frequently heard in his music. Although, not a production for everyone, Mijares and Non-Mijares fans could enjoy this album for the quality of the arrangements and structure and because of Mijares' powerful vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've purchased maternity panels at a sewing supply store in the past.

The material quality is a little poor also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening, Entertaining and Right on Point!","review":"I love how Gina expresses her stories in an informative yet entertaining form. I'm almost sorry to enjoy her writings at her personal expense, but somehow I feel that we can all relate or learn from what we read in the \\"G Spot\\". The author writes with a pace and description that puts you right there with her. You experience what she and/or her acquaintances experience as you live through the relationship episodes within the pages. Surely Book Club material, this book is a great sitcom waiting to happen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This holds some of his best literary pieces on fishing","review":"Zane Grey made his name writing Western novels, but his very best writing revolves around fishing. Grey's first fishing article appeared in 1902, and he published continuously on the topic until his death in 1939. This holds some of his best literary pieces on fishing, and includes a foreword by Loren Grey, and is a lovely, smooth collection thanks to the superb editing of Terry Mort. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be forewarned.","review":"Real communication breakdown between buyer and seller here, though not the fault of buyer!

Finally a refund from Amazon squared things. Will not do business with this seller again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Narrative History from a Unique Point of View","review":"The author presents the facts of case pretty much as a lawyer would. The presentation appears to be complete and detailed. But a professional historian would have taken a different tack. Personally, I feel that Chief Justice Rehnquist presentation was excellent.I particularly liked the Chief Justice's analysis of what might have been Justice Bradley's thought processes in arriving at his opinions. I do not believe that a professional historian could have provided this type of insight into the situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses focus at the end","review":"I enjoyed this book and found it very informative about the 1876 election.Then Rehnquist loses his focus at the end, including a lengthy chapter summarizing how the U.S. Supreme Court has played an extra-judiciary role in American government throughout American history. That chapter did not seem to belong in this book. It was as though Rehnquist wrote it as an essay to justify his Court's role in the 2000 election, and he needed a place to put it. I got frustrated and bored during that chapter, and finally decided that I was not obligated to finish it, and I stopped.I recommend reading this book until the last chapter, which you can skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO BOOK IN MAILBOX","review":"The book did not come in the MAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Simply put, the chief justice is ignorant of scholarship on this election, a prisoner of old stereotypes foisted upon him by whatever research assistant sought to placate his views (do you really think the cheif justice went to the sources?). Scholars will be interested in this book insofar as it might shed some light into the chief justice's own views on the disputed election of 2000, but no one should mistake this volume for a reliable work of historical scholarship."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self-serving apologia","review":"This book is really about the election of 2000, with a thinly veiled, \\"That election was controversial, but OK, and so was 2000\\" subtext. \\"(Supreme Court Justice) Joe Bradley was OK, and so I am, too.\\"Rehnquist is obviously campaigning for his place in history, just like the President (Nixon) who appointed him did for the last 20 years of his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Comedy","review":"I'm always reticent to believe the hype that surrounds a sequel (or a sort of sequel in this case) because often times, it falls short. Not so with \\"Fierce Creatures.\\" It is a pure delight. Here it is 2006-almost ten years after its release-and I'm buying it so it can be a part of my DVD collection. Why? I know I'll want to keep watching it.The acting is superb! One can't go wrong with Kevin Kline, John Cleese and Michael Palin. The deliveries are fast-paced and flawless. The whole storyline is hysterical and everything builds to a surprising climax.If you've never seen this movie-get it! It's so much more clever than the tripe that usually passes for comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hoot and a Half!","review":"This movie is fun, engaging, bright, and positive. In spite of some grave misgivings when I started to watch, I was definitely engaged with this farcical comedy. I have finally figured out why I was so taken with it--the animal actors!Part of the appreciation of a work almost always is due to the sympathy one feels for the characters. That sympathy is won primarily by assorted Lemurs, Ostriches, Roos, etc. in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD 2 stars but movie 5 stars","review":"2 stars for the DVD itself because of the small screen size at the beginning due to the titles, but it does change to full screen. I find this a bit annoying but we do get to see this great movie over and over. I give the DVD 5 stars for the story. To us it is a classic and if you can get through the beginning part without getting mad and shutting off the DVD player you will enjoy it. You need to see \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\", also a great film, to understand what John Cleese says at the end of \\"Fierce Creatures\\". At first I rated this DVD low but that isn't fair to the movie itself. I don't know why they chose to do the beginning the way they did, but most of the movie is in full screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly dreadful","review":"The only explanation for so many positive reviews here is the existence of some sort of negative universe where up is down and bad is good. The whole premise is completely lame and the execution is even worse. The usual dependable Kline is just horrible here. He's trying to revive his dumb guy role from Wanda but he's WAY over the top, almost shouting every line. Everything about this movie is forced and awkward. Cleese, while hilarious in Fawlty Towers, simply tries to use the same elements from that show here but his performance falls totally flat given the abysmal script, that apparently only he is to blame. His performance looks forced and out of place. There isn't a single funny scene or performance in this entire mess. What a waste of so much talent.Buy Fawlty Towers to see top notch writing and razor sharp acting and Cleese at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's over.","review":"A FLOP! Yes, a flop. I had to give it at least one star, only because this review page doesn't work without including the star rating. I love John Cleese, Keven Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Palin. But, this is a dismal attempt to reunite the cast of that wonderful comedy A FISH CALLED WANDA and try for more. It's not a sequal, though it may as well be, for all its worth. It's about a group of lunatics who try to create this new kind of zoo. There are a few laughable bits, but hardly worth the effort. When I heard this was coming out, I looked forward to seeing it. And, as I watched it, I really really tried to like it. But, to no avail. It's a turkey. Stick with A FISH CALLED WANDA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny","review":"Not only are there no funny moments in this movie, but there are plenty of bizzare and offensive ones. The jokes weren't all that funny back when I first heard them in 5th grade, and they aren't funny now. Flatulence, naughty words for genitalia, frantic screaming for no reason at all, and just some bad dialogue. Strangest was when a dead corpse of the father gets beat up by the son. Is this really funny? It came off to me as if it wasn't even supposed to be funny but that we, the audience were supposed to project all our hate for our fathers onto the screen.All involved with this should hide their heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film really deserves to be released in widescreen","review":"Either you love this film or you don't care for it. It alldepends depends upon your particular sense of humor. In my case, Iadore it and find it hysterically funny.My problems with this DVD have nothing to do with the film. Instead, my problems are with the transfer. This disc is one of the worst excuses for a pan and scan disc I've seen. I gave up trying to count the number of times that two characters were having a conversation but only one of them could be seen! Often, there was dialog and you didn't even know another character was even there until they spoke!Even though I adore the DVD format, for this title, buy the VHS version in widescreen instead. You'll get to enjoy the film and actually see the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\"","review":"It's not A Fish Called Wanda, and that's a good thing because it's a different movie. If it were a sequel, people would still complain as sequels are \\"never as good as the original\\". Both \\"Fish\\" and Fierce Creatures are comedies but in completely different ways. Whereas \\"Fish\\" is a more adult comedy using hilarious sexual situations and harsh language, \\"Fierce\\" has more of a Monty Python flavor of lunacy. I find Fierce Creatures the funnier of the two, but A Fish Called Wanda is the better made movie. If you're a Monty Python fan, I recommend this highly. If you're not, you need to rethink your values and hop onto the British humor bandwagon and stop filling your head with the infantile \\"gross-out\\" drivel that's so popular right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-release is still in pan and scan!!!!!!!","review":"After being out of print for a while, Fierce Creatures was finally re-released on June 1, 2010. However, Universal has ignored what the fans want! Instead of the re-release being in widescreen, it is still in pan and scan!! I give the film 5 stars because it is hilarious. I wish we could rate both the film itself, and separately, the studio releasing it. Universal gets a minus 10 stars for releasing this marvelous film in pan and scan. I am glad that I did not get rid of my laser disc of this title. At least it is in wide screen. UNIVERSAL...WAKE UP AND START USING YOUR BRAINS. FIERCE CREATURES DESERVES A WIDE SCREEN BLU RAY RELEASE."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of Robert Lindsay's talents!","review":"Not to mention Kline's, Cleese's, Palin's and Leigh-Curtis's.......but to drop Lindsay into this nothing role and abandon him is beyond forgiveness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great","review":"Don't go out of your way to see this one. 'A Fish called Wanda', while not my favorite of all time, was definitely better than this. The plot here is very simplistic: save the zoo. It could be for children except for the sexual innuendos. It was more slapstick-ish than clever, more 'cute' than funny.For a great Cleese movie check out 'Clock-wise'. I wouldn't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleese as Basil Fawlty again! The rest is ho-hum.","review":"I always enjoy John Cleese in his classic Basil Fawlty role, that's about the only part of this movie I laughed at. There's too much emphasis on the big stars, we never really get to know any of the zoo staff. It could have been much funnier. Get the Fawlty Towers videos if you really want to see some classic British humor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiercely Painful","review":"The acting of the talented John Cleese and Michael Palin cannot save this movie, which lacks even a single funny moment. The movie's premise -- pretend that tame zoo animals are fierce to attract visitors and increase profitability -- is bad enough, but the dialogue is about the worst I've ever heard. Jamie Lee Curtis can be excellent, but she is terrible here because of the abysmal script. The same sexual jokes are repeated over and over, and when Kevin Kline passes gas over and over, the viewer is reminded not of Blazing Saddles but of a moviemaker attempting to force a laugh when there is nothing to laugh about. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I love this movie. I think it is better than \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\".

The movie wasn't that bad.","review":"I'm reading some of the reviews on here, and some of them are just a little nasty. I mean, this wasn't a great movie, but it wasn't a bad one either. I loved \\"A fish called Wanda,\\" but I think the super quality of that movie set expectations a little too high for this one, which is part of what is causing these nasty comments. It's very hard to recreate something of the same caliber as \\"Wanda,\\" especially when you've got the same cast, without repeating yourself. But give it a break! This movie was funny, the acting was good, it wasn't that bad! It just wasn't as good as it's prequel. I think fans of the first movie should see this, if only to see John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline, and Michael Palin all reuinted again - and because of the fact that it was GOOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fish Called Zoo!!!","review":"This Movie Is Hilarious, Kevin Kline gives the performance of a LIFETIME!!!!

It's more accurate, and fair, to say that the band is a fusion of Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Dave Matthews, at least in varying parts of the album. Regardless, as the band's name suggests, \\"Labrador\\" is a great mix of quite a bit of musical stylings, though, I was not too impressed with \\"Rantings of a Lunatic.\\" Just not the vibe I was looking for off of the album.

It was about an old prison opening up as a haunted house. A bunch of people were watiing outside to enter. (the sound in this movie was like distint and horrible.) The people weren't really good at acting it seemed like, that was a bad part. The haunted house turned out to be really stupid, i think. There was a killer roaming around the haunted house first dressed as Jason Voorhees, than as Michael Myers. It was such a copy of Friday the 13th and Halloween. After that happened, the movie just got lamer and lamer.

The ancient history and cosmology theories were very interesting.The problem with this book however,and all the way back to Chariots of the Gods by Von Daniken, is that it always ends in the same dead end for me. Where oh where has just a little proof gone? If an advanced race, alien or terrestrial, spliced DNA to create thinking man, there should be at least some technology buried or abandoned somewhere on this Earth to validate such events. To date, I have never seen CNN reporting from a dig that uncovered an ancient launch pad or ancient biological laboratory. The book is worth reading only for food for thought. If you are looking to this type of writing as validation for your belief in ancient astronauts look elsewhere. The proof may be out there... but it is not in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and informative book","review":"Alien theories aside, this book contains a lot of amazing facts about ancient Sumerian culture.

While this book did entertain a different perspective, Sitchin made the mistake of presenting his preposterous theory as though it were already proven fact. His \\"evidence\\" appeared one-sided, as though it could not mean anything else. It was apparent that he manipulated texts to support his idea. At first, I found this book entertaining, something to laugh at when I was bored. After a while, however, it just became overbearingly insulting.

Mr Sitchin is very convincing and no wonder-all he has to do is repeat the ancient writings. Mainstream scholars have been ignoring the evidence for years but its all there, you just have to know where to look. I never bought into Darvin's Theory of evolution because it has more holes than a fishing net and most of it doesn't make sense, and if it doesn't make sense, itn't true.

I travelled the Old Silk Road in search of ancient manuscripts, never knowing where the search would lead.From ancient documents in Tibetan monastaries, to Hindu concepts of the Garden of Eden and Shangri-La, there was much in Asia that corroborated Sitchen's translations and interpretations in the Middle East and Suneria. In India there are even directions for building and fueling personal vimanas (flying machines)written down five thousand years ago.This gives Sitchen's theories and conclusions a lot of corroboration even he didn't expect.

After 10 years of intense research, I decided to see exactly who everyone was warned to be, \\"beware of\\". I was really surprised to find Dr. Sitchins work isn\`t filled with the contradictons that fill the Scriptures of modern day Christadom.

It is a very interesting historical account of the ancient Sumerian writings, their hisory and religion, and how they started their civilization on Earth. Almost all of the old world teachings from ALL the old religions point to the same thing- that we came here from the stars. The Sumerians were no different, and this exciting account opens up the possibility of the \\"Ancient Alien\\" theory- that we did indeed come here from outer space, and aliens have been visiting this planet for a very long time.

At times, it can be difficult to press through it due to the intensive scientific approach to data collection. However, the conclusions (that can be drawn directly and are not needed to be spoon fed by Sitchin) are stunning. Worth every minute of your time.This is not some guru new age dogma.

I don't believe a reach into the scientific through biblical and ancient texts is as convincing as Sitchin would want us to believe.

Read up on his credentials. I've read all of his books and this is the best!If you read this excellent book and the others, you will know that they are indeed true.

His ideas reflect the need most Eastern Europeans and Asians have, in my opinion, to attribute greatness to ancestors who may or may not merit such attention.Nevertheless, Sitchin does exhibit brilliance in lateral thinking. He takes information and evidence available and re-interprets it in ways never before considered. His interpretations give us a starting point from which to launch questions against the established dogma of history.History is the target of this book, of that there is no doubt. Sitchin's contention that all history is skewed not just toward the victors but out of time altogether is a marvelous example of a mind ready to change. If you need help finding out why things don't seem quite right when reading about ancient history, this book will prove an invaluable resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignorance isn't bliss!!","review":"I can't understand why people put some much negative engery into someone else's work such as a legend as Dr. Sitchin.

This new biography of Harkness draws heavily from the 1938 book -- I got it on interlibrary loan & read it too. It was worth reading both accounts.Just a personal notion: I believe young people need books that not only encourage them to dream, but to dream big. Ruth Harkness had no qualifications, educational, physical or otherwise, whatsoever for this adventure; she simply embraced the dream of her husband who died early in this adventure &, having embraced it, made it come true.I once heard that parents' jobs are to give their children two things, first roots, then wings.

She loved it, and gave it back to me to read. I let it lie for a couple of months, then picked it up one day and started reading -- and, to my surprise, could hardly put it down! What Ruth Harkness accomplished was amazing, given her background and the difficult times (1930s). I learned a lot about China of the times and did not realize the extent of its war with Japan in those years. With that backdrop, it was nothing short of a miracle that Harkness was able to bring even one panda from China to the U.S., much less two. The hardships she endured along the way made me truly wonder why she put up with them when she could have had a much \\"cushier\\" life staying home in New York City. The author has woven a truly fascinating tale -- all the more amazing that it all really happened. I believe anyone would find this a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved the book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was very interesting to read all about the exoctic locations.

Ruth Harkness was a vile, unprincipled woman of privilege who lied, drank, and fornicated her way into history by returning the first captured panda to the United States--after cutting a deal involving the shooting of other pandas--then spent months trying to sell it to the highest bidder. As soon as she did, she returned to China to wreak more death and mistreatment upon the species.Most of the reviewers here must have skipped over the scenes where these woeful victims are abused, mistreated, and left to die by Harkness when another, more promising animal comes along. Actually, this is not surprising, because no animal lover could finish this ghastly book, which is very poorly written into the bargain.

He must have had one heck of an editor then, and he sure didn't have one for this book. Disorganized in the extreme, the prose can vary from scientific jargon to conspiracy theory to personal snarky-ness within a single paragraph.You have a subject that should be inherently interesting -- the destruction of the state of California -- the true \\"Big One\\" that would make Katrina and New Orleans look puny by comparison. But work your way through chapter one, and you'll see why I found this one remaindered for 49 cents at Final Markdown!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Important Work","review":"This is an important work; well researched and well written. It should be required reading for all public officials in California. More illustrations would have been useful. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid effort from Anne Curry, Agincourt explained","review":"This book is evidently the product of extensive and painstaking research over what must have been a very long time. I, like many others, know about Agincourt mainly from Henry V as portrayed by Shakespeare. Anne Curry has been to extraordinary lengths to get right into the detail of events and extrapolate from the available information quite a different story. Fascinating insight into the period. Sometimes a little heavy eyelidded to keep going through some of the details but on the whole an intriguing read and well worth the effort. If accurate history is what you are looking for, told with authority, then this is a 'must have' book. Anne Curry I salute you, the hours that went into this and the efforts you have gone to are obvious, well done. Loved it, thankyou."},{"rating":"1","title":"A scholarly study - not for the casual reader","review":"Although the book could be praised for its excrutiatingly thorough detail, I was personally disappointed. The book is more suited to a \\"credit class\\" scholarly group than the casual reader, such as I, searching simply for an entertaining understanding of the event. Despite the fact that the author includes minute detail such as pay records, important illustrations such as maps relating to the campaign and battles are not included in the text at point of discussion and lack clarity when found in the Appendix. Adding to my personal confusion was the omission of a glossary defining a multitude of terms which would be familiar only to those with a background in medieval warfare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morale For The French?","review":"Juliet Barker an equally if not more eminent historian along with the vast majority of international historians specialising in the 100 Year War make mincemeat of Dr Curry's research regarding the numbers of French troops at the battle.

Of course, this is Chick's album and he also contributed several songs, including the very nice \\"Hattie\\" and a pair of straight-ahead blues cuts \\"Spring Time\\" and \\"Hurt Me So\\". The majority of the disc leans more towards Southern Soul, with tracks like \\"Sweet Woman/Sweet Man\\" (a duet with Rawls daughter Destiny) \\"Keep on Singing the Blues\\", \\"Won't Give Up\\" and \\"Got to Find a Cure\\" sticking in the down-home soul vein. Despite the leaning towards soul and the lack of any raunchy tracks, this ranks as one of Chicks finest albums and any of his fans who don't have it yet should get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works as a great novelty to show off to friends but quality is horrible","review":"At first this thing worked great it took the bottle cap off every time.

The innards are still made rather cheaply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic, there are better versions","review":"I know someone who owns a similar device so I wanted to get one for my mother.

Well, there is about 1/16\\" play where the bars enter the mount attached to the wall so they WILL fall out. Using the template and level each time it fails, not enough of the bar enters the mount.

Their flexibility combined with their position at the top of the hand do nothing to prevent wrist movement. Because of the large pouch of pellets in the palm of the hand, much too large for a small hand, I found myself twisting my wrist into a weird position simply to reach the buttons on my mouse.

When I got home from work I found the bowl and ring on the floor and the dog had managed to swallow the wing nut. I think these bowls would work a lot better if the pieces that grip the cage had some sort of texture to allow them to grip the cage, instead it's just two smooth pieces of metal.

The tip of the nose snapped off forward of the insertion hole for the metal peg of the 747 after about a week of trying to rig this thing together with a rubber band. The band wasn't even put on there tightly, just enough to keep the pieces joined. So now the shuttle wont stay on at all because the peg has no where to grip into.Oh, well.

The slides tip over when the kids are on it, they cannon slide down feet first or they will tip over. It'd be a fine wading pool, but the slides take most of the room and the price really makes it stink. Also, there are like 14 different sections to put air in, making it cumbersome to fill and put away to store. overall, a 10 dollar wading pull would be more fun for the kids. The slides are a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not practically fun","review":"My kids talked me into this pool. The slides are more dangerous than fun and require constant adult intervention. Kids will quickly want to go head first and will hit their heads on the bottom on such a shallow pool. Even when you tie the slides down they fall over, even with toddler sized kids climbing on them. The drain valve ripped off on our second day of use. It's a great deal smaller than in the picture . . dimensions stated related to the slides, not to the pools. Any two foot deep inflatable pool is way better, especially if the bottom inflates for cushioning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be deceived by the pics","review":"Just like Dan said, the pictures on the box make it look a lot cooler than it is. (Photoshop works wonders, doesn't it!) When we got the thing inflated, with slides and water in it, there was hardly any room for my kids! Despite tying the slides down, they still constantly floated and flipped around (because they're full of air). Despite spending $30 for the pool, I was happy that the racoons got to it on the second night we had it. What a waste of money. Our next pool will be a larger hard plastic pool with a slide."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was lied too.","review":"This pool is a rediculous example of false advertising. Looking at the tale or stairs into the pool you will note triangles that indicate the number of steps. In reality their is one step. The child sliding out of the pool appears to have perhaps 2 or 3 feet to descend this is not so. My five year old can sit at the top of the slide and have about 6 inchesbefor her feet touch the ground. The feet appear to be pillow size. They are in fact no larger than a football. The two children in the pool would be touching knees in reality. The box tells you that you cannot return this product to the store. Tonight I will call the company and demand either the pool I bought or a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"very small and unsafe","review":"I purchased this product because I loved the 2 slides - one going into the pool and one going out. My 2 year old cannot fit in the pool with both slides in place. Not only that - the slides must be tied to the pool and the strings that they give you are way too small so I had to use shoe laces. Even when the slide is tied in place it rises once the water is filled in the pool. It is very unstable - even my six year old cannot use the slide without falling."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have GOT to be kidding me.","review":"Ok, I got this yesterday for my son.Got it home, took forever to pump up all of the compartments, and only when we got both slides done, we were saying \\"where's the hose attachment?\\" On the front, you see a kid sliding down one slide with water flowing down. On the back it states \\"easily attaches to any hose\\" or something along that idea.Well...No hose, no flowing water, and a truly irritating assembly overall.It went back before any water ever went in. Thankfully ToysRUs took it back without any issue.A very bad product and extremely bad advertising.

For example, he tells mothers that they need to get out of the house and leave the baby with a sitter in the first 10 days. It's important, he says, that the baby learn that mom won't always be there. A baby needs to learn that at 10 days!? Shouldn't they learn at that point that mom WILL be there, so they feel secure and loved? He also calls babies hedonistic manipulators, saying if you pick them up whenever they fuss, they'll just learn to fuss. I believe in listening to the baby's cries and realizing they cry for a reason. Infants don't have the ability to manipulate. I didn't finish the book because after these tidbits, I didn't trust any other advice he had to offer. Glad I got it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much bad advice outweighs the good advice","review":"You'll be much better off with The Baby Book by Sears and Sears.This book has some dangerous advice about breastfeeding that goes against the AAP's new guidelines.

Buy that book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Never read a \\"first time moms\\" book written by a man..","review":"I should have known not to read a book about First Time Moms written by a man - psychologist or not. He has a very strong viewpoint on moms not working Full Time outside of the home. If you are a mom who chooses to do so, reading this book(and that chapter in particular) may cause you to feel like you aren't making enough 'sacrifices' as he puts it, for your child. He is very anti-daycare and seems to lump all daycares into one group. I really, really disliked this book. Save yourself the time and read the Girlfriend's Guide instead of this man's old fashioned viewpoints that just don't work with today's families. Being a good parent is more than being home during the day to \\"make lunches for your child\\" or 'bandage their knee\\" in my opinion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Working mothers BEWARE!","review":"I bought this book after a friend recommended it to me. I have to say that I'm sorry that I did. The book advises first time parents that at least one parent should stay home full time. For a second it actually made me to start to feel guilty for wanting to work outside the home....for only a second though. It also goes on to say that the family should sacrafice and live on one income. I personally feel that my husband and I are setting a good example for our children since both of us are working and contributing equally to the household. After reading Lehman's opinion on this, I decided there was no need to continue reading.....don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First-time Mom","review":"I was amazed at Dr. Leman's practical advice and took every bit to heart.

It was great for putting things in perspective so your priorities are straight as a new mom and to reassure new moms. Of course I agree with mom staying at home as long as possible, living off one income, etc and many of his beliefs so it was right up my alley. If you and your husband don't have the same beliefs as him you will have issues with this book. I liked his emphasis on bonding, dad's role, family time, discipline, and early parenting practices that help you raise your child to be an adult you are proud of. There was so much I had never thought of or knew would happen as a new mom. Great advice, techniques and information. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good hat","review":"When I received the hat it had left the factory with a damaged head band.

If you are more interested in overall racing engineering, then I feel it isn't. The level of detail seemed excessive and specific. There are chapters on choosing a trailer, and tow vehicle.

When brand new, they seem to do the job, but after a few months they just seem to give up. Even with a fresh battery, it seems like the motion sensor stops functioning. And I live in a very mild climate with little rain, so I can't blame the weather. In general, the CatStop feels light and flimsy for the price, rather than a solid piece of engineering. So if you decide to use this approach to keep cats off your lawn, budget on replacing at least twice a year - plus a string of replacement 9v batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk - fills up with water","review":"When they are brand new they seem to work.

On the plus side, she, her husband and vet daughter trap the cats, get them fixed and dewormed. In some cases, they get new homes. In others, they're released to the suburban wild.With high hopes, I placed this device facing an 8 foot wide corridor where I often see cats crossing my lawn. It trips when my 50 lb dog or I walk past. Last night I watched a cat slink past about 6 feet in front and, to my disbelief, it didn't go off! I adjusted the aim of the motion sensor to better cover the lower airspace that felines occupy and will keep an eye on it.

After that, the cats would poop right next to it, in front of it, behind it, they had absolutely no respect for it at all. Also, the thing eats up batteries like crazy.

I had tried several other products like repellent powders from the hardware store and didn't have any success. I wasn't expecting the CatStop to work, but it really seems to keep the cats away. After six months of success, I purchased three more. Only reason I didn't rate this five stars is that it takes a few of these devices to really keep the cats out of the yard, and the battery needs to be replaced about every 4-8 weeks depending on how much activity (people using walkways, etc.) there is around the device. It's an expensive solution, but it's nice to not have to clean up after other people's pets anymore. I think the birds and lizards in our yard appreciate it too. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"We bought this to deter our cats from jumping on our neighbor's car.

When it does a light will come on indicating it is working. On one the light never came on even when I walked with in two feet of it. On the other the light came on only when I got within about 4 to 5 feet of it. I watched the feral cats walk right past the one with the working light and they did not even notice it.

So I considered that part of the cost when operating it. However, I continually watched cats walk by it less than twenty feet away and it never did light up. When it would light up I could tell it was making noise if I was close enough to it. Unfortunately, even when it was doing its thing, the cats didn't seem to mind, and went right on pooping in my kids yard.Finally, when I went to install an external power supply rated at 9V dc with appropriately polarized connector, it stopped working entirely.

The first 9V battery we put in it lasted about 6 weeks. Then again, it may have just been that particular brand of battery.

I can hear it if I hold it at ear level (in case you can't hear it, a red light turns on whenever it's triggered so you'll know when it's time to change the battery), but since it is such a high frequency it is very directional. When you stake it into the ground it's just about the height of the cats' ears. We first put it in front of the garage and the cats stayed away. Then we moved it to keep them away from the front door. So far so good.

She can't play for beans although he gave up her performance career and opened a harp store before anyone realized this. Players like Grainne Hambley, Michael Rooney, etc have proved this well.Buy Janet Harbison's book if you want to learn Irish harp, go buy a pedal harp tutor if you want to do that- but don't but this book.

The songs have none of the energy of the older Suede albums, while the musicians seem to play in their sleep.Suede seems to be playing along with the \\"Britpop is Dead\\" idea, unfortunatly, their talent seems to have gone to the grave with it. It is noisy, long, and very insubstantial.A crushing disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Head Music - Another Greatest Hits CD - Excellent","review":"Every title on this CD sounds like a greatest hits package from the exquisite ballads (Down, He's Gone, Everything will Flow) to the power pop of Electricity, Can't Get Enough, and She's in Fashion. The CD has a fresh and glamorous feel to it and is a must have for anyone into good pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly, suede died with this album","review":"i'm so sad... \\"elephant man\\" made me cringe... and the line \\"give me head, give me head, give me head music instead\\" ??? they arent serious are they?suppose bernard coming back is out of the question, I still have the previous albums, get dog man star or sci-fi please.... this album is a sad shell of a once great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love This Album!","review":"I Never got any Suede before get this one,all I heard from them is \\"Beautiful Ones\\"and two song from this album,She's In Fashion and Everything Will Flow,I'm sure I'll love this album after hear those two songs!This album is like a Beautiful Lady that make your heart beating,It's a psychedelic that influence your mind!It's Addicted like Pu**y [hahaha! I know it's obscene]I'm sure it's one of the best album you can get!My Favorite Songs are Savoir Faire, Everything Will Flow, She's In Fashion, Asbestos, Indian Strings!Suede is not only my favorite band from UK,it's also my favorite thing from UK!Get it today!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Without Bernard","review":"Whatever attracted me to Suede's debut album and its brilliant followup, \\"Dog Man Star\\", is conspicuously absent in \\"Head Music\\", which strikes me as shallow electronica. Even \\"Coming Up\\" still retained some of the inspiration of its predecessors, thought it was completed by Bernard's replacement.Suede was my all-time favorite band. I stopped listening after this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get This One Some Time, You Won't Be Dissapointed","review":"Now, I do admit, when I first played this cd, I couldn't distingsh any song from the other, I mean, they all sounded the same. So at first I was a bit dissapointed. Then I decided to give the albulm one last shot, and listed to it all the way through. By the time I was done, I wanted to play it again. Although very different then there pervious albulms, this is still a very good cd if you're a fan of Suede. I wouldn't recommend this as your first suede cd, but one your realize you enjoy Suede, pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the year's best","review":"This is a wonderful album: it's well-produced, sexy and certainly Suede's most fully-realized effort so far. It's a bit too long but so was Dog Man Star. Perfect getting-ready-to-go out music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get zapped. Buy this CD.","review":"I have recently discovered The London Suede, and have quickly snatched up their entire body of work. Head Music has got much of the old swagger we love from TLS, but it also has some new guitar effects and pulsing rhythms. And of course, melodies that get you humming along pretty quickly.Pure pop, but extremely interesting pop you should try out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suede announce \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!\\"","review":"As a Suede fan, i must admit, I think that Coming Up was their best album (all you Dog Man Star fans please forgive me) This new album is not a dramatic step forward, but the songs are a little more 'difficult'. Electricity gets the album rocking and keeps on going. Shes in Fashion is beautiful as is Asbestos. I don't think the album is as congruent as Coming UP, but it's definitely an album from a band who just want to have fun with their music. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many Great Tracks!","review":"Head Music has often been regarded is Suede's weakest album; I won't go into that discussion, but simple note that the album contains some of my favourite songs by the band.I was fortunate to see them last summer in Denmark shortly before their split was announced. They played several songs from Head Music, and I particularly enjoyed \\"She's in Fashion\\", \\"Asbestos\\" and \\"Down\\".Other great tracks are \\"Everything Will Flow\\" and \\"He's Gone\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant britpop.","review":"Beside Oasis and Blur, The London Suede is one of the most popular britband.In this album,fill up with soft but modern lyrics & melodies.More electronica and cool.Recommended songs: Electricity,Everything will flow,She's in fashion ,Hi-fi and He's gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Surprising\\" New Release by the Suede Boys","review":"What do you do if your previous CD had 5 top ten UK hits? Well how about change producers, simplify your lyrics and music, and limit the output of the song-writing team that wrote 4 of those 5 top ten UK hits. No one would do that, right? Suede is the exception. \\"Head Music\\" has, like always, the strong yet effeminate vocal delivery of Brett Anderson. However, he alone has written the majority of tunes on this release. The album's consistency suffers because of that. Anderson is a very good writer, especially lyrics, but musically he is not as consistent. Richard Oakes, the very talented young guitarist/writer, is seemingly held back by contributing to only co-writing three of the 13 cuts on the album. Now, I can understand if the band wants to do something a bit different but to lessen the quality of the work is disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best album ever.","review":"I had great expectantions for this cd, but what a dissapointment it was. Only 2 decent traks on it (electriclty and shes in fashion) and a whole clollection of other tripe. not very impressed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof that Butler made them the best?","review":"Suede have gone on a slow downhill fall since Butler left. \\"Coming Up\\" was a good listen and well worth your time. \\"Head Music\\" however is a disaster. All the lyrics are the same \\"Shesss sooo\\" Suede formula and the ones that aren't are just pure rubbish. \\"Elephant Man\\" is just an insult. The music sounds like a bad video game's soundtrack. \\"Electricity\\" is the only good song on this album and that's not saying much. Brett Anderson needs to write something a bit more memorable or they've lost my respect. If you're new to Suede and reading this, stay away from this album and go get their self-titled and \\"Dog Man Star\\". Even \\"Coming Up\\", anything but this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Electricity\\" - the Best Song David Bowie Never Wrote","review":"The opening song \\"Electricity\\" is one of their very best. It's like a total freefall into the Velvet Goldmine Era of echo-y Glam vocals layered over Fuzz guitar.As for the rest of the album...not so memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all.","review":"I can't understand how so many people grant this four or five stars, unless they're friends of the band or work for the record company. The only interesting song is Electricty, the rest is dreadfully dull. If it wasn't for track one, the aforementioned Electricty, I'd never listen to this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe This Is A Suede Record - Simply Dreadful!","review":"Like some of the other reviewers here, I too loved Suede first few outings. I even loved Coming Up. Head Music is neither thoughful or ironic, it's not even catchy. It's dull, dull, dull record, with little heart and absolutely no feeling. it only gets a 2 because of past history. Think of it more as a 1.7.It makes me so mad that they released this garbage. That may sound a bit harsh, but when you consider the work before this and what they could be doing, well...you get the nausea.The B-Sides double disc is a far better use of your Suede money. Now, let's all keep our fingers crossed on what in my opinion will be the tell tale record for them this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed, but not surprised","review":"after coming up, it was clear the direction the band was taking. Empty pop hooks, and throw-away lyrics. Head Music just takes this one step further with better production. Where is the edge that made suede one of the most promising bands of the early nineties? No wonder this album seems to be liked by Americans more than anyone in Europe, Americans are accostomed to dime a dozen bland rock and roll bands. This American won't be fooled. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go get it!","review":"The arrangements are simply great. And Brett Anderson's voice is mesmerizing, just listen to \\"Everything will flow\\" and u'll know what i mean. And the songs are super-catchy too. Just, buy it, okay?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty disappointment","review":"I eagerly purchased this followup to the tremendous \\"Coming Up\\", expecting to be blown away by what surely was to be the next step in this band's evolution. Well, it's a step alright. Backwards. Listening to \\"Head Music\\" makes one feel the way one felt when putting Queen's \\"Hot Space\\" on for the first time. You heard of a new direction of the band, and were horrified when you found out what it was. This empty collection of electronic noise, supplemented by obtuse lyrics about what else- the London club scene(wow, still on that tack, Brett?) is pointless and fatiguing. It's too bad because Suede is/was a good band. I don't know what they were thinking here, but I hear the recording engineer died of boredom during mixing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I'm sorry, but this is awful. I loved the first two albums, and liked Coming Up, but this album NO! Apart from the odd good song, most are simplified awful and embarrasing tunes. Elephant Man is one of the worst songs I've ever heard. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"suede and their influences","review":"what a completely boring album by suede. why has this band who once achieved SOMETHING musically produced such a tragic record? it appears they stopped listening to all other bands and decided to listen only to their own records for an influence specifically coming up. gone is the baroch bowie loveyness and we have an album of boring songs with the following key words featured in most of them 1. car parks 2. trainers (shoes) 3. council estate....... its rubbish!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A few songs worth it (unless you're Suede fan)","review":"Nothing to say about this dissapointing Suede album. Butler is one of the gratest musicians of the last decade, and Brett is a real poet (and a extraordinary singer). That combination was perfect. This album fades more and more as a whole with every listening. The survivors?: \\"Everything will flow\\", \\"He's gone\\" and \\"She's in fashion\\". \\"Low\\" is a pretty song, but don't qualifies to a \\"canonical songs\\" Suede list. Try \\"Comming Up\\" instead and buy the 'Everything will flow single'."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ BELOW! ! !","review":"After all the bad review's here I finally bought this CD cause I got all the others. And I have to say it's a very good album which deserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"You trashed it? You didn't get it.","review":"As a die-hard Suede fan, I have to simply say that those of you who disliked this album didn't get the full effect.Every band has phases they go through. Live comes to mind - the differences between Throwing Copper and Secret Samadhi. Throwing Copper sold god knows how many copies, and Secret Samadhi did really well as well, but SS is constantly compared to TC.This album is EXCELLENT if listened to thinking of it as just that - an album. If you compare it to other Suede works and try to find the better one, you're screwed already. Listen to it as an album, and don't compare it to anything.In my opinion, this is an absolute MUST for anybody's CD collection, no matter what the genre musical taste is."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This is pretty average stuff. Lot's of retreads of melodies and riffs that were pretty lame the first time. I've been listening to the far superior Coming Up and pretending it's their new release. I suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suede's second great album","review":"Since Suede released their debut back in 1993 Britpop has been and gone, and they've lost one of the greatest guitarists of their generation, Bernard Butler. 1996's 'Coming Up' bristled with killer pop melodies, but it was a little too one dimensional for this fan. What I longed for was the magestic swagger of 'Dog Man Star'. And here it is. Although a lot more electronic than that great album, 'Head Music' is a down affair, full of beaufiful ballads like 'He's gone' and 'Indian Strings', all of which allude to tragedy and loss. Sure, Suede's tradmark glam-pop is still there, in single 'Electricity' (the most 'Coming Up' like of the songs here) as well as 'Can't get Enough', but it's the emotional depth of the album which is really affecting. A fantastic return from one of the greatest bands of the 1990's, and once which is sure to propel them with confidence into the new millenium. Essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Little information","review":"We are a SolidWorks and Pro/E engineering heavy equipment company located in Ohio. I have a strong Pro/E background with a Mechanical Engineering degree, and I am trying to learn SolidWorks. SolidWorks seems like a great design tool for many applications.I picked up a used copy of this book, \\"Introducation to Solid Modeling Using SolidWorks\\". I was very disappointed in the lack of functional information in the areas of: general features, creating Drawings, implementing Mates and Relations and generating Assemblies. The book is poorly written and I would not recommend it to anyone, at any level looking to learn SolidWorks.

The timeline of the book follows the same as the life of Aurora, an ethereal spirit who was discovered as a baby floating on an ice slab in middle of the Atlantic ocean, her birthplace and story up until that point a mystery to all. From that point on, we come to know her, the members of her complex but very human family, and ultimately, to feel a part of the family and land. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Moon and You","review":"This is a wonderful introduction to the night sky and indeed to astronomy in general.

It's a clear explanation for all ages and is wonderfully illustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic, but very effectively powerful...","review":"This book shows at a very basic, yet very profound level how important and powerful the deep mind is to success. Yet it isn't preachy. It just shows in a detached, yet passionate way, how to use your deep mind to do anything you want and achieve any goal you want to achieve by orienting your psyche towards it at a very deep level. The real honest truth that works always comes down to the lowest common denominator that is the simple \\"it\\". Yes, this book is that, most definitely.Captain Josh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the title of the book","review":"The title in big font says \\"Embedded Internet Devices\\" but in small font says \\"Using the TINI Microcontroller\\". Though it is a good intro to network basics and using a specific internet-ready TINI board to create a HTTP based system, it is not enough for someone who would like to use other devices or other protocols (like telnet and FTP).Great intro to CAN networking, Java communications classes, 1-wire comm, and I2C bus. But I have to give it low stars due to mis-leading title of the book.In short, this is the second Newnes book I've been somewhat disappointed with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bee Tee Double U","review":"If you're thinking about buying this, then you probably should.

Joss Whedon (Buffy, Firefly/Serenity) turns in another great story/concept.Originally a three-part web production, the DVD combines the episodes into one movie and includes a commentary and a bunch of extras.The acting is great, the music is catchy, and I guarantee you'll be singing \\"Bad Horse, Bad Horse... \\" the rest of the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"DHSAB = Timeless Delight DVD = Pretty Nifty","review":"While I think the actual production of DHSAB is fabulous and contains all the wonderful bits of good comedy and tragedy along with the bon mots and sweetness that is Joss Whedon and everyone alive should watch and enjoy this production, I have to knock a few points on the DVD.There are no subtitles for the Commentary! musical which makes it impossible to understand some parts with no lips to watch, let alone deaf peeps. You can't flip to a single ELE application and the menu flipping is a bit sticky (a common Joss Whedon DVD issue). The Commentary! won't give you much new material if you know all the stories already (and will be funnier if you do), but is still worth a few hearty laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Display of BRILLANCE","review":"I understand this was created during a writer's strike, and it shows; this is as out-of-the-box thinking as I've ever seen, coupled with great overall quality.

Humor somewhat like \\"The Princess Bride\\"--as performed by Doogie Howser and the cast of Firefly?

However, watching the disc again tonight, I noticed that the Left and Right audio channels seem to be reversed. For example, when Penny and Captain Hammer are singing together in \\"A Man's Gotta Do\\", Penny is in the rightmost part of the shot, yet her voice is coming from the Left channel! The same thing at the end of \\"My Eyes\\" - Billy is on the left side of the screen and Penny on the right, but Billy's voice is on the Right channel and Penny's on the Left. I've tried it on several DVD players, and get the same results. Are all the discs like this, or did I just get a wierd copy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"My husband and I loved this video. I'd heard about it on the internet, but not seen it, then I saw it was released on video. Had to have it based on other's reviews!If you like Joss Whedon, you'll love this fun, campy, musical. The story is cute-the \\"good\\" guy gets his in a satisfying way, and the end is a cool twist.I didn't know Neil Patrick Harris could sing, this was a nice surprise. Nathan Fillion is always good entertainment. And Felicia Day was a lovely addition, making an all-around good show."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Obsession","review":"It's not for everyone, I'll give you that. But the simple fact that you've looked far enough into this movie to start reading reviews suggests you're going to like it. Neil Patrick Harris is a brilliantly convincing evil scientist/loser ala Phineas and Ferb's Dr. Doofensmirtz with a better singing voice. Nathan Fillion makes a brilliantly self-absorbed hero. Not every joke is a winner, but the thing is funny. And I've purchased the soundtrack and listened to it nonstop for days. The lyrics may be a little on-the-nose, but they're funny and musical and catchy, particularly the doctor's songs.If you like quirky sci-fi and/or superhero movies and you like musicals at all (if you can name three you'd watch again by choice), then get this. You'll like it. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!","review":"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is the greatest thing of my life. Its hilarious and so much fun! I encourage you all to purchase it. It could possibly alter your life forever.... in a good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"Why buy the dvd when you can see Dr. Horrible online for free??? Two words: Commentary! the Musical! ALSO, the outtakes are AMAZING along with the video submissions to join tghe Evil League of Evil. Also, if you don't buy this dvd, you might one day randomly die a violent and horrible death. True story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Horible is wonderful!","review":"Joss Whedon does it again (and I imagine he knows it and had already complimented himself immensely)with Dr. Horrible's Singalong Blog. Neil Patrick Harris is awesome, and a very good singer, and Nathan Fillion is also surprisingly good. Having never heard him sing, I was skeptical, but he proved that he's not only a talented (and gorgeous) actor, but can carry a tune. Too bad the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Musical didn't have him in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is so awesome! I love the songs and the characters. The story appear simple but you can justsense a depth behind it. And the commentaries are really funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Horrible---not horrible, actually it's amazing!!","review":"Dr. Horrible's sing-a-long blog is hilarious! Any fan of Neil Patrick Harris or Joss Whedon needs to get their hands on this immediately. The DVD is both extremely reasonably priced and totally worth paying for, there are several special features (including \\"Commentary, the musical!\\" and many featurettes). Fantastic cast, crew, writers, and such fun to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny","review":"Like many other people, I saw this for free when they released it online. However, after watching it I immediately went and bought it, because they deserve my money for making such a great movie. The movie alone was worth the money, so the awesome musical commentary was just a bonus for me. One thing to note though: this dvd is a burned disc with a label on it.Seriously, if you look closely, you can see that it says \\"Verbatim 8x dvd-r\\" under the label, and it has the same purple bottom as most burnable dvd-r's, instead of the usual silver bottom of pressed discs. I personally didn't care, but I figured this might be something potential buyers may want to know. It's still worth every penny, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying, even if you bought it on iTunes already","review":"Fabulous bit of work, and this DVD is worth the asking price just for \\"Commentary! The musical.\\" It doubles the awesomeness of Dr. Horrible all by itself, and the spoken commentary is nice too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff!","review":"A musical about a supervillian's rise (sinking?) to infamy? Yes! If you are a fan of comics or just enjoy a good song about freeze rays, this is the movie for you. Viewed this movie online originally and had to have a copy just for the Musical Commentary. Loved the applications to the Evil League of Evil. I want a T-shirt that says \\"Dude, you are not my nemesis.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastically off-beat","review":"Dr. Horrible (he's got a PhD... in horrible!) is a super villain. Maybe not the best, maybe not quite at Bad Horse standards, but a super villain just the same. He is also a sensitive man with a crush on the girl at the laundr-o-mat. Cpt Hammer, on the other hand, is ten-times the size of a normal man (his ego is, anyway).This movie is well worth the money. As is the soundtrack, but you should go the movie route first, if you haven't seen it before (the sountrack and movie are about the same price). It is amusing, and full of catchy tunes. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll have the songs stuck in your head for days at a time.I'm very happy to finally own this fantastic creative work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Musical/Comedy/Drama of 2008","review":"Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog follows the adventures of the title character as he attempts to go from a second rate Mad Scientist to the top tier of villainy. The story, told from the villian's viewpoint, is inspired. The dialog is tight. The humor strikes just the right balance between campy and silly. You will catch yourself spontaneously singing the songs for weeks afterward. Writer/director/producer Joss Whedon at his best. Neil Patrick Harris, Nathan Fillion and Felicia Day all give top performances.The commentary track is a separate musical in its own right. Even if you have never bothered with a commentary track before, you don't want to miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd call it Sophomoric ....","review":"Except even my High School sophomore son didn't like it. The surreal isn't surreal enough, every plot turn is predictable, and the songs are not very interesting. Could have been so much funnier. We're huge fans of Firefly and Serenity, so perhaps our expectations were too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Horrible...","review":"...but I don't recommend it either. The first episode, for me, I could have almost completely done without. Only at the very end of that episode did anything seem to click. The 2nd and 3rd were better but I didn't like the way it ended. All-in-all...just not all that funny, though it has its moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD-R","review":"I regret purchasing this DVD because mine was printed on a low quality media, DVD-R.

I guess that is what you get for being a fan boy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned DVD Read Error","review":"I haven't been able to watch the movie yet. It arrived, surprisingly as a \\"home-burned\\" (purple read surface) DVD disc. The disc also had a scratch on it out of the box, but I don't know if it won't load or play because of the scratch, or the \\"burned\\" nature of the disc. The \\"home-made\\" burned style disc is disappointing. There are places that REPLICATE DVDs in the same method as movies at the store. I have used these services and they cost about $1-2 a disc in quantities over 1000. Replicated (silver, \\"store-type\\") DVDs have the highest compatibility.Amazon does have the DVD-R note at the bottom of the product description. I received it as a gift, and am requesting a replacement through Amazon. Amazon made it easy to print a return mailing label.I look forward to seeing the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a \\"fan\\" of musicals, but I'm a fan of this one! Original; very funny!!!","review":"I was not a Doogie Howser fan, and not a fan of musicals...

You MUST watch this internet phenomenon turned musical DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So good!","review":"There's nothing negative I can say about Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.

A must-own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let wanting more.","review":"From what little I had heard I was not expecting much but since it was a Joss Whedon project I knew I had to give it a shot. Now I'm glad I did. By the end I was saying \\"it can not be over\\"! I was amazed how fast I was drawn in. If you liked the Buffy musical episode then just click buy now. You will not be disappointed. If you thought it was the worst of the series then you might want to rent it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I Expected","review":"Joss never disappoints.If you have already seen it you'll want to pick up the DVD for the extras.If you haven't seen it what are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Web Series!!!","review":"Great bonus features showing behind the scenes music recording and filming! Neil Patrick Harris, Felicia Day and Nathan Fillion all did amazing jobs. Who know they could all sing so well. Recommended to people of all ages! Joss Whedon and the rest of the writers are geniuses. I only wish it was a full feature instead of 42 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goofy Greatness","review":"A low budget film that makes you feel guilty about how much you enjoy it.

My only complaint is I wish it had been longer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr Horrible's Sing Along Blog","review":"This is made of awesome!

But loving Firefly/Serenity (Joss Whedon and Nathan Fillion) made buying this a no-brainer. Just watched it for the 3rd time. Brilliant, hilarious. And I think the Singing Commentary is maybe even better than the main show? And by the way, my 13 year old son loves it as well.Cast is excellent. Never realized how talented Neil Patrick Harris is (long way from Doogie Howser).Going to buy several copies to give to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters! Excellent Music!","review":"The characters are great, the music is even better and the story is a lot of fun. This started out as webisodes, but I'm so glad they made it available on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"So worth the measly asking price","review":"Joss' review was spot on. We should all be buying this DVD every day forever. Commentary! has quite a few good tunes on it and the regular commentary track was also very enjoyable. I keep getting impressed at the sound quality of the music. They were all recorded at Whedon's home studio. Must be some home studio!Really nothing I can add to what has already been said of the Dr H movie (movette? It is rather short for a movie). It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Awesome","review":"This is quite possibly one of the best written movies I have ever seen. The character development is fantastic, the plot is amazing, keeping in mind that it was made as a webisode during the writers strike and all the actors and actresses were non-paid volunteers. The music is great NPH had a wonderful voice! If your not sure about buying this, look it up online. As I stated, it started as a webisode!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best... EVER!!!","review":"This is genius. Pure genius. I think I might be obsessed. The music is INCREDIBLE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd rate this ten stars if I could.","review":"I think anyone looking to buy this probably already knows that it's awesome... so all I have to say is \\"cheers\\" to you for putting it in your cart and go check out! I have watched this DVD probably a hundred and one times and it gets better every time. There isn't a sour note in the whole score and the one liners are sly and bitingly funny. I have recommended this sing a long to everyone I know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"buy it for the commentary","review":"If you like quirky musical stuff and Whedon you'll like this.My only thing to say is buy it for the musical commentary. You're looking at a whole other set of songs (that lasts just as long as the actual program) that in my opinion are better than the originals. The commentary is pretty much the only songs we listen to on this DVD anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"DR. HORRIBLE IS WONDERFUL!","review":"The tale of how a villian becomes a supervillian is funny, smart and poignant. It made me love Neal Patrick Harris. I already loved Joss Whedon & Captain Tightpants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great satire!","review":"This is a fantastic musical satire. If you missed it before, you really should get it now.

It was incredibly good.It has both humor and serious parts, jokes and drama.The characters are interesting, you care about them (at least I did).Everyone who worked on this did an amazing job, and I sure hope they're proud.Bottom line: This is amazing. Watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So entertaining!","review":"I read about Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog on another website called Cake Wrecks. When I searched for it, I was so excited to see that Amazon had copies for sale. When my fiance and I watched it, it made us laugh so hard we cried. It is fairly short which is nice. The songs stay with you for days - the cast did an excellent job.

Proof that something awesome can come out of a small budget. Good acting and excellent music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flaw no one else noticed","review":"I love Dr. Horrible as much as the next person so I won't bore people with that.However, I have noticed that this DVD has it's left and right audio channels swapped backwards. Most noticeable during last part of \\"A Man's Gotta Do\\" song at end of Act I. Penny can be heard clearly coming from left audio channel while standing on right side of screen and Dr. Horrible is heard from right audio channel while standing on left side of screen. Kinda bothersome to have a flaw like this that I can't ignore whenever I watch it now. (And no, it's isn't a DVD player, TV, or receiver issue. disc is indeed flawed itself)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for writers' strikes!","review":"This DVD is a gem! I'd heard the buzz about it online but never took the time to check it out. I finally got it from Netflix the other day and there's a pretty good chance I may never return it.It is laugh-out-loud funny, has wonderful songs, and -- like Amazon's instructions for writing good reviews -- is not too short and not too long.Oh my God, look at my wrist. I gotta go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"Having watched Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog already on the internet many months prior, I must say that I wasn't expecting any surprises when I received the dvd. I was expecting to simply have the three part series on DVD - accessible and easily manageable. I had heard that the commentary was funny, so I turned it on and sat back.I was blown away. The commentary is as good, if not better, than the title piece.Joss Whedon has struck again. Whedon's genius nevers fails to astound me, and this Sing-Along Blog was no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great send up and more Nathan Fillion","review":"Been a big fan of Joss Whedon and Nathan Fillion's particular brand of slightly off-kilter bravado since Firefly. Dr. Horrible satisfies those needs and who knew Nathan could also sing. Neil Patrick Harris is just as over-the-top as Fillion, to my delight. Bought a copy for a gift and one for myself.

Not even slightly.","review":"This is what happens when a writer's strike shuts \\"Hollywood\\" out of \\"Hollywood,\\" and all that's left are passionate writers, actors, musicians, and crew. It has Joss Whedon written all over it - if you're already a fan of his work, read no further. Dr. Horrible (played by Neal Patrick Harris) is quirky and endearing from the start, and the supporting cast are fantastic actors in their own right. The DVD is very well produced and packed with special features. You will want to watch them all. The highlight is the \\"User submissions\\" section: It has its low spots, but overall it's amazing. Watch Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog, and you'll hope that this is the direction that hollywood is headed: Smaller budgets, bigger hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr Horrible is here!","review":"I can only echo what other reviewers have said about this, it's quirky, charming, clever, amazing, original and oozing talent.

It is well written, funny, the characters are all unique and the songs are so good that even people who don't like musicals tend to love them!

I absolutely adore Joss Whedon and think pretty much everything he touches turns to gold, but this is perfect on so many levels. The casting is incredible. Nathan Fillion is one of the most amazing actors EVER, in my opinion. His usual charm is played into the perfect 'corporate tool'. A good guy who is just so cheesy. I love him. NPH is incredibly awesome and just loveable enough to be the bad-guy you want to root for. And Felicia Day is super cute! The songs are great and I dare you to not get them stuck in your head.

Joss, Nathan and Felicia commented on just recording some of the dialog for the commentary. I have no doubt the commentary is every bit as good as the musical itself. If not, may the Bad Horse make me his mare!Ed. note: watched (listened to) the commentary.

You can get a higher quality version of the movie from iTunes than what is included on the DVD.

I was going to buy this for my dad for Father's Day, but he doesn't like to download software to access media (he doesn't even have iTunes), so now I can't really send this to him, either. When you see something that says you can download a movie, I should be able to download THE MOVIE, not some software that will allow me to view a low-res version. I have a Mac, so I can't download the crappy software. I will not be buying any movies through Amazon again.

It's hard to not side with the Doctor as he plots against his nemesis,Capt. Hammer (Nathan Fillion) while trying to win the love of the girl of his dreams, Penny (Felicia Day). The music is good, and the songs are catchy, and reminds me of Joss's last musical, the Buffy episode \\"Once More, with Feeling\\". The only thing I didn't like about it is the fact that the actual movie itself is only about 45 minutes long, though it does leave itself open for a sequel (C'mon Joss, we NEED a sequel).

Now granted, I break out from a lot of things, but this is only the second moisturizer I've ever broken out from. I stopped for a couple days and it started to clear up (I use Proactiv). I started using Porcelana again ... and started breaking out again. So I'm finally stopping and pretty much see it as a waste of $13 (after shipping). It's very thick and heavy, so I'm not surprised it was somehow clogging my pores.

Even now, an hour later, soap-scrubbed and my favorite Dr. Hauschka rose cream applied, the scent of Porcelana is seeping through and making me faintly ill.Too bad, because the price is right. Tomorrow I'm trying Esoterica -- not a bad price either -- to see if I can stand the smell of it, or if it's simply the Hydroquinone ingredient that is the curse.

Most of my smaller age spots have faded or are gone but I do have darker spots that persist. They will require the use of a prescription strength formula of Hydroquinone or laser treatments but due to the overall reduction that has occurred, I know those possible next steps will be less extensive.I also found the daytime formula left a nice base to apply make-up on to and my complexion actually seemed to clear up while using it.I was very pleased with the results overall...and the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laxative anyone?","review":"I can't look at a dog in the street without wondering whether its Chris under there.

Also, the whole pool was alot smaller than the box looked. The canopy was floppy and cheap!! The water fall hose leaked immediatly!!

Each time I had to spend 30 minutes blowing it up with a pump, just for it to deflate over half way in only one hour. The kids didn't get to enjoy it because it would start to collapse and even the slide wouldn't stay tied to the pool itself. The attachment that has the basketball goal leans and ends up detaching after 5 minutes with or without a windy day. This product was made cheaply, even though for a blow up pool, it was one of the most expensive pools to select from.

Poorly Designed. Not recommended.","review":"Well, everyone has already said it. Glad to know I am not the first. The photo on the front shows about 7 kids on it, all about 6-7 years old and there is room for more. When you blow it up, it fits maybe 2-3 toddlers, 2-5 years old. So I guess the had fun, but had I read these reviews first and knowing what I know now, I would have bought another product. The hosing for the \\"stomp\\" button broke for me out of the box. Probably wouldn't last long. So I had to hook the hose directly to the arch. Once the water flows, it kind of weighs it down causing the arch to fall over. It sticks to the sides will velcro and it just does not stick. Anyway the photo is VERY MISLEADING. I was like... WOW! really? this photo is a bit overboard. Anyway, that is my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Junk - I will ban Banzai forever!!!","review":"This is absolute junk. As everyone else has identified, the picture is horribly misleading.

The recommended age for this product is 3 to 12 but it is only big enough for a 1 to 3 year old.

Two parts that blow up do not stay inflated (from the get go). The slide is so rickety and unstable, I'm scared one of them is going to fall and hurt themselves. The arch keeps falling forward. Again, I wasn't expecting a lot but it wasn't even worth 30 bucks. Ahhhh, I'm pretty disappointed. I actually wish I could have rated it with 0 stars. Oh well... live and learn.

My daughter is fearless and braved the flimsiness of the slide, but her guest was leary of it for good reason. We followed all directions precisely and still found it ill designed. For the day that we had it functioning, our daughter loved it. However, it is not maintainable due to its poor construction.

After removing the slide our son flopped down to splash in the water and one of the rings on the bottom that holds the slide cut his butt through a swimmer diaper - made a hole that would not stop bleeding and had a huge bruise around it.

Despite others posts, we have never had a problem with the slide not staying tied down, the pool osing air, or the sprinkler attachment bursting. It's a huge hit with the kids.

Still no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend a little more and get something else.","review":"I bought this for my 3 year old since he seemed to enjoy running under the sprinkler. The pool itself is ok, the slide seems sturdy but like other people have said keeping it in place is all but useless. Not to mention it's awkward for sitting down on and not much room to slide. The arch piece that works as the sprayer is a piece of junk. The material is so thin that within 30 minutes the seal near the hose was broken. I also had to keep the air pump outside. The side of the arch that holds the water lasts about 10 minutes before it deflates and collapses. Aside from the shortcomings my son did have fun with it but to have to fill the thing constantly and have to hold the slide in place so he doesn't fall off isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!","review":"I thought this pool would be great for my 5 year old and 1 year old sons. I put the whole pool together only to realize that you have to tie down the slide which doesn't stay and if someone goes to step on the stairs, the slide comes up from the pool. The strings are so small that if you have big hands, GOOD Luck on trying to tie it. After we got it all set up and went to get the springler turn on, the seam exploded and there went the springler.

Every day I am challenged by these questions as a zoophile myself, and it has become woefully apparent that we are grossly misunderstood by the world at large (as if I didn't know that already) With any luck, this will set the record straight about a few things in the public's perception of our lifestyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you ever thought you were the only one...","review":"This powerful work illustrates how a person can learn to accept himself, despite the stigma society attaches to him.This book will fascinate you and make you challenge your own judgment at what love is, or can be, and what you can really feel love for.(Two hooves up!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for open minds","review":"This is a book for those of us who want to see what is out there.

However, it seemed poorly-written..like it was cobbled together from bits and pieces of random thought. All I got from it was that the author had a \\"troubled past,\\" and it seemingly related to women rejecting him and religious convictions leaving him. Hence, the book gives very little insight as to what makes people \\"zoophiles,\\" in my opinion. All we get is a depressing tale of a troubled man who starts out with a bad life..it gets even worse..then better again..then bad again..and I just had a hard time relating to his story. [F]or those seeking a true understanding of zoophilia, this book may confuse and frighten."},{"rating":"1","title":"This will abolutely frighten people.","review":"This was a confused, cobbled together book exemplifying an individual whose past appears to have created a dysfunctional being. I am a former equine zoophile, and was in the process of \\"coming out\\" when my wife, a then niave individual, \\"found\\" this book by accident, read it to understand zoophilia more, and because of it, nearly terminated our marriage and destroyed the lives of our children. I owe at least two years of absolute living hell to Mark Matthews' book. My advice: be careful. It is certainly NOT representative of what zoophilia is about to most of those involved with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book promotes sexual assault on animal victims","review":"The book describes the author's sordid problems with weight, IV drug use, and divorce, it's quite clear from the book's contents that the author turned to bestiality as a cop-out from the real world.The story reads like a boring Times Square porn shop rag and attempts to convince readers that having sex with an animal is somehow normal or \\"ok\\"Bestiality is ILLEGAL in most states, with more states passing laws against it, all of Canada, UK, AU and most other countries. This book is promoting illegal activities and condoning sexual assaults on animals, sorry but this book belongs in the garbage can."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a real shame that this is out of print","review":"I loved the other John R. Powers books and discovered this one, believe it or not, in an airport gift shop. As with his other books, it was a joy to read and had an emotional depth so rarely found in books that are also miraculously funny. Powers may well be the most underrated writer to emerge in the last 30 years. His books are so entertaining, you don't notice yourself being moved. Until later, that is. Like, ten seconds later. Wonderful writing I recommend to anyone with a heart and a funny bone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genuine Reading Pleasure","review":"I found this book so well written and so easy to read yet hard to put down. I finished this book on a matter of days. The main character is Donald who is facing a health crisis and his mother has taken a bad fall and ended up in the hospital. Donald flies out immediately and must face his past when his mother insists he goes back the house where he was raised, a house he has not entered in twenty years. The book alters between the past and the present. There were moments when I would put the book down and just laugh. I truly enjoyed every moment I spent in Donald's reliving of his childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Urbanist novel","review":"Architechts and Urban Design folks who consider themselves New Urbanists will love this novel. Powers understands that our missing of the \\"old neighborhood\\" is about the sense of place and belonging that was left behind in the search for the suburban dream. Powers tells all the stories: the one mom on the block who worked, the garage which is behind the house, off the alley \\"where it belongs\\". Powers lets us recall the calm and orderliness of life in a neighborhood of diverse population, mixed uses(corner stores and front porches) and care for neighbors. The book is a delightful reminder of the days and places that defined middle class not in terms of income or profession but of an ethic shared with the families next door and across the alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"We tried to buy this item under my wife's account.

Unfortunately, Secret Thirst was the worst that I've read of her work. Lauren, though a scientist, is both dimwitted and self-centered. Over half of the book is her coming off like a complete bitch to Kris. Granted her circumstances would have tried the most docile of creatures, still her behavior was the same when she was not being tried at all. When Kris saves her life does she thank him? No. She insults him and is ungrateful. When he tries to protect her, she does the same thing. I almost didn't finish this book simply because I detested the alleged heroin of the book. Why would I want a perfectly good hero end up with her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book [wasn't good]!","review":"I used this book last semester at a community college near where I live, and it stunk.First, the book comes off as if the student already knows Macroeconomics. It uses difficult terms, it isn't harmonious (it doesn't \\"flow\\" well), and it obviously wasn't written for the layperson in mind.Second, the excersises at the end of the chapter makes you answer questions that has little to do with the chapter you've just read. For example, after you've finished reading chapter 1 and then go on to the chapter review questions (and there are a ton of them) you'll find it hard to answer them because they had little to do with the chapter.I don't recommend this book to any college student. So far it has been the most horrendous piece of work I have ever seen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of fights and action, Just what I like.","review":"Action packed from the beginning.

Without knowing the evil lord puts a 1000 gold tail bounty on his head, and master fighters come from far and wide to collect. Non stop action, and great fast paced fight scenes, perfect set of characters, both good and bad guy's. I reccomend this for sure to any old school martial arts fan. Find out if he can get his revenge or die trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this CD","review":"This CD is a cruel joke on all who know and venerate Segovia's playing and contribution to the guitar. Were there a zero star rating, I would use it. The sound of the Segovia Bach is grotesquely bad, less clear than, say, a hand-held dictation recorder. The Williams pieces, in apparent sympathy, are almost as bad, though there is no apparent reason that we couldn't have better clarity from more modern recordings. I am neither kidding nor being malicious: for example, the overloading on crescendi is so bad that it is painful to hear. If you want to understand Segovia's impact on classical music, save the 7 bucks that you would have spent for this CD and get the Deutsche Grammaphon \\"Art of Segovia\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cute Book about Buddhism and Modern Day Japan","review":"Anyone who enjoys reading Travel Narrative type books about East Asia will enjoy this book. However, it is more than just a travel narrative, it is also an interesting look at an American living as a Buddhist Monk in Japan. The book is very cute and charming at times. The only thing I did not like was the constant lack of chronological order to the story. Personally, it was a bit much at times. However, the book is well written, informative, and funny. I stayed one night in a Buddhist Monk in Japan. One unforgettable night in Kyoto. Chadwick spent much longer, and some of his stories are incredible. A nice mix of travel narrative, culture shock, religion and comedy. If you liked this book...look at Pico Iyer's Lady and the Monk or Learning to Bow by Fieler."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ejoyed comparing my yoga experiences with David's zen.","review":"The zen studies David described seemed very familiar as I compared them with the yoga practice I am working on.

Mr. Chadwick has very little insight into Japan than any other English teacher whose worked there for a few months. It is full of stereotypes and dull to read, making hard to even believe that Mr. Chadwick has ever even been to Japan.

The author is very skillful about telling several stories at once. You never know what is going to happen next in any of these stories. It seems every minor detail in the story seems to have dramatic consequences to what happens next. Additionally, the action in the book is very fast.

I have heard a number of pieces designed for relaxation and meditation, and felt the music on this CD did not meet these needs. The music on the first track was too pulsating (sounded like someone trying to start a small motor repeatedly) to be very relaxing. The meditation music was interesting, but was a bit fast to keep it from being overwhelming.

Her sister's whole life is beauty pagents. One day Scottie-Anne is forced into a beauty pagent at her school. She is surprised that she wants to win. The beauty pagent ends up causing some problems between friends. This book showed that sometimes beauty means more than brains in today's society. I think this book showed both views of beauty pagents well. Some people think beauty pagents are great and some think they are shallow. If you are not into beauty pagents this book might not interest you. I liked it even though I don't like beauty pagents. This book was pretty exciting but the ending was a little disapponting. I would recommend this book to most girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it wasn't just about some pretty girl who wins a pagaent, and her self pitying sister. It has a great message too: you don't have to be gorgeous to make it in life. It also lets you know that even top beauty contestents, like Dane, get jealous of others, and have problems too. Scottie-Annie was a really great character, and her personality was really nice, too. Everybody should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly great literature, but not bad","review":"I found this book entertaining while vaguely pointless. It enphasis on how looks are not as important as character. However, I think it strayed from that when describing how much Scottie-Ann wanted to win the pageant. Don't get me wrong. I DID like it, and I found it to be well written, humorous, and enjoyable. It is a very quick read, and I would recommend it to kids who enjoy reading about teen problems and growing up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forest = Copycat, Wormwood = bust, buy The Devil's Inbox","review":"Though plaguerizing and idea stealing have long been prevalent in high school classrooms, it is a sad day when it finally arrives on our christian bookshelves.

There was only one ab exercise which didn't target the obliques or lower abdomen and if she said \\"Oxygen\\" one more time, I planned on screaming. She didn't even do most of the workout.

I have been a Christian for a long time, and I have to admit, I've always been a bit confused on the subject of prayer. Nee did a great job of clearing this up for me.

However, that does not mean that we cannot learn about prayer! Nee, in a clear way, lays out why we pray and the purpose of it. I have gone to church my whole life, and I have never had prayer so simply explained. After I read this book, during my Bible reading, things just started to come together. When Jesus talks about prayer, it actually makes sense now on a much deeper level.

All it does is makes an annoying sound like loud white noise, there's absolutely no walkie-talkie action from these at all. Even standing next to each other, they didn't work. Not even the buttons work. Usually w/ a toy phone they can still push the buttons and get a dialing sound or something, but these don't do anything. Definitely not worth a penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They simply don't work - don't buy!!","review":"This is the worst product I ever bought - ZERO stars should be an option. 5-10 feet is generous, we had to have them 2 feet apart to barely get them to work - kind of pointless for walkie talkies - 9 volt batteries likely means these were designed in 1977. Don't buy unless you think 2 pieces of plastic with strawberry shortcake on them are worth $20. I made stickers on my computer to replace the two pictures with mom and dad so at least they are expensive picture frames."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I bought these for my two daughters (ages 4 & 5). The girls were VERY excited about playing with these, but they simply do not work. You can barely hear anything through the walkie-talkie and you can only be a few feet apart and directly in line of sight of each other to hear anything through them. The kids could hear each other talking better than coming from the walkie-talkies!I would highly recommend NOT getting these!!!! We have also tried the Disney Princess wristband / ear clip version will equal success. Very frustrating!

They were just not getting along and we had fallen in love with her. At the suggestion of our vet and the rescue we had got her from we went to petco and purchased the \\"Comfort Zone\\" Feliway plugins. Needless to say it was pricey, but it helped! so we thought we'd try and save some money and purchase these. They have only been lasting about 2 weeks instead of the month that they are supposed to. Now they have started to get fussy with each other again!! We would NOT recommend purchasing these. Spend the extra money and get the real thing!! I read a review from another sale of this brand after we had purchased these that said that they will not last the full month and that the company does not sell their product to Amazon. DO NOT BUY THESE FROM AMAZON!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feliway made a difference","review":"I've used this product for the last 4 months, and both I and my cats are benefiting. Stress is down between the oldest and the middle cat, and all of them are more playful. Based on the language of their behaviours, I am so glad they are feeling better.

We used Feliway Plug-In and after about one month noticed a huge difference in her behavior. She no longer terrorizes dogs or people and usually (but not always) pees in her litter box instead of on the floor. She still tries to kill other cats and every so often will go on a spraying binge in the kitchen but she's pretty affectionate with the Pit Bull and with people.Prior to the Feliway my husband and I tried all sorts of things including giving the cat Prozac but nothing worked as well as the Feliway. My advice to anyone with a truly horrible cat is to give the Feliway at least 1-2 months to fully kick in. I guess the more severe the behavior problems are the longer it takes the Feliway to start working."},{"rating":"2","title":"This helps","review":"I have 3 cats and have a problem with them spraying even though all are female, and all are neutered. One is part Siamese, rather high strung, and a possible suspect! These plug in diffusers seems to keep them a calmer and minimize the problem with them spraying. It's not perfect - but I think it helps. I've also used the feliway spray which does seem to keep them from re-spraying on a particular site. For cleanup, especially walls - 1/2 vinegar and 1/2 water works the best. Only trouble with the diffusers is a tendency for them to be to heavy and to slowly work themselves out of the wall plug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great packaging","review":"I found the packaging to be much more convenient on this product than on others I have purchased. The usual plastic encasement was not on these refills making it much easier to open and change the diffuser. As far as the product goes...does it do everything it advertizes? not for my cat, it has helped relax him and he has stopped licking the hair off of his stomach, he still licks the hair off his paws but not as bad. It is also supposed to help reduce his inappropriate elimination which it does not. He still fails to use the litter box and will even go right near the diffuser. I am debating on continuing to use the product since I purchase it to reduce his inappropriate elimination and I am not seeing consistent results, but it certainly has relaxed his nervous personality...or that could be that he is aging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"Helps with multi-cat households.

One of the cats did spray one day, and then I realized that there wasn't any liquid left in the diffuser, I promptly refilled it, it hasn't happened again. I wish I'd tried this much sooner. It really works, it's amazing. Everyone at home is happier, this is totally worth the cost.

I swore that there was no change...until the third refill ran out last week. I started to notice that the male was becoming very aggressive again towards the female and happened to look at the refill to notice it was used up.

As it was, when we plugged them in 3 months later it made a big difference. Before she either hissed at them, ran from the room, or both. Now she'll allow the littlest guy to rub under her chin while they're begging for canned food, adn even deigns to lick his ear once in a while. They get grumpier when the Feliway runs out, so this 6-pack refill has been a great way for us to keep it onhand.

He was losing weight and licking his belly bare. I installed a feliway diffuser and within a week he was his old self and still is.

I purchased the Feliway plug-ins and put them wherever he urinates. He does not mark there as long as the plug-in is active. I'm not sure yet if it has calmed him down because he always goes after one of the other cats and that has not seemed to lessen yet.This was the absolute best price I have ever seen anywhere for these refills.

The book serves as a valuable resource for anyone involved in qualitative research, providing an excellent example of how this is done.Beyond its value to Education Leadership academics, it is a valuable read for principals who have suffered wounds of their own.

And a dog lover. And a person who does not place strenuous demands on beach-bag fiction. But I was looking forward to a pleasant escapist romp, and instead found myself annoyed on almost every page. The writing is horrible. The plot, even by the most forgiving standards, tests your patience. (News flash: the CEO of a major corporation does not negotiate basic contracts, much less personally sign them. The lack of awareness or interest in getting right even the most basic facts about business life is a distraction. Why not make him a member of just the idle rich? Why Fredericksburg? Why not Middleburg?)Ugh.The whole book thing was clearly a necessary evil to sell a screenplay . . . but the day the camera crews show up on location in my town, I am grabbing my torch and pitchfork and storming City Hall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where to start?","review":"1.

For babies and toddlers just beginning to learn the alphabet, Fleming's illustrations make it difficult to discern letter shape. Particularly problematic is the letter \\"W\\", in which Mouse welds a bar of steel between W's two interior angled lines. Unfortunately, this means that the inside of the W appears to be an \\"A\\". My two year old misidentifies the \\"W\\" as an A every time, and technically, he's correct. Ultimately, the illustrated letters are too abstract for children learning their alphabet. Unlike another commenter, I believe that this book is more appropriate for children who have already mastered the basics of the alphabet and are simply building on that knowledge: namely, preschoolers.For babies and toddlers, there are better introductory alphabet books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preschoolers will love it!","review":"I have a four year old daughter who knows her alphabet well, but she still loves this book.

I am married and agree that marriage can be hard sometimes, but I hope no one getting married decides to watch this beforehand because it might scare the H-E double hockey sticks out of them.....

Loved it! Comedy, drama, a little action, and a whole lot of \\"Oh, no, he didn't!\\" I think this was a break through acting roles for not only Janet Jackson (excellent), but also for Jill Scott as well (outstanding). The other actors are not household names like Tyler, Janet, and Jill Scott (R&B singer), but that doesn't mean that they didn't bring it when they performed their roles. Absolutely fabulous!

In other words, the book is very easy to read, unlike a lot of other anarchist literature of the era. He divides quite a few topics into short separate chapters. He speaks about war, labor, capitalism, etc. I suggest this to those who are anarchists, or those who just want information on REAL anarchism.

Unless you really enjoy this style of writing, the mind begins to wander and you can miss important facts because all the facts just seem to run together.

But really, When something says \\"paperback\\" and doesn't specify what size, how many of us are considering that the book won't fit on a normal size paperback book shelf, or worse, even fit with standard hardcovers. Never mind the fact that the typeface is equivalent to a typewriter that most people don't use anymore, light not dark on the print and hard for less than perfect eyes to read for very long at a time.

Personally, I could never get round to comitting myself to the book, but this reading really brings it to life, and is well worth spending the time and money. Milton creates many wonderous and fantastical images and characters. Satan is shown as a tragic hero, tormented by the innocence of Adam and Eve, and prompted to revenge. Milton actually uses his characters to play 'devil's advocate' (literally!) by asking many paradoxical questions of the biblical story. Considering this book was first printed at the height of the witchcraft paranoia of the seventeenth century, it's amazing he managed to get away with it.Full of allegory and layers of meaning, this is a CD set you can enjoy again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, poor design for Kindle version","review":"I just bought the Kindle version of this book, and I already see two highly undesirable features. One is that words that have a footnote in the print version are underlined in the Kindle version, as if for emphasis. (These underlined words are links to the footnotes, but they look like emphasized words.) A second is that the line numbers in the Kindle version (every 5th line is standardly marked with a line number) appear in the body of the poem rather than in the margin, so that, e.g., [25] Every fifth line of the poem begins with a line number. These two features create a very poor reading experience.

I don't know who listed this product on amazon.com and dared to say it was 600 watts regardless what terminology he/she used, RMS power, maximum power or peak to peak power. There would be no way that a speaker of this size could produce 600 watts of power, this ad is not only misleading, but exaggaration at its extreme. Typically, speakers range from 85-92 db measured at 1 meter with 1 watt applied. Everytime you double the wattage you increase the db by 3. So at 600 watts, it you stood three feet away from this speaker, the dB level would reach to 200 or more, it would be traumatic enough to cause permant hearing loss, then Pyle-pro would be in some serious trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"noise, low power","review":"I purchased this item for a room for about 50 people to announce. 600-watt?

I gave two star because it has many functions such as ipod player and charger and wireless mic. Otherwise one star is enough.I think its normail power is around 15~20-watt and max is 50-watt. You can use it outside or in a noisy place with people talking. Don't expect listening to music in a quiet place. Far away from people and speaker.

A pair of bookends, this video and the one from Woodstock (both festivals held the same year). The music is absolutely up to snuff (as you'd expect from the Stones, Jefferson Airplane, Ike and Tina Turner, the Flying Burrito Brothers). Yet of equal power, impact, and importance are the crowd shots. You go to Altamont with this one and see just how screwed up things got.

Five big stars as a rating for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow man, what a trip...","review":"Hey dudes,Just want to check in.

Right up there in terms of cultural importance with the Woodstock movie... The only disapointment of \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is the fact that the Maysles Brothers left out the concert footage of P.

We just had years of Viet Nam on network news. I did not wanna see any more.Now, we do not see the reality of war. We do see massive amounts of gore in commercial film.

Like Stones, Purple is also one of the best Rock contemporary in the 70's hey day. Fortunately I did n't see any quarrels & fights between the audience.

This last Altamont 'free-concert' followed a really great L.A. Forum performance, several hours delayed, but ended near 0700 the next morning.

The movie captures the Rolling Stones at their best. Their live rendition of \\"Satisfaction,\\" from the Madison Square Garden is worth buying the video alone. With a big screen TV and surround sound, you feel as if you are transported back to 1969. Today is the 30 year anniversary of the tragic Altamont concert.

What did they do before and after Sticky Fingers and Exile? a few gems here and there? He even put his stamp on Let it Bleed (although Kef' did do most the the lead work on that--amazing!).

My honest opinion is: I\`D NEVER BEEN A STONES FAN. It is the fault of the band & their security themselves, because they gave the concert in Altamont for free. As a result was: everybody from all villages came to see the band, they carried anything they wanted to bring; knives, bottles, haschisch, beers, dogs, children, guns what ever...without being checked seriously by the security.I'd rather to see Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Purple or Black Sabbath shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD TIME FOR A GREAT MUSIC PERIOD","review":"BOUGHT THIS DVD RECENTLY TO SEE THE MUSIC THAT HAS TOUCH ME IN MY LIFE AS I'M ONLY 41 YEARS OLD THE MUSIC FROM THIS PERIOD IS MY FAVORITE AFTER VIEWING THE DVD IT WAS NOT ONLY SAD BUT SENSELESS THE WAY THE VIOLENSE TOOK AWAY FROM THIS MUSICAL PERIOD THIS IS THE FIRST REVIEW I HAVE EVER WRITTEN I WISH I NEVER WOULD HAVE PURCHASED THIS DVD I'LL NEVER WACTH IT AGAIN.BUY MONTEREY POP OR THE WOODSTOCK DVD FOR THE MUSIC OF THIS PERIOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STONE-ROCK","review":"Rock videos mean very little to me, but Gimme Shelter has a real story to tell.

The school was somewhere I wished could exist so I could send my girls, even if the people running it were a bit off the wall, reminding me some of characters from Dickens. The references to literature, and the arts were fun too.One thing I also appreciated was the way the author worked a bit of eroticism into the story.

Reading about the WWI & II were interesting to read as well, because people tend to forget about the past unless it's mentioned again. I know a few people who know nothing of the past/history and it's rather sad.It has become my favorite book. Ever.

I agree with what Woody Allen had to say about Steve: He sings the great songs the way they were meant to be sung.

There's just something about that voice and those arrangements that make me so very glad I can hear.Buy the CD if you are tired of silky, perfect-voiced singers you hear in coffee shops, who do nothing but serve as soothing background noise while you talk with your friends or read.

Her style in Blue Holes is tighter than in Forces of Evil, which may be due to it being a shorter book. She's getting better at love scenes, though she can use some improvement still. She would save the best one for the last page of the book. And there's a reference to a strange character at the end of this book that may indicate a third book about Dean and Katie. If her writing improves as much in that one as it did for this book, the next one should be a real winner. As it is, this is a nice tight, book with plenty of excitement and a better developed relationship.

Fully aware that he is the same person who was so abusive, he feels no remorse and only inflicts more pain. He's a sociopath, never having any intention to try to use the encounter to seek closure and forgiveness, only to exploit, commit perversion, and cause more injury to this poor woman and his child.

The sad fact is, the last 8 years of Grodin's life have consisted basically of: got his CNBC show, lost it, got an MSNBC weekend gig, lost it, looked for work for a while, landed at CBS 60 Minutes II. The events that connect all this just really aren't that interesting, and not at all funny. And the occasional transcripts of his talk shows fall really flat on the printed page. Love ya Charlie, but your movie talk of the past was far more entertaining than predictable takes on Imus, Stern, Regis, etc. The book jacket promised something like an unprecedented, revealing look into Grodin's personal life.

Again, come ON: for $50 the author should have purchased stock images- or shot them herself- so that the reader could work through the exercises using the same images as the author.Further, there is too much restoration and not enough retouching here, and the very important Liquify Filter recieves only scant coverage.All that being said, there is a great deal of useful info here, and even an old PS verteran like myself can learn some new tricks.

It contains wonderful pictures and stories. I've read them over and over. The pictures are one of my favorite things in the book. My younger sister just sits there and looks at them forever.

The battery that comes with the unit lasts about 30% longer then this one does even though it has a lower MA rating. The battery that comes with the phone is a Lithium Polymer battery. This one is only Lithium Ion which has less capacity for same size.The 1000 MA rating must be incorrect because field use proves otherwise.

This is how Jimmy Jibbit feels about himself. In his opinion, the only thing he'll ever be able to do is draw comics. Not only will most people be able to empathise with Jimmy, they'll also learn the most important lesson: it sometimes takes a million mistakes until you create a master piece, and you just have to stick with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous, funny, feel-good story!","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful work of art! The poignant story of a boy's discovery of his own ability to push past failures to accomplish something difficult is studded with laugh-out-loud portraits of family members, and hilarious episodes of family life. It is filled with truth and love. And the cartoons and illustrations are an entirely wonderful addition to the story. They are excellent in their own right, and add immeasurably to the tale.My daughter picked this book out of the library at random, was glued to it for a day, and told me I should read it. Boy, was she right! Try it, and see if you don't come up laughing and crying at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspirational Book","review":"The Man in the Ceiling is a fast paced story about a young boy's childhood, told like only a young child can tell it. Jules Feiffer creates an alternate world that adults are not often part of, drawing the reader into that remembered world, even if the reader is an adult. The story is one of the artistically struggling young Jimmy who strives to find his talent and himself. His major artistic inspiration is his sailing Uncle Lester the playwright, who first betrays him and then helps him take that final leap towards reaching his goal. I would definitely recommend the reading of this inspirational book, young or old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"I was finally able to visit Las Vegas last year and bought several Vegas books as souvenirs. Unfortunately, most of the books only provided information on present-day Las Vegas. Also wanted were pictures of the Las Vegas I had seen on TV as a kid. After all, that is what gave it its magic & attraction to me.This book provides that. Pictures of the old & new are featured on opposite pages for easy comparison. The pictures are large, sharp, & clear, & are of excellent quality to this layman's eye. They are also accompanied by short paragraphs of essential facts such as build dates & owners, along with information peculiar to the specific buildings.I highly recommend this book to the nostalgist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Shots of Old","review":"Very nice pics and great comparisons from old and new, even if the new are a few years old and a little dated - would be great to get an update with newer photos for now, but Vegas changes so fast that it would have to be updated yearly.

The \\"then\\" photo is contained on the left page, and the \\"now\\" photo is on the facing right page. A one paragraph description is bellow each photograph.As expected, most the photos reflect the evolution of the hotel-casinos, both on the strip and downtown. There are a few non-hotel photos, but these are probably of limited interest for us Vegas tourists.The only real disappointment is the size of the book. It is very SMALL. I did not notice the dimensions on Amazon page, and I wrongly assumed this was a larger format."},{"rating":"2","title":"UPDATE NEEDED","review":"I PURCHASED THIS BOOK BECAUSE MY HUSBAND & I WERE LOOKING FOR THIS VERY THING.......VEGAS THEN & NOW.

IT'S A GREAT BOOK FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY LOVE OLD VEGAS. WE HAVE BEEN GOING THERE SINCE THE MID-SEVENTIES & REALLY MISS SOME OF THE HISTORY THAT'S BEEN TORN DOWN.

Price is still worth it, I just use my old lids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy","review":"The Rubbermaid garbage can is top notch. It is not flimsy and will not blow over in the wind. I kept mine outside and the las vegas summer did not weaken the integrity of the plastic. It is somewhat heavy and when you fill it up it can be a somewhat difficult to transport. However it was a great garbage can and met all my expectations. You get what you pay for and I got my moneys worth out of it.The only drawback was that it was such a nice garbage can someone stole mine! I left it out on trash day and when i got home it was gone.

Before working with Britney, producer Max Martin collaborated with Robyn. This disc is 100% Robyn (Martin is nowhere to be found) and the slick production was pulled back to reveal an artist in a state of growth. A terrible shame that RCA chose not to release it in the States, which only leads to one question. Was RCA too involved with Christina Aguilera to bring us the sophmore disc from one of Sweden's most promising artists? Considering the number of manufactured pop princesses in the U.S. right now, it may have been a good thing for Robyn's \\"my truth\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE HIDDEN SONG IN SWEDISH","review":"To all you Robyn fans: The last song listed on Amazon's tracklisting of My truth is hidden.

It's really pretty bad, and is nothing like what her current albums are showcasing. The only two good songs on this album are \\"Electric\\" and \\"Main Thing\\". Kinda funky, but still dated. To fans who love her as much as I do....look forward....don't look back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"This cd is very good. The songs are all very positive and sweet. Robyn performs her vocals very well.However, keep in mind that 'My Truth' is not a dance pop album. All of the songs are either slow to mid-tempo, but it's supposed to be that way. 'Electric' is really the only song you can move to on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"An highly overrated cd that really isn't good at all","review":"Robyn, formerly Robin, before she changed the name to make it look more cool and american, is an extremly overrated artist. Her winy little voice is so annoying in songs that don't have a beat good lyrics or anything else you would want in a song. To sum it up it sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Fan, BUT.....","review":"First, let me say that I am a huge Martha Munizzi fan. Love, Love, Love her. The woman is bad! - BUT...I have to agree with Ryan....This album was very disappointing. In my opinion, she did not deliver. You cannot take away the fact that she is a great singer/songwriter, but there is a very big difference between \\"No Limits\\" and \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\". It's unfortunate that Israel & Aaron were not involved as producers on this one, because that is where I feel like this is a miss.I still love and listen to \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\" and her Christmas CD \\"When He Came\\".

Although I recognized moves from african dance, yoga and tai chi, they were repetitive and done in slow jerky motions without the correct warm-up. It appeared to be a low impact aerobic video from the 1980's with bad new age music in the background and gushy dialogue. Even though the images shown in the background were at times beautiful, I was wondering why they were used. I also tend to prefer my dance meditation tapes to contain less dialogue or be more active(Gabrielle Roth, Dunya, and Nia or just about any belly dance video)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Bought this for my daughter when she was taking harp lessons.

THis is a cd with mostly David Hammond and only a touch of the Clancy Brothers. Die hard Clancy fans will be disappointed with this purchase. These new releases with David Hammond are misleading due to the headlining of the Clancy Brothers that may only sing 2-3 songs and the rest is the gritty voice of David Hammond. I have been duped into purchasing other CDS that have David Hammond is small print. If you are looking for a great clancy brothers CD, try Tunes and Tales of Ireland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Children","review":"I love Irish Folk songs and purchased it that for that reason. I didn't know anything about the CD before buying it.This CD is somewhat akin to listening to a gathering in the living room and listening to an Irish family playing some of the Irish classics. Even the kids sing a few songs. It's non-polished and is plain as far as that goes. But, it is from the heart and quite joyful to hear. You'll find yourself singing the songs as you walk around doing your day-to-day activities.

Each country has three articles: a firm, an entrepenure, and the country itself for a total of 12 articles each written by true experts. McCraw's understanding of capitlism is somewhat skewed toward the modern, however on the whole the book is extremely balanced. Of partiuclar note, is Prof. David Moss's article on the Deutch Bank which dicusses the succcess, failures, rewards, and dark side of capitalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love amazon","review":"Thank you so much for you amazon service, the book comes without the CD and I returned it and refund me my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving Money","review":"I was able to save alot of money by purchasing this book on Amazon.

This book about the sudden accidental death of his teenaged daughter (and most likely the most vibrant member of his household during her life) was written quite a few years after I left the college at which Nisly teaches. Nisly is what I saw then as a \\"subjective intellectual\\": extremely intelligent, but also deeply sensitive and unwilling to ignore either gift, either perspective, on personal experience. His bravely retold passage through the experience of this vibrant young girl's death is like few things I have read in my life. It is one of few memoirs of its kind, combining a broad, Renaissance intellect with deep personal sensitivity--I am reminded of C.S. Lewis. I was lucky to have known and studied under Dr. Nisly. If you are a Christian or (and especially if) you are not, buy this book and enjoy it, learn from it.

Can I give 0 stars?","review":"I bought this violin for a 5 yr. old because the violin we are renting seemed cheaply made. Little did I know that it was even possible to make a far cheaper instrument. The Cecilio CVN-200 was a completely unusable violin. It is crafted of the lowest possible materials, and the chin rest is not even glued on (came off in her teacher's hands just by picking it up!). We were not able to string the violin because the pegs would not hold any tension. Additionally, the violin was actually a tiny bit shorter than the 1/8 violin that we are renting, so beware of the sizing, as well as the horrible quality. Sure it comes with 2 bows and a few other accessories, but it was the most disappointing purchase of our Christmas, and the worst thing I have ever purchased on Amazon. If you want a badly made violin that will last a month or so (if you're lucky) this is your item.

I especially loved the part where he finally realizes what he has and what he stands to lose by letting his lady walk out the door. I was surprised by his singing voice. I think he should release a CD so we can get the full range of his voice. What I appreciated most about this play was that there was no gun. I'm quite tired of every gospel play having a gun in it.

Its succinct guidance is contained in its four fundamental principles; 1) separate the people from the problem; 2) focus on interests, not positions; 3) generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do, and 4) insist that the result be based on some objective standard. Whatever situations business or family life might send your way, applying these four principles will reliably put you on the path to win-win solutions. \\"Getting to Yes' is an easy read with a powerful and practical message."},{"rating":"1","title":"More expensive than book version???","review":"The book is 2x more expensive in digital form than in book version?Ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"KINDLE PRICING ALL WRONG","review":"THE BOOK IS ABSOLUTELY GREATBUT AMAZON NEEDS TO BE AWARE THAT KINDLE CUSTOMERS ARE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT!!!

Content is good, but not a good value","review":"I guess I was expecting more than a single tape for my $10. I think there is probably a lot of good information in the book, but it's hard to tell from a single hour of talk on a single tape. I recommend getting the book and forgetting the tape for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Concepts","review":"A good primer or review for anyone confounded by negotiating and especially those proned to needing to get past grid lock. Practical advice on how to keep negotiations open and moving.

The one-hour cassette has limited information and is not worth the money. I have a library of audio tapes filled with great information. This is not one of them. I found the narrator voice very annoying to listen to. The tape reminded me of a college professor lecture. I will never buy another tape without checking your reader reviews. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring but Potentially Helpful Guide to Basic Negotiating","review":"If you are uncomfortable with your current negotiation technique and strategy and seek to improve it, this book will offer you great help. It is comprehensive and easy to read with lots of great examples. On the other hand, if you are comfortable with your current negotiation ability this book will seem repetitive and obvious. The authors make it clear that career negotiators who have read the book agree that it teaches them what they already know, but the negotiators also laud the authors for outlining clearly and in laymen's terms \\"The Method\\" as they refer to it, even as a refresher. Note that this is not a sales strategy book that will help you get your way by any means, it is a book advocating healthy, relationship friendly negotiation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic literature","review":"A very basic and even naive book about negotiation.

The book lacks insighful and meaningful thoughts on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh ?","review":"Tries to hard to say what they wanna say, uses way to many words to say what their trying to convey.

It was dull, boring, insipid, and writting on a level much higher than it needed to be written on. I fully expect that less than 1% of those who bot this book read past the first chapter without falling asleep.Don't misunderstand.

I've just recently started listening to it and it seems to be good. Product arrived as listed and shipping was timely. Good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advice and tips on negotiation","review":"This is a well written, informative book on the topic of negotiation. I believe that much can be deduced from the title alone. I found the discussion regarding dispute resolution helpful in that it provided some creative ways to go about achieving the best outcome. The books suggests that a certain procedure be followed when negotiating. I believe everyone develops an individual style and technique when negotiating, but I would not suggest that anyone be close minded when it comes to suggestions for improvement. In summary, this book provides a suggested means of negotiating, and enforces the need to see things from the other side's perspective. By understanding your opponent's position, and the factors they must consider, a negotiation discourse is far more likely to be productive and not adversarial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to gain knowledge on doing negotiation","review":"I wasn't about to read the book at all until my Proffesor demanded his students to do the assignment to read and write 10 great ideas about the containts of the book.

I haven't finished reading it but planned to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robust Recipe for Agreement","review":"I read this book a few years ago, integrated it into my daily relations and field tested it across a range of situations. The theory is detailed, with example dialogues and tactical advise, but for me this has only been illustration. The best about this book is the changed attitudes to negotiation as a consequence of understanding it.This is a general prescriptive theory of negotiation, which means it goes for any relationship where different interests touch. The four key points are:1. Separate the people from the problem2. Focus on interests, not positions3. Invent options for mutual gain4. Insist on objective criteriaAfter you understand the examples, this is all you need to remember to be an effective negotiator. The challenge in practice is to steer the negotiation along these lines, and when successful, you get a friendly discussion about what you can easily do for the other person, with measurable results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Negotiation Classic","review":"This book on Negotiation is a great resource for those seeking to understand the negotiation process.

I recommend this as well as \\"Getting Past No\\" by the same author, for the beginner and the novice negotiator."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES, YES ,YES!!!","review":"This is a book that I was required to read as requirement for a college business course, not only does it have tips and guidelines for negotiation in the professional world but great for everyday battles. I recommend it to all age groups although it can be slightly wordy at times. Fisher and Ury bring up manny outlooks that changed how I saw negotiation and conflict, as well as mutual gains instead of compromise this along with building or maintaining relationships are the most promenade themes of the book. The authors stress that you must respect the one that you are negotiating with because most of the time you would like to have a healthy relationship for future negotiations or family, business, ext. Over all I gave this book a 4 out 5 stars because I had great tips and theory but in my opinion it seems that it will only be helpful if both sides are using them.

Mahala Stripling is delving into questions that all of us must face. I love the timeline; it gives me perspective outside of the contents of the book, as well as within.

The UV light works great eliminating bacteria that may lay around our house, keeping our family and our dog healthier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money!","review":"We bought this and had it shipped directly to my husband who is deployed in the Gulf. He was so excited to get it because it is apparently very humid over there, don't ask me to make sense of this. His bedding and towels were never dry so he was in desperate need of this and he's stuck there for three more months. The day he got it, he plugged it in, turned it on, and it blew out immediately. He rounded up a screw driver, got the fuses out and put new ones in, it blew immediately, again. Then he ordered more fuses from Amazon, to make sure they were the right kind, and it blew again. This thing has never worked, and he finally was able to return it to Amazon. Don't waste your money. Looks like they are not currently available, so hopefully Amazon decided to drop them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every once in a while a special product comes along that delights....","review":"... and this isn't it. It sounds great (Low power consumption, 46-pints-per-24-hours, UV to kill germs and/or mold), but just doesn't perform. Possibly mine was defective, but it ran 24x7 and managed to remove a few pints per day and was never able to get the humidity down to my desired 50%. I wondered why it wasn't EnergyStar rated at only 440 watts for a 46-pint dehumidifier; the answer seems to be because 46 pints is an extreme exaggeration. After replacing this unit with an EnergyStar-rated Frigidaire, I was able to reach my desired humidity level overnight. Better to run a 1000-watt unit on occasion than to run a 440-watt unit 24x7 and not reach your desired result.The other issue is the drain hose output... I tried leveling the unit and shimming it, I was never able to get the water to go anywhere but the removable bucket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacking some features","review":"We are a military family living in Okinawa, Japan and the climate here is subtropical and the humidity is always very high. Mold and mildew are a common occurance here.

I would really love to know what has happened to the author since publication. I found the book very interesting even though I found the author unrepentant and heavily biased in his interpretation of actual events (read \\"Den of Thieves\\").

I can see why other cops would hate him. Yet everyone else, including gang members, just loves him! And the character is asexual, not homosexual. We never get a sense of his desires, so we never understand why he can't just play it straight.The sex in the book is twisted and disgusting, I guess a reflection of the author's self-hatred. Plus, to top it off, the last chapter is a gratuitous bashing of life in LA in general, with San Francisco being the only place for a gay person to live. That's been done, and this guy's view of life in LA is tragically warped. The author just comes off as tired and bitter, an iceberg who was unsuccessful at finding someone \\"just to hold him\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty Cop stuff!","review":"Ok,Mr Grobeson isn't in Wambaughs class just yet, but I'd buy anything he writes!

They aren't asked if they benefitted from the work, but how they felt about Castaneda's personal life. Was he a con man?

Much better than nothing! But think layers, wind block, reflector, sun block (for shade) and so on.Duct tape and cordage a must to get full effect of options.I would say ground cloth but only as a layer over leaves or something as it is very thin and no insulating value.Good survival mirror!

Thought to test them out before an actual need to use them, and I was extremely surprised to find how thin and strong the material was.It's long enough to cover a 6'2\\" man and wide enough to wrap around my legs, but not completely around my chest. In snow emergency, use one blanket under your body, then use another one to cover yourself; since the blanket works by reflecting your own body heat back to you, but if there are openings, your own heat will escape and you won't be warm. Having the blanket under you and over you will keep the heat on you.I strongly recommend keeping a few with your camping gear, in your car, and in your luggage for when you travel.Just don't tear it intentionally or it will unravel."},{"rating":"1","title":"wolf ticket","review":"not effective.

Better light blockage than most blinds.Cons: It reflects only around 80% of visible light and transmits the other 20%, so that it extends one's ability to sleep from 6:15am to 6:45am at best.This is not like general purpose Mylar -- it is an extra thin kind with lesser reflectivity.

As a professional photographer, I needed to create a large custom softbox for a client's project. The softbox needed to be over 8 foot in size. Unfortunately they don't sell an affordable off-the-shelf solution to what I needed so I decided to make my own. These blankets were the key to my creation.

According multiple sites I needed a Y1 bit to do this. When I got this item the Y1 bit did not fit the Y1 screw. I believe this was because the tip did not come to as fine of a point as it should have.Even if I was mistaken about the screw, I would still not recommend this set. As others mentioned the bits are not good quality. The metal seems of poor quality, the security torx bits are drilled off center, the bits do not stay in place in the case while it is closed, and there is no place to put the screwdriver."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Ok...But Look for something better.","review":"Nice case, but as you can see there is no spot for the ratchet driver, and no handle for case. Although the case is not that big. The \\"Specialty\\" bits only go down to a T7 level, which was disapointing. They should have eliminated the flat heads/hex/phillips tips to accomadate for T1-T6 ( smaller heads for the specialty bits. You will not be able to use this set/case of bits for Cell phones or most newer small electonics.

Both have come in handy with my iMac, Mac Book, Dell and Toshiba. The screwdriver has come in handy for big jobs too. I used it to install 5 closets worth of Elfa. It's a great screwdriver for any size job. Sturdy and well made. Has a magnetic head, which helps with the little stuff.I put my old flat and phillips head screwdrivers in storage.

It worked perfectly. Just be gentle with it because they used cheap plastic construction. Also, one of the \\"adapters within the adapter\\" fits inside the unit (you can see it in the product picture, at the top near the USB plug), and must be removed for use. This creates the possibility of losing it. However, in all fairness, it works. This adapter even accepts the US 3-prong grounded plugs. I also like the indicator lights that tell you when its functions are working. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is its flimsy and cheap construction. Otherwise it gets the job done.

I was first invited into the subject by her personal warmth and sincerity. You can actually feel her spirit! She doesn't waste words, but gets right to the essentials of the healing art/gift. Emphasis is placed on demonstrating a simple and practical technique of Reiki. Drawings and photos of hand positions help to make this a much needed reference for students and teachers alike. Karyn takes you from Reiki 1 to Reiki Master/Teacher, explaining the experience of each level and the steps leading to them. A curriculum for the instruction of each level is provided. As a Reiki Master/Teacher, I highly recommend this book to both students and teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!!","review":"Wow! This song is great! After hearing it maybe only once or twice I fell in love with it. Apparantly, many people thought the same way, because this song has been shooting up the charts.

I'm going back to Fiskars cutters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Balanced","review":"Out of the many works on the subject of Pius XII and the Holocaust, I chose this as a primary source for a research paper in college. Why? Because he lets the reader draw his own conclusions by providing the facts. He doesn't overdo the analysis because he doesn't want to appear biased like many other authors. A good writer of history should be as neutral as possible unless he's specifically trying to prove a point. His goal is to not receive an \\"A+\\" paper by offering too much analysis - it is to lead the reader to their own conclusion. Most of the other authors on this subject pull a veil over the readers eyes by drawing the conclusions for them.Ultimately one comes to the conclusion that Pius XII was not in alliance with Hitler, a fact which Sanchez illustrates with hard facts and evidence. This is certainly a scholarly work. If you do not think so, please compare Mr. Sanchez's bibliography to that of someone like Cornwell's (Hitler's Pope). I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well and great simple sleek gate! Best value online for sure!","review":"Very happy with gate. Easy to install, looks great. Price and value is by far the best available online. I researched for at least an hour trying to find just the right gate. This is perfect! I also had a very standard size 30\\" opening. With a different size I could see possible issues if the extensions did not line it up quite right but the adjusters have a good 3\\" of travel on either side. I would just not trust it quite as much if they were fully extended. Pretty cool it comes with 2 extensions. I saw many other gates you have to buy the extensions separate. Also as a side note my 5 year old can open it just fine first try. We wanted that and my 2 year old can not. Perfect! Also keeps dog out. 3 for 1 :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use!","review":"I love this gate. It's easy to open, it swings close by itself (even though it won't shut closed if it's not alligned properly) and it stays wide open when needed. It opens by lifting the actual gate up, so there aren't any latches that might break. My only issue is the lock... I can't figure out how my dog (a 65 lbs boxer) is able to open it even when locked. I might have to set up a camera to see how he does it. Other than that, I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the price.","review":"Good construction. Great price. You can't go wrong with this product.I use it for my pet dog Havanese to keep him secured in his room at bedtime. Can also be used for a toddler although not certain if the locking mechanism would be ideal. Even in the lock position it can be pushed to break open with moderate force. For a pet, it's great. For a toddler, not certain. You might have to consider a higher priced gate. But for me, very satisfied.

No complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy-Close Gate","review":"Very good light duty gate. Simple pressure-mounted installation. Opens easily with one hand with a slight lift, closes nicely on its own with a gentle push back. Spring loaded, pin-in-groove locking mechanism allows for a more secure barrier if needed. Perfect for keeping our dogs out of the den area. My only complaint was that its appearance out of the box made it look like it wouldn't close/lock properly and appeared incapable of properly closing. I actually sent the first one back, thinking it was defective. After proper installation by tightening down enough on the pressure mounts, however, it's worked fine for the past few weeks we've had it. Better illustrations in the installation guide would have avoided this confusion. Otherwise, a quality gate and worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUPERGATE -- NOT","review":"Description and reviews do not fit the product I received. I have made do with nylon cord and a menswear tie. The mechanism for closing gate does not work. It also seems that the sides of the room entrance where this thing is to be used are not plumb (opening measures the same but WTH) so it is difficult to fit gate tightly. One of the extensions comes loose at the bottom. The cord secures the wayward extension, and the tie works at the top for the so-called latch. I've put together Home Decorators and Ikea furniture with less frustration and better results. Since this is to be used as a pet gate rather than for children, I will keep it but do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"shug1","review":"Just not what we were hoping for. We need a barrier for the top of our steps. To be used between a wall and a wood banister.

Both have similar design and construction, both are pressure mounted, very sturdy and nice looking. The difference is that the Supergate Easy-Close has a feature which allows it to stay open in either direction, which is really great! This is not stated in the product description. The Dreambaby gate is slightly nicer looking but does not have the stay-open feature and I am finding this very annoying. The Supergate also has an opening mechanism which is, in my opinion, slightly easier to operate than the Dreambaby. And I found it was not necessary to use the stick-on cups for pressure mounting. I just cut out one of those grippy rubbery things (sold for gripping jar lids to open them) and put them between the wall and mounting surface. Works nicely so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"No Assembly Required\\" completely misleading","review":"30 minutes later the gate is up and relatively functional, but we chose this gate among the countless highly reviewed choices on amazon based solely on the distinguishing factor of \\"no assembly required.\\" Not only was assembly required, the instructions are a cross between Greek and a fighter jet instruction manual.Also, the tightening process on the tension mounts is really awkward, and the success of actually opening the gate and walking thru it is based on the tightening process; once we thought we had the right tightness, the actual opening action felt shoddy, and there's definitely concern over time the thin plastic at the opening hinge will wear down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok gate","review":"My husband got this to keep out kids out of our bathroom. I read the reviews on the other 10,000 gates available for purchase and I'm glad that I chose this one.

The hold open feature is great when carrying laundry or bengal tigers in to my son's room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product","review":"WOW, I was soooo surprised when UPS drove up today and delivered my 3 gates, I had thought I would not get delivery before the 15th of this month.Purchased them to keep my beautiful 3 month old Shih Tzu puppy safe and sound. Two for my deck that she so loves playing on and one to keep her out of my kitchen. I am more than pleased with the gates. Very easy to assemble the construction is great, and they are attractive. I have to retro fit one of the gates for the deck, but not due to the gate design, but rather due to the siding on my home and the fact that I do not have a post on the siding side of the stairway.I had purchased a different companies gate at a local store. I am usually pretty handy, but for the life of me I couldn't figure out how to put it together, no to mention the construction is poor at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"I wasn't really expecting a lot from this gate, I needed a secondary gate to provide close off a little used door way. After using it for a while, I ended up switching it to the primary door way. It is just so easy to open and I love the self closing feature and stay open feature. This inexpensive gate turned into a great product, I would definitely get another one when needed. Like everyone I'm sure, it does look a bit wonky when you get it out of the box, like it isn't made right. You just keep tightening the knobs until the fit is just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for our needs!","review":"We bought this to block off an area for our 7 month old Corgi puppy while we were gone during the day because I hated leaving him in his crate or small confined area. It fits the opening to our hallway perfectly, has a tight secure fit and doesn't damage the wall. The swinging door is the best part of this! It can open both ways and stay in an open position! It was super easy to install and seems pretty durable. We have used it for 2 months now and are very pleased with it. I waited to buy it when it was on sale too and that made it an even better purchase! Since we will be starting a family pretty soon, I am sure this will be great as a baby safety gate! I've had my friend's kids over and it's been kid-tested and approved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dog Gate - Bar Gap Comment","review":"This gate works well for dogs. It is easy to assemble, sturdy, and the built-in door feature alleviates having to step over the gate.Please note that the manufacturer does not give the dimensions between the bars. In doing research, it has the smallest gap that I could find, but it still may prove to be too wide for some dogs at about 2 1/2\\" if I remember correctly. I have a 3lb chihuahua with a head a little bit wider than the bar gap. I've tested it and trained her not to try to squeeze through the bars, but you never know what dogs will try.Otherwise, I am happy with the gate. It isn't too noticable in the room and the gate stays open both ways when you swing it past a certain point. I would recommend it to dog owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I liked this so well I bought a second one. I can open the gate easily with just one finger while juggling other items. I love that it self closes, or i you open it all the way you can get it to stay open. Great gate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to believe people use anything else","review":"This gate is easy to install, rugged, firm, esay to use, and good looking!Among its many features it is self-latching, has a security lock, it has a hold-open position, and a self-closing feature.I find it hard to believe people use anything else (specially at this price)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"... ... Works great and is even Better then I expected. Nice features, suts on its own or stay open if you want it to. Looks nice and its sturdy! ... ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"gates","review":"I love this gate! Very Helpful in keeping people from tripping over other gates that don't open. Good height if you don't have any issues with cats going over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"This is a great pressure-mounted gate. I like how it comes with extensions. It fits well even if you don't have much wall space (the wall only juts out about 2 inches from our bottom step). It's super easy to open and has an automatic close feature, all you have to do is give it a little swing. I have no problems going through it while carrying my baby up or down the stairs. If you have the space, I would recommend The First Years Hands Free Gate over this one (it has a large foot pedal that may not fit small staircases). It feels SLIGHTLY more sturdy, but overall I am very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never \\"came together\\"","review":"No matter how I tightened or adjusted the closing never fully came together. Its also EXTREMELY narrow. I was using this at the bottom of stairs and it just made going up and down soooo difficult! Sent it back and got another Cardinal Gates Stairway Special gate (which I also use at the top). See my review there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this gate!","review":"We ordered this gate to be able to lock our dog in the laundry room while we're away at work. It shipped quickly, was very easy to assemble and install but the best part is that it is made sturdy and operates easy. The gate opens and closes easily but locks securely in place when it closes. We love the bronze color too as it blends in with our decor and doesn't show dirt or wear because of use.I would highly recommend this gate to anyone is looking for something for their pet or small children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product!","review":"Loved the gate but unfortunately about 3 inches to small for the opening, I used a block of wood to fill in fot the extra space we have and then it worked great.I does look bent whwn it comes out of the box but as soon as installed all is fine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works for my needs","review":"needed for dogs (labs) I have installed on stairs to be able to keep dogs up or down. Like that you can walk thru and door will stay open if you wish. once installed it is very sturdy. Takes a bit to get it up, about 15 minutes, but once up... I am very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use gates","review":"We bought them to keep our cats out of certain rooms. Surprisingly they don't jump over them and it keeps them out. Very easy to use and pretty unobtrusive looking. They do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased with this gate","review":"Very easy to use, easy to install, and if you need to have a gate up, this one looks great. Have one on each side of my kitchen to keep my large pitbull puppy contained during the day when he's home alone. Holds up well to him jumping up on it - has never moved out of place. And we did NOT screw it not the wall. We used the extension piece on one of the doorways, works like a charm. Very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and reliable gate","review":"I own a martial arts studio and I have a toddler playing area. This is the door holding the toddlers from escaping the playpen. As you can imagine the toddler play area gets swamped by much bigger kids and the door becomes abused by all kids. Also parents who does not try to learn how to open the gates properly will try to use force opening them. So the other gates did not last more than 6-months.However, this gate, costing much less than all other ones I picked up from Toys-R-us, Target, and Walmart, is holding well for about a year now. I think it'll last another year easy. So if you have a high-traffic kids area, I recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Puppy Gate","review":"Sturdy--quality metal construction. Easy to install if you just read the directions first. It will square up as you tighten the knobs. I am using this without installing the cups permanently into the woodwork, though it is recommended, and I am having no issues with operation or safety. The 'stay open' feature is nice. I'm just a few calories short of 300 lbs and I have no trouble going through the gate opening. Keeps a 12 week old Lab puppy where it belongs, but does not keep it isolated like a shut door, which is why I bought it. Only reason it is not 5* is that I would prefer it to be several inches taller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I like how the door will stay open if you open it all the way. It's well designed and easy to use. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great baby gate, easy to install","review":"This is a great pressure gate and very easy to install. Bought this to keep my 9 month old in our family room. I like the feature which allows for the gate to swing both ways. The gate will also hold open when you don't need to have it shut. I purchased another baby gate brand and now wish I would have just bought this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic gate","review":"We got this gate to enclose our puppy in the kitchen/family room. My teenagers installed it in less than 15 minutes. Great features: door swings both ways, door swings closed (but not locked; although you can \\"lock it\\" by lifting it and it catches in the neutral position, we rarely do), you can keep the door open if you swing it open fully. We leave it swung closed away from the kitchen. This let's our cat push it open to get through from hall to kitchen but puppy cannot push it the other way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet and Very Efficient","review":"I've now had this humidifier for a year.It is extremely efficient. With a new filter installed I have had as much as 8 gallons of through-put (water put into the air by the unit) in 24 hours. The efficiency is such that I seldom have to run the unit at the highest fan setting. (This is the only one of the three settings at which you can hear the unit from more than about six feet away.)Water hardness where I live is such that, even with relatively non-drying heating system (hot water radiators), the amount of through-put means the filter needs replacing about once a month. This is an expense you will have with any evaporative humidifier, so should not be counted as a negative for this product. The unit will not indicate a new filter is needed. Just pay attention to length of fan being on--when the fan is on for long periods but little water is being used, it's time to replace the filter.I would purchase this product again in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable but great when it works","review":"I have bought this at Lowes as well 3 weeks ago and exchanged it today for another one. I worked great for 2 weeks. Used filtered water but slowly started to not deliver the same humidity level. Even after the cleaning in 2nd week as recommended, it still didn't change the fact that it finally wasn't producing any steam this past week. Today I have a new one again from Lowes. It already used it all of the water in 4 hours and works great. Let's see how often I will have to replace these.Wonderful when it works - think it's hit or miss. Keep your receipts for returns, warranties."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bargain, but be warned...","review":"I should probably start this by saying that I love Shostakovich. That being said, I would highly recommend his string quartets to anyone, especially at this price. This set is a great bargain. I have no qualms with the quality of the recording. However, I did not realize when I bought it that this was a LIVE recording. I find the fact that the applause is included to be highly annoying. However, if you do not mind, then go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eloquent","review":"The complete string quartets of Shostakovich are presented here on 5 CDs by the members of the Emerson String Quartet with fiery eloquence. This music, together with the quartets by Bartok and Carter, form a body of work as significant in its way as were the 19th century string quartets by Beethoven. These Emerson performances compare well against the gold standard of the Borodin Quartet recordings. (There is more than one appropriate way to play any given piece of music, as well as many inappropriate ways.)The clarity of sound on these CDs is superb. These were live performances before a remarkably hushed audience in a room at Aspen that was acoustically designed for chamber music. The result is a presence and excitement not often found on digital recordings. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good summary","review":"In my first year of teaching and enrolled full time in college I have very little time to wrestle with textbooks! I found this book to be very detailed for the amount of material it covers. The worksheets aren't essential, but could be good for someone who is not in a classroom every day. Good coverage--addressing the eternal question of depth vs. breadth, and it does well enough at both!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why hide what's inside?","review":"Amazon has an easy way for publishers to share what is \\"inside the textbook,\\" but this publisher chooses not to use it. If the publisher is too ashamed of the book to let people browse it, why should anyone purchase the book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy it from textbooksrus.com unless you want huge ugly stickers all over it","review":"The book itself is fine. I ordered it because it is a required textbook.It should be an inexpensive book considering its physical quality (almost coloring book quality paper).Some sections are straight forward but the theories can be incredibly dry. I've started marking, circling, highlighting and underlining important information; otherwise, like my classmates, I get to the bottom of the page and don't remember what I've read.I've found it useful to highlight using pencil highlighters (aka \\"bible highlighters\\").This book is fine, but don't order from --TEXTBOOKSRUS--, because they slap a huge, ugly sticker on the front cover, the title page and the copyright page. Don't try to remove the stickers, because that just makes things worse.All in all, not a bad book. It has useful information; just watch the Marketplace vendor --TEXTBOOKSRUS--."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and crammed with mostly useless information.","review":"I was very disappointed with this textbook. It seems that the authors have crammed the book full of as much information as possible whether it is useful or not. There are a few good parts in the book, but you have to wade through so much irrelevant, wordy garbage that it isn't worth it to find the few gems.It really isn't necessary to have 6 paragraphs on cell phones in schools. I didn't need a book to tell me that I shouldn't leave my valuables lying around the classroom. The book instructs teachers not to touch electrical cords with wet hands.If you can't figure this stuff out on your own, then you aren't fit to run a cash register, let alone a classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and reliable.","review":"I ordered my book on a Friday and it was here by Monday.

Turns out this battery is thicker than the original. Sure it fits the phone, and I'm sure it works as a battery, but my phone no longer fits in the clip-in belt holster that I use 24/7. Great - now I have to find a new way to carry it, and I can't trust another blind purchase because there's no telling whether a different holster is going to fit.Hooray for crappy documentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold a charge","review":"Purchased this as a replacement battery for the Samsung X427. This was the only place I could find it since the phone is older. The new battery did not hold a charge for any longer than the original one I had for two years. I returned it to Amazon and they sent another free of charge. The second one is really no better than the first and also does not hold a charge for very long (more than a day).

While it isn't a funny as Toy Story it is better then a Bug's life. The boogie man is real and monsters really do live inside your closet in this movie.

Crystal has a bunch of funny lines but overall I found this to be as much if not more of a human interest story than a comedy.There is a lot of sentimentality to it, even overdone a bit at the end, but that's okay. There is absolutely nothing offensive in here, either. The colors look spectacular, too, and I'm anxious to check it out when it comes out on Blu-Ray in several months."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT>>LOVE IT>>LOVE IT","review":"We LOVE this movie....it is funny and it is just an all around good movie!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Monsters, Inc!","review":"This is my boyfriends favorite movie, so I thought it would be fun to buy him a special blu-ray/DVD version of it!

This is ONE way to cure kids from being afraid of monsters in their closet! In fact, kids may begin looking inside their closets in hopes of spotting one!The pace moves along steadily and I never got bored. Time seemed to fly by as I watched.Here is a movie that adults and children alike will watch over and over and over ...Great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOMERUN.........AGAIN","review":"Leave it to Pixar to create, besides another blockbuster, a really touching story. In the grand tradition of Toy Story 2 and its predecessor and A Bug's Life, Pixar and Disney's fourth collaboration doesn't disappoint. Mike and Sulley are, what else? Monsters!! They work in a factory where each monster is assigned a door leading to a child's bedroom. Their job is to scare the child and collect the kids' screams. When one child, \\"Boo\\", crosses over to the monsters' side, Sulley befriends her and learns the importance of friendship, love, and hope. For you snifflers, bring extra tissues. Not only is the movie phenomenal, this DVD is packed full of goods. Looks like Pixar has delivered once again. I can't wait to see what Disney and Pixar cook up for their next meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE!!","review":"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!

By collecting the screams from children the monster are able to power the monster universe. Using a closet door portal system, monsters are able to access the bedrooms of children to sneak in scare the ba-jesus out of them for \\"scare power\\". Unfortunately for them a human girl child was able to follow Sully back through the door and that where the real adventure starts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pixar did it again","review":"What can I say? This movie is fantastic.Although probably not appropriate for the youngest of viewers, those over age 8 or so will get a kick out of Pixar's newest twist: those monsters in your closet are actually scared of kids!! This movie follows two of the monster world's \\"Top Scarers\\" as they try to find a child who has escaped into their world -- without anyone else finding out about it.Billy Crystal and John Goodman are both excellent as Mike and Sully, the main characters. Also, the voice actress for Boo, the little girl, is spectacular. This is the first movie that I have ever seen to use \\"baby talk\\" realistically, and also with humor. This movie will give both adults and children something to laugh about.As for features, there are some good featurettes included that explore \\"The Making Of...\\", plus an added scene or two. I wasn't that impressed by the \\"extras\\" but the movie itself is DEFINITELY worth it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monsters, Inc.","review":"I really enjoyed this Disney movie. Others I have thought were less than funny, somewhat boring, or what have you; but this movie kept me laughing throughout its entirety. Mike, the little green ball, particularly amused me.

Quite clever. *laughs*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pixar Doesn't Disappoint","review":"'Monsters, Inc.' is the story of what happens behind the closet door. There's a whole world of children-fearing monsters back there. Some are good, some are evil, and all are funny.In case you aren't familiar with Pixar, all their movies are computer animated. In my opinion, they produce the highest quality animated movies out today. I think they've passed up their cousin, the Disney traditionally animated movie. 'Monsters, Inc.' is just as good as all the other Pixar movies: 'Toy Story', 'A Bugs Life', and 'Toy Story 2'. Every member of your family will enjoy 'Monsters, Inc.' - there are jokes and gags in there for everyone.Pixar also knows how to package a DVD. There are tons of special features. Especially funny is the outtakes. Buy this movie - and lock your child's door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film.

The animation is excellent and the voices by John Goodman and Billy Crystal are hilarious. The general story is as follows: the monsters scare children in order to collect their screams which they use to power their world (pretty much like electricity) but then a little girl gets loose in the monster world and all hell breaks loose with very amusing results. One of my favourite parts of the movie would be the monster play at the end of the movie entitled \\"Put that thing back where it came from or so help me\\". Its a musical. In conclusion, top notch stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Classic!","review":"This one isn't just for the kids! My new favorite movie is Monsters Inc.

Same goes for some other monster elements and thebreaking-voiced maintenance worker boy character. One bigdifference with the Simpsons however is that the Simpsons is funnyand this was pathetically unfunny. From the rip-off startingpremise, the concept then becomes tediously convoluted - in otherwords, a 95-minute mess (not that I was able to endure the entire95 minutes). Once again, Disney tries to appeal to all age groupsbut fails to appeal to any age group as a lot of material is tooscarey for small children and too trite for grown-ups.

It's got great animation, characters and a well thought out story, but it might be a little too intense for the youngest viewers.

This is one of the BEST movies we own. The only 2 I'd rate above this would eb Shrek & Shrek II. The story line is easy for my son to follow and provided him with many hours of entertainment. It does have a few concepts that are not appropriate, but are presented in a way that is way over the heads of children adn does have a few scenes that very concervative parents may term violent.

They keep making films that kids love, parent's love, and are only rated G (in other words, they never pull cheap laughs, like Shrek did every once in a while, earning them PG status). Monsters, Inc., is a great movie, very funny and has it's moments of peril, and it's moments of fun. The technology behind this movie is so complex now, that if the world was not 'stylized', they could make you believe it's for real!

Toy story, A bugs' life and so on.But, it does have an unbelievable supply of extras that come with it. OVER THREE HOURS OF EXTRAS. Some of them are even worth watching.

I think there are more effective videos to teach reading out there, and the Muppet shows and School House Rock stand the test of time better for entertainment value.The most interesting aspect of the show that I certainly never grasped as a little kid: the cheesy innuendos.

There is the offer to buy this AND the Best of Electric Company together. My advice...don't buy them together! They fail to tell you that the five episodes on \\"Best of the Best\\" are also included on the 4 disc set, so you will have 2 copies of these five episodes if you buy both.

I was then thrilled when I heard there was a DVD in the works of their HBO Concert Special. Recorded with 20+ cameras, HBO really enhanced the experience by getting you up close, something that many would appreciate.Although this DVD is bare bones with basically a photo album being the only bonus material, the concert is enough.

I could've saved my money and just recorded the concert when it aired on HBO. Plus it also shows that they don't change their show. I took my 10 year-old cousin to see them at Nassau Coliseum back in November, and the whole thing was identical to what you saw on HBO. The whole thought of going to a concert, is to see something different. These guys need to mix up the songs a bit, or change some of the choreography (some of the dances have not changed since the last tour). I know these guys have the talent,so there is no need for it to be redundant. Even my little cousin left disappointed. There were no suprises, nothing to make you feel like your concert was special.

The tracking is off and you can't fix it manually. I dislike the remote - the control buttons for which unit you are controlling are hard to find - buried in the middle of the all the buttons. There is no volume control or easily identifiable tracking buttons on the remote. The stop button is also the rewind button, and it kept doing the opposite of what I was trying to make it do.

He wanted to snag the pitchpipe that came with it, so I told him I would share it. I didn't have any problems with the bridge or the strings. If you know the proper way to tune a violin that has very slack strings for shipping purposes you'll do fine. If this is your first violin, take it to a violin music store and they will set the bridge and tune it for you (usually for free). Being new strings, they are still stretching and I found myself tuning them after every couple of songs... but that is to be expected.

If you let the head soak long enough, it is the best mop ever: if not, complaints are not justified. My problem has always been the handle. Some snapped in half. All the others, the telescoping mechanism constantly slips down. Since the mop is so wonderful, I suffer the handle by putting a ton of duct tape around the telescoping part in an effort to stop the movement. Apart from that, highly recommended as durable, non-smelling, fast drying, picks up all dust and pet hair amazingly.

Super absorbent and leaves my 1000'+ of tile and ceramic floors almost dry. Amazing mop!Read about those reviewers who's mop heads popped out. Never been a problem here. Trick is to follow the directions. Let the mop head soak completely BEFORE you wring it out. Otherwise, you have a rock-hard dry mop head that will of course pop out when you try to force the wringer over it. Soak the mop head soft like the instructions tell you to and you will have no problems. Impatient forcing = bad results. Common sense and following instructions = great mop.

The mop performed reasonably well on my tile floor, but when I tried it on my laminate floor, it morphed into The Mop From Hell. The PVC rubber created such a friction with the laminate, it literally forced all my stomach muscles to clench just trying to get it to budge an inch! And once I got enough momentum to grind it against the surface, after a couple strokes, the head dried up and I had to start the torturous ordeal anew. Additionally, the lever to wring the mop head - while it is effective - is situated really low down to the floor. So either you have to mop with a strange neanderthal crouch, or you have to constantly joist the mop up to reach the wringer. And lastly, the scrub-ability ain't that great either. Works fine on regular blotches, but the rubber is so dense, any force you use just gets absorbed instead of directed at the stain. Yup - the immense physical strain certainly warrants it being the mop from hell..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy Customer!!!!","review":"I was very disappointed with my purchase.

The main appeal is simply its homage to an innocent age (if there ever was one!).It was interesting see Nancy Davis, who became Nancy Reagan.At first, she appeared pretty plain bit the more I view this movie, the prettier she gets...especially her eyes. The story, without spoiling it, is simply about people who hear God talking through the radio to them, trying to get them to think about things.Theology-wise, the movie is pretty vague and general, not wanting to offend anyone but it still had a good message. Overall, I guess you could label this film \\"a curiosity piece\\" and certainly a slice of Americana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good***","review":"First, I am very pleased to see this movie on DVD. I owned it a few years ago on VHS. I have seen the movie numerous times. Why do I like it? No cursing, or suggestive themes. A very clean movie, especially when compared to the drivel being put out today.You see how characters change as they begin to realize that a Voice they have heard on the radio is no ordinary voice. The transformation of the characters is very encouraging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could this really occur? How would we react?

The DJ played the whole thing from beginning to end (unedited!). Granted, the whole original disc is only 30 minutes long, I stood next to my stereo in awe for those 30 minutes. I laughed my head off while at the same time wondering if I should feel guilty for even listening to such \\"trash.\\" I had never heard anything like it... at the time when most thrash bands were trying to be serious and \\"deep,\\" S.O.D. made a joke of everything around them including their own genre. This album is a classic. There has never been another disc to even come close. MOD pales in comparison and A.C. is just plain awful. This disc is raw and loud but with a great abundance of melody. Don't take the lyrics too seriously - these songs were written with the intent of being offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal at its funniest!","review":"This is the most hilarious album I have ever heard!!! All the songs are awesome, even the ones under ten seconds.

It's slow mediocre metal geared towards insulting women, gays, immigrants, and much much more! If Hitler floats your boat, this is the WhiteTrash Epiphany Album of the Millenium! Ignorance is Bliss! Listen to this while you graze in your pasture."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys suck","review":"These guys have no talent what so ever. This is the stuff that losers listen too.

Really, this government should legalize kaning and give these little boys a lesson in humility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignorant But Funny!","review":"This CD is a side project of members of Anthrax. To some people, this CD might be considered offensive, but that's only because they take S.O.D. seriously. S.O.D. is as about as serious as A.C. or GWAR. Some of the album's highlights are \\"F--- the Middle East\\" and \\"Pi Alpha Nu\\". Oh, and Sgt.D rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thrash/Punk Music!","review":"This is good stuff.

This reissue should have also included \\"Ram it\\" but it doesn't. This album has been digitally remastered and though it does sound a little better it's not much better. When I got this version the other day I was expecting it to blow me away but you still need to turn the volume up some on this.

Our company started the implementation process (yes, you can buy workbooks!) and I was startled by the lack of accountability this book encourages. The process of responsibility only goes up in this book, and the examples it provides deal primarily with management. The principles of feedback and coaching are important, but I can't see myself, a wage slave, being any more accountable than I already am. So if you're thinking of buying this book, buy it for yourself and don't foist it upon your company like my bosses did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manager","review":"In my years of attempting to implement performance strategies, I've found few processes that foster consistency, buy-in, and results like the Oz Principle. This common-sense approach to achieving individual, departmental, or organizational accountability allows all employees to get on the same page in pursuing the course and ultimately arriving at full accountability. It's a must read and a must do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Melodic Rock Album","review":"Crown of Thorns is another quality AOR/melodic rock group on the Frontiers/Now & Then label. The band, which is led by singer/guitarist/songwriter Jean Beauvier, plays fairly straightforward, not too heavy, melodic rock with a few quirks. To my ears they sound like the offspring of TNT and Enuff Znuff. Their 1996 album features a cover of the Beatles classic Don't Let Me Down.Breakthrough is a fun album that should go over quite well with AOR fans, particularly at Amazon's relatively low price.The track listing is as follows:1. Over My Head2. Don't Let Me Down3. You Wear It Well4. Only One Who's Lonely5. Breakthrough6. Right from Wrong7. You8. Heartbeat9. Leave it to Fate10. He's a Fool11. Down to the River12.

This gorgeous volume combines large-scale reproductions of 130 of his paintings with some 250 color photos of surviving uniforms and equipment from museums and collections around the country (including Troiani's own). After a couple hours of page-turning, I went back and spent much more time studying the depictions of units of special interest to me, such as the Washington Artillery of New Orleans and Terry's Texas Rangers. The variety in uniforms and insignia is staggering, especially compared to the \\"uniformity\\" of modern military uniforms. As usual, he includes extensive technical notes and specs, as well as an annotated guide to artifact collections. It's not a cheap book, but it's worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good--But Could Have Been Better","review":"Troiani's work is always top-notch. I would have given this book a 5-star rating, except that several units are covered more than once, which means other interesting uniforms were not included at all. I realize that with the sheer volume of his work it becomes a matter of picking and choosing, but I still would have appreciated wider coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!! it will arrive in pieces guaranteed","review":"the pot came broken and shattered. they make the return difficult so that the fewer returns they have the more money they make. they want people to buy it and they don't care if its broken because the effort it takes to return it is not worth the few dollars you will get back. and evidence of my comments are completely true because when you try to return it they won't even allow an exchange because they know you will just keep receiving broken clay pots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have listened to the other reviews!!!","review":"I read the other reviews before purchasing and was naive enough to think when I go my Terracotta it would not be broken.

I was searching for something along the line of All-clad, so that the 3 metal layers created the entire pot, not just a circle on the bottom. The All-Clad were a bit out of my price range and too heavy for me to lift when I tested in the store, and that was empty. This set isn't quite as heavy but retains the good quality I was looking for. I really like the handles as well, very comfortable and stay cool as long as heat from a neighboring burner doesn't reach it. They cook evenly, with low heat as suggested and anything that sticks on, comes off easily after soaking in hot sudsy water. I would definitely recommend this line off pots if you are looking to invest in a lasting set, but not break the bank as much as All-clad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"Great price..Love the handles.I've been cooking commercially for over 10 years...Hard to come by a more all around satisfying set of cookware..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for research, anti-imperialist POV","review":"Well written and researched.

This is the second of three different types of all-in-ones that I tried.The handle is very unergonomic, and the screwdriver weighs a lot. Worse the weight is distributed poorly.The bits in the handle seem like a good idea, theoretically, but one bit I pulled out (instead of sliding it out) kept falling out until I bent the holder back into shape. And, no the instructions don't tell you to slide them, nor is it obvious. Plus metal shavings came off of the one bit I used!Perhaps some people will benefit from the 4:1 speed mode, but I didn't. If you really need this I think you'll be much happier with an electric screwdriver.I just bought this today at Target:STANLEY 9 in 1 Screwdriver Set Model 62-511So far I am so much happier with it.I'm going to return the SmartPro to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!","review":"This is my favorite album of Whitesnake of the seventies, Take me with you, Day trippe, this time is right for love.....This album is like a thin lizzy's style, but only in this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Dream House/Future Trance Album","review":"Richi M. is a master of dance music.

All of his conclusions are based on extensive quotations by recognized experts in the field.This book is fair and objective in all respects and deserves honest consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Book","review":"Ed Bulkley takes the anti-psychology argument to such extreme it becomes a sort of spiritual McCarthyism, actually limiting God. No true believer would deny the power and authority of God's Word, but that doesn't mean you throw out all other valid forms of knowledge including the study of God's magnificent creation--the human mind.If you had a loved one with deep mental problems, where would you rather seek help? Would it be one of Ed Bulkley's novice biblical counselors who don't know a neuron from a kneecap, or a professional Christian psychologist, who combines his knowledge of the inner workings of the mind with biblical truth to produce the best of all counseling results?This book goes beyond why Christians can't \\"trust\\" psychology to a legalistic ranting of why Christians can't use the science of psychology in any way, shape, or form.

I have been in Pubs in Ireland (Dingle Pennisula/Dublin) and they would not be singing most of this stuff now or then. It would put everyone to sleep.

There are better albums by each artist(s). Some may find this album a bit melancholy for an 'Irish pub album' But it's a great introduction to the music, the artists, and a superb value for six bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the reissued versions!!!!!","review":"Just to clarify the music...These tracks come from the first two albums of the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. They are called \\"Rising of the Moon\\" and \\"Come Fill Your Glass With Us\\" These tracks were recently reissued on Rykodisc, restored and remastered. Frankly, they sound AMAZING! This complation has terrible sound quality, and the recordings sound like they were copied from an old LP. Don't settle for this ugly sounding reissue, go and check out the remastered versions. Unless you are on a serious budget, get the other discs.

Lenny Bruce is an interesting guy and I think it's very insightful just of life and society in general and of all their inconsistencies. Though today, I'm sure, is much different than Lenny's era, most of what he has to say still applies. He can be really funny at times, but I'd say its a darker humor. I remember thinking it dragged just a bit when he gets deep into his legal battle near the end of the book but overall it kept me entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"you don't even have to know who he is","review":"You don't have to be a fan of Lenny Bruce to love this book, you don't have to really know who he is (I really only know him from a few recordings and by reputation).

This book should be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable for Understanding Comedy","review":"It is not a stretch to say that Lenny Bruce, along with Richard Pryor and George Carlin, changed what stand up comedy is and let it be what we know it as today. This book gives you a glimpse into how Lenny Bruce became that driving force, taking comedy out of the Catskills and moving it into the mainstream. If you love comedy you owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebel with a cause","review":"Lenny Bruce, though a profligate by some standards, comes across as a persevering and sincere man in his own way. His agenda is to break the convention and to push the envelope of the society through humor, to uncover the hypocrisy and to bring out the truth from beneath the sheets. Still, relative to the title, and contrary to Bruce's reputation, I found the book's humor less than satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"...

It was a much stronger told story than Voigt's more experimental Orfe. All the characters get a chance to mature over the course of Jackaroo and enough loose ends are tied up by the conclusion to give the book a satisifying sense of closure while still leaving the Kingdom interesting enough to start off a series of book. I certainly will want to read more of the books in this series! The book would have been even better if Voigt had tightened up the first half of the book where she introduces Gwyn and her motivations for her adventures in the second half of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"I read the other reviews complaining about the lack of actionin the book, and have to strongly disagree with them. It's sad thatpeople prefer mindless \\"action\\" to finely-crafted characters, engaging plots, vivid settings, and meaningful messages, all of which this book has in full.These are the reasons that this book is one of my favorites. Voigt has written a classic tale, and the messages contained within this book are applicable not only in the vivid medieval-type setting where Jackaroo takes place, but in our time as well. Gwyn is a genuine heroine, in a way that anybody can be a hero: she knows what is right and makes an effort to bring the rightness about. Burl is a wonderful compliment to Gwyn.And if you absolutely MUST have your action, there's enough of it towards the end of the book to satisfy anybody. Give this book a try, it's an amazing example of the potentials of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Voigt's worse books.","review":"Cynthia Voigt is one of my favorite authors, but this book was not her best. Jackaroo is very boring at some parts of this book. I read this book for a summer reading book report and halfway through the summer I decided that I needed to choose a different book to read. Another thing that was bad about the book was that the pages were horribly bound together and as soon as I started reading the book, they began to fall out. If you do read this book, try to get it in the hardcover edition, because the book is not worth trying to balance all the pages as you read it. The only person who I would recommend reading this book is a person who really likes fantasy and andventure books, otherwise, I would skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful","review":"The book Jackaroo is so awful I couldn't finish reading it.

One i did not like it because the author seemed to go on and on and on about the simplest things some times distorting the picture in my head. Two the last 20 or so pages was all the action the rest was just detailes. I think Cnthia Voight should rewrite Jackaroo and make it much, much more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent tedium","review":"I have merely one suggestion--read this book if you have insomnia.

I think anyone who likes adventure ought to read this. The only thing I didn't like about it was the odd way in which the author wrote it. Some parts blend in the with the plot perfectly, others don't. At the end, you get the idea that it was a bit rusty. But I think it was very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mattress topper","review":"I really enjoyed this mattress topper. I purchased a king size topper for a queen size bed, and cut the topper to fit my bed, based on other reviews. I was not able to sleep in the bed without my back hurting before I got the topper.

I'm selfish like that. Then, after they left (\\"Give it a chance,\\" said my father-in-law; my mother-in-law just gave me the mystical, \\"You didn't have to do that.\\"), we moved it up to our 10-year-old mattress (with access to master bath).

As a result, my pillow was too high and my neck was at an odd angle. Perhaps, I need to buy a thinner pillow when using this type of memory foam but I think it's related more to the density factor of this product.Pretty much agree with everyone else here who states, you get what you pay for.I give 1 star for the product and 1 star because they accepted the return without issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven","review":"I'm so happy with my purchase.

I can't imagine what it would feel like when the heating kicks in or during the summer. We are returning it and looking for something that is truly ventilated.Incidentally, while a lot of memory foam gets hot, there is variation in brands. Our Nature's Sleep memory foam mattress does not heat up. It is a tad firm for my liking so I bought the tooper to make it softer but until I find something better, I'll take firm over hot anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too soft","review":"The title tells it all. It starts to be good if you weigh 250+ pounds. Otherwise you end up sinking in it and having a sore back.

After a long busy day it is so wonderful looking forward to crawling into bed, knowing I will be so comfortable and warm. It does get a bit warm in the middle of the night, but does not bother me or my husband, we just toss comforter off for a bit. The 3 inch thickness is perfect. This is one of the best purchases I have made. Very reasonably priced and most definitely worth it. Would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The delivery was really quick and I appreciated that. The smell lasted longer than they made it sound but it did go away.The pad is true to the measurements they gave but they cut them two inches shorter and narrower than the true size of the mattress. They say they do that to ensure it will fit. I bought a full and kind of wish I had gotten a queen and cut down to size.I got it to help make my air mattress better. And it did for the most part. Unfortunately, it seems to attract water. I've had it on my air mattress for a couple months and just today while I was recentering it noticed it was wet underneath. So I took it off and there is mold on it. How am I supposed to clean that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"odor overpowered everything","review":"The minty smell was so strong that even after we removed from the room it stayed on the sheets and mattress for days.

We torn everything off again and I pretty much soaked it with gain frefreeze. I hope it helps.As far as the comforter, my husband likes a 2 in but I like the 4 in so we went in the middle and went a 3 In. It is very comfortable butthead pad isnt as cool as it is described.

This product within 3 months of my son using it (he's 29 and 165 lbs.) is now useless. I bought it for my twin guest bed that is extra firm, at first, it was adequate and seemed better than an egg crate. Within 3 months it lost it's cushion in the middle between his chest and butt, and now it's like having nothing on the bed. I paid too much for this to have given out so soon. It's not like he's that big a guy. I thought at first it was better than an egg crate topper but now know better. Starts out with a bang and ends quickly with a thud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot for me, but worth it.","review":"I bought this last Sept. to put on an ancient mattress set that was so horrible to sleep on. This topper, once the smell dissipated (placed in another room for a week or so), was soooooo nice to lay down on. My shoulder, back & hips stopped aching, and my husband's back stopped hurting too. But this thing is hot, hot, hot. It doesn't bother my husband so much, but I have the joy of hot flashes, so unless the room is cold, sleeping for me is a misery. I have two cotton mattress pads under the sheets for a cooling layer, which helps. No need for heavy covers for us over the winter in Upstate NY. In the ten months we've used it, it's held up, I can't detect any breakdown or sinking spots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imitation Memory Foam","review":"This product is ok for the price, but don't be fooled, you aren't getting a great deal on a memory foam topper.

I ended up getting the same brand, but a size up (bed upgrade to a queen). It changed my mattress from hard to softer and more supportive.**Two important remarks everyone should read:1. Do research on density and thickness. I weigh in at nearly 200 pounds, and 3 inches of foam is perfect. I'm unsure at what the density is on this particular model, but it's great for me. Heavier people should migrate to the 4\\" version, and lighter to the 2\\".2. Firmness of the foam is HIGHLY dependent on the ambient temperature. Above ~75 degrees, the foam will be very soft. Under ~65 degrees, it'll be fairly hard. It's fine for even cold environments, though, as your body heat will quickly soften it up.Overall, fantastic for a bed upgrade, and a much better night's sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mattress was damaged","review":"My first mattress topper came with a large tear in it.

But here in Co the carpet in my room is directly over concrete, so I bought an additional cheaper foam topper to supplement. If I had it to do over, I would have bought two of these instead, because the quality is so much better then the cheaper one. And, the price of two of these is still way cheaper then a temperpedic. People are shocked at how comfortable this set up is and I doubt I will ever go back to a traditional bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this!

Thickness is important. When the memory foam is too thin - it doesn't feel cushioned enough when you lay on it. This topper is 3 inches - it feels thick. I was a little scared when I received it because it was shrink wrapped tightly in a ball and just laying in the box. But, as soon as I removed the wrapping, it popped into shape perfectly. And, the bonus was NO smell at all. I like that the foam is ventilated with holes that allow it to breathe. Now I want one for my bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"good topper","review":"Ok, !st let me say the bed topper was a great value.I was looking at a similar topper at department store and it was expensive around $300 on sale.The 2nd thing you'll notice is the smell.It has a faint sweet chemical smell that may bother some people, so let it air out for 1 to 2 days.I'm sensitive to most types of those chemical fragrances ,so I let my sit for a day. The topper is very comfortable and definitely improved our bed.It hugs all the curves and shape of your body while you sleep and supports your back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extend mattress life","review":"My mattress is 14 years old. It had become so uncomfortable I was sleeping on the couch at times. Just couldn't afford to buy a new one right now. I purchased this mattress topper, and I've been sleeping on it for a few months. I highly recommend it, because it has allowed me to continue using a too-firm, worn out mattress. I don't think a thinner mattress pad would offer enough cushion/support, and the thicker ones are too expensive. I find this one to be just right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"it smelled amazing (like chocolate mint) and expanded quickly - we slept on it the same night. it is super comfortable, and took our \\"ok\\" mattress to amazing comfort. i've had it for about a month now and love it even more. it is about an inch smaller length wise than my queen size mattress, and we periodically (approx weekly) have to shift it back to the top of the bed so our pillows don't get stuck between the mattress and mattress topper - but this is not a big deal. really, the only downfall is it that it's so comfortable i don't want to get out of bed in the morning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really excellent!","review":"A big improvement in my sleeping comfort! Adds a bit of height, so be aware of that, but comfortable and easy to care for.

We did not want to spend a fortune on a new mattress, and decided on this topper after reading reviews.The smell of it was a little much when we first unwrapped this, in the am, but by the time we arrived home later that evening the smell had calmed down to where we had no problems sleeping in it. My husband described it as pepperminty.After over a week of sleeping with the topper, I can honestly I haven't slept so well is YEARS. My husband agrees. I would recommend this topper most definitely!**UPDATE** While I still love the mattress topper, my husband is having back problems. I think that it is thick enough that it actually makes the mattress a little too soft. If you do not like soft mattresses, I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Relief","review":"Have been sleeping on this for almost 3 mths now. My husband and I have lower back problems( we are not large people). Thought maybe this would help. After airing out its horrible smell for a day as suggested on here it took about 2 weeks for the smell to disapate on the actual bed. Neither one of us have felt ANY relief in this time frame. It is just an added mattress to an already 3yr old mattress since there is no where to store it or throw it out. It is extremely warm to sleep on as well. That would be the only plus to anyone in a cold area, it holds in the heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells terrible","review":"Had this now for 3 weeks and still trying to get rid of the chemical smell. Have tried Febreze twice and the chemical smell comes back after a couple of days. If it's in a enclosed room for a couple of days - the smells causes headaches. Have tried to contact customer service for help by email on what was listed in the packageing but it won't go through. Had high hopes with the memory foam but now very frustated and disapointed in Iowa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, makes an uncomfy bed comfy","review":"I purchased this for use in my pop up camper as I found the mattress uncomfortable. It arrived shrink wrapped so I unwrapped it and prepared myself for the odor that many reviews spoke of but it never came in the intensity others claimed. It did have a slight smell, nothing offensive to my nose. My wife and I used it the first night we had it and it turned an uncomfortable pop up mattress into bliss. Very supportive, nice!! I would recommend!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I haven't tried similar products so I might not be the best resource on that, but I have definitely enjoyed this mattress topper!

This gives new life to this mattress and saved me from buying a new mattress."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be fooled...","review":"I am completely unsatisfied with this product. I was using a 2inch full size memory foam of a different brand and it was good but not the right size. So I replaced it with this 3inch one but my shoulders and hips still fall asleep using this pad and I am only 150lbs. I originally bought it for a topper to a futon for my in-laws and it will NEVER work for them! Now I seem to be stuck with an unreturnable product. I think the problem is the foam density is not high enough. It's a cheap immitation of a true memory foam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Same As Last Time.....","review":"Disappointed. I ordered this topper back in fall and it was very very good. I have been moving around Afghanistan a good bit and not able to hold on to the original so I ordered a second spurred by the reduced price and previous experience. The second is no good. I could tell when I picked up the box first time we had a dude, the weight gave it away. The topper seems to be normal weight foam I could have gotten at PX here in Afghanistan for $24. I now understand the reduced cost on Amazon....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mattress topper","review":"This pad was used over a low quality mattress in an RV. Thanks to how nice this pad is it kept me from having to buy another mattress for the trailer. We have a memory foam bed at the house and the topper is 80% as good as the bed in the house. Only difference is the on in the trailer is softer than the one in the house. I'm sure that's because of the low quality, soft mattress it's on top of. THis thing is really great and I'll be buying another one for my next RV I'm sure. THis one will go with the trailer because it'll be a selling point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Great addition to our boat. This is almost as good as our brand name very expensive bed at home.I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mattress topper at a terrific price","review":"When we first got it we did unroll it onto the bed in the morning and then made the bed late afternoon so it would air out. It take a few nights to get use to the mattress. A nice bonus is that the mattress pad and bottom sheet stay in place during the night now. It was well worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Could be a little firmer but it is still super comfy.

What a difference it has made! I truly love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Buy and a Great Night's Sleep","review":"I got this as a gift for my 14 year old son and he just loves it. After a late night of homework, he can get a great night's sleep and I didn't have to pay the high price of a full mattress or the big name brand. I highly recommend this mattress enhancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"toxic fumes!","review":"This mattress topper, while physically comfortable to sleep on, gives off a strong chemical fume which made me ill. The instructions shipped with the product said that some of the mattress pads were \\"green tea\\" scented. It actually smells like chocolate mint, which is a nice smell, but unnecessary for bedding! I let it air out for two days before putting it on my mattress, inside a dust proof allergy cover and a mattress pad. I thought that would be sufficient. However, the chemical fumes from the foam mattress topper came through all the bedding and gave me breathing difficulties and an itchy skin rash! I woke up feeling sick and tired for a few days until I realized what the cause was and removed the foam pad. It was terrible! It was difficult to repackage but Amazon paid for return shipping and issued me a complete refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a good night's sleep!","review":"I read the other reviews and decided to spend $139 thinking that would be a better investment than buying another new mattress set ~ especially since our current set is only about a year old. This was a wise decision and a good choice for us. Having that foam topper makes all the difference in the world with regard to support. Interestingly, I do not feel my husband's every move when he changes his position during sleep, nor he mine. The dog seems to love it as well, if I don't shut the bedroom door I know where she will be, given the opportunity.I highly recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep Studio 3-Inch Visco2 foam mattress topper","review":"This improved my sleep, i actually noticed less pain and restfulness after putting this on my bed. First i never got hot once on this bed so i guess the small holes in it work like they suppose to. The memory foam is memory foam not cheap knockoff foam like some other toppers out there, you can actually lay your hand or weight on it and it forms to you. Not too stiff and not too loose, I am over 300lbs and it sinks in but still has the consistency to not completely bottom out or make it hard to lay on. I do like to mention though that when this first comes out of plastic bag it has a slight odor \\"most do\\" but is not too strong and is somewhat pleasant green tea or \\"mint\\" smell. it eventually goes away, just lay out for a day or two and you should be ready to go, although it takes probably a week and its ALL gone. I would recommend this topper over others out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"much too soft","review":"If you like soft, this is the topper for you! For me, it was entirely too soft. So soft that you sunk into it so far that simply rolling over during the night is difficult. I was expecting a memory foam that had more of a density to it, that was not the case here. It was very hot to sleep on and more like sleeping on plain old foam rubber than a memory foam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Our previous memory foam topper served us well for more than five years, but was finally giving up the ghost. After some research, I thought this would be a good replacement. Not so! Although it is three inches thick, it lacks resilience and was far less comfortable than the old one we are replacing. I should have returned it after the first week, but made the mistake of thinking we would get used to it. So, the 30-day return window slipped by. IF YOU BUY THIS, be sure you are satisfied with it before the return window closes. Don't think you'll get used to it, because there is a vast array of better toppers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I was worried I'd regret this purchase and have to deal with returning it but not at all. It fluffed up immediately, smells like a peppermint patty (as per my daughter), and is so nice to sink into at night. The ventilation holes seem to be working - I've had no problems with overheating. All this for a price that is a fraction of a new memory foam mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Foam","review":"This mattress topper was just what I needed. My mattress was just too firm.

I needed new one and thought this product would be just as good, if not better, based on the stellar reviews.

The ventilation hole design is such a gimmick.Do yourself a favor and get a quality topper with higher density instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure what sleeping on a cloud feels like, but not bad","review":"This is good quality foam. It came in a small roll wrapped in plastic wrap. It did have some smell to it. I didn't have to wait that long to let it set. It took maybe 1 hour to get it's full size. Still smelled a little though.Anyways, this product made my bed softer, but it's hard for me to turn on my side because your body sinks into the foam.One beef I have about this product is the \\"Queen\\" size is really a \\"Full\\" size. Definately go one size up."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfy sleep","review":"My memory foam topper is everything I wanted it to be. My bed is much more comfortable and I'm sleeping better and more soundly. I really bought the enhancer to improve my mobility when I wake up.

The ventilated memory foam does not retain body heat,gives great support while still remaining soft as a cloud.Love, love, love it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Literally stinks","review":"I just returned this item. Item had a very noticeable plastic smell to it. The instructions say it should fade in about 24 hours but after a week it was still very strong. The bedroom was saturated with the smell. Even though I let it air out for about 12 hours before putting it on the bed. And we put a fan blowing across it for three days in a row during the day with the window open.My wife is Asthmatic and after five days it started triggering asthma attacks. We had no choice but to pack it up and get it out of the house. I don't have asthma and I felt some mild irritation from it.Probably ok for those who don't have a breathing problem, but if you have Asthma stay away from this thing.Other than the strong odor, works as advertised, really helped to sleep better. But with the odor that's beside the point, if your wife is choking all night. I buy a lot from Amazon and this is probably only the second item I've ever returned, if not the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed. will return","review":"I am very disappointed in this product, so much so that I am going to return it.I have had two other memory foam toppers in the past, so I am familiar with this type of product. I purchased this one based on the reviews. This one is made of very flimsy foam, in my opinion. When I lay on it, the foam collapses completely so that there is maybe 1/4\\" of foam underneath most of my body. Also, there are holes poked through the foam, perhaps to circulate air, but I believe this will lead to this foam breaking down much faster than a similar mattress topper without holes punched through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good topper","review":"i bought this product thinking that it will solve the softiness of my mattress.

Because of those surgeries and my continuous chronic pain, I've been searching high and low for the right bed. Well, I found the perfect memory foam bed for me, but I wanted just a little more \\"plush\\" feeling, which this topper provides. Honestly, I was expecting it to be pretty cheap feeling for the price and smell terrible like memory foam does, but when I received it, I found it to be the highest quality feeling and density foam I've ever felt, and boy, it honestly smelled SO good. It's infused with green tea to remove the horrible foam smell, which will fade with time. I wish it wouldn't. Well, maybe it's better now that I think of it as I'd like to eat my memory foam topper it smells so good. Don't hesitate. Buy it. Trust me. I don't say that unless I mean it. It's worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very soft and comfortable","review":"We purchased this product to use on a sleeper-sofa acquired from Free-cycle. The sofa was from a family that had four kids and was, as they say, much loved. The mattress on the sleeper part was completely shot, you could all but feel the springs through it. We decided to get this mattress cover to put over it for when we have guests over. Our guests have loved it. They've all made comments about sinking into it and not rolling over... it is really cushy. It does have a very interesting vanilla-mint scent to it, but that has faded over the time we've owned it. Our biggest struggled with it is figuring out a way to roll it back up for storage in our urban two-bedroom apartment, as it can be very bulky. Otherwise, we are quite glad we purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelled like mold for 3 months!","review":"This topper smelled like mold for 3 months and it did not significantly lessen the uncomfortableness of my mattress (firm).

This may be the cause of an unusual fuzzy feeling in my head and respiratory inflammation from sleeping only one night on this topper. I am not generally sensitive to chemicals. I have uncovered the foam and opened the windows to give it a good chance to air-out. I patted the foam firmly all over, flipping it periodically through the day to encourage the release of trapped gas.I have given this product a rating of one star because it is not usable due to toxic off-gassing.

But it is difficult to sit on it as it sinks it too much. And also very difficult to change positions if you do that while sleeping.But a great bonus for us was the nice big box it was sent in. The box packaging the foam was covered by another huge box. It is quite sturdy and we are now using it as a convenient table for keeping stuff/eating. It is rigid and spacious. In retrospect, this box is coming in more handy than the foam mattress itself so we are very happy. Highly recommended !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sleep Ever","review":"This memory foam mattress pad has been great for us. We purchased it as a gift to ourselves during Christmas. I would say that every night the pad get more and more comfortable to sleep on. The only problem that we have encountered is that it tends to slide down the bed a little bit so we have to pull it up a few inches once a week. To me that is not a big deal considering how much better our sleep has been. As far as what people were saying about the smell.....I didn't notice any smell when we opened the box the mattress pad came in. There has been no smell from day one so I don't know if we just got lucky or people are kind of over reacting. I would definitely purchase another pad from this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a game changer.","review":"When I first laid down on this my initial reaction was that it was too firm - not what I was expecting. However, after sleeping on it the first night, I can say that I was probably wrong about that. That firmness that I thought was a negative seems to be a positive. I've only used it for one night so far, but I'll come back and update after a couple of weeks. I mainly just wanted to say that it's great and that even if you think it's too firm when you open it, give it a night or two before you box it up to send it back -- you'll probably change your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quicksand","review":"I fully expected to love this, especially after reading reviews.

This is a great band with something to say that doesn't sound like another Christian band trying to imitate a secular one.

It cooks beans (after soaking) in just 2 minutes and a pot roast in 45 minutes. The result is tender foods, not soggy at all. It is not difficult to clean either. It does take awhile (up to 10 minutes) for the pressure to go down so you can take off the lid, but that is to be expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product but would buy the smaller version","review":"This is my first pressure cooker and I really like it. For this price, it is a good choice for those who aren't sure if they will use it much. It is especially useful for vegetarians. Beans that normally take 2 hours to simmer in a sauce pan are done in 20 minutes in the pressure cooker. I was afraid to use it at first but there are safety features which should make you comfortable using it. As long as it is under pressure, you cannot open the top.Although I do like this product, it is overly large for my needs. If you just plan on cooking a cup or two of beans at a time, I would recommend getting the 4 qt version of this product.

But if something sudden happens, for example, a child gets hurt and you run to help and forget to turn the pot off, you do not have a burned on mess, you have a melted pot.

Now I use all 3 cookers for everything. I am very happy about \\"stainless steel\\" because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration (they only make 16-qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it). This is a well-made, top of the line product for such a great price.

Other than that, I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as nice as the eight quart cooker by Presto","review":"I will admit that my negative experience with this pressure cooker is partially my fault. I didn't realize that this model did not have a quick release. I should have noticed this from the photo so it is really my fault. I thought all modern day pressure cookers had quick release valves. I have an eight quart pressure cooker by Presto and I am in love with it. That is why I stuck with the same brand. I wanted to get something smaller to cook smaller portions of food.I also didn't like how I had to screw the handles into place. I want something that has permanently attached handles.

Be sure to read the manual as I wouldn't have thought of using a bowl inside the pressure cooker otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurry up & cook","review":"My old MirroMatic pressure cooker was over 40 years old & I decided it was time for a replacement. Instead of the old all aluminum pan I decided to get the stainless steel pan for ease of cleaning. What a difference! The aluminum core on the bottom provides the even heating, & the stainless steel makes for the easiest of cleaning. I really enjoy the rocker weight on top instead of my old weight with 3 different pressure settings. This one is so much quieter, too. Tonight, I'm making Swiss steak with only 18 minutes of cook time. You can't beat that. The cool down time is much faster than with the old aluminum pan also.

Flavors cook in, rather than boiling out on the cooktop. The only thing that is a little mis-leading is that the cook time starts after the top starts rocking. Even turning the burner on high might take 5-10 minutes to get it rocking, before you can turn it down to medium and start the clock.

Unless you also intend to start growing and canning your own food (requires a larger size) then this is a good size to get the job done for couples or most small families. Do splurge a few extra bucks for the stainless steel rather than the aluminum. It's not much heavier but is much safer for your health and more sturdy.Everything cooks much faster in a pressure cooker, retains more nutrients and flavors and you save utility costs due to less oven use. In case you're wondering - meat literally falls off the bone.

I was raised with Presto pressure cookers, and have used others. None have performed better, in my opinion. The reasonable price is an added bonus.5/10/08: Presto offers a stainless steel steamer basket and a glass lid as optional accessories that fit both their 4 qt. and 6 qt. pressure cookers.

We use it about 4-5 times per a week and it works just fine. The only thing we noticed different than our old one is that steam comes out of the handle and the black dot (both relief/pressure valves) until it reaches the max pressure. Then it seals itself off to prevent steam from coming out. First time we used it, it worried us but now we know that is what it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why would anyone cook w/o one?","review":"This is probably my 6th Presto Stainless Steel pressure cooker. I have given some to my adult children. It is the single most important cooking device in my kitchen (whole chicken in 30 mins, mashed potatoes in 20 mins, beef stew in 30 mins, corn on the cob in 15 mins, and the list goes on and on). Sometimes visitors see us using the pressure cooker and express concern about safety. But Presto designs them completely foolproof. There is no concern over it exploding, since it has an emergency pressure release (which in using these for over 30 years, has never happened). They are completely safe and SO incredibly useful. Once you get one, you will never do without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for brown rice","review":"Well, it's a great price for a pressure cooker, but if you want to pressure cook rice or beans/legumes, this is not a good choice. The manual specifically states that you shouldn't cook those -- basically you shouldn't cook anything that might foam up and clog the pressure vent -- unless you use a foil-covered bowl inside the pressure cooker. Needless to say, that is a pain in several ways, and it severely reduces the volume you can cook. Plus the real deal-killer for me is that after trying it that way many times, brown rice *never* came out right.So if you plan to cook a lot of grains and beans, I suggest you spend more and get a Fagor or Kuhn Rikon. If not, I'm sure the many positive reviews here will confirm that this cooker works fine for meat and veggies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusted screws","review":"After only a few weeks, screws holding handles became rusted and the handle became loose.

The handles won't stay tight and the screws that hold them are already rusting. Plus hard to get it up to pressure - too much sputtering around the handle for a long time! I remember my Mother cooking delicious tender meats in her pressure cooker years ago. But I did not have good results with this one. Followed directions and chicken came out tough. And - a magnet won't stick to the interior (only the exterior)...so maybe the interior is not stainless steel, but aluminum..which is not what I want to cook my food in. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to healthy cooking and fast!","review":"I just bought the stainless steel pressure cooker because I heard that cooking with aluminum is not healthy. I also read that slow cookers have a coating on the dish that contains lead (under the government standards for safety). I cook game meats and find them a little tough and take a lot of electricity to get them tender. With the stainless steel pressure cooker, those entire problems are solved. Yesterday I put two pounds of frozen chicken into water and cooked it for less than a half hour. Then took out the chicken, added all the veggies and potatoes to the stock and cooked them for three minutes. Wow, what a great stew. They say almost all the nutrients remain in the foods. That's my favorite item from now on. My mom also used the pressure cooker when I was a child. Its about time I did too.

The cook times are AFTER the unit starts its steam spewing cycle which usualy takes about 5 minutes on our ceramic top stove.We typically turn the stove on high (10) and once the cooker starts to generate steam we turn it down to medium (4 or 5).Assembly is straight forward and simple. Clean-up of the stainless steel unit is also easy.

This is a replacement of one that my mother gave me which I am sure was many years old. She also gave me old pressure cooker recipe books and I found that the cooking time is a little different with the new pressure cooker (both are Presto 6-quart cookers). A black bean dish that cooked for 35 minutes in the old cooker only takes 25 minutes and a little more liquid in the new one. I learned by trial and error to find the right adjustments to make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sooooo easy to use!....","review":"Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker. Now...many years later....I bought a new Presto and I don't know why I was ever nervous. This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear. I especially wanted it to cook dried beans. Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better. I cannot recommend this product highly enough! I trust Presto because of their longevity (I can remember when they were pretty much the only game in town) and because they are priced competitively. Have no fear......!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooking under Pressure","review":"This is a replacement for an earlier version of the same pressure cooker which has done faithful service for about twenty years. The new one is lighter in weight, but still seems sturdy enough. The new pressure gauge, a detachable knob which rocks when the pot comes to pressure, takes a little getting used to, but appears to work well. Only niggle: the instructiion book says don't cook split peas in this pot. Since I used the old one to cook split pea soup I find this unhelpful. Had I known this when I ordered the cooker I might have cancelled the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Grandma Loves it","review":"I bought this product for my grandma in December of 2010.

It surely rates at least four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fully Functional - I'm happy!","review":"I love having a stainless pressure cooker!

Each handle is being held only by a single screw.

The long handle came off after the second use. It is going back to Amazon now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with quality","review":"I liked the looks of this cooker but when I assembled the handle,the screws were not tight enough and now after two months of use,the screws are getting more loose and have rusted as well.

You can't lose with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product - saves energy","review":"With microwave ovens being the staple of most American homes, it is nice to see pressure cookers making a comeback. This product is ideal for meats, lentils, corn..... things that take a long time to cook. When cooking meats, I usually brown the meat in a skillet first and then put it in the pressure cooker for about 10 minutes - the resulting liquid can be used for soups or as a broth for other dishes. Lentils and beans cook very quickly and the clean up is easy as well. I also found that because it cooks with steam, one can reduce the amount of oil or fat that is used while reducing the cooking time. Good product that I can strongly recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Home Made Food","review":"After searching through 4 different nationwide department stores I was unable to locate a stainless steel pressure cooker. I gave up riding around from store to store and ordered it online. It was here in a jiffy. The good thing was that by comparing sizes of cookers in those department stores, I realized I needed a 6 quart cooker for a family of 3 or 4. Especially if I wanted to have something left for another meal. I made the best tasting stew ever tonight. The meat was actually tender AND tasty. Previous use of a VERY old aluminum pressure cooker lead me to believe that all foods would taste nasty when using a pressure cooker. Not true in this stainless steel cooker. I keep it handy for those occasions when I need to whip up something wholesome and quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value and good quality","review":"This seems to be a high quality product at a very reasonable price. It cooks less expensive cuts of beef (stew meat, chuck roast, corned beef) to mouth watering tenderness in a fraction of the time required in either an oven or slow cooker. It quickly cooks two or three pounds of chicken for salads, sandwiches, or freezing. Cook a pork roast with your favorite barbeque sauce in 30-45 minutes and enjoy pulled pork sandwiches infused with the flavor of the sauce. This would be a great tool for the cook who likes make- ahead meals and stocking the freezer for quick-reheating weekday dinners. Get the stainless steel model to avoid the reaction of aluminum to acidic foods. Eventually you will be glad you did.The clad base is very heavy so I wouldn't recommend using the pan for pasta or vegetables but if you have strong wrists and arms you could do this. Other lids are available from Presto."},{"rating":"1","title":"short lived","review":"i've had this pressure cooker just over 4 months, using it about twice a week . it is already dead. doesn't jiggle any more and all the vapor escapes out the button on the handle. not worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"Please do NOT buy this pressure cooker.

So I decided to cook the beans, which I have done much earlier in my life. I have an old aluminum pressure cooker that was really too big. I'm also interested in reducing the use of aluminum cookware, so decided to buy a new, improved pressure cooker from Amazon. I am very please with my new pressure cooker. The stainless is lightweight, but has a good, thick bottom. The whole pressure regulating mechanism and lock is new and improved. The cookbook that accompanies the cooker vastly overestimates the time to cook beans of all sorts, so I've had to adjust downwards. I cook mostly chickpeas and black beans, which turn out perfect in this pressure cooker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for slippery handles","review":"Item is good and arrived on time.

The only disaster here would be human error. Most important is, just like microwave popcorn, don't leave the area--there are audio and visual cues you need to listen to so you know when to turn off the fire. Certainly we enjoy using this cooker--easy, fast meals in half the time--with a simple cooking method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything burns","review":"It's pretty and it cooks, but everything burns on the smallest of cooking flames.

I like that it is extremely simple in operation and that parts are available not that you are likely to need any parts in the near future or perhaps ever considering how well made the cooker is. If you have not used them I can vouch for the fact that pressure cookers are as fast as they are cracked up to be and with a simple design like this one extremely safe to use.

Being an empty nest'r I felt a smaller cooker would better fit my needs and use less energy. While the stainless is a bit more expensive I felt since I do use my cooker regularly the cost was justified. Pressure cooking is the best way to prepare all-in-one meals using a lot less energy and often in less than half the time.. A win win in my opinion.Why 4 stars instead of 5?

The handle on the lower pot has just one screw that attached it to the pot and the handle on the lid had two screws!! A Major design flaw. The pot has to hold a lot of weight with food in it and needed a firm support. So once the cooker was assembled, we tried lifting it empty the lower pot handle felt as it will yield to the pressure of the hand was not sturdy enough. It did not take us more than 5 minutes to realize that we have made a wrong choice and the product needs to be returned before it is too late.

Fortunately I did not pay a lot for it, but it still was too high a price to pay for a piece of cookware that basically only lasted a little over 2 months as I don't wish to eat rust.It is also very lightweight compared to the old pressure cooker my mother had for over 40 years; maybe that is why the metal isn't very high quality.Firm believer in the old adage that you get what you pay for; my bad. Have ordered another brand that is pricier. I am not in the financial position to pay more for one specialty pan than I did for my entire set of stainless pots and pans, so we will see how this next one works out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional quality from Presto. Great value from Amazon!","review":"I bought this pressure cooker specifically to cook dried beans and have tried it out on just that. Instead of cooking beans for 2 hours on the stove, it's 10 minutes to bring it to a boil, 1-3 minutes to cook and time to let the pressure fall. This pressure cooker will save on cooking time, it will save energy (gas or electricity) to cook, and it will prevent yucky messes caused by food bubbling over. I am anxious to try it out with other foods, too. This pressure cooker is also very easy to use.I was worried about getting a quality pressure cooker that would last me for years to come, but I believe that this one is just that--exceptional quality. Thanks Presto and thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy it","review":"I just purchase this item on 3/27/2011 and it is already not useful.

I had one pressure cooker that I received as a wedding present which worked for nearly 25 years and the only reason is not working anymore is because we can not find the black plastic that is attached to the top is not manufactured anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak product, unlike it's predesessor of several years ago..","review":"Thin metal burns easily and stains easily and VERY difficult to clean...I should have bought a better quality, much more durable (more expensive) item.Save your money, buy something else.

This album features some of the worst production I have ever heard. Basement tapes sound better than this. Furthermore, the instruments are often out of sync with the drums (which is odd, since I know these guys can play), and the vocals off time from the rest of the band. As I listened, I wondered if they had even bothered to listen to what they'd recorded before mixing and pressing the record, it's that bad.Despite this, you can tell that most of these songs would be hardcore classics if only they could be realized sonically, but the production is just too disappointing. \\"Flame Still Burns\\" and \\"Slow Down\\" would have been brilliant, for example.If you're new to YOT, pick up \\"Can't Close My Eyes\\" or \\"Break Down the Walls\\" - this one is for fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"stellar","review":"this is the greatest hardcore album ever created, period. it even beats out minor threat's complete discography for that title. every single song on the album is an anthem worth screaming along with and the lyrics are great. if you are into hardcore music it is imperative that you OWN this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"A friend of mine bought the DVD and popped it in for us to watch.

The sound quality is amazing (listen in Dolby 5.1!), the visuals are stunning. As one of the lucky few to actually see Underworld live, I can attest to the fact that this video is as close as you can get without actually being there. The DVD is a collection of songs from the band's best shows, from Glastonbury to Japan, with gigantic crowds roiling and bouncing with the pulsing beats.

However, it did give me a sense that the author was trying to create a \\"cook book\\" despite him saying that it was not his intend. It felt as if he was trying to predict every possible case scenario instead of raising a more fundamental question such as what therapy work is and what it is not? I believe, it is more important to have this fundamental discussion instead of concentrating on countless little details, because many taboo topics come from therapists' mindless attitude toward their work in general, when they cannot define for themselves what therapy is, how it promotes healing and what therapeutic relationship is and isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Jim Reeves style double CD","review":"First of all, we had a devil of a time getting this double CD but Amazon came thru for us and we have enjoyed it greatly-what a treat to hear the velvet voice of Jim again.

Sean Penn's performance grew more interesting as his character started to slowly spiral downward. He eventually blames Tricky Dick for all his failed endeavors, i.e, eventual divorce, his inability to hack it at his sales job, and the final straw, getting denied a business loan on his traveling tire business. He eventually tries to storm a plane and take it hostage so he could fly it into the White House and take out Nixon. He almost comes off sympathetic until he starts killing some of the airline crew before he gets capped himself. Ultimately, Sam Bicke was a minor footnote in the history books--- he became just another frustrated loser who snapped at the system and ended his self-inflicted misery appropriately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mad Story About a True Man","review":"I LOVE this movie. Sean Penn is amazing in everything he does. All through this film, I wanted to help him. He was kicked down at every turn. Even when he shot his dog, that he loved so much, I still was on his side. In his crazy mind, he was doing right by the dog. Would have loved to see some extras on the dvd, however. Would have been nice to see a documentary on the actual man and events.

As I have experience with portable hardware (I'm an animator) I am very discriminating about cases. While this case is very pretty and the acrylic is very strong and can take scratches, it's not a very functional case. A good case should protect your hardware when it takes a fall. While this case protects well enough against scratches (and shows them very well) it has *no* insulation for shock absorption and the front cover pops off *very* easily. This means if you drop your Ipod, it'll be toast or it could get scratched up really nicely as it pops out of the case. It's a shame, because if Belkin made the top lock securely and added a thin layers of foams inside, it'd be perfect. I have a Case Logic case like that for my PSP and it rocks. Too bad nobody makes one like it for the Ipod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Case","review":"I ordered this for my 5th generation 30g iPod.

Certainly focus groups, refined listening and the staggering advances in statistical techniques have been some help. But for the most part they have added to the noise and we are no better off than our mentors who grew up in the world of mass marketing. Now we have a truly 'new' and finely tested way to know the customer.

The tables for character creation are vague in the extreme. The only good thing about them is that they are a quick and easy way to add a little (not a lot) flair to an NPC. Other reviews said that this product is good for beginers. I would say save your money and make up your own tables."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Players will benefit, but lacks depth...","review":"This book is great for new players and idea generating. However, it lacks depth, focuses too heavily on fantasy cliches (the D&D core setting), and often provides characters with backgrounds they can't match due to limited skill selection. One variant this book should have included is how background can affect skill and feat selection. The book is pricey for its content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authenticity rules","review":"As a native of Japan, I have been put out by novels written about Japan by Western authors. These novels almost invariably present inaccurate and unrealistic pictures of Japan but, due to American ignorance about Japan, often get good reviews. \\"Project Kaisei,\\" on the other hand, is the first novel written in English that satisfied me in its authenticity.

Project Kaisei,\\" the second mystery novel from Japanese author Michiro Naito, deals with a number of complex issues currently facing Japan, such as the critical state of the economy and the growing military threat from its Asian neighbors. It offers a glimpse of modern-day Japan as seen from the eyes of the protagonist, and puts forth the real possibility of the resurgence of fascism on the archipelago which could lead to nuclear armament.

Both HHH and The Rock used this stage to upstage the Austin/Undertaker match, and shoot themselves into eventual superstars, with The Rock being the champ shortly thereafter, and HHH being the champ now. This match is not only great because of its immense action and tremendous heat, but because this match showcases the WWF's top guys right now, but while they were midcarders. This also marks the time that Rock started to get some face pop and some respect for his ability. Great PPV, but without ladder match, its sorry.

Once again we have a remote island where Kong lives. He also meets a blonde beauty and falls in love. But this version has more. We have an evil villain who has constructed a giant robot Kong to aid him in his schemes. But the villain, Dr. Hu, discovers that the real Kong would work even better.Now add some gorilla mind control, suitmation, miniature sets, and titanic battles between giants and you get an unforgettable epic (even if you want to forget it). The result is a film that fits somewhere between the original and a Godzilla film. Visually speaking the film is pure Godzilla-style and a credit to the Kaiju films of its day. While not as polished as some modern Kaiju films no Kaiju library should be without one. The dubbed dialogue actually adds to some of the fun as the villain gloats and compares the two Kongs. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toho wackiness","review":"I am a big fan and have always wanted to see this film. It isn't as olished as some of the others released earlier.

I am Cuban who presently resides in the United States of my own accord. My employment opportunities were limited in Cuba, and Fidel Castro personally gave me permission to leave Cuba. I have been sending my mother and grandmother money for 10 years. Eventhough the situation is tense, it is the fault of the United States and its stupid embargo which makes our country so poor. Socialism is the best form of government, and Castro is a true revolutionary. Unfortunately, the U.S. has continued to deprive us of those things which we deserve. So what if we confiscated the property of American citizens. What business did they have owning lands in Cuba anyway? And for all those rich Cubans who are now stationed in Miami, what the hell is your problem? Did you all think that you could keep hoarding the wealth and lands forever? Socialism is the way of Cuba, get used to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disingenuous of AMAZON","review":"I ordered this film in the expectation that the one or two glowing reviews that came up first in the Amazon reviews were accurate or dependable in some way. After having seen the film, I realize that this is another piece of propaganda from the exCuban fugitive community in Miami. Simplistic, unrealistic, inaccurate, and misinformed did not compensate for the \\"torrid\\" scenes of simulated intercourse. Cuba is a catastrophe, of that there is no doubt. The reasons however fall on all of us, the blockade, the abject fear of the spectre of socialism and social justice, and one of the unluckiest political struggles of modern times. I resent, however, that the customer reviews in Amazon.com can be so manipulated by a small group who would willingly starve their own relatives to fit their agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of depth","review":"This dominican telenovela, sorry, \\"movie\\", is unfortunately an heavy-weighted political manifesto which lacks of subtility ans psychology. Two parts are typical in this sense: the police scene with the young brother (associating \\"freedom\\" and \\"listening to north american pop music\\") and the final one, quite ridiculous for me, but certainly fantasmatic when the sun warms some white hairless heads near the playa Giron, sorry, Bay of Pigs monument in the Calle Ocho. A recent cuban movie, Life is to Whistle, was as critical as Bitter Sugar, but expressed its ideas in a more inspired and cultured way. The director seems to ignore that Cuba is not Sweden (or perhaps it's another fantasm), since all the characters, including our \\"heroes\\", are blancos como el coco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to See if Seeking the Real Cuba","review":"My mother was born in La Habana and since then has returned to find her home land in Castro's hands. When our family watched this movie, 6 Cubans, we saw what Cuba had become and we were relieved that it was portrayed as it really is, beyond the Elian Gonzalez rallys. I hope everyone who sees this movie will be grateful for where they are in the world. Because this is the truth of what families go through. Leaving the country? Keeping \\"Faith\\" in a dead end in government?

Rather than filming an honest account of life inside Cuba, the director manipulates a number of half-truths to create a monstrous piece of propaganda. The MTV style camera work and editing are interesting, but the protagonists are basically Miami stereotypes transported into Havana. If two such vacuous, self-important people could be found outside of the US, Cuba would be the last place on earth where they would survive. Anyone who has been to Cuba and spent some time there will not recognize the laughingly superficial portrayal of Cuban life. I ended up with nothing but admiration for the Cuban government for even allowing such a politically motivated movie to be filmed there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Followup on this movie","review":"This movie potrays the situation in Cuba very well. Although its somewhat sugarcoated and was filmed in another place other than cuba of course.I have to reply to one of these reviews because it insults me and my mom, who came from cuba in '62. There is one reviewer that basically insults the Cuban community. This person is obvious a pinko-leftist bias that probably admires \\"da great fidel castro\\". I wonder what your cuban parents think. Im sure he would love to live in filth like most cuban people live today. Everything there is decaying. Id be interested in the proof of how Reagen killed more people in his own country than Fidel does. I didnt know american presidents killed their own citizens for opinions possibly opposing the government. You are insulting the wrong people. Aparently you dont want democracy for Cuba either."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least the title is good","review":"Bitter Sugar is insultingly simplistic and implausible. I've been to Cuba several times and have many friends there, and I don't believe anyone is as out-to-lunch as our pathetic Marxist hero. He's surprised he's not welcome at the tourist bar? That his brother gets arrested for crashing the political march? I've found Cubans in Cuba to be smart and aware, with few illusions about what's good, bad, or mixed in their lives. Not like all our enthusiastic Miami reviewers, who love the message, not the movie. It is as complex as a Sunday school lesson, and I don't believe that good movies can be that simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating portrait of Cuban life","review":"The story of Gustavo, a young Cuban man who has bought into the Communist dream, and his gradual disillusionment as the lives of everyone around him fall apart.

I cared about these characters and I loved this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb","review":"Bitter Sugar is by far my favorite Cuban movie. This movie deals with the current Cuban socio-political climate with brilliance. Each character represents an important part of the story and a particular perspective in Cuban politics: Gustavo, the idealistic follower of Castro's government; Yolanda, the beautiful, equally resourceful (in her own way) love interest of Gustavo who wants to go to Miami; Bobby, the rebel anti-Castro brother who goes to extraordinary lengths to demonstrate his dissatisfaction; Dr. Valdez, the incredibly witty father of the two, who has become both disillusioned and comlacent. In addition to painting a shockingly realistic view of modern-day Cuba, Azucar Amarga (\\"Bitter Sugar\\") provides us with a memorable love-story too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shouldn't be missed","review":"Tender, heartwrenching, and very romantic, this film is amazing, and will give a better understanding of Cuba and its people.This tragic love affair, set against the politics of repression is a story one won't forget...made vivid by the magnificent black and white cinematography and a marvelous soundtrack.The acting by everyone is superb, and the two leads, Mayte Vilan and Rene Lavan, utterly gorgeous.

I ordered it from Amazon. com (no fault of theirs) thinking I'd see modern Cuba from the inside from the perspective of youth. Well I wondered why it was so polished, so sexy and really so soap opera like in it's sentiments. It was delightful seeing the erotic scenes but then I studied the vidio box carefully to try to see why the message was up-side-down. The prostitution, gambling, grand hotels subjugated peoples lives when only a few owned so much. The movie argues the opposite it squarley blames Castro. Well it's fine for the maker of Miami Vice to put this together but I felt really violated and cheated to learn he'd put this slick steamy vidieo together and is posing (for the viewer) as an insider showing us the hidden truths. Don't be fooled."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-sided political view of Cuba","review":"This film is an obvious attempt by the Cuban/ Miami exile community to manipulate the viewer's feelings vis-à-vis Castro. There should be a warning at the beginning of the film to this effect! I wonder who funded the film? By focusing on the \\"evils\\" of socialism, the film neglected the positive effects of this political philosphy. As a non-Cuban, I am personally impartial as to these political philosophies, but as a film-viewer, I was utterly insulted at such arm-twisting!

The included dust ruffle did not cover them. Though I thought the bed felt good in the beginning, we both woke up several times during the night complaining about back pains from it.

Casey sets the bar a little higher by adding three different time elements into her Athronian Chronicles. I found this book extremely exciting with the magic and intrigue of one world coping with the Overseers' intent to take over another world while the fate of the third world is yet to be seen. This is a tightly woven story that is a must for all fantasy readers. The only disappointment I had was that it ended too soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very entertaining book","review":"Written in simple but powerful prose, Casey is able to pull the reader into a story where things and people are never quite what they first appear to be. Her assortment of characters are not only living breathing sympathetic beings but possess deep secrets that lead to the games of truth that are played throughout the book. On one level, Game of Truth is a good entertaining read. Yet on another level, it's the kind of book where the richness of the spare prose and the complexity of the story are uncovered like precious gems through repeated readings.This book is filled with wonderful twists and turns. Casey delights in making sure the reader doesn't get too complacent in what they think will happen next. If you want a good, well-written, well-paced, entertaining fantasy book, then I recommend Game of Truth. I can't wait for the next book in the series to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good company","review":"Purchased the male hormone panel. Test was easy, sent in, one week later had the results.

Why? Because the original was strictly a pattern source book for jewelry, and most patterns seem to have been covered in faceted stones. These have now been redrawn as shapeless blobs in the motifs, and all details pretending to jewelry have been omitted. The result is ugly, style-less, and devoid of historical interest. Dover must have decided that the market was to narrow for a goldsmiths' guide, and tried to expand it to \\"Artists and Craftspeople\\" by redrawing the whole thing.Maybe you can find some use for it if you need some very simple floral patterns to trace your woodcarving from, otherwise, stay clear.

I may be in a position to do so myself, and with some apologies for my earlier disparaging comments. Based on the track listing of a CD featuring Sonny Terry, with Woodie Guthrie and Cisco Houston, and based on an imaginative assumption of Houston's singing under presumably extremely primitive conditions, it seems that he may be the singer I maligned. Sincere apologies, then, but still no upgrade on the rating on account of the minimal sleeve notes, non-existent performer credits/recording details, and truly excrable sound.

The tracks featuring Sonny and Brownie (I can't tell if the balance of the disc even involves them) are as lovely as you would expect, and quite decently reproduced. The remaining tracks are dreadfully recorded and poorly selected (the over-riding criterion seeming to be reference to chain gangs). Listening sequentially leads one to incredulous laughter shortly followed by anger and boredom. That said, I would be very interested to know who the mystery voice is (not that he can sing), and the provenance of the recorded songs - genuine country blues, if a little monothematic. And so we come to the final gripe with this CD - the sleevenotes are worthless in the extreme. Is this really a Smithsonian recording??? If so, please let's have some more info."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Mishmash -- Look Elsewhere","review":"The CD starts out great. Tracks 1-7 are Brownie & Sonny at their finest.

Not only do you get to admire many lucious images of a modern master's work, Richard Schmid generously shares his knowlege with humour, clarity and detail. A long look at both the technical and emotional aspects of painting, written with great commitment and depth. Though the price is daunting, consider it a worthy indulgence. You could buy ten other books on this subject and still not obtain such a complete reference source as this one book. On top of the excellent content, the book is beautifully made to last a lifetime (and more!), and printed on top quality paper. Splurge on this; you won't be disapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Book About Painting","review":"With this book in hand, I could throw out all 4 dozen or so books on painting I've purchased in the past. Schmid clearly describes the factors necessary to paint well as well as his suggestions on tools with which to do it. His chapters on edges and values alone are indispensible to artists, beginners or professional.His writing style is very easy to read and understand and there are more than a few laughs laced throughout. It's a keeper and I'll be going back and rereading until the pages are tattered and worn."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for any painter","review":"It is rare for an artist to have contact with and guidance from a master.

There is no dobut that Richard Schmid is an excellent painter but I fail to see why this book has had such rave reviews over the years. The advice that you get in this book is no better than I had during my 1st year of art school and for the price tag that this book commands I expected a whole lot more. My advice is to have a good look at this book before you consider buying it.

Everything in this book is standard and basic stuff that any oil painter will realise after a few days of practice. There is nothing concrete that changed the way I paint. It reads like a dictionary, only slightly going over topics while never really addressing this.When you're done reading through this book you'll realise that you actually knew all this already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alla Prima, Ricard Schmid/book","review":"I purchased this book because a good friend recommended it. I was shocked when it arrived. I believe it was way overpriced for this type of book. Over $80 for a paperback book by that features the work of an unknown artist is just unreasonable. Richard Schmid is a competent artist but his instructions to follow only his style were not helpful to me at all. Perhaps someone who is a beginner might follow his method but as an artist who has painted and studied for years I did not learn anything new or anything that might help me with my own work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting, unlikable characters","review":"I picked up this book free during an Amazon giveaway.

I have not been able to put this book down yet!All the characters give you something to connect with or remind you of someone going through a similar situation.The only thing I didn't really like was the way the writers made Vonnie look like she was keeping a secret from Donna. Vonnie had no clue that her mother had given the baby she thought was dead up for adoption and she may not have felt it was the right time to talk to Donna about her previous marriage. Donna was indeed bitter about her mother's situation, but Vonnie's mishap should not have been added to her unhappiness with God.All in all, I am eager to read Book #2 & #3...

In some ways, the fictional town is like Mayberry-everyone knows everyone else's business and secrets. Most of the plot twists and turns have an edge of good humor and fun to them. Most of the characters are strong and believeable. Unlike Mayberry, under the veneer of comedy, there is a lot of drama going on with people dealing with real life, 21st Century issues.

It's definitely a Christian book. The characters are so real. Each of them has their own problems and it's so easy to feel like you're one of them. A lot of Christian books seem so perfect and they make you feel like you'll have a perfect life if you're a Christian, too. The truth is, we can't be perfect because we aren't God, so we have problems and we make mistakes. That doesn't mean we're any less of a Christian!I do want to add that when I first started reading this book, I felt like it was too gossipy and I wondered how I was going to keep up with the characters. But, I quickly got drawn into the book and then I couldn't put it down! I was anxious to find out what was happening in each character's life. I also love that each chapter is based on a recipe.

It holds a wide assortment of paranormal monsters with detailed descriptions and even suggested plot hooks.Primarily I would say it holds \\"monsters\\" including demons, werewolves, frogmen and the like, but it also has some excellent sections on extradimensional and extraphysical xenoforms that can add a lot into a very modern, computerized world as well.My only real complaint is the lack of truly \\"alien\\" creatures, but this need not be a large part of a Dark Matter campaign.Only if you are looking to add in significant extraterestrial creatures would I advise against buying this book.

I really tried to like it too, 'cause it'd be a darn good CD (hence the 2 stars instead of completely demoting it to 1) if not for the stupid electronic drums.

It appears the filmmakers have simply copied Ray's program, removed the intelligent narration, and inserting their own shrill British narrator.

I thought it would be a sci-fi thriller with a horror based plot. It's not. It's more of a futuristic social commentary. Which would be fine... except that it's not interesting to read. All the elements are exactly the same: the characters all talk in the same grandiose vocabulary, the computers talk this same way, and the events are all described in the same way too. Because of this, everybody & everything in the book lacks personality.

There is a scene where a man serves his wife goat heads for dinner because they are cheap - but the show itself shows him buying them for seven dollars. You can get a less gross cut of meat for seven dollars.

Only 2 of the 13 episodes measure up to the consistency of S1 and S2: the opener - and which ever ends disc 3. The rest are nothing more than ho-hum filler. I'm not alone here: 7 of us waited with baited breath for S3 - and we watched all 13 in 2 sessions. The consensus was unanimous... this collection is a major yawn and nothing close to what we hoped for or expected. Hopefully S4 will be somewhat redemptive... though, from those who saw it on TV, we're not banking on it. Too bad, so sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 Feet Under Review","review":"Of course nothing will compare to the first season of 6 Feet Under but Season 3 is still worth the purchase.

Full of scantily clad vampire women and loaded with a surprising amount of gore for an R-rated movie, this film is pure trashy horror fun with comedian Dennis Miller playing a private eye who stumbles upon a bordello full of vampires being funded by an evangilist (Chris Sarandon). Plenty of toungue-in-cheek dark humor, hot babes, and wild gore; Bordello of Blood doesn't hit the same greatness as Demon Knight, but it doesn't try to either.

Dennis Miller to find her trouble making brother who was missing after he and his friends visit a bordello where the vampires lurk. The plot is so badly written anyone could write a better plot on tissue paper and the casting was badly casted like Angie Everhart as the villian vampire Lillith or Dennis Miller's terrible performance as the dectective,at least find a better comedian for the role.

Its nice to watch on a friday night with friends. It wasn't that funny. Except for the guy who was high. My advice? Watch it twice. Its much more enjoyable and funny the second time of viewing.

In fact, Miller looked more ridiculous in this movie than he did as a MNF analyst. This movie was supposed to be a vampire movie and while there are some vampires in it, one can easily see that this movie is a total joke and the crypt keeper and others involved in the making of this movie had to laughing when they made it knowing it was not scary and not any good.

My memory was that it certainly wasn't going to cure any diseases any time soon, but that it was very enjoyable in a camp sort of way. As a result, when I stumbled across the title somehow, I got a wild hair and ordered it up. I'm not sure what I was thinking when I first saw it, but I certainly didn't have a repeat experience. It's not one of those movies that improves with a second viewing...even after multiple years have passed. Miller is enjoyable when he's at his wise-cracking best, and there's some good work done by a supporting character or two, but the effect was largely disappointing, stale, and flat. The predictability and contrivance of the ending didn't help the experience at all. If you can rent it or buy it for a buck, it's worth it for the occaisional one-liner.

The key to success in scale trading, especially when prices are falling, is RESTRAINT, RESTRAINT, RESTRAINT. This book helps scale traders exercise restraint by buying fewer contracts at lower prices and in situations where prices are rebounding.

There are very few ideas in this book and none of them are new."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Find!","review":"This book is a godsend. I was having troubles with putting it all together. The Screenplay Workbook by Mungovan and Robinson does not show you how to format the screenplay, there are tons of books out there that show you how to do that, what this book does, and probably does the best is, holds your hand developing your story, and making it \\"make sense\\". It's tough to put all it together, but this book amazingly cuts through all the excess and forces you to write a better story. The worksheets are great, the copy is fun and easy to read. I can see why schools are using this as a texbook. It really has everything you need to know! This is certainly a must have for any screenwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"budding screenwriters take note!","review":"If your serious about the craft of screenwriting, you must pick up this book. It has a plethora of useful information on all sorts of screenwriting tasks. Basically, read some background info on screenwriting, fill out some worksheets and save as a useful tool for when you do write your screenplay. It's amazingly simple - and highly effective. It's my new favorite book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the European DVD-box; it has the Pilot included!","review":"DVD 1 has the pilot & episode 1DVD 2 has episodes 2, 3 & 4DVD 3 has episodes 5, 6 & 7DVD 4 has the extra's.The DVD-set of the year! Stunning image & sound quality, a story which is still as fresh, intrigueing and fascinating as back in 1990, and on top of that, lots of extra's. Such as: deleted/altered dialogues/scenes, a documentary on David Lynch, commentary tracks for each episode (unfortunately not by Mr. Lynch himself),"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pilot has been released.","review":"I give this four stars because unlike the UK edition that included the pilot (yes, it was released years ago in the UK!) this one does not. I was lucky enough to know about the UK box set before buying the US set. ADVICE: Buy UK edition (make sure you have a multi-region player) and sell your US edition on E-Bay to reduce cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point","review":"Of releasing a series on DVD without including the pilot episode that is. The original crime is discovered in the pilot, the rest of the series is about that crime. Why not release the entire series all at once in a nice box set including the pilot episode and maybe Fire Walk with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"no pilot","review":"totally messed up. i plan to return this and request a refund because there is no warning that the pilot, the most important episode, is not included. there should be a warning to customers and the fact that there isn't shows how little amazon cares about the quality of its service and the satisfaction of its customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special about this \\"special edition\\"","review":"Any DVD collection that touts itself as being \\"The First Season: Special Edition\\" damn sure better have then entire first season included. What studio moron agreed to release this without the pilot? I mean, if I'm gonna shell out fifty bucks or more on something called \\"special edition\\" I expect it to be special. There is nothing special about this set at all. I did better myself taping the Bravo repeats back in the early 90s.The shows are great, this collection stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing pilot","review":"Disappointed that the pilot episode is not included. It makes it difficult to enjoy a series when the pivotal episode is missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A GYP!!! ONLY BUY IF YOU ENJOY BEING DISSAPOINTED","review":"i have always been a HUGE fan of Lynch's work and couldn't wait for Twin Peaks to be released on DVD but on getting the box set, what do I find? The 90-minute pilot is MISSING so unless you've already seen the series previously or have no sense of continuity, then a huge chunk of the plot, the fun, the atmosphere is missing.sure, a summary is included with the box set, but why not save yourself ($$$) and just find an online review of the whole series and read that instead? Artisan seem to think that a summary is enough for how it all began, so why bother yourself by watching the rest of it?Wouldn't have been soooooooo upset if the packaging had at least give some clue to the absence but no, it quite clearly states THE FIRST SEASON.the technical quality of the set, however, is great - the commentaries and additional features are brilliant, but i would happily have swapped them for the FIRST EPISODE."},{"rating":"2","title":"changed my life","review":"twin peaks changed my life it made me look at the small thing's thing i didn't notice thing's i should have.thanks t.p."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointed","review":"This review has little to do with the original series itself, but rather with the extremely poor quality of the DVD set I received. Clearly this has been edited, and the quality of the copy is horrible. At first my DVD player wouldn't read it at all, then when it finally did, there were major skips in the copy at critical points. I wouldn't recommend this item as a purchase for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple nonsence without the pilot !","review":"I was first very happy to see whats, in my opinion, is one of thegreatest TV - series in history, beside the X-files and Millennium. Yet why i m giving it a rating of only one star youwould ask ? Because its released by horrendous stupid and ignorant people, whoever they are, are not intelligent enough,that the whole Twin Peaks series makes absolutely no sensewithout the Pilot !!!!!!!!How do you except to sell this to people who havent seen the series, when they get only the half plot for their money !!I hope the releasing company will see their error, and releasesthe pilot immidiately, otherwise they can keep their DVD.All in all, Twin Peaks is one of the greatest TV-series ever made,with the Pilot, the Collection would have get 5 STARS from me !"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Retro stuff doesnt stand the test of time!","review":"Its interesting to re-visit this show---but I have to say big doses of it are harder to stand than they were when it first came out. In those times it was cutting edge tv! These days, compared with say Six Feet Under its rather passe.Nice to have...but really a once watcher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No pilot = terrible DVD","review":"I, too, sat down to watch \\"Twin Peaks\\" for the first time and was seriously annoyed to hear \\"Previousy on Twin Peaks...\\" I am sending mine back for a refund. When my friends watched this years ago, many complained of being frustrated. That must be the producers goal. They've succeeded in doing it again all these years later. And only 3 seconds into the DVD!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Series, Horrible tapes","review":"While the Twin Peaks series is one of the best things ever to appear on a TV, these tapes dont do the series justice. First they attempt to pack 5 episodes on each VHS tape, and in order to do this they are done in very low quality. Both the audio and video suffer, though the audio is really the worst part. After viewing the tapes a few times, it seems like they may actually be getting worse, the audio has almost completely dropped out in some places. My advice is to get out of the dark ages and get the DVDs"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's full of secrets!","review":"I never saw the show when it was on TV. I had heard a little bit about the hype. Recently I rented the pilot at my local video store. I must say that I am hooked. I can not wait to see the rest of this series.I am a huge X-Files fan. I can now see why everyone thinks it's a rip-off of Twin Peaks. I still love X-Files; but, it's going to be a toss up this Christmas to see which DVD set I buy: Twin Peaks Season One or X-Files Season Four. I'm sure I'll eventually get both. But I'm more excited about Twin Peaks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Produced, well packaged, but...","review":"Where the heck is the pilot episode???? Why does David Lynch insist on being difficult when it comes to packaging his work? The pilot isn't even available stateside, I had to track down an import, with horrible sound quality.Plus, why release season 1 if you have no intention of releasing season 2? I know some viewers believe season 2 to be largely inferior, but at least release the full cultural document!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sooooo disappointed!","review":"It never even occurred to me that the first season would not include the pilot. WHY? I am so bummed out that I don't have the pilot episode, the BEST episode. There should be a warning on the box! Lame. Very very lame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Death?Owls?David Lynch?Trust me,it's not as bad as it sounds","review":"Welcome to Twin Peaks... A town full of secrets,a young girl dead.... Twin Peaks is the ultimate soap opera,except it has style,content,wit and suspense.It's a town full of quirks and dramas,few things are as they seem,and the people are intriguing as well as amusing. Twin Peaks begins with the murder of Laura Palmer.A local girl,the homecoming queen,found beaten to death.An FBI agent is called in and the investigation begins.An investigation,we find,that has far-reaching effects for the town as well as it's inhabitants.You will laugh.You will also cry.You will make friends and lose them again.You will wonder at the misery and (possibly) the madness of Twin Peaks,even as you marvel at the courage of a sleepy small town,trying to protect itself from an enemy in it's very heart.Watch it.You'll either love it or hate it.....but even if you hate it,at least you'll know who killed Laura Palmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"One hell of a thrill ride!","review":"When the series came out in 1990 it grabbed the attention of many viewers including myself. Ten years later I've seen the series again on Bravo & it's just as sad, unnerving, mysterious, romantic and funny as it was then. As Dale Cooper would say \\"damn good cup of coffee\\". The popularity of Twin Peaks may be due to the array of characters that ranged from funny to terrifying. Something for every viewer! Watch it again or for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please release the second season and PILOT!!!","review":"Not much more can I add to entice any of you to purchase this masterpiece. The intricate character developments from Pete calling Harry with that cryptic \\"she's dead...wrapped in plastic\\" to Deputy Andy and Lucy's intricate social relationship, and of course, not to be outdone by Leland Palmer (especially when he hops on Laura's casket at the funeral and rides it up and down)...PRICELESS!, the Norweigans...Big Ed Hurley, it's all the quirky characters that make this the treasure that it truly is! If you don't buy it - - well - - that would be crazy. ahhhh Douglas Firs, and coffee, black as midnight on a moonless night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Pilot is Very Bad News","review":"I am a diehard Peak Freak, and have seen the entire series many times. The episodes that ARE contained in the collection are not at issue, nor is the quality of the DVD, nor the bonus material. I can not get a high-quality (DVD) version of the pilot anywhere, and it is the most important part of the first season. To omit it from the collection is heinous. Why call the collection \\"The First Season\\" if you're going to omit the most essential episode! I feel very angry about how this collection was released. If the pilot were available elsewhere in DVD format, I'd feel less cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't get jerked around","review":"What is the purpose of a season 2 set if Season 1 is unavailable? And season one didn't even have the pilot! We are just being jerked around here. When the whole region 1 series is available, I'll buy, and not a day sooner. This must be the worst ever marketing plan for a tv series on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!","review":"Before you assume that I am going to complain about the omission of the pilot, I'm not.What I want to remind everyone of before they rush to buy season 1 on DVD, is what happened when the VHS releases came out....Season 1 was released on VHS, then later the complete series (seasons 1 & 2) was released in a boxed set. So anyone who had bought season 1 had to buy it again in the complete set.How do we know that won't happen with the DVD release? Why buy season 1 if they are going to release it with season 2 in a complete set?Again I say, BEWARE! Unless you have money to burn... I'd wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn good coffee!","review":"I am giving this five stars because it is simply the greatest television ever created. Dazzlingly original, visually mesmerizing, and funny as hell, this is David Lynch at his absolute best, and that is saying a lot. Sure, the series ran out of steam somewhere in its second season, but the first season remains the only television show I put everything else on hold for so I could watch. I doubt we will ever see such creativity on the tube again.Having said all that, I was indeed shocked to find that the pilot was not included with this set. Yeah, you can get it now in an inferior transfer, but that is not the point. The pilot is essential to the first season.If you have never seen this, or attempted vainly to \\"get into it\\" when it was first shown because you started in the middle, this is your chance to see what all the buzz was about. Get the pilot, get this set, and discover television nirvana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Note to all Twin PeakAholics!!!!","review":"If you buy the first season make sure you have the TV Pilot and the movie Fire Walk With Me, and make sure you absolutely have the book \\"The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer\\" By Jennifer Lynch. The Book puts everything together and makes the movie make sense. There is alot of stuff going on and it will help you understand alot of the weird things that go on in the movie and in the first season.For all of you who have never seen Twin Peaks you don't know what you are missing. It's great cause you can't watch it just once everytime you watch it you pick up something new. The cleverest thing I've ever watched in my 30 years."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],M={key:0},B={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-a565fc04"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/6.md","filePath":"quotesmag/6.md"}'),P={name:"quotesmag/6.md"},L=Object.assign(P,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{j as __pageData,L as default};
