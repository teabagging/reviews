Me being a fan of early rap like Public Enemy, and modern hard rock like Nine Inch Nails, Sevendust, Living Colour, rock rap should generally grab me. And it wasn't until I heard this mob that I was taken at all.It's intelligently written, played and sung with intense passion, the guitar riffs and general playing has all the energy and agression of someone like Sevendust - just powerful.Hard to explain it as there is not really a lot to compare it too - a couple of Bionic Jive tracks maybe, but nothing like this.Tracks which describe the record well are \\"Hill\\", \\"IFO\\" - this is a masterpiece\\", \\"Serpent Boy\\", \\"Ground\\"brilliant"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best CD Ive heard in a while","review":"This CD is great.

However, having read the book in all of 10 minutes or so, it's USELESS. Do not buy it for any reason. Spend the extra 10 bucks for the full version. I knew more about massage before reading it.

BE CAREFUL SO YOU ORDER THE BOOK YOU REALLY WANT."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING!!","review":"This book is very small!! So small that I almost cant read the print. This would be a good gage gift or if you want to take this book on a date and not have the other person know it's in your back pocket or purse. Due to the size this book has only 4 chapters but is 128 pages long. This book isn't very helpful at all due to the fact you can barely read or see it. I thought I was getting a great deal for this book but I found I have great disappointment instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miniature book with no real information","review":"Beware! This book has only 4 chapters and is less than 4 inches high. There are no pictures (other than a couple comics) and instructions for the very few techniques described are very poor. The entire book can be summarized in a single sentence: massage is good; relax and you'll like it. I can't comment on the full-size, full-length version of this book, but the miniature version is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and insightful","review":"Another wonderful book by Steve Capellini regarding massage. This one is good especially for the consumer looking for good massages and how to find them, and receive them, and understand massage. There's info in there as well for massage therapists. Steve's got a great attitude and humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light on content, full of filler","review":"This book covers the basics, but it will make you work to unearth the very rudimentary tips buried underneath dull asides, lame jokes, and torrents of banal information.I would be more willing to tolerate the author's lame sense of humour if he didn't peddle so much nonsense - the amount of pernicious anti-scientific twaddle in this book makes the author look like a gullible fool (pimping reflexology, acupressure and other inane practices), which makes it so much more difficult to esteem him as an expert.I read this book out of duty to my girlfriend, who got it for me, but it was painful to get through the first few chapters, which could have been replaced with bullet-points in their entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Show Boat","review":"I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers here have been... imbibing -This is without doubt the best single recording of this classic score to date. The entire cast is marvelous! Barbara Cook is sublime, Stephen Douglas sings with power and emotion, Constance Towers is at her absolute best, and Allyn Ann McLerie is utterly charming. The recording is clearly a cast recording, and not a quickly-mounted studio effort. Every song is sung with nuance and character. My only complaint is that it could have included a bit more music. Still, it's as complete as most other Show Boat recordings. The sound is excellent -vibrant and rich. Kern and Hammerstein would have been thrilled. If you're new to the score, or searching for a new recording, this is THE ONE to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service","review":"I am fully satisfied of my purchase. It couldn't have been better. In fact, the book was delivered to me well before the provisional date initially mentioned. The packaging was done professionally.

A bientot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children Of The Storm","review":"This was an enjoyable read as were all of the books in this series. I have now read them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful read.","review":"I agree with those who advise that this is not the book to start reading the Peabody series with if you have never read any of the previous 14 books. To those who have, I suggest that this one is a refreshing entry in the series. If nothing else it serves to keep both the author and the characters out of a rut. Yes, it is a whole lot more domestic than previous adventures considering this is the first \\"family reunion\\" in years. But enjoy the book for what it is and leave reality TV to Hollywood.I liked the book in spite of its faults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed With Amelia","review":"I have read all Amelia Peabody books and would give any other an enthusiastic five stars! But this one just lost its charm. At LEAST 50% of the book was boring an uneventful. The book was missing the usual wit and humor behind almost every line out of Amelia's mouth. David and Ramses were trying to be responsible parents and didn't sneak out on adventures. There was not a lot of disguising (on the part of the Emerson's, that is.) If you're a huge fan, like myself, I'd read it (but it isn't worth buying, get it from a library) just to meet Ramses' and Nefrets twins, Davy and Charla, and learn Sethos's real name!Otherwise, if you want to read fabulous, funny, page-turning books, start with The Crocodil on the Sandbank and work your way up to The Golden One!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Paced","review":"Not one of her better Peabody books, the first 3rd of this book is very slow paced.It is a great series, and she's a strong writer, but you have to be a dedicated fan to slog through the beginning of the book.If you are new to reading this series, I would recommend starting off with one of her earlier books. There are a lot of characters to follow, and a long history to each character, so it's not an easy series to jump into part way through.Having said that, once you start to read the series, you'll enjoy the family and their travels and tales.It's more of a beach read, than any type of serious intellectual pursuit, but you'll still pick up some interesting trivia along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children of the storm","review":"Amelia Peabody books are always good reading, funny and cleverly written mysteries. They not only give a picture of early Egyptiarn archeology but also an interesting twist on the type of relationships that may have been around between Europeans and their Egyptian employees. I hope Elizabeth Peters continues to write more Peabody mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amelia Peabody Mysteries","review":"The entire series is so much fun to read! Because the author has first hand knowledge, her writing has a lot of authority on Egyptology without being boring in the least little bit. Her smooth writing style makes you feel as if you're experiencing things right along side of the family when they're opening a newly discovered tomb, walking in an English garden or sailing on the Nile. Her characters have so much warmth and depth that you feel as if you know them by the end of the first book. By the end of the series they seemed like family members and that you'd traveled with to Egypt and England in the early 1900's. There's never a dull moment with a mystery magnet family. Unique and entertaining, tag along as they navigate through back streets of Egypt and the expectations of well-bred British aristocracy. Any of the books can be read alone but try to read them in order since she does such a good job of evolving the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so sorry","review":"I am so sorry I read this book under the illusion it was a mystery type of book. The author has been writing on the edge of fictional biography/mystery, and this time she crossed the line. I got bewildered when the \\"plot\\" never turned up, the bad guys were just so unimportant that the twins linguistic skills just overrode their appearance on the scene and Peabody's maternal instincts just couldn't be bothered with evil doers. The book is probably fine for those who bought the author's work for reading about the sentimental family interrelations but for those who expected something more exciting it is a dissapointment. I feel as if I was sold this book on false pretenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!!!!!","review":"This was an AMAZING book! I literally could not put it down. By far the best book I have ever read, including the others in the series. Surprises around every corner! I would read it again in a heartbeat, which I plan to do. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially Amelia fans! Anyone who doesn't read it should be punished! lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to Love 'Em, But It's So Over Now","review":"I agree with the reader who said the series peaked with LAST CAMEL. Granted, the romantic tension b/t Ramses and Nefret in that more recent trilogy was a reason to keep reading, but the series' humor and wit died long ago. Come on, Elizabeth Peters fans, can you honestly say any of the last several installments in this saga can hold a candle to the early books? Compare and weep! I'm not trying to be unkind here: no one wishes more than I do that this series was still any good. For years, it was Elizabeth Peters...and nobody else. Now it's just...nobody."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow second act.","review":"I could read Perry's descriptions of a English countryside for hundreds of pages, but I can not say the same about the way she goes on about the emotions the characters are experiencing in this book. When Perry did give descriptions of the horrors of the first World War the book picked up very well, and even the side excursion to Gallipoli was done well. The story does get sidetracked from original murder mystery, but not to a point of no return. The ongoing chase of 'The Peacemaker' still entertains, but his machinations do not seem overly inspired in this book. If the third novel goes the same directions, in terms of exploring the emotional side of the characters, vice historical fiction and mystery I will give up on the series. Instead, I will pick up on the new Arturo Perez-Reverte series sooner then I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating subject, terrible writing","review":"I really wanted to learn more about Maeve Brennan, but we got stuck with every detail around her in this book, like we wanted to learn about this colorful carousel, but all we got were details of the circus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a book... Truth","review":"This book is extremely well written, and is understandable on any and every level. The authors wisdom seeps out of the pages and makes you think.

Cruise plays a hot shot young lawyer who discovers that the wealthy Memphis Legal firm he works for represents a particularly sinister customer. He's given strong support from an all star cast, particularly from Tripplehorn and Hunter and a brilliant (as ever) Hackman. It goes on too long by at least 20 minutes, but is slick, engrossing and suspenceful, particular at the end. The softer ending that shys away from the tough stance of the book is slightly disappointing though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The book was definitely a lot better than the movie.

Then I see the movie, and its totally changed! The entire second half of the book isnt even in the movie. Not a good ending at all. If you really want to know more about the firm, read the book, dont go and rent the movie. It seems like they tried to get more into the relationships of the people in the movie, where its more suspencefull in the book, dealing more with the mob and the F.B.I.

Good thing I didnt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Legal Mush","review":"There is one thing you can't call Author John Grisham, and the word is \\"original.\\" Book after book, made into a legal \\"thriller\\" that is supposed to entertain us. Some of his stories were good, like \\"The Client.\\" But this movie is not as great. It is way too long (2 and a half hours) and tends to drag on at the end. The story has a conflict, but no substance because it seems that the conflict in this story is an empty threat that never evloves to anything.

I'm just surprised why the fight returned result so fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FIRM","review":"Tom Cruise delivers the most electrifying performance of his career in this riveting film based on the international bestseller.Criuse plays Mitch McDeere, a brilliant and ambitious Harvard Law grad. Driven by a fierce desire to bury his working -class past, Mitch joins a small, prosperous Memphis firm that affords Mitch and his wife an affluent lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams.But when FBI agents confront him with eveidence of corruption and murder within the firm, Mitch sets out to find the truth in a deadly crossfire between the FBI, the Mob, and a force that will stop at nothing to protect its interests - THE FIRM.Directed by Oscar winner Sydney Pollack and starring Oscar winner Gene Hackman plus a magnificent supporting cast, THE FIRM makes its case as the must - see movie of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"The book, as always, was much better and more interesting. The worst part of this movie was the irritating piano music that underscores most or just about all of the scenes, very distracting. Did anyone else notice this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible If You've Read The Book","review":"I LOVED the book. I was really amped to see the movie but after it was about ten minutes in, I knew I wasn't going to like it. Changed A LOT of the story and it was not enjoyable whatsoever. Not to mention that Abby was pretty fugly and a poor actress. I always knew Cruise was a weenie and this one just further advanced that opinion. Just go read the book, way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book First","review":"I have read every John Grisham book he has ever written and loved all of them. This movie moves so far from the book that it's like two different plots and sadly, looses a lot of the Grisham appeal. I though the actors did a good job, but after just reading the book a week before watching the move, it was hard not to keep making the comparisons. One simple example is that in the book Mitch get a new BMW when he signs with the firm and in the movie he gets a Mercedes. Simple, but why not stay true to the book? Did Mercedes pay more for the rights?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible Ending and Overacting Ruin Grisham Novel","review":"\\"The Firm\\" stands out as a shining example of why one should read the novel before watching the movie made from it. I noted that some reviewers have criticized the music, which I always thought of as being out of place in this picture. The two biggest problems I have with the movie are Tom Cruise's ham-handed acting performance and an ending that strays from that in the novel and simply is too implausible. A previous customer reviewer commented that Cruise's character would have been killed by the mobsters, and I agree wholeheartedly with that assessment. If Cruise had been a little more restrained, and if the producers had followed Grisham's book more faithfully, I believe that it could have been a much better movie than the forgettable waste of time that it ended up being."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Substance","review":"I was extremely disappointed, prior to seeing this movie I read the book. it has no way near the intensity of the book, neither is it true to the storyline, especially the ending. Do Yourself a favour, if you haven't seen the firm already, Don't see it, Don't waste your money, buy the book instead. unless you like watching paint dry, avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR ME","review":"I did not like this film. It did have drama and suspense, and Tom Cruise and Gene Hackman were good. Bribery, blackmail... always good premises for action pictures. But personal taste dictates that I just did not get into it. Jeanne Tripplehorn is one good reason not to like it. Sometimes she is very likeable (in the virtually unknown Til There Was You) but other times not so (Sliding Doors). Most people who see this will probably like it. What can I say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"poor beach scene","review":"This is a great movie but it is too bad they did not do a better job on the beach scene..the dvd quality is terrible and they should have looked before the release..my copy is going back and hopefully a new copy will be better.......visit the cayman island you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Frim will blow you away - See the real power of it","review":"It was great, sure it differed from the book, but Cruise and Hackman took care of it and from great lines to a great revised plot the movie is a captivating exprience and is one of the best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Firm Review by BJack","review":"The Firm is one of Tom's best movies in my opinion though i don't think it was a blockbuster, good action and story line, Suspense and Drama and thrills mixed in with intelligent scripting.

The man is so real, and the character so believable, you'd think Hackman were the character. Except he isn't, because the character is a hackman, while Hackman is an extraordinary actor.Probably Cruise's best performance, better than in \\"Color of Money\\". Garey Busey does a perfect turn, and Holly Hunter gets to vamp.The only film in which I've seen Triplehorn -- a beauty, and is the equal of Cruise in this (in performance; I don't think of Cruise as a beauty).You'll like it.

The movie simply bashed lawyers. That's not tough sport."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Sidney Pollack doing in directing this?","review":"The first sign that this movie was going to be well below the book's quality level was the jazzy piano music from the first step. The early scene was a lot weaker than the book's. It continued from there. This did not need to be an R-rated movie, but some Hollywood idiot thought better.There had been several actresses who received both best actress and best supporting actress (different roles) the same year, and the norm was typified by Jessica Lange in '82, when she lost the best actress but won the best supporting actress. The next actress in that position (Sigourney Weaver, for \\"Gorillas In The Mist\\" and \\"Working Girl\\" failed to win either. Holly Hunter was nominated in '93 for \\"The Piano\\" as best actress, which she won, and this movie for best supporting actress, which I did not believe she was as worthy of.I like Wilford Brumley, but I cannot think of anything in this movie that is worth recommending to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing letdown for a very great novel","review":"Why would anyone want to take a really great novel, \\"adapt\\" it, and come up with a bomb? Ask the script-writers of the Firm. The movie is illogical and preposterous. The taut extremely clever thriller book has become a soap opera combined with a routine chase movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of rubbish","review":"Oh please! what a pathetically long boring movie. Yes, I have read the *book* and Cruise, Trippelhorn, Hunter and Hackman are all flat as a pancake. The firm's lawyers look like George W with a Marx moustache. The firm itself doesn't even look menacing, and Tarrance looks like an egg. Ray McDeere looks impossibly sleazy, and what on earth happened to the Locke of Bendini, Lambert & Locke. And what a ridiculous ending - mail fraud. The whole point of this story is Mitch's conscience, as the newbie, his fresh law school ethics. Instead he helps the FBI indict BL&L for f***ing MAIL FRAUD. Good grief."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Firm","review":"Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes.

In my opinion, \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\" is a figment that should have been left sealed in the author's imagination. \\"Zanoni\\" on the other hand is a tale with an intriguing plot that all the while leads the reader into unexpected and profound esoteric content.

I bought \\"Tracks\\" for 55 bucks the day it came out, and now I don't get these three songs? This is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Ripoff","review":"At first, it might seem like this is a noble premise - a briefer edition of the \\"Tracks\\" box set containing its highlights so that those on a more modest budget can have access to some of these songs. Then, it turns out, that there are two cuts here not on the \\"Tracks\\" cd. So now, fans who have already purchased the pricey box set have two choices - forgo the much sought after two cuts on this collection, of shell out top dollar to millionaire Bruce for what amounts to a single's worth of otherwise unavailable material. So much for Bruce being the champion of the working man."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not buying it","review":"I've heard 15 of these songs because I got sucked into buying the 4 disc Tracks for $60 Canadian.

It's amazing that such jems as \\"Restless Nights, My Love will not let you down, Brothers under the bridges\\", did not wind up on previous albums.

Now he has become the antithesis of this: a sellout! This collection is of 3rd generation stuff - the out takes from the out takes. It's sad. He should not have allowed himself to be connnected with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing collection","review":"I gave such a low rating because Springsteen really rips off his fans. Everybody who saved money to afford the 4-CD-box (which I highly recommend) now has to pay an additional expense for 3 more songs. Plus, the given selection may not match everyone's personal choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"26 years is enough","review":"OK enough is enough. First we had Human Touch and Lucky Town both at full price on the same day. Then we had the Greatest Hits album with the bonus tracks to make us shell out. Now the fans pay 40 for the Tracks set of which the great complaint is The Promise is missing and hey, guess what, a few months later it pops up on another sell out record.Bruce has always laid great store on his control over the whole recording process and his rights over his music (like the recent London court case). Sadly I guess that means he has to take responsibility for this prolonged rip off throughout the 90s."},{"rating":"1","title":"18 Duds","review":"No wonder why these 18 duds were not included on Springsteen's original releases. He should have entitled this disc \\"18 Losers!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Memories","review":"Although the whole collection is great, if you're a Bruce Springsteen fan, I really bought the CD for one song only--\\"The Fever\\". I originally had these songs on an 8-track, so this specific song, \\"The Fever\\" brings great memories from the 70's."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bonus","review":"I like Springsteen but that's too much. The bonus tracks in here are the fifteen you pay twice if you got the 'old' Tracks. And this time the bonus is not for you...

I bought the \\"Tracks\\" box set for $40 and now I have to pay another $15 for three extra songs!?

If he cared at all about his fans he woulnd't have screwed us like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has \\"The Promise\\" on it","review":"Since 1980 I have loved the Bruce song \\"The Promise\\". I have countless tapes and bootleg CD's with poor versions on it. So when Bruce released Tracks and I bought it content unseen - I was deeply disappointed not to find it on the 4 disc set. Now I see it is on here and, for me, $18 or whatever will be a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Move By A Great Artist","review":"I worship Bruce Springsteen. He and his music have provided me with joy for years. This album makes no sense. It has three songs people like me didn't get when we shelled out $60 for Tracks, and the selections from Tracks are, for the most part, mediocre.

This time, he did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, I never realize how many songs I knew!","review":"500 Songs sounds like a lot. It is fun to go through the book and see how many songs you know.

When I got up the next morning I happened to notice that the cracks were gone, I don't know how this could even be possible cracks don't just disappear overnight, it JUST DOESN'T happen! It could be argued that my young mind just perceived it incorrectly, but it made such an impression on me that I just could not have.

Massive bloodletting at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Brilliant Film By Kurosawa","review":"With every Kurosawa film I see, I appreciate his true genius more and more. In my opinion, Akira Kurosawa is one of the, if the not the greatest and most influenial director of all time. My personal favorite of his films is Seven Samurai, but Yojimbo comes pretty close. There isn't much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said, so I will just mention what I think is most impressive about this movie; Toshiro Mifune. Mifune's performance in this movie is one of his best, proving him to be one of the best actors of his era. Any fan Kurosawa or film should see this movie, along with any other Kurosawa movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words: non-anamophic","review":"Ok, we all know the film is brilliant, but this DVD rates very low. The transfer is non-anamorphic, and the subtitles are placed out of frame. This means that if you have a widescreen set and you need to see the subtitles, you are stuck with a very small image. Not only that, but the resolution of the image isn't nearly as high. It's unprofessional and stupid to format any widescreen DVD this way, especially something as awesome as a Kurosawa film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finely crafted sequel to \\"Yojimbo\\"","review":"A group of eager, chivalrous, but young and inexperienced samurai find themselves marked for death by corrupt officials, but they are fortunate to make the acquaintance of Sanjuro (Toshiro Mifune), the masterless samurai whose sense of honor and decency is masked by a gruff, sarcastic exterior. This film is played more for laughs than the previous \\"Yojimbo,\\" but director Akira Kurosawa doesn't stint on the swordplay and suspense. Mifune is wonderful as always. Despite the comedy, the film's stunning finale makes quite a sobering and penetrating comment on the character of a man like Sanjuro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sanjuro Rocks!!!","review":"This is one of my favorite Kurosawa films. I have saw many of his samurai films and this one is my favorite. It is hilarious!!! I would suggest this film to anyone that likes samurai films.

Toshiro Mifune is simply amazing in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bodyguard I want to engage...","review":"I had a very enjoyable time to see \\"YOJIMBO\\", with Mifune's splendid role and funny character.

Sanjuro of Mifune is very courageous character.But the same time, Mifune is very good at acting \\"A SISSY\\" In \\"IKIMONO NO KIROKU\\" by Kurosawa, Mifune has a unbelievable role. I want to make all Mifune fans see it! Some may say DELICIOUS, other may say NO! But, where is \\"IKIMONO NO KIROKU\\" on amzon.com? moreover, I dont know WHERE \\"MUHOUMATSU NO ISSHOU\\" IS. I am sure that \\"MNI\\" by Inagaki Hiroshi must be the masterpiece of Mifune, getting a great prize on international festival of film in Venezia in 1958.I'd love for All Kurosawa-Mifune fans to see \\"YOJIMBO\\",\\"SANJURO\\",\\"HIDDEN FORTRESS\\" AND \\"IKIMONO NO KIROKU\\" as well as \\"SEVEN SAMURAI\\" Dont forget \\"MUHOUMATSU NO ISSHOU\\"(not Kurosawa).I wonder why \\"INK\\" and \\"MNI\\" cannot be watched in the U.S."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as most of Kurosawa's work","review":"As usual, this DVD rendition of a Kurosawa film has almost no extras. Having become accustomed to this as part of the price of owning one of his works, I can only judge this on the merits of the film itself. The acting was good (Mifune's superb), directing and photography excellent, and script OK. Why OK? Well, our hero's power and fate seem to depend more on the improbable stupidity of his antagonists than his own cleverness. Can anyone believe the town bosses could rise to and hold their positions with such gullibility? If this is meant to be comedic, it borders on the cartoonish. Nevertheless, it is my compliment to Kurosawa that, while one of his lesser films, Yojimbo is well worth my time, and Hollywood's compliment that Fistful Of Dollars is an almost scene-for-scene knock-off. Ignoring the DVD's lack of features, I give this a 3.5."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see!","review":"You don't get much better than this! This movie had everything from drama, action, comedy and a touch of class that is unmatched. Akira Kurosawa was a true master and created a true masterpiece. I feel sorry for anyone who does not get to see this brilliant example of film making. Well done Akira Kurosawa!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked; it's my favorite movie.","review":"What is it about this movie that is so hugely appealing? The humor is both subtle, and slapstick, and the dark moments--when the woman is on the rope and can't get to her little son--are bleak indeed. But that's life, in so many ways. We swing wildly from happiness to despair, at times, and like the hero and the numerous villains, none of us are usually as good as we would like to think we are. That. for me, is part of the charm of Yojimbo: it's scruffy and noble at the same time--and so, sometimes, are we. And is there anything funnier than the ending, when Sanjuro looks around at the burned-out town, with everyone dead, then says, \\"It'll be quiet in this town now.\\"?? As many times as I've seen this, I still laugh out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite movies!!","review":"Akira Kurosawa is probably one of the best directors in cinema history. This movie is one of my personal favorites. The movie takes place in Japan in the 1860s when the Tokugawa shogunite fell and the samurai had been freed from their duty. Yojimbo, the bodyguard comes to a small village by chance of throwing a stick which led him to a town with gambling, brothels, and death which is seperated by controlled by two opposing gangs. He decides to stay plotting the gangs against each other, and to end the corruption. Great flick!! A must for Akira Kurosawa fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Japanese \\"western\\" of a different kind","review":"Kurosawa follows a simple story of a lone free-lance samurai (Mifune) who arrives in a town and is informed of the destruction that is caused by the war between two clans of ruthless gamblers. Then he decides to play the game in his own rules and annihilate the thugs through cunning and deception. Along the way, the brave samurai does not avoid a few harrowing moments where he nears death, but his excellent mastery of the sword, his quick thinking and his superior morality triumphs in the end. It is a tradional japanese film which does not have many battle scenes, or fantastically choreographed swordplay but very good acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mifune and Kurosawa at their best","review":"This is a wonderful crafted movie, which shows Mifune and Kurosawa at their best. This is one of the many films of Kurosawa, that inspired the westerngenre. Last man standing was the last obvious remake of Yojimbo, made in 1996 and starring Bruce Willis.If you thought The seven Samurai was a good movie, but a little too long, check out Yojimbo - you won't be disappointed.I can't wait for \\"The hidden fortress\\" being released, which was the main inspiration for Star Wars and once again a superb teaming of Mifune, Kurosawa and the Samuraigenre."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece cinema","review":"The very template for an entire genre of film-making, Kurosawa's gritty dust-swept sets and wrinkled obi's and tussled-haired Samurai and black-tooth geisha chicks and rough-hewn anti-hero could have been shot by some indy director yesterday, they're so cutting edge. Shot in 1961, Kurosawa's samurai flicks are lively and gritty and inspired a generation of Hollywood rip-offs. Film school 101 stuff kids. Miss this at your own peril."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Cool","review":"I just recently watched this movie for the first time. I always heard about this movie and how the Clint Eastwood movie ripped this one off. After watching it I must say its awsome. Very cool and funny, Akira Kurosawa put the movie together so well. The music is funny and catchy. For an old film it really shines, the dvd version is a good buy and i found nothing wrong with it. Pick this one up for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you own \\"Fistful of Dollars\\" buy this (and vice-versa)","review":"\\"Fistful of Dollars\\" is the remake of \\"Yojimbo\\" ... from the halfway point on, it is an almost scene for scene remake.Each complements the other very well and I'd recommend watching them back to back.As for that other remake of Yojimbo, \\"Last Man Standing\\" ... well, don't bother with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best samurai movies of all time.","review":"Sanjuro follows the travels of our favorite scruffy samurai (Sanjuro, last seen in YOJIMBO) but this time with a humorous twist. After inadvertently becoming involved in an intricate plot to thwart the take over of a small villages governing council, Sanjuro constantly is one step ahead of \\"the bad guys\\" while keeping his overzealous young partners out of harms way. This darkly funny film is enjoyable and entertaining to watch. The duel at the end of the film has to be seen to be believed. A must see for all samurai enthusiasts! and to me, one of the best samurai films of all time. Watch and enjoy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"The sequel to Kurosawa's 1961 Yojimbo, Sanjuro picks up with our nameless hero in a new town helping to solve another family argument turned violent. Sanjuro in many ways has more happening in it than Yojimbo. Sure there are the great fighting sequences and some truly beautiful landscape shots but there's more direct humor reminiscent of Toshiro in Seven Samurai. Likewise, women have more of an emphasized role in this film and the women's nature of traditional Japanese attitudes juxtaposed with the samurai mentality creates some great moments and metaphors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"This is a Western/Action/Drama sort of film. You'll enjoy it if you like Westerns because this one is top-notch! I must admit the fight scenes were way too short, but impressive nonetheless.This film focuses on a ronin samurai, Sanjuro, in the year 1860. He comes across a village that has two gangs fighting over the control of the village. The gangs both see Sanjuro's great swordsmanship skills and they both want to recruit him. Sanjuro then secretly joins BOTH gangs without them knowing and plays tricks on the gangs, restoring peace to the town. Hehe... Very clever and cool film. Kurosawa is a genius. Hope ya enjoy it.Fight scenes score - B+Movie plot score - A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Sarcastic, Well-written, and Well-directed.","review":"This is not Kurosawa's best work, yet it stands head and shoulers above most action films. Its loose storyline is actually a benefit, and shows that spaghetti westerns have nothing on samurai epics.There isn't a whole lot of deep philosophy or soul-searching in this film. It's basically very straightforward action. Don't be fooled, though, there are quite a number of twists and turns, and though the action drives the film, there are some truly profound lines of dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kurosawa classic!","review":"Definetly one of the greatest movies of all time, which always means there will be an american remake.

This film as others such as 7 Samurais are the basic for the famous spagettiwesterns that made Clint Eastwood famous. The coresponding Eastwood film to Yojimbo is an exact copy. I do beleive however that Korusawa in his black and white captures the people and details few other directors can match.Get it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a bad misstep","review":"It's hard to believe this is a Kurosawa film. Other reviewers have liked it but is a pale shadow of the magnificent Yojimbo. Everything that made the latter great is missing.Mifune just shows up. No buildup.The young men he helps out aren't worth his time and all are faceless.The villains are all the same. Not one is memorable. Even the great Tatsuya Nakadai, so outstanding in Yojimbo, has no personality at all. His death, though, is \\"interesting.\\"The terrible comedy weakens whatever plot there is. It advances the story in Yojimbo, though, and Daisuke Kato, as Nakadai's older brother, is hilarious though he doesn't mean to be.And, worse of all, there's no one to root for.Skip this and get Stray Dog, a Kurisawa film finally getting the credit due it. It is one of kurosawa's four or five greatest films and has been overlooked for nearly fifty years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't translate well to a non Japanese audience","review":"This film used to be shown a lot in double bills with Yojimbo. It is a very different film and not as good. Where as Yojimbo is about a self confident swaggering warrior, Sanjuro is based on a very different story. It is about a samurai who is cowardly but cunning. It is a sort of joke or playing against type which would make a lot of sense to Japanese audiences but can leave western audiences scratching their heads.The film is also reasonably talky and is set largely in interior settings. The inside of a house, gardens and so forth.The plot involves the cowardly samurai who helps a number of younger samurai overcome an evil lord. A well made film but a dissapointment after the Seven Samurai or Yojimbo."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst of Kurosawa's black-and-white samurai films","review":"I'm not sure why Kurosawa is so invariably highly-regarded: was it because he didn't have much competition? He made a couple of great samurai films, but after seeing several of them, they get to be a bit repetitive.If you're going to watch several of them, I would save this one for last: it's probably the worst of that lot. Hammy acting, a confused script, obtrusive score, campy directing, and an uneven tone make this a forgettable outing. Unconvincing combat scenes and no real memorable scenes at all, other than the \\"footstool.\\" In fact, most of the action of this film takes place indoors, a bad sign for a samurai film.Characterization is also cackhanded: the only reason Sanjuro seems different from everybody is because Mifune is the only one using method acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I recently ordered the book and it looked great based upon the contents and other reviews. The book needs rewritten as it lacks substance (details), is difficult to read, and is WAY overpriced! It is more like a summary of what needs to be done, yet lacks the details of the process. I was sorely dissappointed with this book! Anyone want a... copy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic blocks!","review":"I am a teacher and I can tell you that these blocks are great!!! My baby and I love them. They stack so well, even on uneven surfaces (the fabric they are made out of helps them stick to each other a bit). You will not be disappointed with these blocks. The colors are vibrant. Some of the blocks crinkle, some jingle. They have little fabric windows that the babies can peek into. They have different textures as well.

I love the colour themed Jill Winters books. Have read all of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd Man Out","review":"It must be me. I fought my way through this book. There were way too many odd ball characters. There was not one normally functioning employee at Lonnie's office. That didn't work on television for me, and it falls flat here. A few idiosyncracies are great for comic relief and to move the plot along, but a chronic diet of them strains the plot.Too much time was spent on the insanity at Twit and Bell and too little time on the romance between the characters. The murder of one of the partners was glossed over and barely noticeable. It could have been petty office theft for all the impact it made on the story. I did like Peach and her interference in Lonnie's life, but she wasn't around enough to make the book more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff","review":"I should have read the reviews more carefully - the repeated use of the word \\"sexy\\" was the tip off that this is more romance than mystery.

It would save a lot of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish this book","review":"Seems to me I have a much different opinion of this book than others. I didn't enjoy the main character - with her dresses to \\"just below the knee\\" (whatever that means - I took it to be a fashion faux pas, but that's just me) and her annoying habits - but more importantly, I didn't find any of the characters real or believable. Glad others enjoyed it, but I just didn't find it to be well-written.

Dumas has woven a nice web of deceit, love, and honor amidst the bygone era of gentlemen. By focusing on the first rumblings of Napoleanic rule, we get a strong taste of the leftover pain of a murdered monarchy, an anarchic period of divided loyalties and a national desire for stability.

Never shall I again be quite so relaxed about a chance encounter with one. I am even more convinced I would never have the wits to survive an attack.

It was inferred that a lot of times the bears only attacked in order to chastise humans for being dumb, like it was some type of corrective action a parent would use on a disobedient child.But overall, a really fun book to read. I didn't want to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rediculous","review":"The bear attack stories are very good in this book however I can't get past the tree hugging, gun hating flavor of these stories that is the underlying agenda of this book. It frequently encourages bear spray and makes rediculous statements such as no one has time to use a gun during attacks so they are useless. Yet in many stories multiple people use their spray only to further anger the bears and get some more of their face chewed off! Makes no since to me. If you go out in the wilderness without adequate defenses than your not very smart. A 400-500 lb grizzly will not be phased by some pepper spray get real people! Stop being pusses and protect yourself or stay out of the woods!!! That's just my opinion!

Written like a story, describing the characters involved, going outside what is relevant to the grizzly relating topic. That is not wrong by itself but just shows the 'novel' style of the book. It mentions bite marks in a wallet, then never mentions if they were used to identify the bear, the outcome of not having identified the destroyed bears with 100% certainty suggests it didn't.Chapter 2 is mainly about Banff, back in 1998, this chapter needs a complete rewrite, it's old and out of date.I found the book lacked scientific structure, that is, systematic and consistent.If you are looking for an entertaining book, it's fine, fore bear behavior and analysis, Herrero's book is much better structured and focused on bear behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE!","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST REALISTIC AND MIND TINGLING BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!FROM BEGINNING TO END,THIS STORY KEEPS YOU ON THE SEAT OF YOUR PANTS!IT CAPTIVATES YOU AND PULLS YOU IN TO THE TERROR THEY EXPERIENCED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic View of Interracial and Cross-Cultural Relations During World War II","review":"\\"The Affair\\" is set during World War II in England.

I have never before read a romance where the hero blushes as much as Rafe does. Queen Viv really did remind me of everything the today type of women. She knows what she wants and she gets it. Her past experience is not a hinderance to her relationship with Rafe. He is very accepting of who she is and I think does not try to change her.The very explicit love scenes were just enough to keep me interested in the book, but what really kept me reading was the emotion between the two characters.

I'm also convinced that very little of our true citizenship remains.

I struggled just to finish the book.On the plus side, his characterization is pretty good. I'd give him only 2 stars for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of difficult choices","review":"This story is told as a flashback memoir, but essentially it carries straight on from the first book in this series BROTHERS IN ARMS, although we do have some glimpses of Scott's future after the war.In this novel Scott St Andrew faces a choice - he has been approached by the Colonial Wardens to join their organisation and switch sides in the conflict. For Scott, while he can appreciate their aims, this means betraying everything of moral importance to him. This is basically a book of difficult choices. We meet old characters from book 1 as well as some new important people as Scott shifts though a myriad of plots and betrayals.Although the constant battle scenes can be wearying and somewhat depressing with all the loss in lives and how little they really achieve, this book rattles along at a fast pace and keeps you wanting to know how it ends. I'll be very interested to see where this war takes St Andrew in book 3, PATRIOTS IN ARMS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up In Arms","review":"Like the first book, this one leaves you with some questions.

It's startling to see your grandfather's name in print, and accurately portrayed as I knew him from all his sons and daughter. Father Storojev, after whom I was named, was the priest who presided over the liturgical ceremonies to the Romanov family. I did learn something new, however. That he was involved in passing and receiving secret messages from Czar Nicholas. I am sure this is accurate as the author has meticulously described the horrific conditions of the Epatiev House in which they were confined. I also appreciated his historical asides, which I found to be accurate and penetrating, as I have done graduate work in Russian/Soviet history and politics. Hats off to you Robert Alexander. I can't wait for the movie, in which case I would be eager to provide other personal details of my grandfather and his remarkable life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for The Kitchen Boy","review":"The Kitchen Boy is an excellent book about the last days of the Romanov's. I am a historical fiction fan, but usually gravitate towards novels about the British Royals. I decided to delve into the Russian Royals and I am happy that I did! This book gives the reader a glimpse into the daily life of the last Tsar and his family. I now picture Nicholas and Alexandra as loving and devoted parents- not just stoic historical figures. It was a little difficult to get through this book only because I knew what the tragic ending would be. Although it is a work of fiction the author seems to be well educated on the events surrounding the actual events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending is borderline offensive","review":"Up until the last 15 pages of this book, I admit I really enjoyed it. I think the author did a splendid job of weaving facts and fiction into a well-written and gripping story about what really happened to the Romanovs. While I agree that this portion of the book was very respectful to the family, I felt the \\"plot twist\\" at the end was both unnecessary and offensive. I cannot imagine any world in which that ending could possibly have taken place. The book would still have been a very good read without the massive plot twist in the epilogue, but with the plot twist, it becomes quite tasteless. I would never have guessed that an epilogue could undo the excellent qualities of the rest of the book, but this one succeeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"the kitchen boy","review":"even though it's fiction some insight into the family life of the tsar and his family and what might have been their ending"},{"rating":"2","title":"True life mystery.......","review":"Even though this is a fiction book, it is very detailed and at times I actually believed it could have happened. This is the story of the Romanov imprisonment in Siberia after the fall of their reign. It is told from the point of view of the Kitchen boy who saw it all. The ending has a unexpected twist.

I found this book very interesting and hard to put down. You can see the different personalities in the family so well. The descriptions in this book are wonderful. My only complaint is that sometimes Mr. Alexander goes off and strays from his original thought. Still, this is an amazing piece of work.I sincerely hope Mr. Alexander continues to write Russian historical fiction. There is a large gap in the genere for these types of books and so many interesting figures in Russian history(Catherine the Great, Peter, Ivan the Terrible) that I hope he writes other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"This book was well written, believable, and had some great plot twists. As you read it, you keep changing your mind about what is the truth. I'm glad the readers were given a solid idea of what really happened in the end. This is one story that I didn't want to walk away from with any uncertainty about what really happened. I'll be good and won't give it away.

If you haven't read it yet you really need to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"After reading Massie's, Nicholas and Alexandra I thought The Kitchen Boy would be a positive experience but instead it was a disappointment. There is far too much unconfirmed detail of the Romanov's time in captivity and their murders that detracts from the sensitivity surrounding this tragedy. Why is it necessary to keep the myth of survivors alive? This is a waste of time if you are searching for authenticity of Romanov history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Not Great","review":"There is a big part of me that wanted this story only to be about the royal family's confinement at the House of Special Purpose. To have this story told from the kitchen boy's point of view would have been very interesting and intense. Perhaps the title threw me off.I realize that the whole concept was to present a scenario as to what happened to the two missing bodies. For me it got a little muddled and choppy.That being said, I enjoy Alexander's writing style and plan to read Rasputin's Daughter soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable plot","review":"A dedicated fan of the Romanovs may find this book worth reading for its faithful recreation of the family's last days. As a novel, however, the book is seriously flawed. The story-within-a-story format is clumsily handled - the narrator goes off on long tirades about things that don't advance the plot at all, and spouts some tiresome (and cliched) opinions about the downfall of the Romanovs. Everything that happens after the murder of the family is completely unbelievable. It's like the author was trying to show off how torturous a plot he was able to dream up, without understanding that plots have to be character-driven. The character of Kate, on whose behalf the story is being told, is a thin and unconvincing one. This would have been a much better book if it had been done as a simple, fictionalized account of the Romanov murders without trying to turn it into a suspense novel. I give it 2 stars for atmosphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"I brought this book on vacation to Misquamicut Beach with me this year and I could not put it down.

I had previously seen \\"Henry Fool\\", which I loved. However, whereas \\"Henry Fool\\" actually had something to say (and was pretty funny too), \\"Simple Men\\" is just pretentious drivel.

However, Biophage was a let down. 2 stars is gracious. Acting was almost unbearable and the script at times feels like it was written by an infant. Sound quality in alot of scenes was clearly dubbed and poorly executed (noticable with embarassingly long breaks in dialogue that should have flowed smoothly). I caught myself saying \\"who in their right mind would say/do that?\\". Its a shame because the plot is unique, and the underlying tension between the doctor and soldier was brilliant, but camera work and directing took this movie from 4 stars to 2. Its worth a watch once so rent it if you love low budget zombie movies, but since I purchased it all I have now is another coaster for the coffee table.

This album is a must for those who love folk music type guitar playing, and original, thoughful lyrics.My favourite track is \\"Supermodels\\", which expresses Kendall's (somewhat tongue-in-cheek) frustration at being compared to the \\"perfect body\\".

I then left on a 14 hour trip back to college, and it didn't leave the CD player. Kendall has an amazing ability to write honest lyrics and fitting melodies. Her songs got me through some difficult times when I was 20, and now at 23 she still never fails to touch me. She covers a full range of emotions. For Christian listeners, she reminds us that we're not always going to be happy and life is going to hurt, but we will never be alone (see \\"Never Leave\\").I'm ready for her next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sensitive and Sweet Debut","review":"This review has been a long time coming. Now finally here it is. I bout this cd two months ago, I believe. Kendall is a clever song writer with an ear for satire, humor, and catharis. I have to say that I was actually moved by this disc. The honesty that she writes with is appealing and refreshing. \\"Honest\\" and \\"On my bones\\" are enough to force one to go home and attempt to write poetry in a journal. The pop sensibility of each song kind of creates an outline for the whole disc. \\"Supermodels\\" is a quirky song, and one can easily recognize that kendall enjoyed doing that tune. There's really only one song i do not enjoy and that is \\"Modern day moses.\\" Kendall has achieved a lot with this debut, she has proposed beauty and pain and has come out with a brilliant self portrait. Also, Kendall allows for a very sweet and haunting idea of Christianity to slip into the crevices of her songs. And at other times it is bold though abstract."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not overall impressed with this CD","review":"I have heard Kendall a few times at small venues and have liked listening to her, however, I am not overall impressed with this CD. The songs all sound alike and her voice doesn't change too much with each song, which makes it too repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful child's book about war","review":"Admiral Wags is a children's book about a non-children's subject. Wags was the pet of Capt. Frederick Sherman, skipper of the aircraft carrier Lexington during World War II. Sherman took Wags, a black cocker, with him on the ship. When it was sunk during the Battle of the Coral Sea, Wags was rescued. The book, by Sherman's wife, is wonderfully written and illustrated, and it doesn't pull any punches about the costs of war. I read it--as a very small child--while the war was still going on, in my home two blocks from the Naval Training Center in San Diego; it was about real life to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I've been using this tea kettle for over 3 months and it's almost perfect: high quality metal/porcelain, comfortable handle, good loud whistle which increases in volume, easy to open spout, gorgeous thick color (terra cotta), good weight (hefty but feels like quality). The only drawback is what another reviewer decribed so well: it cannot be filled neatly through the spout due to a bad design which limits the opening of the spout - fine for pouring but not filling. I have made my peace with this design flaw by filling through the spout anyway, making a mess with water running down the outside of the kettle, and wiping it dry each time. I like to wipe any kettle occasionally to keep it clean and shiny, so this problem ensures that the kettle is always sparkling. I'd say buy it and wipe it off every time you fill it (or you can take off the lid to fill but that can cause steam to burn your fingers like with any kettle). Kitchenaid, are you reading this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold out for a better design.","review":"We find this kettle to be lacking in several departments. The handle gets too hot on a gas burner. On an electric burner it does stay cool. The whistle indicating the water is hot is nothing special. The pour spout trigger doesn't always hold the spout open. The pot has been slippery. If you do like this I would hold out for the Stainless steel version so you don't have to worry about cracking the porcelin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I love this teakettle! It has a good capacity, enough to fill my biggest teapot. The whistle is loud, so I can hear it from whatever room I am in.

I use it almost every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"rusty kettle","review":"I bought this tea kettle thinking kitchenaid would be a reliable brand.

Unfortunately mine got stolen, so you could imagine my disappointment. This game is about Bugs Bunny having to find a secret treasure in this castle, and to get to it he must maneuver through 60 levels. In each level he will have to collect a total of 8 keys before going on to the next level, while avoiding the other Looney Tunes characters, who have been enchanted by a witch. Bugs has the advantage of being able to pick up weapons such as a pop gun or a bomb, which he can use to protect himself from the other characters gone evil. As you go along the levels get harder and more complicated for the extra challenge. You can also use passwords if you want to put the game down and pick it up again later. The graphics were also quite nice and I liked the use of colors. I thought this game was a lot of fun and is good for all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I finished this game in 3 days. I never want to play it again.

This book is an okay introduction to a basic history of the English conquest of the Subcontinent; as far as anything approaching history from an unbiased perspective, it falls far short. Snippy remarks about Gandhi, entirely too much editorialization about Mountbatten, and a surreal disregard for the people who inhabited what has become India pervade and nearly ruin this book. While those whose country was colonized will understandably present an entirely different portrait of this century-plus of history, this is the exact opposite: an almost jingoistic portrayal of the Raj and the \\"civilizing\\" mission of the English in India. I cannot recommend this book to anyone who does not take what they read with a large dose of suspicion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disservice to history","review":"The author would belong well with the 19th century British historians who manipulated historical events to create their own version of history.

I found it thorough in that it discussed the cultures, the politics, the economics and more. It did this for the Indian citizens and for the British at home and in India.Also, unlike the misquotes below (they are out of context), this book is actually rather harsh on the British for their view that they could \\"civilize\\" India in their mold and that this was desirable. Time and again James points to the errors of upper crust British belief.I also found his treatment of Gandhi as something besides a demigod interesting. My only wish is that in this long book, he had spent more pages on the last years.This book was readable informative and interesting.

If you want to read a book that really gives you the flavor of British Empire, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chauvinistic ramblings","review":"First of all let's get the facts straight. The British stole much wealth out of India, indirectly or directly led to the deaths of millions of Indians (the indigo fiasco is an example), falsified Indian history (like the so called Aryan invasions), pitted North and South Indians against each other, destroyed much of India's natural wealth and wildlife, fostered bitterness between Hindus and Muslims, and to top it all of-the partition of India was largely under their inspiration. What more harm could they have done to this country? The author conveniently glances over much of these facts and praises the technological advancements brought by the British. Colonization is however not necessary for technological improvement as can be seen in countries like Thailand. This book reeks of \\"the white man's burden\\" syndrome.

It's not bad enough to be really entertaining so unless you have to see every Italian junk film - save your money.

First, the movie opened with a jeep driving along a beach or a desert or something. First sign of trouble: rather than spend real money having the name of the company painted on the door of the jeep, a piece of cardboard under the windshield says EAST AFRICA TRADING COMPANY. So we know we are in Africa and not in...say...Italy. A gunfight ensues. Most of the casualties drop without so much as a spot of blood (more economy).

When the 1997 revision came out, I rushed out and bought it, too, assuming I would pass on my older one to a young cook. I am so glad I didn't give my first one away!

This cookbook beats all the others hands down. I know it has been around for awhile, but these recipes are just wonderful. This book has blasted me out of the tired, what's for dinner zone, into real joy of cooking.

The paper in this book is dark and grainy, smoother than pulp paper, but just as unreadable. The text isn't in the large and easy-to-read font we know and love in the original book, but rather in a cramped and heavy typeface.

However recipes have changed radically in the last decade so the use of butter as a main ingredient has gone down in favor. Also classic American cooking tends to be fattening and bland. New cookbooks use fresh ingredients and different methods of adding flavor besides using butter and flour. However the art of candy making and canning is not as prevelant, so I find this book useful for those aspects. Unless you are a triathelete though, I wouldn't want to live on the recipes here.

This older version turns cooking the many traditional recipes into an amusing time, as if your crazy aunt was there givign you advice.It also contains more info that you may ever need. cooking possum? you're all set. making maple syrup? it tells you how.

You really get the impression that you are looking something up in a phone book. Because of the two mentioned reasons I really did not concentrate a lot on the recipes.

I much prefer a more down-to-earth cookbook which uses fewer ingredients per recipe, more \\"standard\\" ingredients - the things we almost all keep our refrigerators and pantries stocked with (think Cheddar cheese instead of Gruyere) - and which doesn't expect me to spend all evening in the kitchen.

I am hoping the message they sent to tell me this was extremely pessimistic, but 2.5 months is not at all acceptable.When I was young and it was still a mostly manual world, I thought this was mostly a marketing ploy designed to get you to buy two months of extra mags on the news stand - and still take those two months of magazines in the mail subscription.

I am 32 years old and for my entire (yes entire) life my family has subscribed to the Reader's Digest. It is the perfect ahem... restroom reading material because it contains short, well written stories that are either amusing, thought provoking, heart warming (or a combination of all three).Now, every other page - literally - is an advertisement for a pharmaceutical product of some kind. The first thing I do when I receive my monthly copy is I rip out the ads. In doing so I'm usually left with LESS THAN HALF of the pages I started with. I feel like I'm paying for a monthly subscription to pharmaceutical ads. \\"Now, That's Outrageous!\\"I'm so sad and disappointed.

Started getting renewal letters in with my magazine about 2 months ago and got to wondering when my subscription was ending? I looked here at Amazon and it says March 2013 which is correct then I looked at the label on my magazine and it says November 2012. What's going on here that is a 4 month difference in what I paid for and what I am actually receiving. So I contacted Amazon about this and they promptly shuffled me off to Readers Digest (Thanks Amazon)who gave me a song and dance story about how the May issue was a special issue and it was so much bigger that it counted as 2 issues. Well I pulled out my May issue and it has about 10 extra pages compared to the other issues. so shame on you Readers Digest for trying to rip off consumers and an even bigger shame on you Amazon for not standing behind what you are selling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you ready to pay for reading ads?","review":"I'm echoing the same sentiment as expressed by other users.If you are planning to subscribe it, because you liked it during your childhood/Teens - get ready for big disappointment. The once great RD seems to be taken over by the marketing department, who believes that less content and more ads will help them boost sales.\\"Goose and Golden Eggs\\" story fits very well here.Problems with ads:1. TOO many ads (ya, it needed caps).2. Too few good articles.3. Too read a full article, you have to skip multiple ad pages - breaks the flow (besides being annoyance).4. First 10-12 pages are just adds.5. More than 50% of the book is made up of ads.Of course, I was disgusted with the marketing material and didn't care to renew the subscription.

Here's how they work: shortly after you receive your initial magazine, you'll receive a \\"renewal\\" offer with all sorts of warnings not to let your 'special' price offer expire. Well, as I stated, she is a senior and her memory isn't the best. So she heeds the 'warning' and within 14 months she has 11 magazines being delivered. This is unconscionable and RD knows the seniors to prey on.

Alas, these skits are terrible, and should be avoided--unless you happen to be a ten year old boy that has very liberal parents, or you have the maturity level of a preteen. Even when judging these episodes in an early 80's vacuum it's hard to see \\"Bizarre\\" as the purveyor of impudence that it was billed as.

He is absurd, and yet completely endearing, and it makes the reader really want the best for him. His readiness to mix with memebers of lower social classes than himself is a remarkable atribute considering the time period. The other characters in this novel are also really well-written, and provide great comic value during the course of the adventure.One thing that is different about this particular Heyer regency is that it mostly takes place outside of the inner circle of the Quality. Set close to Sheffield, the reader is truly given the sense of a small peak district community nestled in the hills.

In this book she integrates the two into a seamless whole, producing an mystery that is inseparable from a romance (and which is set during the Regency). This sounds an unlikely juxtaposition, but Heyer pulls it off without a jarring note.Captain John Staple, at a loose end now that the war against Napoleon is over, stumbles across an anomaly: an unattended tollgate. He takes shelter for the night, and in the morning finds a reason to stay in the area: Miss Stornaway. The two turn out connected, which is not to the Captain's liking, and he finds it necessary to disentangle them before he can let justice take its course."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best","review":"I haven't stopped to think which of Ms. Heyer's regency romances might be my favorite but this is definitely in the running.

Some of my other brand pans do feel that way. They are extremely easy to clean and heat up very fast. They cook quick and evenly. Also, I love the color.Cons. In the last 7 months of owning these pans, I have noticed the paint on the bottom of the pans coming off. This could just be from heavy use. Some of the non-stick surface has also been damaged. Again, could be due to heavy use. We don't use any metal cookware with them, so I'm not totally sure.Either way, I really love them. The cons are minor and I think they are worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Set","review":"We're very pleased with the pots and pans. The heat distribution is very good and the speed of heating is also welcome. We wish they could take the oven at 400 degrees but that's not something we use too much. Also, the teflon coating has been scratched/chipped on the edge of the pans. This could be from our handling of them but our previous set of 'cheapies' never did this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coating doesn't last","review":"The coating doesn't last and the warranty stinks! You have to ship the heavy item to them and they'll decide if it should be replaced or not. No guarantees. I just threw mine out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful - works great - exterior needs improvement","review":"I bought the 12 inch skillet just like this set to try it out and used it for 2 months - and loved it - before ordering this set. I was SO looking forward to it (except for the stainless lids). The first (and only) time I cooked in the large pot, I boiled some ribs in salt, pepper and garlic. It boiled over the sides and actually damaged the finish !! I cleaned and cleaned, but there was a permanent stripe down the sides where the liquid ran over. The inside and exterior bottom were a breeze to clean, but not the red enamel. I sent mine back and ordered the black anodized set. Not nearly as pretty, but very durable and easy to keep looking good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't cleanup well","review":"I purchased this product a little over a year ago. It cooks well, looks beautiful. But, after repeated use, the red turns to an off-pink. KitchenAid support doesn't offer any suggestions for bringing the pans back to the original color. Overall, its a good product. Just don't purchase it in a colored version."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks, Kitchenaid.","review":"The finish on these is falling apart after a year of use. There isn't really much else to say except that my knife set from them isn't in much better shape - maybe I received an unlucky batch but I think I will pick up a different set from a different company when I replace these at the end of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still loving them after a year!","review":"I bought my KitchenAid cookware about a year ago. They are still in great shape, despite daily use. I especially love the 12-inch covered saute pan! It's great for making stir fry, fried rice, spaghetti sauce, grilled cheese, steak, or sauteed veggies! The helper handle really comes in handy when moving the pan. The reason why I gave it four stars is the fact that they have to be handwashed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Don't bother buying the pots. After only 2 months use, the inside edges are cracking off (I hand wash all the pots). I have a fry pan of another brand that I have used for over 3 years and this never happened. In addition, in spite of purchasing the 12 piece set and three additional pans, they refused to give me a $20.00 promised rebate. I'm ready to junk the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red finish fades in dishwasher","review":"beautiful out of the box. after a year of use, the red finish has faded to an ugly dull shade. and - who wants to hand-wash their pots and pans? no thanks, KitchenAid."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not use aluminum or non-stick","review":"non-stick contains fluoride (toxic). avoid aluminum too (ties to Alzheimer's). use full porcelain or ceramic cookware.do some research online on these issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than 6 years of usage, this set is worthless","review":"i use some pots everyday. i must say i am so disappointed. the interior of the pots burn now. i overheated some corn the other day.. i am still trying to get the burned pieces off. i used pans for making candy.. the pots bend and distort. i used the little fry pan everyday to make my scrambled tofu.. it is worthless now because everything sticks to it. i dug out my 40 year old stainless steel pots and will use them from now on. kitchenaid must have had this set made in china. Beware of you buy this set. looks cute.. works fine for a couple years.. then the finish is off and stuff burns. this cookware i purchased in 2006 is now worthless and awful.. uggghhh"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Set","review":"This set is the best set of cookware that I have owned. This set provides everything you would want and they are very durable. The lids are of excellent quality as with everything in the set. I highly recommend this set for the on-sale price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red is in!","review":"Oh my gosh, I love my new cookware! It cleans up very easily, so I don't mind at all that I can't put it in the dishwasher. It is a great set, and I love the variety of the set. Plus getting it on a one day special with free shipping for $89.99...what a deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set","review":"Only complaint is the enormous jump between the middle and large pan. The large pan is giant, and the middle not much bigger than the small. Other than that I'm very happy with this kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware & Read the Fine Print in Warranty","review":"Absolutely it is not dishwasher safe. I would suggest that anyone should stay away from Kitchenaid cookware. Yes, they have a nice warranty...HOWEVER, after using my set only a couple of months, the red started to fade. Upon reading the fine print in that wonderful warranty, I see that you are not supposed to expose the cookware to high temperatures. SAY WHAT?? It's COOKWARE. Okay... and then I also find in the warranty that it's not DISHWASHER SAFE. !!!! What in the world?!? We are not living in the stone age. Who makes cookware that's not dishwasher safe. The non-stick finish seemed to be working okay... but the red outside of the cookware looks TERRIBLE. It quickly became faded and chipped. I'm now in the market for a new set of cookware that will withstand HEAT and the DISHWASHER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy. Not dishwasher safe.","review":"I bought these pots without reading the fine print and seeing that they are not dishwasher safe. After only 3 or 4 times in the dishwasher the color fades from a wonderful red to a cruddy looking light pink with white haze. In addition, the bottoms chip easily.I wouldn't recommend at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back","review":"Too many limitations... Not diswasher safe, do not use on electric stoves. Not for this not for that... NOT FOR ME!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for glass stovetops! OR dishwashers!","review":"I can't believe they even MAKE something nowadays that I can't cook on my glass stove top or put in the dishwasher! They should have titled this, for the outdoors enthusiast-bring to the campground, wash in a basin but god forbid you cook on your stove top unless you have a disposable glass top!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS set even more fabulous PRICE!","review":"I say... go for it! I was so very pleasantly surprised with the quality of this set. While it is NOT dishwasher safe, they wash up like a dream... no effort required, so I don't mind doing these dishes! They are heavy and well-made. The silicone handles are fabulous too! They are so soft and give you such a nice grip on the pan. How can you complain with the bonus au-grautin pans? That makes a 14 pc set for $104.99 SHIPPED! (free shipping and code CLEAROUT at checkout takes an extra $25 off your order). My recommendation is 5* and I would give them a higher number if I could!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy if you have a flat electric cooktop","review":"Do not buy these products if you have a flattop stove. You can't turn yourstove top over medium heat or else the pot melts onto your cooktop ruining your stove! They don't tell you that the ceramic will melt at too high a temp and bond to your cooktop so beware!! It seems like the chance of this happening would be low, no, I put a pot onto boil med-high and the pot started to fuse to my cooktop. I smelt the burning but it still left some pot residue on one of the burners...Yuck. Probably great for a gas stove"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to make someone feel at home in their first apartment","review":"This is a great set. Among other things, you can cook on lower heat settings with it than with cheaper alternatives because these pots and pans do such a good job of distributing heat.I noticed that someone said these could not be used on glass or ceramic stovetops and I wanted to clarify--if you use high heat (which you're advised not to do in any event), let a pot boil dry, or leave an empty pot on a hot burner, the red enamel can fuse with the top. All you need, then, is some common sense and a trivet, and you don't need to worry about this hazard.It is also worth noting that the lids are dishwasher safe. Yes, the pots are not, but I have yet to meet a nonstick pot that really was. All the regular rules of nonstick cookware apply--use plastic utensils only, don't cook with your pet bird in the kitchen, et cetera.All in all, a lovely set sure to last a long time with the right care--and a great bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip Hip Hooray","review":"What collection of text have you stashed away, with thoughts of putting it into a book...one day?

It smells awful when you take it out of the bag. I returned it immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It, Excellent Quality","review":"Super cute, very soft, excellent quality. I was worried that the train may not be attached well, but it looks great. It has held up to the abuse of an 18-month old (stepping on it, sleeping with it, throwing it). Great pillow!

We go through so many that this was an excellent buy for my house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but pricey","review":"My whole family likes these crunchy snacks. They are good in the car, at work or wherever when rushing from school to sports practice. They do tend to spill crumbs easily. Of course after I bought a case of them, my daughter decided she liked chewy ones better, but she still eats them. I was a bit disappointing at the price - once I did the math I realized that these can be gotten cheaper from the local supermarket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, just what I was looking for","review":"Low to no dust after two months of usage. No squealing. Didn't even use any anti-squeal lube/gel. Just used the plates off the original manufacturer pads. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Require server password","review":"Item requires a phone provider server password even if server does not, therefore won't function. Can't work around the server password requirement, according to D-Link customer service. Because my rural phone provider, TDS Telecom, omits the need for a server password, this DSL router-modem is unusable, and not only that, can't be returned, because the box was opened and the item was used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult Setup","review":"Purchased to use with AT&T internet. It was difficult to setup. Took about an hour along with AT&T customer service rep. to get it up and running. Once setup, tt worked fine. Best price I found for this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the job.","review":"Easy to setup. Supports UP&P. Handles high volumes. good price. Replaces both a DSL Modem and a wireless router. The only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars is that there is no logging capability. If that's not a concern for you than this is an easy recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor support & couldn't update firmware","review":"I needed help setting up wireless connection. The internet download speed wasn't what it should have been. I used their support twice and still couldn't download their firmware update for the device.Their support is off-shore. The first person was hard to understand. The second contact was OK. Each time they would end the support session after maybe 10 minutes by saying try this or that & if it didn't resolve the issue to call back.I resolved the issue by returning the device."},{"rating":"2","title":"D-Link works well","review":"I bought this D-Link modem/wireless router to replace a Speedstream 5360 modem and a Linksys wireless router. It works MUCH better than the other system I was using. This system has been very stable--no more random disconnects from the internet or continual problems with the wireless system that I was experiencing previously. The D-Link wireless router has a much stronger signal than the Linksys it replaced. My D-Link system is in a building next to my house (about 20 feet away) and I can recieve signals anywhere in the house on a laptop with no problem at all--the Linksys was only usable in one room. The set up was easy and I like the combination modem/router--does not clutter up the desk. D-Link has created a good prodcut for my application."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly","review":"The D-Link ADSL2/2+ MODEM/Router worked right out of the box with no problem. Syncs with DSL, delivers UN and PW, and wireless router works fine with encrypted network. Couldn't have been easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"The thing has firm-wear that's 5 years old and no new updates.

If they came out with new firm-wear I think it would work just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!","review":"This unit along with the Tech. Support are ridiculous. I had to return it. MAC buyers beware: either I rec'd a bad CD manual or it is incompatible w/ MAC. It would never read.

Good Luck if you purchase this...DO NOT RECOMMEND."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad specified","review":"I've bought this product to use with a cable modem.

I haven't had any problems with it cutting out and it's been fast as I could expect"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"At first it was working well even if it did not process all my downloads. The setup for your computer was a little confusing. The worst part was when after about 6 months of use it broke on me. I tried to reset it called the service guys but they told me it was dead. So yes it might be cheap but it is still not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"I spent more than two hours on the phone with D-Link trying to make this product work. They were courteous, but not able to make the product work with CenturyLink DSL service. I believe the product is okay, but they claimed that it was broken, and would not let me directly ship it to them. They made me return it to the vendor, which did not help. I ended up getting a new router/modem from another company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work out of the box.

D-link customer service is a joke, they couldn't help me at all after 3 hour on the phone. I give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a modem/router that can only had one task at a time","review":"then the D-link 2640B is for you. I bought this item since I had gotten several years of good service from my old D-link wireless router (no built-in modem), but this definitely is a disappointment. If you try and do two or more things at once, like watch a youtube video and also surf a little, one of the two will time out and give you a time out fault screen. It works, so I gave it two stars instead of one, but my advise, pass this modem/router by."},{"rating":"2","title":"great customer support","review":"I had a bit of trouble installing the product myself, so I called D-Link customer service and they walked me through the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Work and Had to Return It.","review":"I purchased this modem/router but had to return it because the modem did not work. I kept thinking I was setting it up wrong so I had to call an AT&T tech over to the house to help. He checked it and the modem was faulty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible with ISP (Consolidated Communication)","review":"Several attempts failed to get this ADSL2/2+ Modem/Wireless router operational. Consolidated Communication was able to reset and ping this router successfully. After two calls to D-link, it was determined that there were compatibility issues between the D-Link router and the ISP. The device was returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, hard setup","review":"I really love this product. It works really well. My only complaint is that it took a long time to set up. most of this was problems with my ISP. So just be prepared for the usual hoops for the initial setup. After I got it set up I haven't had a signal problem. All in all I would really recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible customer support","review":"Modem stopped working after about two weeks. Calls to D-Link customer service support result in run around. They blame on DSL provider, but DSL is working fine. It is also very difficult to understand the service representatives as they are not native English speakers and must use poor quality headsets for their calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got it to work, and, poor support.","review":"Would not work given the instructions, and I have some IT experience.Called the help line and waited 25 minutes. Spoke to three people on two different occasions for a period of almost two hours. They blamed everything from my computer to the ISP to my lack of understanding. None of the people I spoke with really seemed to understand the hardware or software, they just referred to and read from scripts.Horrible experience. Returned for refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Wireless Router","review":"Unless you only plan on using this router for a few weeks, don't buy it. I can echo other reviewers' complaints about the company's customer service. The only thing they know how to do is blame your service provider and tell you to reset the modem. That is literally the full extent of their knowledge on trouble-shooting device issues. I will say that the modem/router works reasonably well for a wired connection, but has TERRIBLE range if you plan on using it for a Wi-fi network. In addition, I've had it only a short time and the wireless feature no longer works at all. D-Link has refused to give me a refund. I would not waste your time with this device when there are much better ones out there, for a few more bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy","review":"I bought this as a replacement for a 2WIRE router/modem. My order shipped the same day and could not have been easier to set up. Tech support is great and very helpful with even the simplest questions. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Router worked","review":"Gave this router as a gift to my family. They were having problems staying connected. Replaced the 2-wire and have not had any problems. However, wireless acer laptops had a problem connecting, you may have to troubleshoot the problem. Just kept trying and finally connected the laptops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless DSL Router","review":"Great product, mediocre documentation. Go to the website for setup instructions especially 128 bit encryption. To talk to the modem from your PC the ID and PW are both 'admin'.It's been working fine and I'm pleased for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good 3in1 device","review":"I had no issues with the installation and it seems like a pretty good ADSL modem and wireless router. The only thing I didn't like was that you cannot use this device only as a wireless router since it does not have a WAN port, you have to use the ADSL connection to use the wireless.I can't understand why amazon has increased the rate of this device I bought it for $66 last month and now it is $190 which is insane. With such a price tag one might as well buy separate ADSL modems and Wireless routers. Even a search for D-link modems does not show this device, it seems like amazon does not want to sell this particular product. But if you google for D-link DSL-2640B you'll get deals for around 60$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly plug and play, but.....","review":"It took a little bit of playing with different configs, but once I got it working it is perfect. This device is way better than the speedstream \\"toy\\" router Windstream supplied, which was like having dialup since you had to reboot it so often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never could get it set up","review":"I am sure this would be a good product if you could ever get it set up to be used. I followed all the trouble shooting help and could not reach the IP address on the internet in order to activate the router. I cannot sit on the phone waiting for help and just became so frustated I returned it. The online help was not helpful in any way. I lost out on $20 in shipping fees but was relieved that I was done with it. I will buy locally next time and make sure the set up is easy for me to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Work for Centurylink (at least for me!)","review":"I read previous reviews and decided to purchase modem to replace Centurylink modem/router I am renting. Could not get this modem to work. Called tech support twice and could not understand the technician because they don't speak English!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"After spending hours on the phone with both D-Link and my internet provider, we concluded that the device was defective. It did not work at all, and I ended up returning it. I have no idea if this is common with this product or if it was just a fluke. Also, the D-Link customer support was not helpful -- they assumed that any problems were because of my internet provider and did not work hard to help me solve the problem. I did get a prompt refund, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 3 months of use","review":"After reading the reviews, decided to purchase this to connect AT&T DSL network. Was easy to set up-- just be sure to register the DSL account from another internet source BEFORE trying to configure. This will save a lot of time. Worked great for a little over 3 months, then it died. It won't power on at all. Of course, the return window has also expired. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is Too Short for This!","review":"Against my better judgment, I bought this D-Link product. I spent nearly 5 hours of my day on the phone with D-Link customer service and AT&T customer service, trying in vain to make this truly awful device function. I gave up on D-Link, and went to the local computer store, where I purchased a Netgear modem/router. It took me all of 7 minutes total to install and configure my complete wireless network on the Netgear device. This is the last time I make the mistake of thinking D-Link has changed their incompetent ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"D-Link Wireless Modem/Router","review":"The D-link Modem + wireless router works excellent with excellent wireless range, setting it up was not too bad it just took a little configuration and the wireless setup was not bad either.

This is satire. Flan O'Brien is satirising those - like Yeats - who mythologised a Celtic and Gaelic past that never existed.

So, expand your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"I didn't like this book at all. I read it for english class. Whenever I picked it up, I fell asleep. It was so boring.

I particularly liked the chapter on SQL Server CE. The reader is well-served by the clear implementation of a complicated feature like SQL Server Replication. The author leaves no stone unturned in his coverage of POOM development. This book is a must-read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good, Bad & Not-So Ugly","review":"It wasn't what I was expecting but maybe what I want doesn't exist. With that explanation out of the way - I must say it's really one of the better kitchen cabinet idea books out there. It has great photos, a large quantity of ideas and is very informative about various products, equipment and necessary prepartion. It's chapters are broken down by color which makes it easy to skim through the book and find what you're interested in without having to read every chapter to learn what you need to know. The \\"bad\\" part is that the technique directions are sometimes not too specific or clear so it's best to just use the book for ideas and refer to a book on painting techniques for more explicit directions if you're very dependent on step by step directions. Other than that, I'd really recommend this book to anyone who is looking for cabinet update ideas without the expense of buying all new ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. Basically, there was really nothing one couldn't find in any decorating magazine. I was hoping it incorporated other ways to renew kitchen cabinets along with the painting, it doesn't.

Standouts were Paula Abdul, Color Me Badd, Jody Watley, Tara Kemp, Shanice's best singing in Saving Forever For You and others. But I liked Jeremy Jordan's The Right Kind of Love and Geoffrey Williams' adventurous Let Me Be Your Baby with its out of nowhere kind of sound. What really made the soundtrack stand out was the wonderful Vanessa Williams/Brian McKnight duet, Love Is. Perfect matchup that boosted both singers' music careers incredibly and gave them more solo hits on their own. I still hear that song a good 13 years later on some radio stations--people still love it. This soundtrack set the tone for more kinds of pop oriented soundtracks in the '90s with the biggest names on the planet on one collection. These days, the NOW series does this method. But this is fun, escapism pop to promote a very popular TV show on Fox, when Jason Priestley's green eyes swooned female viewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER AGAIN.","review":"TWICE. twice did i buy purchases from amazon mp3 downloader and they never showed up. they just downloaded into .amz files which never started amazon dowloader as it should have. dont use amazon downloader!! buy this on itunes you never get ripped off!

Make sure you can do your own hair? It isn't the 1950s; I am pretty sure most women have been doing this for awhile.There also is more of a selfish tone in there than I like, such as the Five-Hour Rule.

Another feature that I love is that it has a front panel lock so my one and a half year old child can't turn it on and off and play with the menu. I like all the features it has except that you have to sit almost in front of the t.v. to see the picture on the screen.

It's my only TV in the house too. weight is an issue so don't pick it up w/ out some friends around. I did have to have a tech guy come out and do some things w/ the lazer something or other and that cost me $300 but I guess all rear projections will need that done every handful of years so that is nothing against this model.

Jane Savioe writes in a very clear and concise way. As a dressage rider I admire her use of the tranining scale and German system. All the dressage theory in the world doesn't help if you can't put it into practice on less than perfect horses! I also highly reccomend her second book as well. The description of the half halt is the best I've seen. These books are a good reference source for the pleasure rider, and as a complament to a lesson program.

Although this book explains the basic principles of riding in a readable and simple style, Ms Savoie provides as comprehensive an introduction to the subject as I've seen anywhere. The illustrations are pertinent, and contribute significantly to understanding the text. Often, when I am struggling with a problem with my horse, I go back to this book for assistance - and invariably there is something that helps.

Period. No matter what the discipline, this book is for you. If you don't work with a trainer, it explains all the basic and important concepts which a rider must have in order to keep the rider safe, the horse safe, and to get the horse to do what you want. If you do work with a trainer, it just reinforces what you already know, but with wonderful new ways of understanding exactly why the aids are so important for the horse and how the rider can best acquire these aids.

The breakup of the protagonists cause both to eventually desire to lose their minds - or at least their memories - of their relationship by undergoing experimental memory erasure therapy. Two elements occur to bring the viewer into some level of connectedness with the protagonists - first, the pain of breaking up is always best forgotten, but also that even the worst relationship, the worst memories generally had some redeeming quality in it. To wish something never happened doesn't mean it didn't, and there is truly no way to erase our past, or fully forget about it.The actors stretch themselves from their traditional roles, and do a pretty fine job of it. The comedy is dark, but not so dark as to be uncomfortable. More telling, however, is that the story line and the theme apply to every viewer. We all have things we wish we could erase, and perhaps the lesson that we cannot, and should not, need to be remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"'I'm Not Really Sure What You're Asking Me\\" ~ Random Thoughts, Celestial Constellations And The Dining Dead","review":"'Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind' is an intelligent, smartly written dark comedy exploring the inner recesses of the mind and the essential role our memories play in defining who we are. It's one of those films that you don't want to miss a word of dialogue, or a single frame of the visuals. Every comment, every gesture and every background setting is imbued with meaning and emotional context. Jim Carey and Kate Winslet are at their very best as the two mismatched lovers Joel and Clementine and the rest of the supporting cast shine as well.Watch this one with a group of friends who like to dissect a film after viewing, you'll have alot to talk about afterwards!"},{"rating":"2","title":"80,000 voices join Silvio's: simply magical.","review":"Silvio Rodriguez returns to a liberated Santiago de Chile, and in the infamous Estadio Nacional magic happens when 80,000 people sing his songs as one...

The first is that Dian Parkinson, a longtime fixture of the \\"Price is Right\\", shows that there's more to her than just to gesture at prizes.The other reason, and the biggest as far as this reviewer is concerned, is that the Playmate Centerfold that follows is Miss August of 1993, Miss Jennifer Lavoie. The first (and so far only) Playmate from New Hampshire is more than just a pretty face. She is also very active, which she demonstrates with gymnastic floor exercises. From playing around on a New England lobster boat, to working out, to a midnight hookup involving cold and wet items from the refrigerator, to a seductive tropical scene that will make you wish you were \\"Lost\\" with her, you will think that the wrong beauty was on the cover of the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Reliability and Warranty","review":"I have a Sony DVD player. Sony claims a 1 year part/90 day labor warranty. First, the machine simply stopped working after 5 months.

They don't assess the problem and then give you an estimate, permitting you to decide whether or not you want to go through with a repair. Third, when I noted that the cost to repair closely approaches the cost of a new machine, their customer service representative told me I should have purchased the extended warranty.My suggestion is, buy a more reliable product, not a Sony.

There is a company called MSB that offers a factory-installed modification that returns the digital output to 24/96.I do not work for this company and am not getting paid to post this message. On the contrary, if anything, it is good for Amazon and Sony at the bottom line for customers to know that there is a \\"fix\\" available for Sony's ill-advised decision to downsample output. If I didn't know of this myself, I would probably pass on the Sony player for this reason. For those interested, information about the modification can be found ... by searching MSB on the Web.

Read a review of this player in Stereo Review's Sound & Vision. Every other player is measured against this piece. The video is superb, especially hooked up with the component video outputs, and the audio is amazing. As far as the downsampling goes, Sony was simply complying with the manufacuring standard of the industry which did not want to allow a digital bitstream passing out of the player at 24/96. That is why it is downsampled to 48! Additionally, if you have DACs in your system that are better than the ones in this Sony, you should be looking higher, like at a Lexicon or a Meridian player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedic Genius!","review":"This movie had an excellent cast, and Carrel with Fey paired together was amazing. There were a few stars I didn't even know were in the film, particularly Ray Liotta.I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews on this movie. I'm particularly a tough critic for movies, so I guess you either get the jokes or you don't and none of them had the intelligence level to get the jokes or maybe they were too serious to enjoy this movie and it's humor. I was rolling through the whole movie, especially during the credits with the extra scenes and gaffs.Tina Fey and Steve Carrel's characters I think are something we can all relate to, being married and feeling like things are just going stale, or worrying that maybe your relationship isn't up to par with your friends and co-workers' relationships.Hilarious movie, definitely worth seeing and definitely FIVE stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern screwball comedy","review":"This is in the tradition of the screwball comedies of the 30's and 40's, briefly reborn in movies like \\"What's Up Doc.\\" The chase scene is actually one of its weaker elements, except for the part where the two cars get locked together, which is hysterical. Yes, the ending is a little pat, but some good points are made. And who cares, if you're laughing along the way? Tina Fey and Steve Carell are in top form; they can do more with facial expressions and tone of voice that most comic actors can do with the whole screen. Of the cameos, the one with the \\"real\\" Tripplehorns (James Franco and his wife?) is the real delight. I can't see why anyone wouldn't enjoy it, but I would say this is most likely to appeal to actual married couples--maybe not so much to the younger set, the kids.

I have seen almost all of their work and you can imagine how excited I felt when I heard they would be starring in a movie together. However, after watching this movie I felt disappointed. It has a few funny moments, but not enough to make it satisfying. The jokes seem to fall short and it got boring near the end. The story was confusing and didn't seem to really flow. On the other hand, I give this movie credit for possessing realistic and relatable characters. It is about the stereotypical boring suburban cople who are finding it difficult to find any spark in their relationship. Their date night gone wrong brings them to realize they still love each other. Overall, this movie is somewhat entertaining, but is ultimately forgettable. Woth a rental if you're bored and can't think of anything else to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie","review":"This movie is in the same vein as True Lies with the big difference being the focus is the average suburban couple.

However, with \\"Date Night\\", it generally got very favorable reviews.I cannot understand for the life of me how anyone would give this movie more than 1-star. It has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, with any kind of budget, or star actor attached to it. I am usually pretty good with making it through movies, even when they stink. But I couldn't make it through this movie. I think I finally hit the STOP button with about 30 minutes left. At that point, I just simply didn't care anymore how the movie turned out.

The movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a romantic comedy or a crime farce and failed badly at both. Also, Carell and Fey, despite being very funny people had zero chemistry.Having said that one of the best parts of the movie were the supporting characters. Mark Whalberg was excellent especially the parts regarding how he chose to expose himself. James Franco and Mila Kunis were also very funny as the bickering sleazebags.

You get Date Night. Notice there were no writers in the equation because the story was a severe after-thought in this time sucking piece of Hollywood garbage. The story was disjointed at best, the tempo swung from somberly serious divorce preaching to whimsical humor in a millisecond and somehow there was the meaningless action story tie-in. Steve Carell is such an obvious money hog that it is a waste of time to see his films. He's shown what he can do, now we need a replacement, he is played out.Don't waste your time with this movie it's not a good comedy, action movie or moral story.

I don't think the comedic aspects of this film were enough to put up with the terrible plot. Much of it was ridiculous. If you are into that sort of thing, then this movie might be for you. For the talent involved and all the money spent on stupid effects and set props, there should have been a lot more laughter going on. Typical audiences must be easily impressed. I respect Steve Carell and Tina Fey otherwise, but I think their talent was wasted in this movie. There was a poor balance between clever situations and the believable nature of the action. If you want people to laugh at the funny situations, then emphasize them more with funny camera shots and an obviously supportive soundtrack. In other words, the tone, mood, and pace in many of the scenes took away from the comedy.

Steve Carell basically acted how he does on the office and clawd have mercy, what in the hot hell happened to Ray Liotta's face. His face looks like somebody threw a brown wig on some soggy wheat bread.And why in the hell was he wearing so much wet N wild eyeliner around his eyes I will never know. But I digress.

My choice is Perform Better, which is also quite well made at a fraction of the Dragon Door cost.I understand that Ader, Lifeline USA, and Agatsu make very nice kettlebells also (I haven't seen them), but shipping is expensive, as it is with the Dragon Door bells. As I can get the Perform Better bells locally (making a single 16 kg bell $60 cheaper), that seals the deals for me. My advice is to buy the best you can get without having to pay shipping.

IN less than 100 pages, Sova presents a fast paced guide taking the reader from start to finish. Along the way, the perspective writer will find such information as a sample query letter, constructing an effective lead and even grammatical advice.This brief introduction is well written and easy to understand. It contains practical advice that will surely help aspiring writers. Short on depth, but that is to be expected from such a small introduction. The back cover states the book is \\"perfect for amateurs and seasoned professionals\\" but I believe seasoned professionals might find it a bit too basic."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of better resources are out there","review":"Of limited value.

It often smacks of immaturity in terms of on-the-ground journalism and writing savvy, however. Some of her \\"bad\\" writing examples are construed. Some of the \\"good\\" passages are marred by editorializing, journalese and an amateurish approach. Campus-related events or angles provide the bulk of her writing samples and ideas, raising questions about the breadth of her reporting experience.

Unfortunately, on this CD the instrumentation (which sounds very amateurish)almost drowns out her harmonies completely.Don't get me wrong. I think Plumb is awesome.

Some of the words on \\"Concrete\\" I actually found offendsive. The CD had the air of being good, but not being Christian. Maybe I am not educated enough to perceive the hidden meanings in the songs, but I have never had a problem decerning the meanings of the other 34 CHRISTIAN Artists that I listen to.

I was surprised after listening to it that it was classified as a Christian CD. \\"Send Angels\\" is a blandly amusing atmospheric music with sonic keyboard washes and a long irritating blank space of over 5 minutes silence to get the end of the track. Of the other songs, the only one that stays with me long enough to recognize is \\"Concrete\\" with its driving guitars and some memorable lyrics, \\"Hold tight to your convictions, hypocrites in all directions, Cling to the things your father taught you, confess your sins to the One who bought you.\\" Even as interesting as this track is, it still makes the Christian faith sound more like spiritual slavery rather than a joyful attitude of faith. Perhaps on other sets, Plumb comes up with a formula that works. Here, the music is generic and forgettable, neither moving in its message nor pleasant in performance.

So far it's been 36 hours and it still has a strong gasoline smell. I checked the package to see what theywere made of to make them smell that way but couldn't find any information except that they were made by a companyin China. Since I can't use them I was going to give them to my granddaughter to take to daycare to share with her classmatesbut I'm worried these aren't safe for children....or pets.I'm going to give the one another 24 hrs to see if the smell goes away.

I think what makes this series interesting is the dirty deeds of the divine order. African-Americans have been raised in the church. Of course, there are worldly ways and events that happen in the church amongst christian folk. Kimberlea Lawson-Roby does an excellent job weaving an entangled web of lies and deceit amongst these church folk. This fictious book held my attention because each character had a distinct personality. I liked the human side of the Pastor having a problem with his mother and sister (lots of people can relate to family disputes, but \\"trying\\" to work through Christ to resolve the problem), and showing the true feelings of the pastors wife - her selfishness and need to have the best and biggest of everything (we all know people like that regardless if they are the first lady of the church or a devout christian).

I did not love The Best Kept Secret. Why you may ask? Because I read this story in Casting The First Stone and Too Much Of A Good Thing. Can you say sick of Curtis Black!!!! Cause I am. I mean come on didn't we go through this same thing once before. Ok maybe he's not quite as bad but his wife is doing exactly the same things he did. And Ms. Roby please tell me you're not setting us up for a forth installment cause I can't take it. How about we revisit the characters in Behind Closed Doors or Tastes of Reality. I would have given this book one star if it was by another author but I love Ms. Roby to much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives Up to the Hype","review":"This is the third in Roby's series about the Reverend Curtis Black. However, this book stands alone and even if you haven't read the first two you will still enjoy this one.This time Curtis has sworn off his cheating and manipulative ways and vows to be faithful to his new wife Charlotte and the church they have founded. Little does he know he is about to get what he has dished out.The materialistic Charlotte proves totally disinterested in church affairs and to top it off is having an affair with one of the Deacon's, who is also Curtis' best friend.I really enjoyed this book because it explored Curtis' background and he became a changed man. I won't give too much away, but let's say I hope there is another book coming because there are definitely some surpises at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page-Turner","review":"Great book, not as good as the first two.

I picked up this book at the library and was so disappointed. The story is one-dimensional and it goes around and around in circles. I was sick to my stomach reading this nauseating story. It seems like the author was at a loss for words and plot. It was the most simplistically written and predictable story I've ever read. There were no plot twists and turns, just a story about a bad preacher turned good with a cheating wife and cheating best friend/deacon. The wife gets pregnant but doesn't know whether it's her preacher/husband's child or her lover/deacon's child. What a boring book! I couldn't even read a chapter at a time--I was reading 1.5 to 2 pages at a time before closing the book and picking it up later hoping that it would get better. But nope! It doesn't. Usually, I would read a good, pageturning book in one sitting.

Sure, ministers are human and make mistakes. The problem with this book is that it deals with a minister that messes up, time after time, but does not turn to Jesus for forgiveness, repentance, and reconciliation. Although this is a work of fiction, if you are writing about a minister and a church, there should be something besides sin going on in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the best kept secret","review":"This book was not in very good conditionIt had something spilled on it.

Its obvious that there is another book after this for the ending is too open.I hope they are as enjoyable as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive explanation of Hendrix's untimely demise.","review":"So many other Hendrix biographies have glossed over the circumstances surrounding Jimi Hendrix's death. Many other writers have tried to tackle this weighty subject, but none of them have succeeded. None, that is, until Tony Brown published this book. Hendrix: The Final Days spells out all of the facts, including some new elements of the hours leading up to Hendrix's death that I didn't know before I read this book. As a serious Hendrix fan, I consider this book to be an indispensible reference full of quotes and solid facts, just like the rest of Brown's books about Hendrix.Throughout the years, Jimi Hendrix has been used too often as a posterchild for the \\"Drug-Free America\\" campaigns. The irresponsible journalists who insist on perpetuating the myth that Hendrix died of a narcotics overdose should read this book. They should read this book and then print apologetic retractions of all the lies they have spread in the name of journalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book","review":"it's sad to think of this genius untimely death.this book is really focused and gives solid inside details.Tony Brown does a wonderful job.looking at what has happened in music since his death you have to wonder what other directions he would have gone in.many questions we will never know but we still have his genius work and that is timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a crock of s&*%!!!!","review":"First of all, jimi did not commit suicide...plain and simple. Even Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox have stated that jimi didn't believe in suicide because he believed that if you committed suicide then your soul would never be allowed to rest in peace. This book only focuses on rumors...it doesn't focus on the facts. So, if you wanna book that realisticly talks about the cause of jimi's death then this book is definetly not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music is not a competition, & Jazz is not a race war!!!","review":"For my money, this is one of the best Jazz recordings ever. I bought it on cassette (with a different title) along with Jackie McLean's \\"Lights Out\\" almost twenty years ago, and both are still among my favorites. When I was a kid, I played the trumpet, and I idolised Miles Davis. I am sick to death of all this Miles vs. Chet, Chet vs. Miles crap. I quit playing trumpet when I was a teenager because Wynton Marsalis (allegedly)had made a racist comment about how only black men could play Jazz, or something like that. Also, way too many white people apparently have considered Chet to be the great white hope of Jazz trumpet. Anyone who loves Miles and hates Chet, or vice versa, is nothing but an evil racist bigot who should go die. I have a friend who I trade Jazz recordings with; we are different colors, but our love of this music (among other things) makes us brothers- and both of us like both Miles and Chet.Dimestore LiamDetroit"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok engine rebuild book, but very little info specific to Nova","review":"This manual has basic information on engine rebuilding, but minimal information specific to the Chevy Nova."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"The biographies read like compelling stories to which I could relate. My mate had been physically/mentally abusive until I finally grew out of tolerating it through the help of my friends. I could not read more than a couple tales at a time because they were painful.

Its careful research is combined with acute observations by author Wilson, on topics ranging from a fateful wrestling match that made Lincoln's reputation in a frontier village to Lincoln's bewilderment when courting Mary Todd. Wilson here produced one of the finest volumes ever to appear in the crowded field of Lincoln books.

Their finest album in mind is \\"The Vanishing Race\\". Graham has taken over the job of lead singer on this album away from Russell. Russell needs to be the lead singer as he has the more dominant voice. The song writing was mediocre at best.

The Last Wilderness (about the Olympic Peninsula) is my personal favorite, for sheer range of characters and stories, more humanity packed into a book than most novels.But Puget's Sound has the most depth and detail, from original sources, of any of Morgan's books. It covers each era of South Puget Sound history, thoroughly and with footnotes. Because of that, it reads more academically than Morgan's other books, and weighs much more, too!

So unless I have hidden ear wax in the palm of my hand...these don't work.I really wanted this to work, but it doesn't from my little experiment.

I have used my Zen for a week at work (in the trades) and not a scratch. The film screen protector is really flimsy. It fell on the carpet and got alittle dirty, couldn't use it. Haven't tried the belt clip or arm band yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case","review":"Although the thought of a protective case was very smart, the fact is that this case seems too bulky. After a couple of days of using it I just decided to go without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Zen Deluxe Package Skin","review":"I loved everything about this package excetp the film screen protector. It was pretty flimsy. The skin itself is wonderful and really protects the mp3 player. I also like the flip up screen protector and the back clip as well. Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT ORDER FROM VIZU. They didn't send me my order and will not respond to e-mail or phone call. This is a horrible company.","review":"I ordered this product with the anticipation of having an armband and case to use my player at the gym more safely. The order arrived without the armband. I left two e-mail messages and two phone call messages but the company didn't reply. I contacted Amazon to ask for a refund due to the lack of response. The company did respond then stating they would send the armbad but ofcourse it never arrived. Do NOT order from Vizub since this company fails at both customer service, shipping products ordered and following through on thier word. There are plenty of alternatives out there. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I bought this item pretty much just for the skin, and not for the other features. I don't use the screen shield (the hard clear plastic piece), the stand, or the arm band, I just use the skin and the screen protector. As a skin it works very well. It fits well, but isn't super tight. This makes it easy to put on and you don't have any problem with the buttons like I've heard about in reviews of other skins. The screen protector is a pain in the rear to put on without air bubbles, but I believe that's going to be the case with any screen protector. Overall, I think it was a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"This product is extremely beneficial. The covers control location matches well with those on the Zen. I like the ease of use and the ability to switch from the belt clip to the active armband. The only negative would be the stand which sometimes moves away from cover when moving. If this were removable when not in use it would have been a five star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible with Creative Zen Vision M","review":"It definitely looks like a lot of stuff for 9.99 + shipping. The problem is that it does not work well when you try and press the butttons on the Creative Zen Vision M. Because the silicon case is so tight around the zen you can press the button but it does not allow the click to release and you have to loosen the case before the click releases. I just received this yesterday so I dont know if the case will loosen a little in the long run but for now I definitely do not recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silcone cover for mp3 player Zen","review":"Was missing a piece that allows you to use the belt clip.I still can use it to protect the zen player but i cant use the belt clip which was 1 of the main reasons i chose to purchase it in the 1st place."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. BUYER BEWARE","review":"I bought this product, in the hopes of stopping my player getting more scratched than it is now. there are no good points too this product. The cover does not fit the player properly. The cover covers the earplug hole partly restricting usage of this port. The hinges of the plastic screen protector won't fit into the holes as the case won't stretch far enough.I tried to turn on my player while the case was on it, but the player wouldn't turn on due too all the buttons being pressed down at the same time, by the tightness of the case.If I could give this negative rating or even a zero I would do this without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the protector, could do without the rest.","review":"The protective skin is perfect. It fit over the device without any problem, and it has already provided good protection to the screen and body of my zen. As a comparison, my cell phone which I've carried in my pocket for the last two years looks like it's been run over by a car - I think with this skin the zen will hold up better. The screen protector is a nice touch.The armband is not something I use with a device this hefty. The belt clip is suspect- it's too flimsy for me to use and feel confident with. But the skin allows me to put the zen right in my pocket without digging out a protective bag or other cover. The skin alone is worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its cool i guess","review":"This is a nice product. I don't have a warranty on my Zen so this is a needed thing and it serves its purpose. The only bad thing about it is the Zen plug on the bottom comes out really easily. But other than that its great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Protective? Yes. USEFUL..no!","review":"PROS: Good protection, arm strap is so-so CONS: Adapter doesnt hold when rubber case is on, belt clip is garbageVery good protection; a purposely done drop yielded no changes or injuries.Thats IT for the good though: the adapter piece slips out VERY EASILY when you want to charge or add music. The flip up screen wont sit flush, which makes the rubber underneath stick up or it lays clumsily on top. There are no holes to let the natural light from the buttons show through...and most importantly..that FREAKIN BELT CLIP DOESNT WORK! It will NOT stay on. It doesnt even fit...the circle on the front of the belt clip is supposed to fit between the two side bars of the kickstand thing. The circle thing is not even big enough to touch both sides.Buy it if you want that rubber protection; but if you want to strap it to something (like for exercise), it can only be your arm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but don't run with it...","review":"It worked decent, but the first time I tried to run with it, the film screen protector fell off during my run, which I didn't realize until I'd returned home. So I guess I'll try to find something a little more durable for jogging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit player by a long shot","review":"I completely agree with another reviewer who said this does not fit the Zen Vision M correctly. I thought maybe because I have the 60GB version, it was too snug. But Amazon and Creative's website both list the 30GB and 60GB versions of the Zen Vision as having the same dimensions. If that's true, I'm not sure what player this case is meant for. It certainly doesn't come close to fitting the 60GB.The case is so snug it bows visibly around each opening, bends the power button to the side, and would barely allow you to hook into the headphone jack. It's so tight that all of the buttons are depressed at once by the case, rendering them useless. The screen opening bends open so far that the plastic flip screen will not hook into the slots for it, and just falls out feebly.Basically, this case does not come close to fitting properly, and I couldn't recommend it to anyone. It's straight garbage. Do not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take that, Apple!","review":"Have you seen the price of skins for iPods? They're insanely overpriced. This little baby comes with a belt clip, armband, a screen cover, and a little metal piece to prop it up on a table. I've had it for a long time now, and it's stayed together just like it was new. A very nice product, and I recommend it to anyone with a Zen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Protection","review":"A little struggle getting the player in the sleeve. It's a nice fit and it's a good feeling to have the player protected. No instructions, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, you have to unscrew the belt clip and insert in the case hole. Of course, didn't realize this until after I put the player in the case.Overall good. Like the screen protector and the plastic flip window for that added protection. It's a big investment so it's worthwhile to purchase this for the protection of the player."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"Well i bought this product and well it was a black one it kept collecting all the dust around and even worse the belt cilp there was no place to put it without making some type of mark on the Zen also the case itself expands so i was really dissapointed with this buy as for now i now have to go and find something else!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Value","review":"I recently purchased this for my creative zen, what a great deal, it came with the armband, belt clip,stand, and screen covering (a plastic flipscreen), was an easy assembly and works great. I love the plastic flipsreen though it does scratch rather easily.I was weary about the product before buying it, being so cheap, but I'm so glad I purchased this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It serves its puropse...","review":"Well, what can I say? This package serves its purpose, but for $9.95 you can't really expect alot else. The skin cover is great, keeps the Zen Vision safe, no question, but everything else is low quality. The screen protector is almost impossible to apply properly, the arm band would be great if the view stand wasn't permanently attatched, and therefore cutting into your arm every time you use it. I haven't used the belt clip yet,but it doesn't look out of the ordinary, so I'm sure its fine. If you are looking primarily for a skin cover, do yourself a favor and just buy that and pick up another brand of accessories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"synopsis","review":"Proud and beautiful, she would be no man's prize!

He this shows this by constantly mentioning his antagonists in life or his \\"adversary's\\" he also had a talent for expressing himself in a way no other rapper could do. This cd shows his talents well because it is compiled from different points in his life right from 1991 to the year of his death 1996. CD2 is more heart felt, thus impressing you when he switches to his hardcore mode on CD1. Switch from being a moron to intelligent by purchasing this CD. PEACE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Pac Too Many","review":"This album contains purely demo material. It has no place alongside his pre-posthumous work.

I felt robbed of my twenty somewhat dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"say what you want....","review":"but i definitely believe that this is a tight album. i don't know what all of yall are talkin about sayin that the first side is weak. i listen to it regularly straight through and it keeps my head banging. And with side 2... well i felt there was some good old stuff, but some of the tracks could have be left out. The hidden gem of the album can be found in Only Fear Of Death, a song that will leave the listener begging for more. Too bad rap had to lose a legend in 2pac.

This double LP sounds more like a compilation of 2Pac's early work, most tracks were made around the times of \\"2Pacalypse Now\\" and \\"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\\", and it shows. Although Tupac (as always) comes with it lyrically (for the most part), this album - like his old albums, suffers from poor production. But this LP is still a solid buy, it is just below average overall as an LP.

The entire production is very professional and engaging. The music is appropriate and not terribly annoying, but the highlights are the great footage, excellently written and delivered narration, and attention to detail. The narrator is a girl, and her comments are occasionally punctuated with questions from a boy. Graphics are used to unobtrusively introduce concepts such as size, height, and volume. And best of all, there is a female pilot along with the many men interviewed and lots of shots of planes taking off and landing on the aircraft carrier.

You can get both the Netflix promo and free movie/rental promo together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No griping - Just buy it","review":"My ideal electronic appliance has just one On/Off button and flawless performance - the DVP-S330 comes closest to this ideal, considering the sophisticated technology behind the front panel. Easy to set up, a breeze to use, and in one shot obsoleting two former remotes (TV set & VHS machine) - what more can you ask for, for not even that much dough?. One nuisance, though: the audio-out level delivers muffled sound, making it a necessity to fiddle with the receiver controls when starting to play a disc -- probably those of us not owning fancy SDDS-receivers-or-whatever gizmos don't deserve sharp sound -- but I'll live with with it. Still worth every penny, excellent value.

I'm returning mine now. Strangely, Sony has no recall procedure in place because they claim that not every 330 in the batch manufactured before 8/99 has had a problem.

This player provides the benefits of DVD at a reasonable price. It has excellent picture clarity and sound. I haven't incurred any of the problems that others who own this model have mentioned in previous reviews. I've even tried DVD rentals and have not had any problems.

This is the low-end model, but the only obvious missing feature is the analog 5.1 surround output. Unless you have a receiver that requires that, don't worry about it. (I firmly believe that the surround sound decoding belongs in the receiver, for use by multiple components.)One thing you can't do with Sony DVD players is play CDs that you make yourself with a CD-R drive.

Optical audio is fabulous. There's no component video, but I don't even have an S-Video television. No zoom-in feature either. Both don't matter at all to me though. Weighs very little. Unfortunately does not play CD-Rs.You'll love using this for years with the beautiful design of the player, the remote, and the on-screen menus.

C 13:00 is the error message you will receive when the DVD player will no longer recognize a DVD-- clean, dirty, new, used, home made movie, or cinema DVD it will NOT read it! then you'll be stuck with a dust collector.

She assumes some previous acquaintance with geometry and simple algebra and analytic geometry. But not too much of the latter, so don't let this scare you off.The trig concepts are slowly introduced and explained at some length. With plenty of examples. Now, you really should tackle as many of the problems as possible. Yes, it takes time. But if you want a solid, fluid grasp of trig, you have to spend the time to familiarise yourself with sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant.There are certainly numerous relationships between these functions. You don't have to know all of them.

There was no reason for the demo to be done with a nude infant. The instruction was awful. Several of the massage techniques were not soothing to the infant. The creepy guy and the creepy moves he did were unsettling. There are many other infant massage videos out there that are better for parent and baby. Amazon should stop selling this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with others who find this video disturbing","review":"I was distracted by the fact that they man couldn't keep the bottle of oil out of the baby's reach. Whenever he let go of her I'd get nervous she'd fall. No matter how quickly he might grab for her, she's covered in oil and could easily slip out of his hands and onto the floor. Then she starts grabbing for the cap, which she could easily choke on. He took it from her several times, but didn't put it out of reach like he should have. She even tried to put it in her mouth. If nothing else, this is a great video of what NOT to do during an infant massage.There was very little instructional content to this video. Essentially, what you see is a 30-something minute, low-budget film of a man rubbing a baby down in oil and trying to stop her from spilling the bottle of oil or falling onto the floor and injuring herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended!","review":"Received a poor quality DVD. It would not play sound in my Toshiba DVD player (I have not had a problem with any other DVDs). I had to play it in my Panasonic portable DVD player in order to hear the sound.

I agree with other reviewers that the guy was creepy. The one year old in the DVD kept trying to crawl off the table. The guy said several times how you needed to keep the oil out of the baby's reach, but didn't heed his own advice. I didn't find the DVD very helpful and will continue to look for a better instructional DVD. My husband couldn't sit through the whole thing, said it was too painful to watch.

It is odd that he could be so critical of so many of the other mushers from the back of the pack. While not quite an armchair quarterback, he was definitely throwing some cheap shots from the sled runners. I had a suspicion while reading this book that he was searching for a way to justify his utter lack of speed, instead of just reveling in the moment.

My only issue is the presentation of Anthony Carill but that's just me being picky - I don't like the soft speaking. The poses combined with the weights will always challenge you, just add more weights and take the poses deeper. One day I want to be able to do this on my Bosu ball.

You will hear an unconvincing history of the bass, you will learn how to hold the instrument - described twice. You will learn some finger exercises, the major scale, and two arpeggios, but there is no description of just how these principles are applied to real music, and Phil goes on about how he's saving you time, but his explanation of how he does this is very flimsy.

I was addicted to the first Jars CD and now this one. Each one of their songs are so different so it's like listening to the same song over and over just with different words. Their paradox of strings with the tradtional rock band electric gitaurs and drumms is truly unquie and they pull it off quite well. HOwever there is no hidden jam session as there was on the fisrt CD but there is a bonus.

Each page inside is a different color and there's this neat little collage thingie in the center of it all.Like I said, this is my favorite album. If you've waited until now to buy it, you've waited too long. I was not at all a Jars of Clay fan before I bought this album.

What has made them so popular is their Accoustic sound mixed with various other instruments. Their lirics are also well developed making for a great group. But When success hit a group it may go to their heads. That is why, in my opinion, the follow up to their debut record, Much Afraid, isn't as well written or developed. It seems as if with their fame with Flood, from their first record, that they may have commercialized their new C.D. Never-the-less, Much Afraid is some what characteristic of Jars of Clay's work. It has upbeat songs and slow songs depending on your mood, but has gotten away from its \\"roots\\". So if interested in more Jars of Clay, This would be a bad C.D. to look into, but don't expcect the superior quality you may have experienced with their earlier work."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is awesome! The acoustics are incredible!","review":"I first started to listen to Jars of Clay when they broke off of the christian radio and expanded their gospel to secular music. Their acoustics are very up lifting. Overjoyed and Crazy Times are just sweet! Buy it! Get closer to God!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Solidifies It...","review":"Though this album came out ten years ago, it's my favorite Jars album. I have been sadly disappointed with all of the albums following this one, but it could be because I'm holding them to the standard of 'Much Afraid'!Dan Haseltine has a remarkable way of writing lyrics that are not-so-obvious in their direction, which is why I believe they have so many non-Christian fans. But his lyrics are also well written and interlaced with excellent guitar playing and emotion, it's hard to miss the talent of this band.From 'Weighed Down' to 'Crazy Times' to my favorite, 'Truce', I'm going to rank this album in my top 20. And I have A LOT of CDs. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jars Of Clay At It's Best! Awesome!","review":"I don't know how they did it. This cd is full of music at its best! Jars of Clay combined a solemn and steady tone with meaningful words full of truth. Track no. 5 (Frail) displays an awesome 1 minute and 45 second introduction of a spectacular guitar solo. People that have a habit of changing cd's because they can't find a cd that has a good song track after track need to buy this cd. From Overjoyed to Hymn, they display a show of truth, devotion, and talent as they play their hearts out. Crazy Times and Tea And Sympathy were my original favorites. Five Candles (You Were There) has a catchy tune that'll will make yo addicted in no time, and Frail will keep it real. Hymn will bring a classic \\"hymnal\\" type of song to you with words of truth. Also, the new \\"If I Left The Zoo\\" cd is a blast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH AFRAID: PURE GENIOUS","review":"I have been a fan of the jars since their first album. ive seen them preform three times, and even met them once. This CD, though it used to be my least favorite of the jars, is based on the classic HINDS FEET ON HIGH PLACES by H annah Hurnard. it is the story of Much Afraid as she flees from her relatives the Fearings to make a journey with the shepard(Jesus) to the high places to become like a hind or a deer. It is an allegory about becoming a christian and letting Christ overcome our physical, spiritual, and emotional limitations. It is not only this that makes the CD great, it is the superb voice of Dan Haseltine, combined with some awesome guitar work by Steve Mason, great bass by Matt Odemark and the keyboarding of the professor Charlie Lowell. the best cuts are crazy times, truce, fade to grey, and five candles"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Effort","review":"Jars of Clay's first album was spectacular and can never be equalled again. But their sophmore release did not dissappoint me either. MUCH AFRAID is richer musically and experiments a lot more than the first album did.

The song \\"FRAIL\\" sticks out of the bunch as being mesmerizing, very deep, and conveying the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"grows on you","review":"When I first got this CD, I didn't like it. But it grew on me. Each time I played it, I came to like it a little more. The songs on this disc have a real depth (spiritual and musical) to them. Some of my favorites include the introspective \\"fade to grey,\\" the soul-searching \\"frail,\\" the prayerful \\"weighed down,\\" the bitterly honest \\"much afraid,\\" and the beautiful \\"hymn.\\" This disc is great for leading yourself into worship or for playing when you're entertaining guests. I recommend this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"Although this isn't the best Jars album, it's still very good. I recently got the CD, and right now I think that the first 4 tracks (Overjoyed, Fade to Gray, Tea and Sympathy, and Crazy Times) are the best. I have been reading reviews and maybe I should listen to the album a few more times to see how great the other tracks are too; before I really judge it. Don't think that this album isn't good- well, it's not it's GREAT. Of course it'll never compare to their self-titled CD, but it's a super sophmore album.

This saddle fit has the support in all the right places and enabled me to increase my saddle time to several hours on day one.

It is really cheaply made, and poorly designed. The plastic does not support that well, and constantly moves and flexes slightly. The biggest design issue is the seat is too long front to back. The hornless seat I ended up liking was short enough that my hip bones can rest comfortably on the seat, and the front does not extent past the crease that separates the top of your leg and your sitting area.There are some good hornless designs on the market that are really well made.

It's a little odd at first but it didn't take me long to adjust to the ride. I didn't have any trouble with the balance.

Yes, it took pressure off of the groin area. However, the seat has two serious design flaws.First, the pads are built so that they dig into your thighs (they should be sloped in and in the other direction).Second, the seat rocks as you move. It is slight--maybe 10 degrees or so--but very irritating. I commute in city traffic. Concentration is key. The rocking of the seat made it impossible to focus on what was around me.This seat is, alas, going to be trashed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant find comfortable position","review":"The cushions move too much.

I really think this seat was made for someone of a smaller statue. It did work in getting rid of the numbness in my crotch, however it only lasted three bike rides. Your butt bone rest on two little dimples in the seats. That is what keeps you from sliding off. The seat itself is hard and a bit uncomfortable, but not intolerable. Each pad will adjust from side to side with a thumb screw holding it in place. The problem is the whole pad is kept from sliding off by a plastic plug on the end. Guess what comes out with not too much pressure. Being big as I am, the seat quickly fell apart on me. Someone of a smaller frame might have a better run at it. Anyway the principle works, no pressure in the crotch area mean no numbness. I am giving it two stars for working but nothing more because of the bad design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"This is suppose to be one of the best, however it fell apart three times my first one mile ride. The attachment for the seat to the bike is made of plastic with very small thumb turn screws to hold the seat to the frame. Three times the right seat fell off onto the road and the last time almost got hit by a car trying to retrieve the parts. Very poor design and may be some major liability there with this product.By the way, I tightened the thumb screws as tight as possible and within 10 minutes the right side (and parts) fell to the road.You should come up with something safer as I hurt myself when the seat fell off before I finally had to walk the bike home."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This was a major disappointment.

The Hobson Easyseat is the latest one I've tried. While it does relieve pressure, it is so uncomfortable that it makes bicycling torture. I tried adjusting this seat every way possible - moved it up, moved it down, moved the pads from side to side, tilted up, tilted back, no tilt - and no matter what I did it was uncomfortable. I tried it for 3, twelve mile rides and it got to the point where I can no longer bear the thought of riding with this saddle again. I had to constantly change my position in a futile attempt at finding a comfortable \\"sweet spot\\". Occasionally I would find a half way comfortable position but it would only last for a few minutes. This seat takes all the fun out of bicycling. I cannot understand the many positive reviews here. My search for a decent split saddle seat will continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor design","review":"I took one ride on the seat and took it right off.

I only paid a couple dollars for it and I still feel ripped off!As mentioned in the other review they actually put a splitscreen view of the before and after of their \\"remastering\\" job. It's almost worth buying just to see it because it's such a joke. In fact, it took me a while to figure out which was supposed to be the remastered side.I would like to write about the movie itself as I was looking forward to watching it, but with this DVD that will never happen.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING RELEASED BY THIS HORRIBLE COMPANY (FUSIAN)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only an Info-mercial","review":"This DVD is basically a come-on to entice you to enroll in Villoldo's school.

I have never had any issues with audio track and video track being out of sync, in fact it has worked perfectly. the remote control is intuitive, with multiple rewind and ff speeds. The slow motion also has multiple speeds, so you can go frame by frame with the jog function, or the system can move forward very very slowly front or back. full features, digital menus, most of the controls can also be done from the console of th machine itself.

On paper, her nordic image appeared very distant to the sevilian woman depicted by the French musician.Yet, her fine acting, and her years living in Spain helped, along with a black haired wig, to offer us a magnificent Carmen, full of fire and with impecable singing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not greatest","review":"I've read all these reviews with great interest and while I agree with the general trend - musically and visually exciting, Elina Garanca outstanding etc - I have to say that those who think this is the best Carmen ever obviously have not seen the great Placido Domingo/Julia Migenes-Johnson film version. Wonderful though Garanca is, and obviously giving it her all, I just don't think she is quite as perfect in the part as was the Marvellous Migenes - she really WAS Carmen, despite not being a mezzo. If you can afford to buy more than one Carmen DVD then buy both of these (and there are a couple of other good ones available too - remember Jose Carreras in his prime as a very good Don Jose?) - if you can only afford one then go for Placido and Julia (and Raimondo Ruggiero, quite wonderful as Escamillo)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous performance, wonderful interpretation","review":"Elina Garanca is spectacular in the role of Carmen.

One of the Met's best productions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie ever made....................","review":"I first saw this movie in 1966, and was blown away by it's story line and camera work. I recently discovered the DVD and found that after forty years, it has stood the test of time. It is even better seeing it through the eyes of a sixty-one year old, then it was the first time.Claude LeLouch raised the bar for cinema with this one. Many of the camera tricks introduced (through necessity)in this movie...later became the standard for exceptional film making.The story of the making of the film is a welcome added bonus to this DVD. To see Claude belted to a lawn chair, on the hood of a 1957 Buick, holding a big camera, in the rain..............filming that brand new Ford GT40, at 100 MPH.........is worth the price of this DVD, alone.The music is world class, too.

The original blue tinted night scenes are now black and white, the lush bedroom reds and oranges are gone. Most of it remains true, but these serious deficincies really ruin the experience, especially for those of us who saw it in the theatre and remember it very well.The VHS, which I saw but never bought, suffers from a lethargic dubbines treatment and apparently some rough chop. I wonder if somehow the original version shown in american theatres was somehow recolorized back then. No one I know remembers it as clearly as I do, but neither version is very satisfying. Amazing how many missteps occurred in this releasing this wonderful romantic flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bad reprint of a great film","review":"I just saw the broadcast of this version on the \\"Speed\\" cable tv channel. The audio sounded like it came over a telephone, The English dubbing ruins the romance, and the video almost looked like it was done by aiming a video camera at a movie screen. In fact, the movie screen had some spots on it that didn't move. Of course this could have been the cable channel's fault.I decided to buy my own dvd of the movie on Amazon, and was discouraged to find only the dubbed version. If the French language version with subtitles was good enough for the original American theater release, Why change it? I'm waiting for a re-release with decent production values and the original French language script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore!","review":"I rented this video based on the wonderful things I had heard about it, and I enjoy exploring the classics.

It is hard to find books on his reading level that hold his interest. The narator of the story is Hank the cowdog (also self proclaimed head of ranch security). The chapters are only 3 or 4 pages and give my son a sense of accomplishment for being able to read a couple of chapters each night.Hank also has a few pronuciation problems, allowing the young reader to identify correct pronunciation and grammer. The stories are interesting and funny and have really improved my son's interest in reading as well as his grades in reading and language skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My son has read most of these books and we thought it would be nice to have them on cd to listen to on the road.

I found the acting to be very poor, as exemplified by the main character, portrayed by Jennie Garth. I feel she was badly miscast with her Betty Boop protrayal. The best performance was given by the beautiful, status-seeking wife. Personally, I wouldn't waste money on this, but would save it for Jewels, The Ring, to name a couple of wonderful interpretations of Danielle Steele's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensitive and sweet story","review":"Great movie.

The acting is mediocre though with the exception of the actress that played Bierko's wife. Jenny Garth is not a good actress, but if you like sappy chick flicks, you will like this movie. I have yet to see a Danielle Steel film that is as good as Lace, which is the best film of all and extremely hard to get. This movie was predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atractive and functional-what a prize!","review":"I love this cookware!

The Handles are silicone and can go into the oven at lower temperatures. I noticed that if I grab the handle close to the end of the handle it can be a little hot as the silicone tapers a little bit.

I was looking for something to use as an introductory training tool for a medium sized manufacturing firm and thought I might at least find small segments that could be used for an adult audience.

No more of my wife complaining that the seat isn't down.The seat has a unique fastening system so that it doesn't shift to the left or right. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 star review is that it seems a little too light weight and plasticy (new word).

The E-Myth Contactor - is a summary of M. Gerber's program with \\"contractor stories.\\" There is no true insight into the contactor industry. My guess is this is the 1st of many books focusing on specific industries. My advice is to skip this book, just purchase Gerber's E-Myth Revisited & make the connections yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"It puts a hook in your mouth.","review":"This book is filled with wonderful ideas and philosophies. They all make sense and seem to put you on the path to the realization of your goals. The problem is that not all the keys to making the ideas work that you could actually put into practice are provided in the book. The idea of the book seems to be to get the reader excited and then point them to a web site where one can sign up for classes (at a healthy fee) to learn the fundementals of the systems and how to put them to use. The limited scope of the book was no doubt designed to provide the author, Mr. Gerber, with more income than he receives just through book sales. I would be very cautious before getting hooked because the \\"rest of the story\\" is provided in a lengthy process that is quite expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same content - different package","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the E-Myth Revisited. I thought there was a lot of good material and direction for me to follow.I was excited to see that the author was coming out with a contractor version that I hoped would fit my company even better. I was disappointed to find that it really wasn't much more than the first book, somewhat refocused.Between reading the two books, I contacted the company to see about using their consulting services. It became clear to me that the principles presented in the books, which they ask business operators to live up to, are not implemented in the E-Myth company very well at all. - Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"This book repeats a few of the strategies presented in \\"The E-Myth Revisted\\", trying to point them at the contractor. Unfortunately, except for a couple of good ideas from that book, there is nothing here but fluff and pep talk. At one point, I think you can actually tell where material was cut-and-pasted from the sister book about medical practices, where they accidentally forgot to change \\"practice\\" to \\"contracting business\\".If you found some chapters of the \\"The E-Myth Revisted\\" to be a bit fluffy for you, you can count on an entire (although short) book of it here. Very dissapointing and not particularly useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome extenstion to his other books","review":"Gerber's books on the EMyth should be required reading in MBA schools and should be provided free by all CPA's of the world.He describes how you need to work ON your business (developing franchiseable systems) rather than IN your business (as a worker).This book extends that theme for contractors. There is alot of new material here that updates previous versions. I was able to read it quickly in an afternoon... even after extensive underlinings. I went to his web site and researched other books here on Amazon.Overall, this should be recommended reading for any entrepreneur, particularly those that have been in business for several years and are frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Chiefs","review":"I was initially impressed when I first started reading Gerber.He quickly captures your attention with well described scenariosof everyday business problems.Small contractor can identify with time, employee,and cash flow issues.The second one half of the book moves rapidly to conceptualrather than the practical solutions to the initial problems.We all know we need a \\"business plan\\", and we all knowat times that we need to read \\"inspirational material\\" to boostour spirit.I found this book somewhat lacking in a more conciseand specific formula that was promised to createthe changes needed to alleviate the common woes.In the very end you are left with the same problem:someone has to be in charge. An office or a businessleft with all the chiefs running amuck isa dangerous situation. I give thisbook one thumb down.C.

However, it's not really written like a case study. It's written as a stand alone book. For that, I give this book only 2 stars. The E-Myth Revisited was an excellent book. Exceedingly worthwhile to read. This one was not. I could have done without it and, probably, so can you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sales/Marketing","review":"This book was amazing!

It is a fast read because there is little real information, mostly rhetorical questions, and a few anecdotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent small business framework","review":"Michael Gerber does a very good job outlining a basic approach to small business development. His approach may give some readers an enlightened perspective on their current small business dilemas. He has an insightful understanding of how typical contractors think and the challenges we all deal with everyday. This book won't solve your problems - you have to do that - but it will give you the basic groundwork needed to change the way you think about your business and how you run it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read explaining importance of CashFlow for business owners.","review":"This is another in the series of E-myth books. While focused on (building) contractors, it is very applicable for any business owner. It breaks down the different ways to look at money related to business. A quick read, especially if you have read the e-myth Revisited. I usually go purchase a bunch for each new client to get them on the same page of understanding that running your business by the checkbook or float is a recipe for disaster.

Her motive for going to medical school and becoming a shrink is to exact revenge on Odessa. What a stupid plot to begin with and the execution is just as bad. Once hired by Gibson State, Marti immediately launches into her plan and is so obvious about what she is up to, it ruins any mystery or suspense the author may have hoped to have present.The characters in this book are transparent and cartoonish.

It expanded again in 1967, and in the early 1980s took control of a 'security zone' in southern Lebanon.\\" This makes it seem like Israel simply wants to expand its borders. This book does not mention times when countries invaded Israel and also does not mention terrorism!

I have enjoyed almost every Burton movie out there, but this one seems severely lacking. The plot is droll, almost like Burton read the cliff notes version of the fable. The character development (what little of it there was) is painfully easy to predict, more like a fledgling directors work. The score was weak at best. Elfman just didn't seem to put as much into this project as he has in others. It seems to me that Burton and Elfman put in a whole weekend worth of thought into this work.

The stop-motion animation was not nearly as smooth as in The Nightmare Before Christmas(TNBC). The soundtrack was mediocre at best, though there was occassionally interesting background music.The movie is just over an hour long and it really seems to have a slow storyline. If I could go back in time, I would not go to see Tim Burton's Corpse Bride. As a Burton fan, the movie was simply sub-par.

En mi opinión no llega a tener el ritmo ni la profundidad en la historia que ésta última.Aunque a nivel de imagen considero que los años han pasado a favor de la \\"Novia Cadáver\\" lo cierto es que ni en la historia ni en la música alcanza las cotas de PADN. La música es muy parecida y la historia es bastante más floja y mucho más predecible. Hay elementos como el perro del protagonista en el Inframundo que son como el perro de PADN.A pesar de todo estoy muy satisfecho con la compra de este DVD y la recomiendo encarecidamente.Respecto a los Extras, te enteras de algunos detalles pero tampoco aportan gran cosa.

The film is overall not a great film so i will say it's ok at times but most of all it's bad. The good parts of the movie are the animation it's great and the movie is very visual to watch and while you watch it you love the animation. The bad parts are the story it's very short only 77 min, there is no point to the story and it's very lacluster, the voices are also very dull and have no life to them. The movie is a waste of time so dont bother watching it you wont be enertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed : (","review":"I am sad to say, that only after watching this dvd once - it wouldn't play for me any longer. I've updated my blue-ray player thinking that it must've needed one. But after all that & trying it again the dvd wouldn't work. I'm sad because I really liked this movie and it's been a long time since I last seen it. But I had to buy a regular dvd and it sufficed.I don't know what was wrong with the product, but it must've just been only mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Corpse Bride\\" is a Keeper","review":"Tim Burton is a GENIUS, but you should know that by now. He never disappoints. I was lucky to get this on Tuesday because by the time I went to Best Buy it was sold out, and only a few left at my Target. I had been waiting for this one. Saw it in the theater and loved it. The animation is fantastic. While this might not be as enchanting as \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" it's a worthy follow-up. Tim and Johnny Depp scored big twice last year with this movie and \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" I'd recommend that also. They're a good team. So buy \\"Corpse Bride\\" if you have seen it or if you haven't. If you like a slightly twisted take on things, grab this DVD immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable tale about character","review":"Yes, it's true, this is a similar story to Nightmare, but what would you expect? Elfman, Burton, and Depp all deliver. It's nice to watch a movie that shows character development and sacrifice through clamation. This should have won the Oscar, no doubt about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"I love all things from Tim Burton. Great story line, great animations. I would recommend this movie to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Really fun- You can't compare it to Nightmare before Christmas though- that was just amazing. But creative as all and a great watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film, great animation & characters","review":"Tim Burton set a high standard with The Nightmare Before Christmas but supplies audiences again with Corpse Bride, a re-telling of a Russian/Jewish folktale. Sadly, the title character, Emily (the Corpse Bride), does not have herself a happy ending and her tale of her eminent demise (by murder for her money) is not the typical happy-ever-after associated in most animated films; still, the movie maintains an aura of whimsicality and jubilee despite its horror film-like antics. Entertaining but somewhat sad film, but long overdue."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Nightmare Before Christmas","review":"I'll give it 2 stars for the excellent animation but other than that it was just horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing For Once","review":"The story concept is way above average, the animation is about average, the energy level is corpse-compatible. On the whole, Corpse Bride is entertaining enough to sit through once--especially if you're 10 or under. But if your cake has ever had 20 candles or more, once will likely do it for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corpse Bride","review":"Tim Burton is my favorite movie maker.

She is all like aHH! im deaD! and he s all like.. AHH... so the movie get progressivly worse and then they burst into some cool songs.all in all its an ok film with great animation and some funny jokes.i say go by edward sissorhands starring johny deep and wynona ryder. its a LOT BETTER....jared"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing, but still fun","review":"As a huge Tim Burton fan, I was expecting more than this. The plot seems awfully familiar...of Tim Burton's other animated film, The Nightmare Before Christmas. It's as if somebody took a plot synopsis from that movie and simply changed a few things around, threw in a few dozen plot holes, and robbed the characters of anything interesting. The Danny Elfman songs also sounded like spoiled Nightmare leftovers.Luckily, there are some plusses. The animation is beautiful and the gags are very funny. This is a Tim Burton movie, so there is bound to be some amazing twisted visuals, and the goods are delivered there. It's still a major dissapointment, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Closed Captions or English Subtitles for Additional Features","review":"Additional features are subtitled only in French.Movie does have Closed Captions.Tim Burton is CHEAP not to caption everything!

This movie is pointless and a waste of time and money....."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I LOVE THIS MOVIE\\" \\"IT'S SO GOTH!\\"","review":"First off, that title was a complete mockery of the fools who watch this movie and consider it goth, don't enjoy it, and wear the related apparel so they can be considered cool by other \\"goths\\". While watching this movie I didn't think for one second that it was goth at all. This is mainstream crap that trys to appeal to to many different groups at once, and fails at all attempts. The songs were very boring and forgettable. Plus, the movie spawned a whole horrifying army of prep-turned-'goths' who wear \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"Corpse Bride\\" because it was the first thing they saw at that one 'cool store', Hot Topic, thus making themselves cool among so called friends who only like them because they're popular. \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" was and is extremely overrated.

This movie takes its place alongside nightmare before christmas as my favorite stop motion movie, casting johnny depp for corpse bride was a stroke of brilliance, I always thought tim burton needed to use johnny depp for a nightmare before christmas type stop motion movie, tim burton and johnny depp work wonders together as usual.

It has a slightly \\"sick\\" appeal to it, like many of his other movies. The color is amazing and it ranges from fun, upbeat and colorful to dark, quiet and somber. The dancing skeleton's are very clever. There's a lot of irony and sarcasm, but it's done in a \\"genius\\" way. It's similar to The Nightmare Before Christmas, including the dog. The soundtrack (piano) is absolutely beautiful and also entertaining (Danny Elfman). The movie has a dark feel to it like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but it's wonderful - if you're into that sort of thing (like me). It's funny! My children (ages 7 and 5) enjoyed it, too - I just remind them ahead of time that it's \\"just a movie\\" so they don't get scared. The pairing of Tim Burton with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter is exquisite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie but wish it was longer.....","review":"When you wish a movie was longer, that's when you know it's that good. I guess that's also part of the con. I thought the movie could use some more movie time:-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a little short...","review":"Recently we went to see Tim Burton's Corpse Bride. It's a stop-motion animation flick, similar to The Nightmare Before Christmas.It's thoroughly entertaining, great family fare. The only knocks I have against it are its length--it is short--and it has a pretty linear and predictable plot. The voice actors turn in good performances. Danny Elfman does a great job, as always, with the music. The movie features a great colour scheme, evoking a grey, Victorian style in the land of the living, and a more colourful land of the dead.It's a great family film, as I said. However, it could be scary for very young kids. Kids under 5 shouldn't be at the movies anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite!","review":"& not just the beauteous title character, -Corpse Bride- is a dark 1940's-Disney-style story about a nervous groom whose arranged marriage - which seems destined to be joyful, regardless - is put off when he fumbles his vows [for 3 hours!]. He runs off to practicce & ends up wed to the Corpse Bride ... & then the fun begins. Musical numbers, creepy skeletons, maggot jokes [*not* what you think!] & the course of cursed True Love abound in this delightful, black-chocolate confection.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky Burton fun!","review":"Dead bride ... shy young man ... blah, blah, blah. You've read the plot, now go watch the movie! This story is fun, fun, fun. After a short while into the movie, it starts to matter less and less who is dead and who is alive ... all the characters are zany! Bravo to the cast for vocalizing such wonderful characters. The only drawback for me were the songs ... I like Danny Elfman's music, but these vocals felt out of place in this movie.Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My kind of movie :)","review":"Fan of Tim Burton, as well as Johnny Depp, so I ordered this without ever seeing the movie.

I've owned it now for three years and have watched it so many times I'm afraid I'll wear out the packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I LOVE this movie! Johnny Depp and Tim Burton collaborate well together. My DVD arrived in a very timely manner, I believe I got it before the actual ship date and I did watch it almost immediately. Amazon also gave me a 48 hour rental on this title after I initially purchased it so I could stream it to my television through my xbox from the Amazon Instant Video app. I really like this feature of Amazon because it beats having to get in the car to hit up a red box or the video rental store to rent a movie. The newer releases range from 2.99-3.99 for a 48 hour rental which is about the same as a video store but you save yourself some time and gas by renting through Amazon. It may not be a convenience for some but it is definitely for myself because I live in a rural area where I have to drive at least a mile if not more to get to the nearest store."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry Tim...","review":"I love Tim Burton movies, but this one I'm sorry to say was very boring. It was very slow too... The storyline was simple, but I kept getting distracted from the movie because of my boredom. This is not a movie for those that bore easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for shallow characters and an emotionally detached audience","review":"Though the movie had its charm, I was bothered by it. The onset of the film established a gloomy tone which prevailed throughout, which would have worked well if there had existed some kind of comic relief at all. I spent the entire second act feeling sorry for all of the principal characters and without any humor it just weighed me down. Again, if there had been any humor element at all, it wouldn't have been such a downer.The villainous character receives his dues at the end in a last-ditch effort to satisfy the audience. It was so contrived. He brings about his own demise by grabbing a sitting goblet and drinking it, without any real idea of its contents. It felt like a simplistic device to bring about what the audience was naturally waiting for.The songs were forgetable too."},{"rating":"2","title":"jordallequinnreview","review":"We watched the movie as a family get together. We love it because it has a melancholy-yet-upbeat tone to it. The corpse bride really makes one think about life and who you leave behind. In the end, the right choice is made and hope is restored.

The character design is uneven, but the Corpse Bride herself is sometimes quite beautiful on screen.Storywise, it's just dreadful. Slow. Predictable. Not funny. Plus there are a number of garish song and dance numbers which are not entertaining.For all the time and effort put into this type of production, they should've made sure the story was charming and compelling. It was just a bore.Keep in mind, I also think NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS is slow and boring. Visually, I give CORPSE BRIDE 4 stars.

It is like the soles just disintergrated. I store my shoes in boxes w/ silica packs to keep moisture at bay and keep the leather oiled and treated. I am very very diligent about my shoes and feel like they should last more than 2 or 3 years since they are only worn occasionaly. I will probably not purchase Dansko again anytime soon as I have found several links on the internet that this has happened to others also.

The only bad thing about Danskos are that the top of the shoe takes time to break in so at first it cuts into the top of your foot until the shoe breaks in. I recommend changing your shoes in the middle of the day until the Danskos fully break in. Once that's done you will see that your legs and feet are much less fatigued at the end of the day.

I tried these on, and it was a miracle! No breaking in period, no blisters, no pinching, no pain from day one. I am on my feet a lot at work, and these clogs easily carry me through the day.

I'm not as steady on my feet or have as strong, firm ankles, as most adults and I've nearly injured myself (or actually injured myself) many times if it's too early in the morning or I've pushed myself too hard. But if you buy the right size, your foot won't slip out with each step, as happens in many clogs, and you get TRUE support (unlike those overly-cushioned clog-shaped monstrosities that are somehow currently in style). I love them, but I have to be careful that I don't wear them every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"The shoes were very uncomfortable, hard, blistered my feet.

When they arrived I tried them on, it was difficult to get them on they felt a full size smaller. The feel was stiff and hard not comfortable at all.I have a pair that I purchased in 1997 that were the same size as the new pair that fit perfectly and oh so comfortable.I put the 2 pairs together and it was quite obvious the new pair was a few inches shorter.I contacted Dansko and spoke with 2 different representatives who really had no explanation and suggested that I just return them and exchange them.My concern is was it that particular pair or has the sizing changed.I decided to do some research and have read that the new clogs are manufactured in China and the quality is not the same. I checked inside the shoe and it is printed made in China.I think my best bet is to return them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keepers","review":"I tore my right achilles tendon 20 years ago, resulting in severely limited ankle motion. I wore backless clogs for years, for comfort, but developed plantar fasciitis, due to clenching my toes to keep the clogs on.Most shoes that felt good were just plain homely.I went into a local shoe shop a couple years ago, checked these out, and figured if they were good for nurses, I would give them a try. They are durable, and actually quite nice looking with jeans and work wear. My days of wearing heels ended with an injury, but I most likely did my other foot a favor by switching to a comfy supportive shoe.My old ones are 3 years old now, and getting kinda worn, but they are so comfortable, I still put them on for non-formal work days. I recently bought two more pairs, and want them in every color. It might take a month or so to wear them in till they feel like a well loved pair of jeans, but they are worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dansko clog","review":"I have arch and ankle issues so was a little leary of trying the Dansko clogs since they have a loose fit but these are very comfortable shoes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really, really wanted to like these shoes.","review":"I love the way these shoes make my feet and back feel. I get great arch support and there is plenty of room for my toes to wiggle around. They are fantastic for long hours on your feet.BUT, they are terrible for my ankles. When I wear these shoes I roll my ankles all the time and have fallen a couple of times. They are especially bad for me in a hospital setting where there are cords and such that I risk stepping on. I am also afraid to walk/run in them because I am afraid I will wipe out and fall down.I really want to love these, but I feel that the base of the sole needs to be a bit wider for stability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I decided to replace my old Dansko clogs with this style and color.

What a waste of $100."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality has dropped","review":"I used to buy them for my whole office but, we have noticed a big difference in quality.

This is only the second pair I have bought in 7 years and only the inside wore out on the first pair. Outside is still in great shape.

I wore them around the house the day they came in the mail and they seemed fine, but after I wore them the following day at my busy waitress job, I felt crippled. The stitching around the sides dug into my feet and worse, the ball of my right foot is still sore 30 hours after having taken them off and my toes on that foot are still numb. I can't believe these are the same Dansko shoes so many rave about and just maybe they are not. After one wearing, they would not allow me to return them nor would they send me a different right shoe. Now I'm just $100 poorer and have a pair of shoes I will never wear again in my closet. Great. My suggestion is that you buy Dansko's from a company that takes returns in the event it doesn't work out for you. I wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth the money","review":"I don't often spend the money of great shoes but these are well worth the money. I first got them about five years ago right before a trip to Paris with my husband and I spend six days walking the cobbled paths of Paris and never once felt like my feet hurt or that I had to switch shoes to avoid disaster. You have to get used to such great arch support and realize that's the way shoes are supposed to support you. You have to get them fitted correctly - make sure the heel can slip up and down freely. You won't be sorry. They last forever as well. Mine lasted four years until my new puppy decided to have them for dinner. My fault !

Naturally, it would be impossible for anyone to be impressed with every one of them.

In view of all the five star rating above I guess I just don't get it. NO stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Precursor to Stephen King","review":"This is a really well-written, extremely gripping little horror novel. If you've never read Richard Matheson before, get this book--you'll be glad you did. Stephen King has often cited Matheson as one of his main influences, and this book clearly shows why.Matheson tells the story of Tom Wallace, a decent everyday blue collar guy (not unlike Richard Dreyfus's character in \\"Close Encounters\\") who, after being hypnotized, is able to read the darker thoughts lying under his neighbors' smiling exteriors. This is a horror novel that truly works because it deals with very human horrors-the darkness hides inside us all. It is also a very entertaining novel. The characters and dialogue feel right.You can see echoes of this novel in many of much of King's writing, particularly The Shining, and later books such as Needful Things and The Green Mile. If you like Stephen King, you should definitely give Matheson a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A psychic murder mystery with a twist...","review":"If you've seen the movie, forget it. While a good movie, \\"A Stir of Echoes\\" by Richard Matheson resembles it only tangentally. Character names are the same, but that's about it. In the book, the protagonist Tom is a white collar businessman, and the story itself unfolds completely differently: who is murdered, why, and by whom is different from the movie version of this book.I had read the book first, and let me tell you, it's a remarkable read. The psychic abilities of the protagonist are written in a new and fresh perspective. As Tom navigates the mystery of the ghostly figure that is appearing and, apparently, begging him to solve her murder, the story that unfolds is challenging, thrilling, and certainly a fresh take on psychic mysteries.If you liked \\"The Dead Zone,\\" by Stephen King, or you've read Beth Amos' \\"Second Sight,\\" you're in for a great ride with this book. Snap it up, and prepare stay awake at night...'Nathan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another GREAT story from Richard Matheson","review":"This is a great story! As with all his other books, this is a gripping tale that captures the imagination from the first sentence. Don't miss out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Great book. The movie is fantastic, and at the time that I saw it, I hadn't yet heard of Richard Matheson and didn't know that it was based on his book. But like one previous viewer mentioned, even if you've seen the movie, the story in the book is quite different. Definitely worth the read. I'm excited to see what they do with 'I Am Legend', which I've also heard is to be made into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stir of Echoes.... a waste of time","review":"I found this book to be a complete letdown after reading some of the rave reviews on it. There was very little suspense in it and at times the author brushed lightly over any paranormal phenomena. I was left wondering what the main character Tom Holland had actually seen in some of his \\"dreams\\". The book seemed to go off in no real direction leaving me totally confused. If you are after a suspense story then i wouldn't waste your time reding this book. I can only hope the movie isn't as big a flop as i found this book to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick, yet satisfying read","review":"This is not Matheson's best work. That doesn't mean that it's bad, it just has a tough act to live up to in \\"I Am Legend\\". Even \\"Hell House\\" was a better book, especially in terms of pacing. So, what does this book have to offer? A story that's just as good today as the day it was written.This is a fairly creepy read, but not really scary. It raises some good questions, and makes me glad I'm not telepathic. You really feel bad for the protagonist after a while. People can be so ugly on the inside...I've never seen the movie, so I can't comment on that. But I do plan to see it, and expect to be disappointed as always!A great light read, without the impact of a lot of his other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was better","review":"I found this book to be so boring and half the time I found myself skimming the paragraphs. Nothing really happened till the end and it just seemed rushed when it finally came. The characters were boring and I didn't like the fact that he kept apologizing to his wife because he was having trouble sleeping and waking up scared and seeing things. Really? I just don't get it, she seemed like an uncaring selfish b*&ch... Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I'd rather watch the movie and recommend that. At least the movie was entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this read!","review":"The writing was awful, the plot boring, and the whole book was poorly constructed! I was laughing in parts of it...not sure how this author got published in the mainstream...a real disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stir of Outdated-ness","review":"I was excited to read from this author, who many popular Sci Fi and Fantasy writers today give homage to. That excitement quickly turned to dissapointment. The writing is choppy and very out-dated. The plot was not very compelling. In fact I would never have finished this very thin book if I hadn't heard such adulation of it from authors whom I love. I'm guessing now that when these authors were younger, very young perhaps, they enjoyed the basic intrigues and imagination in this book. If they were to have read it for the first time as an adult,now, I find it hard to believe that they would have the same sentiments. It may have been ahead of its time, but how can that be considering Tolkien was before it. I am reluctant to read any of Matheson's other works because this was so unintriguing. It was a fairly interesting yarn at best. I may still give I am Legend a shot, if it's in the bargain bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I wasted the money...","review":"This book was absolutely one of the worst excuses for literary effort since Cather in the Rye (yes, that's an insult). It saddens me that a theme with such potential could be so maliciously bastardized by an author who had obviously little business tackling the whole concept. I think the worst thing about the whole book was how unreal the characters were. It's like, TOM: Honeey, I'm psychic. ANNIE: My God, you're right! That's pretty much the first 100 pages in a nutshell. The character's actions are completely unfounded, and I thought the work was little more than something to keep the coffee table level. I did give it one star however, but not for the book. I feel that the poor guy sho drew the short straw and had to type up the damned thing ought to get some credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not light reading","review":"I'm trying to get into this book. I just find it rather rambling. I read about 1 or 2 pages a night and then fall asleep. Gripping it is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Dissent: This is a Great Book","review":"No point in blabbing on. Everyone agrees that this is a great book. In High Fiedlity, John Cusack kids that it's \\"about girls, right?\\" Well, it's a bit more complicated than that. Of the Marquez books I've read, \\"100 Years\\" and \\"Chronicle of a Death Foretold,\\" this is the funniest. The story tells of Florentino's decades long love for Fermina. During his long wait, Florentino has sex with just about every woman in Colombia, but remains emotionally faithful to Fermina, who marries the stable but dull and passive aggressive Dr. Urbino. What I took from the story is the lesson of how some people exchange passion for stability, while others do the opposite. And can two such people live a life together? Anyway, that's my humble, non-MFA take on it. I might be missing the point. In any case, Marquez is South America's most famous living writer for a reason. Read this book to see why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book!","review":"This is an awesome novel, the first I've read by Marquez. The rich language and original phrases are a treat to anyone searching for a beautiful, poignant literary work. It is honest to the point of being embarassing at times, yet still poetic and rich with history. It will captivate you for the entire reading! My first experience with this author was his short story, \\"The Very Old Man with Enormous Wings,\\" which I also loved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic","review":"This book encompasses the depths of love. Beautifully written. Romantic. I couldn't stop reading it. If you are a romantic at heart, you will love the story!! Fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"so hard to get through","review":"I have always wanted to read this book, and when I finally had the chance, I was really disappointed. The story itself--the idea of the story--was really romantic and wonderful. Getting from the start to the end was the problem--it just dragged. It was truly difficult to get through it and I just didn't love it at all. It ended up being a tough read for me--I finished it only because I wanted to know how it would end, not because I was enjoying it. In the end, I sighed with relief that I was finally finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!!","review":"I was a little hesitant about starting LITTOC because I'd never read Gabriel García Márquez before. I didn't know what to expect when started reading, but I was pleasantly surprised by his quirky characters. What reeled me in from the beginning is the fact that it's not your normal everyday love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really 4.5 stars","review":"The only reason I witheld the last half star was that I think the book is not quite as profound as it could be, and that is, I think, only beciuse it is written entirely from the male experience.OK, OK, I'll give it the 5th star because the author's not at fault for being gender-limited!I thought it was evocative, sweeping, poetic and all that has been said, and I was happy to be reading it. The language is quite beautiful. But somehow I just didn't quite buy the pathetic unrequited love at its core. Can't quite put my finger on why not.I agree it explored all sorts of types of love, and the descriptive passages of place were also highly evocative."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, BORING, BORING","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read. I put it down half way through and read something else. Then I went back to it. Still awful. I shared it with two friends and they couldn't finish it either. It was boring, the writing is terrible and the story is preposterous. Save your money (and time) read anything by Jodi Picoult and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessively wordy, not inspiring, left me with no emotion","review":"I read this book for my neighborhood book club and I was very disappointed. The writing style is very wordy and difficult to follow. To call it verbose and rambling would be generous. There are excessive details about extraneous events and many unnecessary characters that are challenging to follow. I didn't feel connected with any of the people and finished the book without feeling any inspiration. The characters' behaviors and choices were often revolting (for example, an old man molesting a minor female, winning her affections, \\"dumping\\" her, and then feeling no remorse when she kills herself). I would NOT recommend this book. Not worth the time if you're looking for something to add to your life. \\"The Notebook\\" is a much better lifelong love story that will touch your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it or hate it","review":"This is the favorite book of a friend of mine, she rereads it every year. She chose it for our bookclub, and the rest of us hated it! I think this is the best example I know of a book that either really connects with you, or doesn't at all. I have a degree in Eng. Lit. and certainly have encountered a number of books written in a unique or poetic style that I loved, but this one was for me rambling, full of tedious detail that lead nowhere and, since I didn't like a single character, I never felt invested in anything that happened to them. For others what was tedium for me, was poetry. I made myself read the whole book for the sake of the bookclub, but it was like taking medicine--still I can see that every word was a joy for my friend. This isn't a matter of being good or bad, its obviously a masterpiece for some, but if it isn't your kind of writing, you will find it more than a chore to get through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"This is an excellent read- also a second or third purchase of this title as they keep disappearing. Much easier to read than 100 Years of Solitude- which is also excellent and as this book begs for rereading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"It was a difficult read for me. Due to the time period and wording after translation, I just couldn't get into the book. I'm sure that other people may have had a great experience reading it. Unfortunately, Cholera just wasn't my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea...","review":"I purchased this book as my monthly book club read...I never finished it. I've heard so many great things about the book, perhaps I'll try reading it again at a later date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love in the Time of Cholera","review":"Very disjointed book and difficult to get into let alone read through. I must have missed the point somehow. The book seems badly structured, so bad infact, I doubt that I will ever finish reading it.

However, you have to wade through piles and piles of non-essential rubbish to get to the meat of the story (which could have been told in about 1 chapter. Not romantic, but very James Joyce in that the characters are flawed, unhappy people who you're not sure should be together at all. The most difficult thing about this book is the lack of editorial advice. It needs more chapter breaks, less digression, something to make it flow better. Took me a LONG time to finish, and I'm not happy I wasted all of that time when I could have read something more fulfilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooooooooring","review":"I really like and respect Gabriel Garcia Marquez books, but I find this one sort of boring and over elaborating.The book is a love story and I did nt like the characters that much. I found them very stupid, selfish and wasted.I think if you are interested to know about the book just watch the movie, which BTW did not do well in box office.and one more thing, the book was not really an easy read I had to open up dictionary few times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not with a bang but with a wimper","review":"This book is the worst type of book; it starts brilliantly, with the premise and smell of unrequited love, but then it just dies. I felt such relief at finishing, not because- thank God- I know \\"what happens\\" but because in good conscience I can now put it away and not have that hankering orange cover staring up at me from my bedstand. I do not mean to suggest that it is a bad book. It is not. But it fails to deliver on its opening promise. And, we never get to know the characters in any capacity greater than their actions. I have no idea if I like or dislike any of the three main characters. In fact, I don't think I care because I couldn't recognize them walking down the street. I felt betrayed by this book. Why couldn't it have been better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and not what I expected","review":"I think the book went way too slow. It came highly recommended and I was disappointed. It was the kind of book that I just made myself read because I don't like to just stop a book half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Boring I Can't Even Get Through It...","review":"I immediately realized within the first 10 pages that this is not my type of book. I found it extremely boring and couldn't even get halfway through it. Perhaps I went into it with the wrong notions of what it was about. I don't think the description on the back cover really explains it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unpleasant surprise...","review":"As an avid reader, I could not wait to get my hands on a copy of a book that had been recommended to me a thousand times. I devoured the first chapter, and admit it had its brilliant points, but as the book progressed I found it to be banal and tedious. The characters, described by some as \\"wonderfully flawed\\" come across as contrived and ridiculous. The author's extraordinary talent for prose is tarnished by his particular taste for describing the ugly parts of life and failing. If you are looking for a childish endeavour of a novel, veering into sexual activity as an attempt to keep interest but instead insulting intelligence, read this.Don't get me wrong, I know this is a cherished book by many, and I agree that his style has exceptional flair at points. Unfortunately it fell way below expectation; there is nothing deep about this book. The idea was enchanting, I get choked up just thinking about the storyline, but the execution is another matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish this book","review":"This book came highly recommended to me by two friends, whose opinions I respect. I just couldn't get into it. And I tried. I kept hoping it would get better and I would actually CARE what happened to the characters. I found Florentino Ariza to be irritating and whiny. I quit reading a little more than halfway through the book. I just couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Briefly....","review":"I first read this novel in 1992 and contracted a disease much more severe than cholera - an overwhelming desire to find a book that could have the same effect on me. I have yet to find a cure. Quite simply, Love in the Time of Cholera is the best novel I have ever read and has left me with a longing that can never be satisfied - to experience it for the first time again...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really love?","review":"I persisted through this difficult reading thinking that there must be something, somewhere that would evoke the feelings entailed in all the great reviews for this book. What a horrible disappointment. This book shows \\"love\\" in all its profane forms: seduction and molestation of a minor, adolescent and unrequited lust, fornication during a time of mourning, adultery, a rape that \\"enraptured\\" the victim, promiscuity without the reality of STDs and unplanned pregnancies, along with \\"love\\" resulting in suicide and homicide. I hope the movie is vastly different from the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adulterous","review":"Perhaps the translation was not good. It almost seemed like the author was trying to prove to himself and the readers how eloquent and descriptive he could be. The whole book was overflowing with chapter-long descriptions and character analyses made by an omniscient narrator. For every effect, there was a cause that had to be explained for several pages. As if the author wanted to make certain that the reader was convinced of the complexity of the characters and situations. The first half was quite lovely, but when the adultery began, I became so tired of the characters and their actions. I read his novella, A Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor and thought it was excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to understand the personalities involved","review":"Recognizing that this author is of a totally different background and culture then I am, it was difficult for me to keep immersed in this as a love story. It had many twists and angles, but as for it being the true, undying love story of which I am usually attracted to, it didn't do it for me, and I am a Senior and can understand that Seniors can still love and feel passion. So I didn't really enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"an intricate portrait of words","review":"this truly was a beautifully written masterpiece. if you are into quick reads this is not for you, it took me...a month to read this (on and off)...but it was worth it. reading this book makes you feel like you are stepping into a different world. i could smell the cafe con leche, feel the humidity, see the aged buildings and cobblestone roads. when fermina daza cries i cried, the mark of a good book, is when you're able to feel all the emotions of the characters. it was an amazing story, and i believe that the ending, the very last page, is one of the greatest endings ever written. marquez successfully tells a story of half a century, in perfect pace, and captures the very essence of love. in a word ..it's breathtaking"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, sorry classic literature....this does not belong in the modern cannon","review":"I really, really disliked this book, found it depressing and not inspiring like most modern classics that I've read.

Still found this dull and felt like I had lost hours that I couldn't get back."},{"rating":"2","title":"An timeless love story about enduring love, worth reading.","review":"A beautiful story, the author passionately evokes the scene and the characters are believable.

Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pseudo-freudian analyis","review":"All things aside, an old man having sex with his young charge is weird to our eyes. This love is not the central concern in the book, but pops up in some reviews. I got this book because I read an earlier novel by the same writer and found that his work was fantastic....if only he chose something else to write about. Granted, the earlier book was much shorter, so when I thumbed throug hwith my right hand on what I had left, I was much more forgiving. This book, however, was hard to read. While GGM is a \\"great writer\\" in terms of how he writes, I don't care about the \\"things\\" he writes about. His topics make it hard for me to care."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rich feast of a novel","review":"\\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\" is a beautiful, character-driven novel. Gabriel Garcia Marquez moves slowly in the beginning, establishing place and characters with histories for each. Clearly he loves the people he's creating. I felt that I was experiencing a slice of life in a culture and era quite different from the ones I've inhabited. In the course of the book, the characters love and betray each other, but ultimately the book offers a positive understanding of the strength of love in spite of obstacles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow in the Time of Cholera","review":"I got this book to read as it was the choice of my 'book club', I would not have chosen to buy this, based on the fact I read another one of his books,'A Hundred days of Solitude' and found it to be equally slow and boring.I found it hard to get into and didn't feel I was able to get completely absorbed in this book.Each sentence is bursting with so many adjectives that sometimes you forget what is going on in the story.I think it comes down to personal choice of writing style.Not sure that I'll bother to finish this book, it's become more of a mission than a pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was good about this book","review":"Thank you to the other one star raters for letting me retain a little faith in the human race.

I read roughly 30 pages into the book and it still just did not grab me. I have to be interested in a book usually in the first 10 pages or so, but I kept going with this one since it was our Book Club selection, so I tried to keep an open mind and plug on. I finally just stopped because I found that I was having to force myself to pick it up. The descriptiveness the author uses is just too detailed and I felt like he kept side tracking. Plus there wasn't much \\"dialog\\" in the book. The book jacket description kept talking about the two main characters but there was no mention of them that I could tell until about page 30 and then it was just one of them. Maybe I would have liked it if I perservered, but I am sorry it just seemed to be hard to get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read","review":"I am looking forward to this book when I can get to it.

At first I thought it was a wonderful love story until it went on and on and depressingly on for 250 pages...and what in the world did he, Florentino, (all I can picture is a 'nebish' who had 622 affairs?) see in Fermina, a nasty, angry woman?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I read this book years ago.

The first 50-60 pages had me very interested, and then...nothing. The book jumps all over the place back and forth in time and in between characters. The more I read about Florentino, the more I realized that he is a pervert who claims to be in love. I was also extremely disturbed with the sexual relationship he has with a 14 year old girl when he is in his 70's. I found myself becoming uninterested and bored very easily. It was difficult to finish, because reading this book became a chore. I won't be recommending this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, over-written and overly sentimental","review":"I read this book as part of my local book club it is boring and the main characters are uninspiring. It is so bad I wonder if the author genuinely thinks it is a love story because I cannot imagine any intelligent person calling this a love story. The main character is over-sexed and super-needy. Why don't we all write about the relationships of the mentally ill and call it love. That is what this book does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and painful to read","review":"This book is filled with tedious unimportant details. The \\"love story\\" is flawed, and the main character is disgusting. The story is supposed to be of the great love between Fermina Daza and and Florintino Ariza who are in love as teens. Fermina goes on to marry another man. Florintino pines away for 50 years or so until Fermina's husband dies. In the meantime, Florintino has sex with anything on two legs. Florintino causes the death of one lover. He rapes and impregnates his house maid and molests a young schoolgirl who is his goddaughter. Oh, and there is endless details about his use of enemas. I think Amazon should have paid ME to suffer through reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great writing","review":"I read this book about 15 years ago because a very bright co-worker had said she did not like it. I was curious. This book is a keeper, a book to be reread. Although a love story in time of cholera may seem an odd scenario, I was very happy that I chose to read it.

I've had to face that situation.) It is an amazing cooincidence that the new movie has just come to the large scrren, so we can see and read, although I prefer to read and then see. I love all of his writing.Bettie Magee"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sober read","review":"Marquez's book evokes the melancholy and desperate side of love as a man's love for a woman goes largely unrequited for 50 years. After reading this book, I wondered if love was worth it at all, since his obsession really is a disease, much like the cholera that ravaged the small Caribbean town in the book. Humans have enough trouble with their emotions without love being as much a burden as a blessing, as in this book. Love really is a two-edged sword; it can both enoble or destroy a life, and Marquez's book is a sobering and melancholy reflection on such a situation.The pacing of the book is slow, as the story gradually unfolds over five decades. That was the only real problem I had with the book, but I admit to not having the longest attention span when it comes to fiction, as I read mostly non-fiction. But all in all this is another brilliant book by a master storyteller that should stand the test of time despite its overall downer story and theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my Cup of Tea","review":"Unlike some reviewers in this forum, I have finished \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\".

So wordsy, and the paragraphs are sooooooo long. Story is over told and very over sold. I am trying to finish only for one reason and that is because the movie is due out this week, and I want to see it. I am sure the book is written beautifully, but it is not user friendly. I am often having to remind myself who is who, and try to get through the long long paragraphs.

It is like reading poetry, that flows so powerully and easily the reader doesn't even know he is reading. This is simply the greatest love story of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find something else to read.","review":"For some reason this book tries very hard to get its audience to be sympathetic to a man who falls in love or so he thinks with a girl he doesn't know. Trying to be faithful to the \\"Love of his life\\" he sleeps with every one in his town from widows to 14 year old girls when he is past fifty. Not the type of person I am usually sympathetic for. The main character doesn't have any redeeming qualities except poetic writing but even that is over the top. How can you write thousands of pages of love to a girl you know nothing about except for her name? This book is so unrealistic, the characters are not interesting and the plot keeps getting sided track to events that have no real importance at all. The only likable character (and I say that lightly) dies from a pathetic tragedy that seems at first to be relevant to the plot even if it is unlikely but no that too was just more wasted words. If this is what I can expect from Oprah's list I will steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Oprah had it in her book club. Big deal. It still stinks.","review":"This book requires NO thinking.

Although extremely sad, the story as a whole truly makes one think: Does love like this exist? How many people have wasted away their lives with the wrong person in order to be \\"safe\\"?Although more dialogue would have made it an easier read, the author's beautiful and flowing descriptions kept me interested.

At the time I was reading a very long, 600+ page book, and I when I finally started reading Love in the time of Cholera, I was put off by its beginning, which to me seemed to have no point. However, I kept at it, and soon I was hooked.The story occurs over a 50 year period, starting at the end and then going back to beginning to explain how things got there. In the late 1800's, in an unspecialized South American city, a boy and girl fall in love. However, their love is never consumated, and they barely speak, choosing instead to correspond with letters. Finally the girl chooses to marry a rich doctor- but the boy never gives up, waiting for the day Fermenia's husband will die. The author's style kept me going, as his writing style helped me imagine the story perfectly and beatifully. I loved this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. The method of storytelling, while unusual and somewhat poetic, is rambling and almost painful to stay with. I did manage to finish it, but only because I forced myself to read to the end, not because I enjoyed it. The author slips key parts of the story into rambling text, to the point where I had to go back and reread a sentence or even a paragraph to verify that I had read it right. (Did he just say that? Did that really just happen? In the middle of a nothing paragraph?) Things don't need to be pointed out to me, but I find this style of writing very anti-climactic. I won't spoil the end, but I will say the entire book was just depressing and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow ....slow","review":"A friend insisted that I read her copy of this book. I have honestly tried to enjoy it even half as much as apparently she did but.....slow is an understatement.

His multiple conquests of other women as a sign of devotion to his unattainable Fermina Daza was a ridiculous concept (but I guess people cope in different ways) and the ending was not how I expected. I found Florentino Ariza's character deeply disturbing and not someone that could be loved, regardless of time and distance.I managed to struggle through the book and was disappointed in its outcome and its bizarreness. I almost put it down for good (such as I did for Ayn Rand's THE FOUNTAINHEAD), but I pressed on anyway. I'm glad that I was able to finish it, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Z-z-z-z","review":"Whenever I read a bad, boring book, I always check to see if I'm the only one with that opinion.

Garcia's prose is richly seasoned. His characterization is complete and immensely human. With his style of writing, he creates for the reader a prose that is complex, ornate, baroque, and deeply satisfying.The novel's scope ranges over the youth and old age of three characters, caught in unrequited love, surviving civil wars, deforestation of landscapes--both psychological and also natural--and outbreaks of cholera. Behind this hubris, Garcia details the fine distinctions of love and love lost.This novel, finally, gets better when you finish reading it; the sensual prose seeps into the reader's memory and makes for a haunting, echoing satisfaction. Yes, the ending is fulfilling. In fact, the last 50 pages of the book are simply incredible, but of course, the readers needs to read everything prior to this--as set-up--to get the reward of the finale.This is an incredibly satisfying novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I enjoyed reading the \\"one star\\" reviews of this book far more than reading the book itself. I agree with all of their criticisms - especially the pedophilia! I was totally not engaged and couldn't wait to finish it. I only finished it because I though maybe something would happen. It didn't. And what's with the use of first and last name EVERY TIME a character was referenced? My favorite character? The parrot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you consider Hannibal Lector a romantic figure?","review":"If not, then you shouldn't consider Florentino Ariza one either. This is a startlingly good piece of literature, but, pedophilia is never justifiable--not even by Oprah! Shame on her! Ariza RAPES his ward--seduction in his mind, but it ultimately destroys her soul. So just like all the pedophiles and child murderers, he justifies his actions as love. Borrow the book from the library & read it--don't pay for a new copy wherein a pedophile is touted as a romantic hero. He is a complex character--both good and bad. But for our society to make someone with this much evil in him into a romantic hero dilutes both the original story and its value and allows pedophiles to justify their behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books of all time","review":"I am not someone who normally reads novels with romantic themes.I read this book over seventeen years ago when my literary diet was spy thrillers and business novels. This was the only book I had stuck in a house during a stormy vacation. It was my introduction to the world of fantasy realism. I was simply blown away with the beauty of Marquez's narrative. This book transported me to a place I had never been and evoked emotions I never new existed.The strength of this author's genius is that his work survives translation yet his stories affect all cultures. While there are many stories of unrequited love this story is one of the best.Many have told me that Marquez's other works are better. I disagree. Then again I am biased since this book was my initiation to his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Garcia Marquez, worthy of a second Nobel prize","review":"A love story that reaches your soul and stirs all emotions.

Yet we love them, and we love the way they love each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy Love","review":"While this book was a study of love, the sexual obsessions of the main character frequently were perverse if not all right criminal.

However, I have not read many of her selections, either.I found Love in the Time of Cholera to be quite tedious to read. I did not care for the main character, Florentino Ariza at all and felt him to be a disgusting person. However, I stuck with it and continued, very painfully, to read this book to the end. I was hoping that as a selection of Oprah's Book Club, that it might, in the end, have some redeeming qualities. There were none.

An intricate tale of two lives that intertwine for a time, go their own ways, and come together again. You almost like the characters, despite their flaws, but I never quite reached that point.García Márquez tells stories, and gives them a rich tapestry to make you feel you understand -- and he did it again. I, however, prefer to like the characters as much as I like to feel I understand them. Not my favorite of his works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Love in the Times of Cholera is an enjoyable book. I am not sure I would consider it a classic, but it is a worthwhile read for the sections that worked for me from a writing and storyline worked well, but it other spots I did find it a bit slow. As in any love story there are certain patterns/themes (Fermina and Florentino find love, lose it, questions it) so there is some familarity here but there are worthwhile gems in the path of telling the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"he carves the walls of the heart","review":"I admire GGM's patience for love both in love in the time of cholera and hundred years of solitude. he is alive when he talks of the waiting years. he thrives in the longing, he carves and carves the walls of a waiting heart and nourishes the memories. that's what makes it breathtaking. the suspense is carefully and patiently savored, its juice came ever so sweetly.excellent,too are his brilliant thoughts on ordinary ircumstances. there were things one would not thnk of verbalizing but there they were blinding you with the simple fear or discomfort of truth.there is however a part that left me rather lost, maybe out of misinterpretation. there is a portion in the book i found unresolved. I believe, in a book, all holes must be covered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointing","review":"The book had a lot of potential and got off to an interesting start. It began as a sweet but strange love story, hit a number of slow spots, and then deteriorated into pointless perversion. While there were some endearing and poignant moments, the debauchery that the story became completely ruined this book for me. After the main character loses his chance at his \\"one true love\\" he debases himself by sleeping with hundreds of random women, ultimately to become an elderly, incestuous, child rapist. Although the author allegedly uses the novel to describe the many types of love, there is not much love but instead lust, rape, seduction, adultery, molestation, depression, and delusion. I wish I had my four days of reading back. Really not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes itself too seriously and too slow to read","review":"I admit I never finished this book. After I didn't enjoy the beginning, I made myself read 50 more pages. I still didn't enjoy it, so I quit.

A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank Goodness I'm Not the Only One","review":"I found this book, like others to be unbelievably dull and unrealistic. \\"Love\\" is not the word I'd use to describe any of the relationships created.

I have no interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing to Say the Least","review":"Like many other people, I too had heard that this was a fantastic book. I was actually excited about reading it. It took me about 2 months, just because I had to force myself to pick it up every once in a while. The subject matter was boring....yes, Florentino loves Fermina, but why? Why does he obsess over her for 50-something years? Move on already! That isn't love, that is scary obsession.Just when you are about to fall asleep, you come across disturbing images, such as Florentino soiling himself in the back of a carriage, molesting a 14 year old child put in his care, having NUMEROUS flings with prostitutes, when he claims to love Fermina....the list goes on. I understand that this takes place in a different time and the author attempts to give us a glimpse into what life was like back then, but I don't want to read about a poverty-stricken society living with sewage running through the streets. You see enough of that on TV. My suggestion....don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor...read this book!","review":"A beautiful and epic novel about love.

His prose is like a painting where every square inch glows with exotic color and every juktaposition surprises you: descriptions turned inside out.

I found it to be dark, depraved, disgusting, and depressing! An examination of love in all it forms? Hardly! These characters were just plain goofy. I finally figured it out towards the end of the book, these characters were so miserable because they were lost spiritually. They were looking to other humans to provide them with true love, and that is just barking up the wrong tree.

At least she finished it; disappointed! Every time I picked it up it seemed to wander aimlesslesly from one subject to the other, without much regard to the pace. I felt I was constantly on siesta! From now on we're sticking to the classics - this felt utterly pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick!","review":"This book is just plain sick. I forced myself to read it on a dare from a friend who loved it. Then we talked about it afterwards, and I found out that he's just as sick, sick, sick, as the book. PS, stupid too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to Love It","review":"I really struggled with this one. I thought the writing was decent, but had trouble liking, identifying with or caring about any of the characters. Not something that is necessary, but when the plot moves so slow you start grasping for something to motivate you to finish. Did not leave me wanting more or thinking about it after except to wonder what all the hype is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is the defintion of love?","review":"One may have to be a fan to truly enjoy this book, or one may just hav to be old enough to remember all the things love can be. A loveless marriage that is truly based in love is hard for most to understand, and the flavor of another culture can be disarming, even deceptive at times. All in all, I have been a fan and had a relationship of my own for 46 years so the poignancy of the flash back, though a different tie period than my own, still reaches in to touch a special memory.E. Claverie, editor, \\"Forget the Cures, Find the Cause, Books I and II\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I can give it a half star...","review":"It has been almost a month now and I couldn't finish the book. No, I am not a slow reader. I only have a 100 pages to go and I am still waiting for something that would perk up my interest. In fairness, the description of the places are really vivid. That is just about it. Do not waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love conquers all . . . including pedophilia?","review":"I'm rather shocked by the fanfare for this novel. The sexual escapades were nauseating, and I vomited in my mouth a little when I read about the pedophilia, which Marquez excuses with a shrug of the shoulders and a wave of the hand. And while the idea of unrequited love can be noble, and the thought of seniors feeling giddy again is sweet, there was nothing of nobility, and little sweetness in this book. Love conquers all? Hardly. Fermina Daza was correct the majority of her life; stay away from Florentino Ariza. Don't waste your precious time and degrade your sense of morality in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Reviewers said it was \\"magical,\\" extolling the plot and the author. I found it disappointing, after an interesting beginning. Now I just want it to be over and I have 100 pages to go. Seems like 1000.I was afraid I was one of the few who didn't love this book.

It is work slogging through this thing. I am an avid reader and I have to force myself to sit and read this. What a love story (sarcasm), who cares if these two people end up together after 50 years. Don't bother with this one, unless you need to fall asleep quickly..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get why everyone loves this book. I could not get into it at all!","review":"I'm a big fan of all kinds of fiction, but especially historical fiction. I love classics too. I didn't like this book at all. It seemed almost to copy the style of classics from earlier times, only without any substance. I even noticed that it used some very obscure words from the English language that were used in \\"Great Expectations.\\" Seemed like the author was stretching to sound classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedophilia in the Time Of Cholera","review":"First, women do not find pedophilia romantic. If a young girl who was entrusted in the care of a 70 year old relative was made victim of his sexual appetite in real life, people would want to hang him, not contemplate the depth of his love. Supposedly, this book describes the varied types of love that exist. In my opinion, in the numerous relationships that the main character entered into there was no evidence of love. It all seemed like lust (in some cases it was like reading a trite sex scene from a pornagraphy magazine).Second, although the prose is well written, it can not make up for the fact that there is no plot line and the main character lacks depth. It is difficult to sympathize with a character who one finds loathsome. (I was able to sympathize more easily with Dr. Lecter from Silence of the Lambs.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is too short to waste on this book.","review":"I understand that this may be a wonderful read for many people, but I, frankly, can barely get through one page without falling asleep.

She has tried to play it many times with us and with her friends. It always looks so fun on the box. The problems with this toy are multiple. First, it comes in four pieces-which will NOT stay together long enough to play the game. It is a frustrating game because it is so hard to score anything! Now, I've had kids from 4 to 43 try this thing and it is tough!! The gopher which pops up broke shortly after arrival and it no longer pops up. (I guess we should be glad that it didn't get stuck in the up position!) To top it all off, getting the pieces back into the original packaging ain't no easy feat either! I would save my money and stick with the Silly Bowling game. It is a lot more fun and a lot more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY IT","review":"My sons 2 and 4 played with this toy for about 10 minutes after setting it up. We all hated the way it fell apart when moved,and the balls didnt always go where they were supposed to. When in storage, you need to take out the batteries for the thing to shut up, otherwise you hear it in the closet in the middle of the night. My husband said he turned the switch off, but it was faulty. The boys had more fun hitting each other with the clubs, than trying to sink the balls. My recommendation....dont buy it. Ours found a permanent placement in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"More art than information.","review":"This video is an interesting piece of visual art. It is short on detailed information and discussion. The creators made it to convey an overall impression of the life and struggles of Tesla in regard to his inventions, but it leaves you wanting much more detailed information. Not much science information either; more of an impressionist video. Also, there is no discussion of Tesla's struggles with Edison, for example. Leaves one wondering what the \\"other\\" side of the story is...if there is one and this is just not answered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"If I could give this zero stars, I would. I started out assuming that it was one of those shlocky, amateurish, poorly-formed conspiracy theory movies you can watch for free at various shlocky, amateurish, poorly-conceived conspiracy theory web sites. But then I saw the blurb about Nikola Tesla, one of my heroes. It's no secret that mainstream media don't want you to know about Tesla, so it stands to reason that a film about Tesla might be low-budget, and therefore easily confused with the shlock alluded to above. I should've stuck with my original impression. Low-budget I can handle; and I even like a good conspiracy theory. This piece of garbage, however, has absolutely no redeeming qualities.

It presents fascinating info about Tesla and is creatively edited with a variety of animation, photos, and film footage in the public domain. Perhaps the most surprising component is the original music performed by the filmmakers who call themselves, VyZ - short for improvyzed music for movies. This is another unique, educational film produced by filmmaker, John Pritchard, and packs a huge amount of scientific subject matter into an 86 minute film that should be winning awards for its artistic interpretation. Highly recommended for those tired of the documentary status quo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction Book","review":"I very much enjoyed reading this book. This version if you can get it a rough print with hand sketches from the chalkboard.It is the Biology courses given during 1970's at MIT. Book is divided into sections with total 36 lessons. Part I Cell Biology and Cell Chemistry, Part II Biochemistry, Part III, Genetics, Part IV and V developmental biology and physiology. Author is very clear in his explanations and time to time he provides practical examples.

Sure it doesn't have hordes of goblins, or dragons, but let's see... there's a demi-god, evil demons, prophecies that have to be figured out, and in general a great mix of action. This book can explain a lot more about Raistlin and Caramon's relationship... and give a new outlook to the younger Raistlin. Earwig Lockpicker is your typical kender, bringing in the comedy relief. A great buy and a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor addition to the world of Dragonlance.","review":"Brothers Majere starts off well and offers a new and never-before-seen adventure the likes of which I have never seen. However, it quickly degenerates into The Classic Dragonlance Plot, but without the epic feel Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman incorporate in their novels. The author also made two gigantic mistakes which contradict lines located in Tales of the Lance and Dragons of Autumn Twilight.

I have a gay second cousin and remember the difficulties he faced when he had to admit his situation to them. A gay acquaintance saw this film no fewer than seven times, obviously because it spoke to him.It's also painful for illegal immigrants, living in the shadows and hoping to be able to change their status.

There are little suprises in this film, and a number of funny and poignant scenes. Its main theme is unconditional love and acceptance.

In old Chinese, it is definitely not easy to be tough and persistent to do what we want to do or think is right to do.The author has shown us how she wanted her life to be and at the same time, not to against her parents too much; she was able to handle the conflicting situations well.We need to stick to our belief and believe what is right or good for us if we want to walk our way to a destination.However, it would be even more interesting if the author could write a bit more on her life and her siblings' after the death of her \\"Gu Ba Ba\\".This book is really good for leisure reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent autobiography.

She fails to see that Niang's opinion of her can never be changed because she believes too strongly in the wholesome \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" family attitude. Her memory lacks real emotional substance, she doesn't really say anything other than the plain facts during these tragic events of her childhood. At the end when Aunt BaBa died, I couldn't relate to Adeline's warm, peaceful feeling, so I don't think the ending settled any matters between her and her family. Her writing style is good, but I didn't understand how so much boring history related to her story. She skips around on the timeline, which confused me while I tried to organize each event in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written with gut-wrenching intimacy","review":"This life journey of a search for belonging and identity is written in a simple flowing style and with gut-wrenching intimacy.

She was honest with herself,pouring out her emotional hurt, her longing to belong and her darkest secrests, like the love affair with Karl. Also, a well written combination of other characters which does not make it complicating and a unique way to present the chinese proverbs! Bravo!! I thank her for giving me a wonderful pleasure of reading her work which i was able to relate to as well. It has opened my eyes to revolutions of changes that have occured in China and Honk Kong. It also proves the human capacity for selfishness and vindictiveness. Lastly, i salute her tollerance and love for others.

And her idiot brothers should have been paid back in full. But worse was Lydia's betrayal. All of them would have been dealt with immediately after I learned of their duplicity.

The author is obviously not damaged by the life she lived and she was fed, clothed, educated and saved from the \\"Party\\" occupation. So many other Chinese girls were left at orphanages, dumped along the side of the road or sold during those times that it is very hard to be sympathetic because someone had to walk a distance to school (didn't all our mother's walk 10 miles in deep snow :)) or because she got sent to boarding school or slapped a couple of times. This book actually left me more angry at the author for her self pity than with the wicked stepmother. There are so much worse things happening to girls and women today in our world."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"This was a poorly written sob story by a wealthy American doctor. She desperately desired her cruel parent's approval even with years of evidence that 1) they would never give it and 2) it would be worthless, since they themselves were worthless. They treated her and her siblings as donkeys, proffering and yanking away the carrots of affection and money. She blames all of this on the \\"evil stepmother,\\" but all complicit share the guilt. Her victim saga is sad, but she had ample examples of strength and independence to follow, which she mainly ignored. Her younger sister Susan and her Aunt Baba were the heros of the story, but the author sadly didn't follow their example. Basically, I should have been paid to read this, as it seems like a whinge to a therapist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible story, sorrow and strength all in one.","review":"I loved this book.

But, if she would have wrote alittle more about the other characters in the book it would have been a 10 star. I would have like to know more about Niang's life before meeting her husband. Niang's life as a child must have had its own secrets and abuse to be so abusive towards this family but mostly adeline. I also would have like to know more about Adeline's Aunt Baba. It seems to me that no matter how life is and in what situation we are in we always have someone that is a tressure to us and to Adeline it was her Aunt Baba. Thank you for this book. This is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what?","review":"I have a friend who was born in Algeria. Her father was murdered and her mother died of starvation, holding two babies in her arms. One of them was a girl (my friend) who eventually ended up in an orphanage in France. She never had the opportunity to go to University and become a doctor. She never had to fight a will, she never had to fight with her siblings over money... And she is the most generous person I know. MS. Adeline Yen Mah is very lucky; a lot of kids are left alone, abused, mistreated and never have the chance to become American citizens, study and have a wonderful life in California."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like this book","review":"I don't feel that it is a good book for me.

This I couldn't - I got tired of the poor me and seemed a little over done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply splendid!!","review":"I counldn't put this book down when I first started reading it. What Adeline Yen Mah went thru was simply unbelieveable but very much true in that traditional and ancient era. Despite the fact she was born in a wealthy family but what she has suffered from her stepmother treatment and discrimations has made her no different from the hardship the poor experienced. Through her intense experiences that she has written in her book, it has made me understand more of the unequal treatment and choas in that era. Her book is simply splendid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE - HEART WRENCHING - A MUST READ","review":"I have never been so touched by a true story in my 47 years of life. I was hurting the entire time I read it and could relate to much of it from my own experiences of growing up with a father who treated his sons far better than his daughters and still does. To say that I am impressed with Adeline's ability to write this book is an understatement. My only hope is that writing this was therapeutic for her and that she lives a long happy life with her husband Robert. I have recommended this book to anyone and everyone who reads and I don't know a single soul who didn't have trouble putting it down. 12 out of 12 women in my book club thought the book was superb - and we don't agree on much! Great for group discussions. Don't even get me started on her children's version \\"Chinese Cinderella\\" ...I'll let my 10 year old son review that one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, clear and complex, survival/struggle/transform","review":"Well-written, clear, concise, human inspiration of struggle to make sense of deeply negative family setting. Think about - clarity of childhood perception of the family situation v/v the emotional need to be loved and accepted. Can/could be debilitating, yet for some, ie Yen Mah, she found perseverence in herself and ability to not just survive, but to finally find a loving husband and a satisfying and challenging career. A breath of fresh air in light of the \\"blaming\\" theme prevalent in much of our society at this time. Still incredulous to me how she could still seek/anticipate any acceptance or love from Niang in the last 1/3-1/4 of the book. Human nature? How do we tick? Another observation from her story: the power of gifts that come our way-Aunt Baba-whose deep love and support were critical to Yen Mah's self-perception."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book touches the nerve of women unloved by their mother","review":"This book certainly touches raw nerves for any woman who experienced the loss or lack of a mother's love throughout childhood. The reader keeps waiting for the moment when the stepmother will relent, give in and love all of her step children. The reader is puzzled by the father's abandonment of his children. Is not emotional bonding with his own children worth more than the manipulative love of his new wife? At the conclusion of the book, I was left asking, Why? The \\"why\\" is not about the daughter's treatment, but rather, why did Adeline write the book. Healing her anger and hurts? Getting even with her stepmother? Getting even with her siblings? The book has left me haunted by these questions, and I welcome a reply from the author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dramatic, Emotional, Deep, and a Gut Wrenching Saga","review":"I just completed this novel, and it was the first book I have ever read that gave me a feeling of soulfoul emotions. By the end of the book, you feel as if you are a close freind of the author, and right there in China. Each character has its own tableu of sounds and color that echo off into a saga filled with pain, triumph, and respect. The evil Niang, is the most ruthless I have ever read of to date. I found this book to be excellant even though others have not, but it was touching and a true gripping story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"This was a great memoir. It left me feeling angry at how some people treat children or other people for that matter! I'm thankful to live in a society that recognizes the value of women. Once again it shows that human nature wants approval from parents in all circumstances. This is a heart wrenching story that had some redeeming moments but the are few & far between.The book is well written and believable. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falling Leaves- FANTASTIC read!","review":"The heartbreaking story of an unwanted, abused, neglected child who never ceases to try and earn her family's affections. If you have ever experienced these feelings,no matter what your race, you will LOVE this book. It moved me to tears and I could not put it down once I started reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter drivel.","review":"This book rates as THE worst that I have ever read and were it not for a belief in the sanctity of the written word I would take it outside and burn it. Not only is the quality of the writing extremely poor, the author gives the impression of being a bitter, immature, whinging, unbalanced and revenge seeking spoilt brat. Oh poor little unloved rich kid! How many times have we heard this theme - get over it!! This book is completely one-sided and fails to address any of the feelings of her family or the enormous advantages bestowed on the author compared to her fellow countrymen. It is with great sadness that I see this book in any way compared to the dignified, intelligent and balanced writing of Jung Chang in Wild Swans. Please do not buy this book and thus give the author any more satisfaction in her self-centered righteousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated and over-hyped","review":"I read this book before it was re-released and I think it's a travesty and a pityfest that dies out after a few chapters. The title is basically an attention-grabbing effort to pull at the heart strings of home makers who need to fill lazy afternoons. Wouldn't have given it any stars if I had the choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching Story that Strikes the Heart","review":"Falling Leaves is a touching story about the human spirit and it's longing to find acceptance, unconditional love, and belonging as the author struggles throughout her life to please her stepmother. Yen Mah shows readers that satisfaction and fullfillment do not come hand in hand with wealth. This book also tells a historical story as Yen Mah successfully intertwines her family's history with the Chinese culture and the historical events that took place as China was being transformed into a Communist country to what it is like in the present day. She is also able to inform readers about life in Hong Kong and the hardships of being an overseas Chinese."},{"rating":"1","title":"good effort but no merit.","review":"Being chinese myself growing up in China, Hongkong and the US, I can understand some of the troubles Ms Mah went through. But her story is neither particularly touching nor interesting. There are millions and millions Chinese women out there who suffered more than her and would be dying to have the opportunities she was given. The whole book is basically a reader's digest version of what happened to her over the past 50 years in her own view. There is no details to events and no analysis of other people's action. Nonetheless, it's nice to see such book because it brings out the inners feelings of millions of chinese female readers. The 2 stars is solely for its effort, not its merit"},{"rating":"1","title":"No sympathy for the author","review":"I must admit, the book kept my interest but only because I kept waiting for the author to stop playing victim and move on with her life. Unfortunately it never came. Adeline Yen Mah details how her great aunt defied her own foot binding at age 3 and went on to open a very successful bank in China and how her aunt works at that bank and never marries; both women defying cultural norms and with obvious admiration from the author. However, Ms. Yen Mah then justifies her own kowtowing to her distant father and vindictive step-mother as \\"the way it is in Chinese families\\". This is after her step-mother and father are less than filial towards her paternal grandfather. By the end of the book it is apparent Ms. Yeh Mah was only sticking around for the inheritance than never came. And then she cries foul and writes a tell-all book. It was a rather off-putting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irrestible story!","review":"I picked up this book by chance because the cover looked interesting. I really enjoy Amy Tan and hoped for a similar peek into the fascinating world view of China.I was NOT disappointed!Rich in detail, offering a fascinating \\"other side\\" perspective of some of the most momentous events of the 20th century, and psychologically GRIPPING, this book is a winner!You will find yourself identifying with Mah, and being pulled into her misery--and propelled by her fierce HOPE of final acceptance.I couldn't QUIT until I knew if I (I mean Mah!) was FINALLY going to be given my place in the universe. I finished the book in ONE SITTING!! (And no, I WON'T tell the ending--read it yourself!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"an incredable story which gets to the heart of life and love","review":"It is a well written story, I was unable to put the book down. Adeline Yen Mah writes from the heart and places her own personal stuggles in relationship to the history of China. I am amazed at how strong a child\\"s need is for parental acceptance and love. I also received an small understanding of the Chinese culture and how they view family and work. This book is well worth reading! It is one of the best I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's overexposure undercuts the emotional impact","review":"After reading this and seeing how many other books Dr. Yen Mah has written which have some variation on \\"Chinese Daughter\\" stuck in the title like a Nike Swoosh, I wonder if this is how she introduces herself to new people. \\"Hi, I'm Adeline the abused Chinese kid, how are you?\\" The obvious attempt to capitalize on tragedy at the expense of family members put a bad taste in my mouth from the start. Yes, it was a horrible childhood, but I've heard of worse, and the self-pity is only barely restrained in the prose.However, it isn't *badly* written, and provides a good layman's view of Chinese child-rearing, culture, and, in small doses, a half-decent historical context."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sour Grapes","review":"It isn't easy growing up in a dysfuntional family and the times she grew up in were turbulent at best. But she wasn't abandoned like so many female Chinese and she had enough to eat, clothes to wear and an excellent education that prepared her to make her own professional living, plus she had the invaluable support of a loving aunt. So, why write a book spewing out such vitriol? And a pretty poorly written book at that. Better to read the magnificant, vastly more informative \\"Wild Swans.\\"By the way, I bought this book a few years ago in hard cover after reading \\"Wild Swans\\" and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that this drivel made it the the best-seller list.If you want a memoir about surviving your family, read \\"The Liar's Club\\" - the author not only survived but overcame and forgave - arriving on the other side whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, contrived, empty","review":"I was SO disappointed by this book. I found it to be completely void of any context and reflection. Had I not been reading it with a book club (none of whom liked it either), I would have stopped after the first couple of chapters. I am surprised that she rarely reflected on her mother's death as a huge turning point in her life. Then in just three pages we learn that she gets married, has sex for the first time, and gives birth to her first child, and she and her son are physically abused. These very important facts are told in a flippant way with no perspective. I also don't understand why she didn't help out her Aunt Baba more. I came away not caring about her or her family. Sure her life was hard, but as a piece of literature, this book was weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"keep a box of tissues near by","review":"This is one of my favorite books.You won't be able to put it down.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"The story is so touching and i really recommend you to read it.

But I never got around to read it. This summer, out of sheer boredom, I picked it up and started.By page 2 I was hooked.Meet Adeline Yen Mah, a child whose family is anything but suportive. She's mistreated, and the way she tells her own childhood, filled with misery and humiliation is... sadenning. To believe that a child went through such uncomfortable situations is quite unsetlling for me. I endeared myself to Adeline. Her struggles were my struggles, her hardships my hardships. Her every conquest, her every smile would get a loud cheer from me. I had tears in my eyes when I discovered the tru meaning of this book: no matter how much one suffers, there will always be hope, and if we fight for ourselves, then happiness can and will most certainly be achieved.Read it! Don't let it gather dust on your bookshelf. It will soon become your favorite book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant, plaintive picture of the heart's desire to belong.","review":"Kierkegaard writes of one imprisoned by a tyrant in a brazen bull and slowly tortured over a steady fire. The cries of the victim could not be heard so as to strike terror into the victim's heart. When the cries of the one imprisoned finally do reach the tyrant's ears, they sounded like sweet music. As men crowd around they say to the prisoner, \\"Sing for us soon again.\\" This prisoner Kierkegaard calls the poet. The sweet music of Falling Leaves comes from such a tortured heart. Mah is a lyrical poet, singing of cruelty, bitterness, revenge, and finally the triumph of the heart's longing to belong. If you do not weep when you read this account of suffering, make an appointment with your mortician."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most powerful narratives of the decade. A must!!","review":"The power of Adeline Yen Mah's story is hard to contain in the pages of the \\"hard Cover\\"text.

I started it around 6pm and stayed w/it until I finished 5 hours later. Dr. Mah is a poetic writer who skillfully blends Chinese culture and history into an engaging autobiographical work. It took a lot of courage to write this. It was touching without being 'whiney'...the author was very matter-of-fact about her situation in the family. I want to congratulate her for her courage & perseverance, and literary skill! Would recommend this to anyone with the slightest interest in Chinese culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine as a personal story but...plays into stereotypes","review":"The author is a fairly good writer. Her narrative is descriptive and flows nicely. However, her books seems to pander to the Western masses who love to eat up stories about poor oppressed \\"Chinese daughters.\\" This book is another one of those \\"exotic oppressed Asian girl/woman\\" books that indulge Orientalist fantasies that westerners have towards Chinese and non-western cultures in general. I am offended at the way she implies that her story is \\"typical\\" of Chinese females. I would have given the book more stars if she had just written a book called \\"Falling Leaves: The Memoir of an Unwanted DAUGHTER\\" which would have worked well as a memoir about a child (not a \\"Chinese\\" child but a CHILD, a human being) who triumps over her emotionally abusive parents. Instead she chooses to emphasize the \\"oppressed Chinese daughter\\" angle to cater to people with Orientalist fantasies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Story of Courage and Perseverance","review":"I could not put this book down.

She suffered a great amout of pain when Niang hits her, but she suffer the most pain feeling lonly and loveless. Her Aunt Baba loves her very much , but nobody can relate to what she gone through. Her dad tries to keep them apart, saying that she is a bad influence to her. Adeline is a very strong person to have sirvived all of those years of not being loved at all.Now she is happy living with her husband and having two children of her own. Niang had disinherited her in her will and also her own daughter, Susan. That case doesn't matter now when she found her dad's will.

She was born into a rich Chinese family with a maid, a home, a place to sleep, and given home cooked meals. The entire book is about how everything in life is not fair and has a huge undertone of self-entitlement. At no point was she \\"unwanted\\"...there may have been typical Chinese family favoritism, but really, her life was not that bad. Her whiny narration and constant \\"poor me\\" attitude had me rolling my eyes and annoyed throughout the book.There is no development of any of the characters. Her chronological story telling is all over the place and very choppy. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone...there is really no takeaway from her memoir, besides, \\"shut the heck up you spoiled brat.\\" I'm sure some of her siblings have passed away and I'm sure there has to be some revenge behind her authoring this book and painting everyone around her as villians.Yes, her step mother was a witch, but quit your whining and stop trying to change people."},{"rating":"1","title":"whining","review":"I know for a fact that there are hundreds, if not thousands of children who have suffered more than Adeline Yen Mah. Niang is a saint compared to so many dysfunctional mothers and stepmothers in this world. Grappling over shares after the father's death is typical in any Hong kong millionaire family. It's inevitable. It's common and it's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinese Cinderalla","review":"The ONLY reason I bought this book is that I belong to a book club, and they decided they wanted to read Falling Leaves. I haven't finished the book (I'm on page 80 or so) and sincerely I have not found the book captivating. The characters are more like caricatures, the print is too small, and I don't like to read sad books unless they're classics. I have my own problems without reading sad books. I guess it's OK for a long trip, but the print is so small it gives me eyestrain, and the characters lack personality. Besides, this is 2009, and it talks about events from before World War II, the Cultural Revolution -- all that is old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"If you are someone who gets bored, confused, or lost easily, DO NOT READ THIS!! I had to resd this for school, wich I wasn't happy about to begin with. What didn't make it easy to understand was that it jumped around so much. In one chapter her dad is meeting her mom, then in the next is about her dads youth.

It was slow in the beginning but once I got into it I couldn't put it down. I'm reading this book as a class requirement in my 9th grade English class. I think my teacher picked a very good book, because it teaches everyone a lesson on how their life isn't really as bad as they might think it is. When you read Adeline's story it explains in great detail what her life was like and what she had to go through. It was so sad how she was treated by her parents, she never did anything to deserve the awful treatment she put up with. I think everyone should read this book because it shows how real and horrible life can be for some people."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a memoir","review":"Adeline Mah's story is unlike any other I've encountered; elegantlywritten and honest, her memoir may not be for everyone. It is most assuredly not a whiner's account: her spirit was constantly tested by her unloving and spiteful father, siblings, and particularly \\"Niang\\"(who gives new meaning to the phrase \\"wicked stepmother\\"). If you are expecting a family saga where the principals squabble over money, that's here -- but Mah's only real wish was for love and respect, and the denial of that love shapes her life. Mah givesfascinating insight into China's cultural evolution as she tells her family's story. It is subtle, modest and unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifuly Enchanting, Undescribably Moving","review":"This is a first class, book. It has no pretensions just tells the girls story as it was. I thoroughly enjoyed it and could not put it down. Its honesty and bluntness was refreshing and equally moving. The heartfelt story of a little girls struggles against insurmountable odds is both enthralling and upsetting. It shows that strange human trait that blood is thicker than water. No matter how awful they were to her, she still longed for acceptance, even as an adult with her own family, career and life. Strange but I am sure similar to alot of you. I defy you not to enjoy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwrenching story of the search for love and acceptance.","review":"Absolutely powerful and moving. Ms. Mah's story is one that will stay with me for a very, very long time. At times I became so upset I had to stop reading, and found myself picking up the book again. The abuse Ms. Mah and her siblings endured from her once loving father, and venemous step mother is beyond belief. If it were not for Aunt Baba's love and support, one can only imagine what might of happened to Adeline Yen. On a very personal note, Ms. Mah thank you for sharing your most intimate memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, a must read!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book and its remarkable main character.

As I understand it, favorite and famous Rascals shorts were cherry-picked to be beneficiaries of this color process, and were then compiled in these collector's sets.I see the benefits of this process as being primarily twofold: one, it's a new way to re-experience beloved and familiar material. Two, it's a great way to introduce the classics to the younger, color-biased generation.

Everytime I go to the bookstore i search for new novels out. Fiest brought to life the characters in his book and made them seem real. The plot dragged you inside and made it seem as if you were really involved in the happenings. You feel the pain, the agony, the excitement, and the rush. You feel like your the main character and you have the power of a magician. Fiest truly is a superior writer. I have been addicted to his works for many years and strive to feel that same feeling flowing inside me when I read and re-read his riftwar saga. I truly felt I was involved in his books for even I have caught myself speaking as if I was Pug myself on top of the stadium preparing to use the magic that I have been taught. A truly excellent most have book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unputdownable!!!!","review":"I dont think I ate for the three days that I read this book!

He's one one mean mother and he gets the girl at the end of the day(even if she is a few hundred years old!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past the 1st chapter!","review":"This book was recommended (by Amazon) as I had purchased all of Game of Thrones. On paper it looked like it was going to be excellent. I can't comment on plot, character development, etc. because, sadly, the writing was unbearable.It seemed badly researched with details of the setting conflicting with each other. The tone was of someone making a concerted effort to speak Ye Olde Englishe and really over egging the pudding. Important (presumably) characters were introduced clumsily and without much imagination.I had to stop reading before the end of the chapter. I am disappointed this book didn't work me when it has for so many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"yet another fantasy book...","review":"I approached this book with, well, great expectations. A few minutes after finishing it I said \\"Well! Wow!\\". However, as time goes by, I cannot stop thinking that actually the book is not so good. It is rather like a first attempt of the author to write fantasy. Not only is it full of stereotypes (maybe this is a book who generated these stereotypes, I don't know). The characters are so thin that after a few weeks I have forgotten all of them. They are far from having the precise contours of Tolkien's heroes. They are far from having the depth of Ursula le Guin's characters. Even in the Wheel of Time cycle one could find heroes that are better realised than these ones. The story itself? Well, not big deal. Again, the stereotype of a stranger that tries to invade, and intestine plottings to add some (watery) thrill. A lot of scenes are there only to help the book growing thick. All in all, an easy book: easy to read and easy to forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"carefull of your order","review":"I ordered two (2) copies of this book. One (1) for myself and one (1) to replace a book that got damaged while in my posession. At the time of the order there were plenty in stock to cover my order. When recieved I got ONLY one (1) which had to be used for the replacment. Not real happy if they didn't have the quantity in stock why was I allowed to order them. From now on I will go through DEEPDISCOUNT.COM who only allowes you to order what is in stock and only bills you for what they ship. Took almost 2 weeks for me to get a refund for the second copy that they apperently never had!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A leader in fantasy...","review":"This book is certainly a benchmark and one of the most important fantasy books of all time. Raymond Feist is an extremely talented writer, he develops his characters well and he certainly doesn't overdo the fantasy element. It has all the classic features of a tolkienesque tale - elves, dwarves, magic, and a dragon. Yes, in a way it is cliche and in later volumes his characters are perhaps a little over-developed in the sense that they become as gods, a kind of no-no in fantasy writing. However, if you pick up this book you will not put it down, nor will you have a bad thought about it as you read. The rest of the series is really, really good, and in this vein of fantasy Feist is quite unmatched. I hunted down a first ed. HB copy for my collection, and I have read and re-read it as well as the rest of the series. If you have any inclination towards classic fantasy, then look no further. The character development and a well woven plot will have you hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it - you won't be sorry!","review":"Feist has the ability to create a world and characters so real you could really believe them to exist. From the start he captures your sympathy for Pug, and the plot is superb. Also, the book steers away from stereotypical endings and happenings, so you're frequently suprised! Really, do read this book. It was his first and, I really think, his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feist does epic right","review":"When I first read magician 13 years ago I was blown away. Here was a story with the epicness and character depth of Lord of Rings, but as accessible as a reenn reader.Not meaning that the writing is aimed low and everything is simplistic, oh no, but Feist has this quality that just keeps you turning page after page, and before you know it it's 3am.If I have a criticism it's that the story isn't original, but what he did was take a standard fantasy plot and bend it to his sown will and style.If anyone loves fantasy and hasn't read this book (which I'd duobt, but hey it happens) than you should read this now. If you're new to fantsay and want somewhere to start, I'd recommend Magician over any other book, yes even Lord of the Rings. If Tom Bombadil showed his face in Midkemia he'd have it torn off by a Saur before he could sing his first verse."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice book that reviews a lot of topics","review":"very good for beginners, gives a good review of items that you might want to drill into in other books..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expecting","review":"I agree with Jeff P's comments.

I have digenerative disc disease in my lower back & have quite abit of back pain.

I used it 2 days & returned it.It does heat up quickly & does have a nice, long cord.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:-While it heats up quickly to the highest setting it doesn't maintain the heat!I don't know why. After only 20-30 minutes, you realize there is barely anyheat at all, like you turned it down to the low setting.-It's small & rather stiff so it's hard to place to be effective.-Auto shut-off.

But NO, this manufacturer has designed a heating pad that won't work properly with an extension cord. It comes on initially just fine, but once it goes into automatic shut-off mode, the on/off/set temp switch will not operate unless the pad is plugged directly into the wall. I'm very glad I didn't spend more on a fancier model of this heating pad. Also, the CSR at Kaz claimed that this limitation is described in the owner's manual. It isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! I love the SoftHeat brand","review":"I've purchased two SoftHeat heating pads as well as many other brands for my lower back pain. SoftHeat is the only brand that has not died on me after a few months of use. I have had the first SoftHeat heating pad that I purchased for years, and it still works really well. I only purchased a second one because the plastic started to melt after years of use and the wires were exposed. The second heating pad that I purchased from this brand started to not work on the highest setting after more than six months of use. I use it almost daily, and it still works very well otherwise!

The story follows Bruno, a thug who dreams of well..being the Great White Hope. Of course, we know he's a thug, and will always be nothing but a thug. Bruno and his thuggish friends talk in a Chicago dialect that grates on your nerves. Algren is not Mark Twain, so it further alienates the reader when you want to hear English you can recognize.

Beyond just the recipes though, the book is also a great history lesson (based on first hand research) provided by Karen Hess.The recipes are written exactly as they appeared in the 1881 edition. This is before modern ovens and measurements so the recipes are sometimes vague and incomplete based on knowledge that would be assumed to be known by anyone who cooked at the time.

In 5 years we will probably be able to test our own genes for abnormal gene expressions leading to biological markers and more targeted treatments.

GREAT and FUNNY read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for all mommies!","review":"I've been a long time fan of the Bob & Sheri show, and bought the book because I've enjoyed Sheri's column on the show's website. I was not disappointed in the book! I think it's a must read for moms, moms-to-be, or anyone thinking about being a mom and maybe having doubts. I hope she does write another one about toddlers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dysfunctional","review":"We're all a little dysfunctional and hope to not screw it up, but this book put so much emphasis on Mom's dysfunctionality that it became not relevant to us \\"normally screwed up\\" Moms. I was hoping for humor and good tips, this was not the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book is a terrible waste of time. It is not good reading at all, it said misfit countless times which is just one of its many annoyances. This is actually the first book I threw out in the trash. I have never written a review about any book, but I disliked this book so much I had to write this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as expected","review":"If you are looking for Surf Ninjas this DVD is great.

It was exactly what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surf Ninjas","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. It brought back some good memorie of my childhood. The movie got here in a timely manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably only worth buying if you liked it as a kid","review":"Well, I'll begin by saying that my review of this movie is somewhat biased, since I first saw it as a young kid, I must have been 12 or 13 when it came out.That having been said, at 22 I still really enjoy watching, and am glad to see it out on DVD now. Sure it's cheesy and all, but if you can just relax and not worry about that, it's got some great lines and situations, and will keep you laughing until the end.If you didn't enjoy the first Ninja Turtle movie, or the Naked Gun series, don't buy this DVD. If you did, then rent it some night and give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Good Ol' Fashioned Fun","review":"I can not in my right mind give this movie 5 stars, but it might as well be...This movie was not made for Oscar, but was made for families and friends to laugh together at how 80's/early 90's it is. The acting is not good, the Martial Arts aren't good, there is not a lot of things that would normally go with a movie that I would purchase, but the comedy and antics of the cast - and the general cornyness of it all - makes it worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horribly Awesome!","review":"This is a movie you hate to love, but you MUST love it. It's innocent, brainless, and completely moronic, but in the best way. Rob Schneider provides comedy relief for a movie that's ridiculous to begin with. And, I have two words for you...Tone Loc! I mean this is a motley crew of characters, and the plot is plotless, yet it's fun, and has nostalgia merit for anyone fond of late 80's early 90's. Ernie Reyes Jr. is cool as he's always been and it's good to see him working with his father, Reyes Sr. Basically, if you don't take yourself, or life too seriously, you'll find some humor in this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch For Those Biceps","review":"\\"Surf Ninjas\\" has one of the most vapid and pointless plotlines in existence in that great place Hollywood. However, it redeems itself with lengthy shots of Ernie Reyes's beautiful pecs. Two stars, one for each arm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surf Ninjas Review","review":"This was just a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies. The story is stale and uninspired. The jokes are lame as the Ready To Rumble film. Rob Schneider & Leslie Nielsen are unfunny. It has little to no danger,seriousness,spontaneity and even surfing. The acting is trash. The lessons are trash. The \\"bend knees use your arms\\" line is the laziest way to teach people how to surf ever. I give this film a 0 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"SURFIN FOR LAUGHS","review":"Made at the height of the Ninja craze in the early 90s, SURF NINJAS is a pretty flat and lifeless movie. Leslie Nielsen is wasted in what is merely a glorified cameo and the movie's youthful stars don't have the oomph to carry the movie, although an early Rob Schneider is a boost to the proceedings. Unless you're extremely fond of the ninja genre, this one's better avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Very nice pair of stylish footwear !!!!!!!!!!!!

I don't mean the type of bad that its so bad its good (Troma), I mean the filmmakers of this movie tried so hard and they wasted good money. DO NOT BUY/RENT/OR WASTE the 1 hour 1/2 on this crapfest. It has to be a student film from some community college somewhere, because the acting is the worst and its a ripoff of every good horror movie of the past 5 years. there isn't even NUDITY to make up for any of this. there is literally ONE small boob. thats it. ONE! I'd rather watch my dying grandmother take a dump than sit through CRAP SHO one more time. The filmmakers of this movie should be literally crapped on for an 1 1/2 hours. Amateurs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this Side Sho","review":"Poorly filmed, chock full of bad acting (and fat hoochies), Side Sho is a bad idea put on film. The story is a copy of \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\", which is part of the problem.

The dialogue was forced with every line delivered including the name of the person they were speaking to, such as \\"Where are we now, John?\\", \\"Good going, Dad\\" or \\"What am I doing in this movie, mommy?\\"The acting...well, it wasn't really acting and the storyline was not unique and any episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer has better effects. I really do admire low budget productions that are done really well, but this is just not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one and keep looking","review":"If what you are looking for has a thin plot, horrible writing and even worse acting, this is your movie.

Side Show brings a good story to the screen with production values far in excess of the independent studio's budget. I was pleasently surprised at how good a film could be made with limited funds.

It does not proceed in a gradual series of steps. Instead, each chapter re-establishes the foundation & context in its own way, often incompletely. This way, each of Dr. Boehm's students had a chance to document his or her thesis topic in the form of a book chapter.

When a friend told me about \\"Room To Grow\\" I was relieved; when I started to read the essays, I was ecstatic. This book was exactly what I was looking for: smart, moving pieces about the kind of parenting issues the parenting books ignore.

The setting is so well pictured you feel yourself traveling along with the heroine, Joe Flannigan, through the underbelly of the city.I love this young author. She is an explorer of genres. I read her other two books, Saturn's Return, and Come Closer, but I never expected a noir detective from her, and a female no less - think Becall not Bogart. You'll really enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than expected","review":"When I first picked up DOPE, I was a little skeptical. The plot did not sound too impressive, but I thought I would give it a try. Having just finished it, I am really glad I did decide to read it! This book has some excellent descriptions. Sara Gran creates wonderful pictures and you will not be dissapointed! Through the book you meet a handful of characters, all of whom I came to love, or loved to hate, that make you to keep turning the pages.The book is not too long, a little over 240 pages. I highly recommend it. The only reason why I took off a star in the rating is that the book starts off a little slow. Give it a chance, though, and you will be glad you picked this book up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing very new","review":"Only if you have not recently read Hammett, Chandler and co could you be satisfied with this unpersuasive rehash of the American post-war 'noir' thriller. Gran may love the sassy language of this period, and find echoes of its dark wit, but she brings nothing sufficiently new to the genre to make this exercise worthwhile. Many classic genre novels were actually quite ropy in the plot department, but Gran seems to think this an excuse to follow suit, and hers is thin to a degree that most contempory crime writers would find unacceptable. Being a contemporary novel there is more drugs and more in-your-face nastiness than in noir novels of the past; but all that kind of thing is handled with far more panache and impact by James Ellroy ('LA Confidential', 'The Black Dahlia', 'The Big Nowhere' etc.).I enjoyed Gran's last short novel, 'Come Closer', although that too suffered from a lack of story development, hence its extreme brevity. But this is a step in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad the author forgot she needed a plot to tie together all these rich characters","review":"Sara Gran's sophomore novel is billed as Chandleresque detective noir. She certainly has the setting correct--flophouses and the streets of 1950's New York. She employs a cast of addicts, pick pockets, hookers, up-and-coming actresses, and pimps in her detective story. Unfortunately, the novel completely lacks a plot or plausible mystery. It's centered around reformed heroin addict named Josephine (\\"Joe\\") who is employed by a missing girl's parents to track her through the underbelly of the city.The novel consists entirely of Joe traipsing through the city, talking tough and being in the know. Towards the end, Gran throws in a series of \\"twists\\" that serve more as monkey wrenches in a plodding story that as compelling plot devices.If you want noir, stick to the tried and true classics. Gran's novel is barely mediocre, and certainly not worthy of comparison to any of the great detective authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"film noirish","review":"Todd Haynes is turning this short novel into a film (with Julianne Moore, I believe, as the lead). It's a quick read, taking us back to an Raymond Chandler era. The story-telling is smart and intelligent. Be prepared for some twists and turns in this wonderfully-told tale of Josephine, struggling with a past of substance abuse and trying to make her way in the world without ending up back in her old shoes. I read it a few years ago, but re-read it recently, imagining it's filmic qualities."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great main character","review":"I picked this book up on a whim. I'm not even a big mystery buff, but I like that Raymond Chandler thing once in a while and from the opening line Gran's narrative voice caught me up and did not let me down. The hardboiled tone never feels fake or simply derivative, but always quite natural. More importantly, this is a book whose main character is very believable and despite a very checkered past, deeply honorable. Your heart goes out to her in a way that it never would for, say, a Sam Spade. Josephine Flannigan is a superb novelistic creation, and I do hope Gran can find a way to bring her back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peaceful","review":"A wonderful collection of soft and relaxing classical music.

I recognized and enjoyed every song on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accomplishes its goals, free is also nice!","review":"Downloaded for free through Amazon (still think it's up for grabs for el zilcho). Great selection and nothing hinders it's goal. Pachelbel's canon, Fur Elise, and Ave Maria are the heavy hitters of this album, and have a good supporting cast of other songs for a nice classical mixture. Not a lot of other well known songs in the album, but well worth the price of free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Relaxing","review":"I downloaded this on Amazon because it was free at the time.

She brings a novice to a place of comfort.I use this book in my business communication course along with Standard Deviant's video Public Speaking. Between the book and the tape, the class feels at ease about their first business presentations.The weakest area is her section on interviewing. It appears she has done very little interviewing. She's weak about how to ask questions, how to end the interview and the value of interrupting a rambling source.The many strengths include a great MLA/APA reference section (but it is missing online source citations), organization, evaluation methods and check out the summaries at the end of each chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Update: Smith & Wesson SW5000","review":"This is a nice knife.

This record would set the stage for a decade-long dominance almost unrivaled in musical history.The Eagles took a very shrewd approach to making their mark on music history. They took the country rock sounds of the Byrds and mixed it with the easiness of the folk rock craze of the era. Simply put, The Eagles took a lot of what was popular and made it even more accessible to the public. This record did exactly what the Eagles wanted, made country rock a force to reckoned with throughout the 1970's. While every song on this album is solid enough, my favorites are \\"Chug All Night\\", \\"Nightingale\\", \\"Take The Devil\\" and \\"Take It Easy\\".If you only know the singles from this terrific band, your seriously missing out on some awesome music. If you like the breezy sounds of the 1970's, you'll want to check this album out, you'll not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eagles started here.....","review":"This is where they started, back in 1972. But should you start here? Here's the rundown:1. Take It Easy - A catchy song with lead lyrics by Glenn Frey.2. Witchy Woman - Don Henley takes the lead to this haunting rock song.3. Chug All Night - A cool southern rock song.4. Most of Us Are Sad - As you guessed, this is kind of slow and sad, but it's still good.5. Nightingale - Kind of odd to me, but then again, that's me.6. Train Leaves Here This Morning - Hmmm, just okay in my opinion.7. Take the Devil - A cool rock track.8. Early Bird - A weird tune. Not my taste, but whatever.9. Peaceful Easy Feeling - Another easygoing song by Glenn Frey.10. Tryin' - Underrated track. \\"You can make it if you try.....\\"A must-buy for Eagles fans, but I wouldn't start where the Eagles started; you might get the wrong idea about their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that good folks.","review":"I barely gave this cd 4 stars. It does have some good songs, however most every song except those those on the greatest hits cd display a rather immature use of songwriting. There are high points, but unless you really like country music (not country rock or southern rock, much different) I doubt you will like it. Whatever you do, do not buy this cd as your first eagles cd. Get instead the very mature and awesome One Of These Night (probably thier best) or Hotel California (extremely close, maybe the best, I don't know)Check out those cd's now if you havent already."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest debut albums in pop/rock history","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable (if not the most) EAGLES studio albums they ever made. There's no filler on this baby! I promise! \\"Take it easy\\" and \\"Witchy Woman\\" are definitely top notched songs, but everything on this release is in my opinion a 10/10 rating. I used to do a lot of drinking listening to \\"Chug all night\\". Just a killer drinking song! \\"Take the Devil\\" is also one of my all time favorite EAGLES songs. When people talk about the great debut albums I don't usually hear many talk about this one, but in my eyes it's definitely one of the greatest. Just buy this great album. Get ready for a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for teaching sound identification and memory skills","review":"The purpose of this game is to match Mommy animals with their babies - who just happen to be hiding under haystacks. Set up is quick and the game is easy to play. Children learn to identify the hidden animals by the sounds that they make, and to remember where a hidden animal is amongst the other hidden babies. It is easy to stop the animal sounds or the farmer's singing when you've had enough of either.There are instructions for a beginner and an advanced version of the game. My daughter mastered the beginner version after playing just a few times. Since she's only three, the advanced version is just a little bit difficult for her. The game can be played to conclusion rapidly. I'm pretty sure that this will be a game that we'll be playing for at least another 2 to 3 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good album, but not as good as Hastings 1066","review":"I agree with most of what the reviewer befor me said. This album is also less prog-inspired, and tehre fewer intro/interludes that help give that medival feel.Favourites of mine: The Chosen, The Trial, Rise of a King, Siege Of Paris.I recommend buying this album.

This one takes us from Biblical days to the not too distant past, to the 1960s. It takes a realistic look at Biblical times, not an overly religious look. It makes you want to visit Israel.It was interesting to read that the young Israelis of the early 1960s found it so foreign to them that the prior generation succumbed to the Nazis without putting up more of a fight. Today's Israelis have to fight for their existence, and they do it well.Then again, today's Israelis have a country of their own. They are not a despised and mauled minority surrounded by vicious, satanic enemies, as their ancestors were in the mid 20th century.

An exchange was made, however, the second time proved just as disappointing. My son loved it at first, as did I. But it took less than 2 weeks for a 4-month-old to break another air tube. I only give this item 1 star because my son loved to kick and make the animals hop into view (when it was working).

Yet with this book Terry Brooks has demonstrated the depth and scope of fantasy and has reminded me me once again why I originally gave myself into the pleasurable quicksand world of fantasy literature.The plot is very meaningful. It would be extremely difficult to find anybody who has not at some point or other wished to just escape into a magic kingdom of his own and live a life of idyll and glory without any of our modern problems and stress. Brooks plays on this yearning to show the sometimes hilarious, sometimes scary consequences of such a wish. At the end though, what with the happy ending, such a yearning in the reader would just be strengthened, leaving a bittersweet aftertaste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than the normal High Fantasy","review":"Ben Holiday, a long-time lawyer, who recently lost his wife Annie, finds an odd advertisement in the Wishbook Catalogue. The ad stated that a magical land, Landover, is for sale for one million dollars. He decided that this would be perfect because it would allow him to forget his sorrow. Thus begins his adventure and his ascension to the throne of Landover. In Landover, he must overcome demons, dragons, witches, as well as human obsticles. This was a fairly enjoyable book. It lacked the usual complexity of other fantasy novels, but had a very interesting twist to the story line. The author writes with a sense of humor. He also adds love into the mix. I would recommend this book for a short quick novel to pass some free time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Admittedly Sappy...","review":"But still a very entertaining read, as seems to be the standard of any Terry Brooks novel.Continuing his tradition of taking the blandest of plots and making it one of the most interesting books you'll ever read, he uses the idea of a 20th-century lawyer escaping into a world of run-of-the-mill, fairy tale fantasy, and keeps the reader turning the pages the whole way through. In my case, after reading his Shannara novels, I didn't expect any amazing emotional insights to be granted to me in the course of the reading, or the deepest of characters or the most ingenious conflicts or a world in which I could see myself making a decent living. There are plenty of books and series that I could (and have) read if I were looking for something of that caliber. Brooks writes solely to entertain, and he succeeded with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and what fantasy is all about.","review":"I read Brooks' Sword of Shannara and it was a great book, but not very original. This book, on the otherhand, is one of the most original and unique books I have ever read. I have to admit that it starts out a little slow, but once you get into it you'll find that it is hard to put down. Brooks' magical kingdom of Landover made my imagination run wild, there truly is nothing like it. All of the characters are very well developed and have likable qualities which make you root for them. I found myself truly caring for the characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy, especially someone who is looking for a not-so-dark and highly original book filled with immense amounts of imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry Brooks's other works were good, but this is great!","review":"I can not believe how much I did enjoy this book. Going so far as to wish that I was also there. What a wonderful place to play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Wonderful escapism that I never wanted to end! The fun begins from the very beginning and peaks at its conclusion. This was my first Terry Brooks read, and it definitely won't be my last..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have read 22 books by Terry Brooks.","review":"I have read 22 books by Terry Brooks. I'm new to the Landover Series. I found the first 1/2 of the book a very slow introduction to this series, but in all fairness, the book picked up after halfway (A little patience from me was well worth it). Book #2, The Black Unicorn, was much better, and I'd give it a 4 out of 5 stars. I'm now reading #3 (Wizard at Large). I have been wanting to read this series because of the soon to be released, \\"A Princess of Landover\\" (Scheduled release on Aug. 18, 2009).Even if this series isn't the same quality as the \\"Shannara\\" series (prequels and sequels), I'd rather read Terry Brooks than many other authors out there. I look forward to anything he writes (I even have some books on audio as well as paper/hardback). Terry, keep up the good work! You bring us all many hours of enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this series","review":"The first book of the Brook's Landover series was a nice departure from the seriousness of the Shannara line. Don't misread this last statement; I am Brook's #1 fan. But I feel that he did a really cool thing when he created another series and brought more of a fairytale, playful kind of fantasy vibe into the writing. You still have a lot of the magic and characthers such as trolls, but he delves more into a light Arturian type realm, with plenty of excitement and suspense. I think that that this series would be a great place to start for a young reader curious about fantasy. I could truly see the Landover novels being brought to the big screen and becoming a huge success. Think Harry Potter meets Lord of the Rings. I hear Terry was working on book #6 for this series. I can hardly wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring for the most part.","review":"I found this book very boring. Especially in the beggining. It gets a little better towards the end. Most of the book just seemed to drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters are similar to TV show \\"2 1/2 Men\\"","review":"I think fans of the show \\"2 1/2 men\\" will like this book - but it is not a comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brooklyn Bridge for Sale-- SOLD!","review":"\\"Magic Kingdom for Sale\\" has a funny premise. Ben Holiday,a lawyer,finds himself winning ownership of a magic country. Real life is melded with fantasy. The fantastical idea works as an idea--not so much in practice. Terry Brooks makes a potentially fun story incredibly dull. There's every fantasy cliche one can imagine-a quest against an evil demon,a beautiful lass,talking animals. Landover is the Generic Fantasyland.CS Lewis knew how to meld the mundane with the fantasy in Narnia,interweaving the Pevensies' days in WWII England with his allegorical kingdom. On the other hand, Brooks can't. It's a dull,boring book. It's a journey over the rainbow not worth taking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic Kingdom for Sale - Sold!","review":"This book was very boring! It does not even come close to comparing with his others."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book","review":"I wanted to like this book. It has an interesting premise, it is by a great writer, and I am really into fantasy and sci fi. I kept expecting the book to get better but it never did. The humor needs much improvement, the story line is very predictable, and the ending was just as dull as the whole. Just about the only thing I liked about this book was the price--free.I was very surprised that I did not like the book. It got good reviews and it is a subject that I enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passes the time, but unimpressive","review":"I really want to like this story, but there's a lot to be desired within the pages of Magic Kingdom. The main character is really the only character - we get more insight into the personality of a dragon than from our hero's love interest, for example.There is very little of note in Landover - even though Ben, our main character, signed up for the stereotypical fantasy land, there needs to be something creative or new about it to make it worthwhile for the rest of us to read. It's cute - and nothing more.That actually sums up most of Magic Kingdom - cute, but little beneath the surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, lots of typos in Kindle","review":"I've owned this series for a long time. And love it. When travelling recently, I finished all the Amazon Kindle books on my iPod, so I \\"bought\\" (it's free) this one. And enjoyed it. But it was clearly scanned and not edited well after. Many upside-down exclamation points. Sentence sets like \\"...more than I. I don't think...\\" became \\"... than 1.1 don't think...\\". \\"I'll\\" also became 1.1. Even the country name (Lan-Dover most of the time) was screwed up a bit.It was still readable easily, but this seemed sloppy. So five stars for the book, less one for the typos."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Terry Brooks book I have read","review":"Really a charming tale here. Terry wrote a likeable book with entertaining characters. Its lighthearted and fun. You can spend some time wandering in this kingdom and forget the world and just enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book - Awful Kindle Version","review":"This is one of my favorite fantasy series. Unfortunately, the Kindle digital version is really badly converted. A good amount of the punctuation is completely wrong, and many of the words are garbled. You can still make out what's going on, but the number of typos is really embarrassing. You get what you pay for, since it's a free digital download, but still, I'm not going to buy any other of the books in this series digitally.It's a great series, and I'd highly recommend buying the books, but avoid the Kindle version unless they fix it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You never know what's going to happen next","review":"At frist a angry unhappy lawer in the real world who always feels sorry for himself,next thing you know he's king of a magical land.This novel is the best book I've ever read, it makes you think their must something more out there than the world we know of.READ THIS BOOK"},{"rating":"2","title":"This story is...","review":"Some may think that the story starts off slow, although I think it is just the right speed for the setting. It's perspective takes a different path for fantasy, and, without giving any spoilers, takes some time to make the transition, but it is intriguing enough to keep you wondering how it will unfold, and it delivers that well. So well, that it seems Warner Bros. is making a movie about it, which I think is long overdue for a book published in 1986. I have read other works by Mr. Brooks, and only recently listened to this book on Audible.com. Now, I am curious to see how it continues and am currently on the third book in the series. Give it a try, it's a worthy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I expected!","review":"I'm not usually into Terry Brook's books. I read one of the Shannara books, and it seemed like a shortened version of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" - in order to find this magic object we have to walk through a dangerous forest, make our way under a mountain where we'll face supernatural enemies and so on. This book isn't like that at all. The main character is a quite normal person who's frustrated with his life and sees an ad for a Magic Kingdom for sale. He assumes that it's a joke, it has to be, but he still can't stop thinking about it. And, eventually, he finds himself the new King of Landover. In trying to deal with this new world of his, he has great help of a clumsy wizard and a talking dog... The book is funny and takes some unexpected turns, and I really enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I had heard Terry Brooks was an excellent writer. I did not find that to be the case with this book. The story itself was somewhat interesting; the writing, however, was sorely lacking. Brooks used the same predictable vocabulary throughout. He seems to have a particular fondness for the word \\"trailer,\\" which made me want to spork my eyes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put me to sleep","review":"I got a bit over halfway through this and I tried, I really, really tried but wow this is boring! Nothing happens at all in the first 200 pages aside from him buying the kingdom. I thought there would be much more fantasy in this book and fun fantasy creatures but you only really hear about them more in passing then anything else. I was also looking forward to the funny parts of this book but I must have missed them because I did not find any part even enough to crack a smile for. I actually had to do something else while reading to keep myself from dozing off so I figured it was time to quit this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I have read in a long time!","review":"Although the title is a bit goofy, the story is incredible! I love love love it! I highly recommend this book, the guy who reads the book is incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Surprise","review":"I enjoyed Magic Kingdom for Sale-Sold. It perked my interest with a different story line. I have already purchased the Black Unicorn. Terry Brooks is a great author and I enjoy the way he comes up with great characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm......","review":"This looked like my type of book. I mean really it did. But it wasn't. It was one of the most boring books I've ever read. The only character I actually liked was the dragon. I don't think I've ever read a more predicting book. It's a shame too, because this is the first Terry Brooks book I have read. I'm hesitating to read anymore of his books. Although my friends keep telling me to read the Shannara series, so I might give them a try. If you're looking for a fantasy book and this catches your eye, just look over it. Believe me, it's not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"In The Beginning","review":"What can you say about the icon Pamela Anderson.This was her in the beginning,just before Home Improvement and Baywatch.I saw one vignette on a file sharing site once,and had to get the whole DVD so I could watch on a bigger screen than my computer monitor.I wasn't dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thankfully short, ridiculous novel.","review":"Reading sleeping with \\"Jane Austen\\" left a bad taste in my mouth. The narrative was awful, I loathed the main character and found him repulsive and wonder if there really is such a creature so pathetic. Aitken also peppered this 200 page excuse for a novel with highly erudite words that hardly anybody uses, let alone a depraved serial killer with an ear fetish. It's not the worst(That's Kathy Acker's \\"pirate\\" book), but it comes pretty close."},{"rating":"2","title":"the dubliners: At Their Best Again","review":"It has been 40 years for the band's existance so far and have put out so many great songs. this is a must cd. their live music is just as good as any studio recordings and i would say equally enjoyable. if you want to listen to good ol irish folk songs and australian one too, then you will want to buy this cd. get in a nice chair, drink a pint of guinness,listen to this cd, and you got a great atmosphere in your own place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elton at his worst","review":"Gridlock is a poor cover for Ben Elton to expound his politically-correct views on the world again.

They meet a diner-runner named Hugo, and Brother Phillip, who runs a street mission. Together, they rescue Joel, and surprisingly, a bunch of other little kids who were also kidnapped.

It's reassured me through countless colds and scrapes on the part of my two kids. The developmental sections are helpful, and the parenting parts are no more than suggestions of various alternatives you might not have thought of. If you're very dogmatic about child-raising this book will annoy you, as the author will invariably discuss some child-rearing technique you don't like and think no one should ever use, but I personally had no problem ignoring the parts I wasn't interested in and benefiting from the rest, and I'm glad she wrote a comprehensive enough book to let me do that rather than making arbitrary decisions like \\"I hate pacifiers so I'm not going to say anything about them.\\" My only complaint was the illustrations are extremely ugly. Maybe a child drew them, but they certainly don't add anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm returning it","review":"At first, I was mixed about the book. Dr.Nathanson is great on nutrition and breastfeeding, but I really didn't like her parenting philosophy. Her suggestion that holding a child less during the day is a solution to a child's desiring holding at night seemed cold. That was when I started thinking about returning the book.Then, I got to the section about 9-12 month olds, and her suggestion that now would be the time for me to buy a \\"leash\\" for my child, so that he would get used to it. That was pretty much my limit. I didn't adopt a dog, I gave birth to a child, and I would no sooner leash him than I would feed him kibble.But, at least she's an advocate of breastfeeding."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd skip this one","review":"The instructions were complex, but not too cumbersome. Getting through the game took about 10 minutes and was not terribly interesting or fun. A big problem we had was that it had to really be dark to see the difference between the night and day markings. Then we couldn't see the dice. In all fairness we played it through only once, and after reading the other reviews we'll try again. But, I really don't think we're missing anything crucial. Maybe it's a matter of preference, but we're pretty easily amused, and this one just didn't do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"for younger kids","review":"We bought this game and found it to be fun, but I feel that the age category is wrong.

The blue ones seem pointless.

However, not everything that glitters is gold.The easiest way to describe Highsmith's final novel \\"Small g: A Summer Idyll\\" is to say it's a 150 page story trapped in a 300 page book. Having said that, I must admit that this novel is not without virtues: actually, the story is quite strong, the characters are an endearing assortment of straights and gays tangled up in a pseudo-mystery, the scenario is not uninteresting (it could make a first rate film - Rupert Everett would be great as Ricky) - which is why I pushed myself to finish. Unfortunately for readers, the physical writing is so stodgy that many may give up the struggle long before the mystery is solved. But DON'T give up. This book is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make No Mistake","review":"If you expect this to be a mystery/suspense novel in the line of Highsmith's other work, you may be disappointed. This is a slice of life in gay Zurich in the 80's, albeit a slice with perhaps more crime and death than most.

The work isn't short on logically questionable bias. Most of his critical arguments take the form of exaggerating an opposing view to the point of absurdity. This would serve as a great political trick, but has no place in philosophy. Nash is also a bastion of arrogance in almost every chapter. I was particularly taken aback when he called Aristotle's god \\"religiously unsatisfying\\".He also argues that in the face of overwhelming evidence, atheists have no argumentative standing. He of course fails to present the \\"overwhelming evidence\\". In my opinion, his worldview is so old and out of date, the evidence probably consists of him actually attending the crucifixion of Jesus"},{"rating":"2","title":"theology for normal people","review":"There are 6 chapters, with subchapters under each,on the following subjects.

Well written and much needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it advertises","review":"Some interesting insights, but overall, ending poverty was less the focus of the author as touting deregulation and laissez-faire Capitalism.

I follow poverty reduction closely and it's amazing what Jeffrey Sachs has done for the issues.

This book should be required reading for anyone with a pulse."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's new?","review":"Although I appreciate Dr. Sachs effort, his book lacked a new approach to ending poverty. It is a comprehensive, eye opening book for people without in depth knowledge of poverty and development, but for many scholars this book must have been a \\"yes we already know\\"-experience. The book is more a moral \\"we should\\"-appeal rather than a practical guide for people interested in ending poverty, because it does not offer new solutions. We have long known what we should do, on a micro level as well as in large scale programming, but how to actually make it work is a different thing. How do we get governments to meet the .7 GDP promise? How do we lower trade barriers, open markets, build infrastructure, gender equality etc. I will start \\"The White Man's Burden\\" today.

But if you are at the place in your life where you are receptive to the idea that there is more to our life than ourselves; that if you are lucky enough to be born in the 1st world, you owe something to those who by the simple bad luck of geography were born in the 3rd world, then this is the book for you.

I have a very strong negative opinion about the plan because of the pain it induced during its execution and its result. I was just curious how Jeffrey will sell his \\"work\\" in Poland and therefore I managed to waste my time only to the chapter devoted to my country. Lots of hand-waving about the glorious path of Jeffrey!Well, as far as I know, Russian citizens (excluding maybe the richest 15%) feel the same about the \\"shock therapy\\" . I was just laughing about his description of himself as a savior of nation.

He really has amazing ideas, if you can put that stuff in the back of your mind. He focuses a TON on the successes he's had, and tends to gloss over the countries and economies he made mistakes with.

Then again...I think Jeff knows exactly what the people he works for at the UN want to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated","review":"I increasingly become frustrated with prescribed economic theories for ending poverty. Poverty will not completely end through economic principles alone. The devaluing of human life based on skin color, social class etc. must be fundamentally understood and revamped simultaneously with any economic plan. With the best intentions economists develop master plans to change situations; however, NO economic plan with erase WORLD POVERTY!!! The problem is inherently so much deeper than economics. While Sachs offers some interesting and practical methods of erasing poverty, this is only a start of scratching the surface of the many economic disparities crippling global communties. The problems must also be explored on a social level and issues related to the devaluing of human life based on creed, color, religion etc., must be explored in depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is the \\"left\\" of econimists? I am going to be sick.","review":"Jeffery Sachs is no social justice activist. If your looking for real ways to end poverty, and dismantle the systems that create poverty, look somewhere else. What Jeffery does offer is a salve for the conscious of the worlds wealthiest.You see the problem with poverty is not that people have been ruthlessly exploited for years under colonialism and later capitalism. The real problem is that people don't have access to the market. In fact that exploitation, such as sweatshops and slave labor, are really the key to moving up the economic ladder! At least people are making something, we are told.

The End of Poverty details how Sachs actually learned how to study economic development, and his story is very different from those of most academic economics professors. His greatest success in the book is showing just how many bodies of knowledge are required to put all the peices of the development puzzle together. It is not just an economic or medical or political or strategic issue - it is all of those, and much much more.While his argument for why the west can't afford not to help the third world is less convincing than his argument for how the west could help if it really wanted to (a subtle difference that he does not pursue rigorously enough; however, it is a very thought provoking book and one that everyone interested in international aid and development should read (highlighter in hand!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Kee's great work","review":"Listening to songs on John P.Kee cd \\" We walk by faith\\" makes you want to go to church.

The plot is supposedly a murder mystery, but with the double homicide, the guy is more interested in a books store, the towns anniversary, and his cat being able to make a turkey call than the bodies pileing up. (Spoiler) Even the murderer is caugt by coincidence! (End of Spoiler) The main focus is on life in the small town, which felt nothing like any I've come across, or lived in, in real life. A annoying book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun rests on her laurels","review":"I was disappointed in this book. Jim usually helps in solving the mystery. This time the killer just walked up to him and told him all about the killings. Just to have KoKo howl is not enough involvement to really include this book in the Cat Who mystery series. It was nice to read about the Brrr celebration and his one-may show, but she, Braun, really didn't develop a mystery at all. I find most of her books lately just are not as developed and interesting as her earlier ones and I have all she has written in my collection. Just gentle books about a town 400 miles north of somewhere. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat Who Ate the Plot","review":"This was my first -- and last -- Cat Who book. I bought it because I needed something to read at the beach, but found it so inane that I went for another swim instead. Having spent money on the book, I felt obligated to eventually finish it. I kept wondering when I would discover the plot, but alas, the book ended without one. I had hoped to read a mystery story, but the only mystery -- the body found on Qwilleran's property -- was never developed. Another reviewer called this book a pastiche -- a quite appropriate word.Want to write a book like this? Here's how... Take a small town newspaper, cut out stories at random, then stick them together. Throw in a rather silly single male journalist who spends his days wandering in and out of other people's lives, writing corny sayings and then attributing them to his cat (I thought Koko was supposed to be smart!), eating in restaurants, and traveling between his various properties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another lame effort","review":"This book is similar to other recent entries in the series-- disappointing. I agree with the other reviewers- the plot is lame, the \\"mystery\\" nearly non-existent. Once again, the main characters don't do anything to solve the mystery.How many clues does Koko find? None!This book is not worth adding to my collection. If you want to read it, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It looks like Ms. Braun has decided to kick back and cash in the the cachet of the early \\"Cat Who\\" books.

In fact, I was so disappointed in this one that I pulled out a couple of older ones to see if my tastes had simply changed! No, the book just doesn't measure up. As another viewer commented - too cutesy, too predictable, too little mystery. I will look for subsequent titles at the library rather than purchase them in hardback. I hope this is just an oddball flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is that original warmth and flair?","review":"I agree with several other reviewers, wondering if this isn't a ghostwriter at work. Many portions have been lifted from other \\"cat who\\" books and the style is definitely different. If I had not read all of Mrs. Braun's other books in the series, I would probably not have looked for more after this one. While revisiting \\"Qwill,\\" the cats, their apple-barn home, and neighboring towns is still fun, I would never have fallen in love with all that from reading this book. I recommend it only to those of us craving the additional \\"cat who\\" experience, but not for its original warmth and flair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Easy","review":"This can be a pleasant read for real fans of the \\"Cat Who...\\" series, but there isn't any mystery about it. The writer neverdevelopes any tension in the story, and the villains just appearand drop out without any real development, and this book isjust an easy story to read about the same ol' characters as inthe past, and nothing much really happens.It is like reading one of the more simple cartoons; not much to it,but it's familiar, so you can give it a glance, then move on tosomething more substantial.For the true fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a Turkey!","review":"Don't waste your money! What a sad dissappointment this book was. The entire time I was reading it (and I even skipped some parts), I thought that it was more like a primative draft for a story. I just can't believe that Lilian Jackson Braun wrote this book. It does not reflect her style in any manner. Polly even makes comments that she would never make. I won't be purchasing any more \\"Cat who...\\" books. It's such a shame as Mr. Q, KoKo and YumYum were the best.

A waste of trees.This woman has a gig that is bulletproof; churning out endless tales with the same cast of cartoon characters. Not a single thing in this book rang true, and its convenient ending, telegraphed a mile away, was so lame that I couldn't believe it when it actually happened. My grandson and I listened to this on a trip, and as he thought he could see the ending I said, \\"No, it can't end that way-that's how they do it, like a magician, they make you look this way while the action is going on over there.\\" But no magician wrote this book; the incredible piled up on the stupid until it mercifully came to its abrupt conclusion.An utter waste of time, energy, resources and everything else. So stupid and boring as to make me think, \\"Heck, if this sells, maybe I can write that novel after all!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Ms. Braun use a ghost writer?","review":"The Cat Who Talked Turkey was a big disappointment to me.

This time her style wasn't as prevalent."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is clearly GHOSTWRITTEN!","review":"Having compared this to all of Ms. Braun's previous titles in the series, I can say with utter confidence that this book was ghostwritten. Even \\"going downhill,\\" she could never have descended to this level of poor writing. The structure, plot, and even word use are horrible. The diction is NOT consistent with any of the previous novels. Dialogue is shoddy and also inconsistent.If you are a Cat Who fan, avoid disappointment, and don't buy this book. Don't even make the mistake of reading it if it's lent to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat Who Talked Turkey","review":"I agree with the others. Don't waste your money on this book. If you want to read it, get it from your library--there isn't a long wait (tells you something about the book, doesn't it).

However, I became \\"hooked\\" on this series after reading a couple that my mother had. So, last year I read sequentially the series of \\"Cat Who\\" books, and read this installment last fall. I was disappointed in this volume. It seemed obvious that someone had taken her notes and wrote this book for her. Perhaps something happened and she was unable to complete it herself. The writing did not have the \\"sparkle\\" and \\"life\\" of the previous works. In the previous volumes, the imagery was delightful -- making one able to \\"see\\" the antics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Braun","review":"This is a terrible book. I've enjoyed \\"Cat Who\\" books for years, and this book does not read like a Lillian Jackson Braun book. It sounds like it was written by someone who does not have an intimate relationship with the characters. It's generic, generic, generic. Where are the details of the crime? How is Quill involved? It's like reading a Cliffs notes version of the book. Lillian, please don't go down this road - I'd rather have The Cat Who series end than have generic volumes turned out one after another...without the local color and intrigue of the other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ko Ko and Yum Yum have taken the back seats....","review":"With the new book, the cats have been relegated to the back seats. There doesn't seem to be much in Ko Ko's sleuthing behavior towards the crimes committed, and the crimes themselves don't seem to weave into anything much.I'm finding that the with past few books the author seem more inclined to write about the townspeople and events than the cats. Not that it's not amusing; it is. But the point really seems more centered on Qwilleran the do-gooder than Ko Ko or even the crimes. Also, the turkeys in the title don't seem to be tied to anything... how did they get introduced when they were annihilated before, and how do they tie in with the crime?I've read all of Ms. Braun's books. I think the earlier ones gave the characters more depth than this one. With this, one is left asking the motivation of the senseless crimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"This book was simply dreadful. No plot, no mystery. Lots of long descriptions of Quill and Polly dining here, dining there, interspersed with tall tales about...well, who cares? The Cat Who books used to be my favorite. Read the first few in the series and you'll find a wonderful, cat-centric mystery series. But somewhere along the way Moose County became more involving to the author than the mystery. There is NO mystery. Someone is shot. Oh, and in the last five pages, we are told who did it, but not quite why. No clues, no investigation, nothing! Just a lot of silly ramblings. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does the turkey have to do with this mystery?","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I had started getting these books on CD from the library amd thoroughly enjoyed the first few I listened to. I enjoy the author's picturesque, almost poetic, descriptions of things. Those descriptions were still there, but they did not connect well. The mystery of the person murdered becomes an incidental by-line, not really crucial to the other goings-on in the story. There is no expanation to why the return of the turkeys is of any significance and what do the cats' being able to communicate with them have to do with anything in the story line. I felt very let down at the end of this audio book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Cats-giving!","review":"Am I going to be sick? I think I ate(read) too much!

After recently rereading most of the series, I checked this out of the library & was severely disappointed. The writing style isn't consistent, characters don't act \\"in character\\", even the standard re-describing past events doesn't fit any of the other books. Even Koko could've written a better book! The only reason I gave this a \\"1\\" is because \\"0\\" wasn't an option.If you must satisfy your curiousity, check it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"where was the plot?","review":"I know these books have been declining in quality for several years. I don't even read them anymore for anything other than amusing characters and something to do for an afternoon. But this one was amazingly formulaic.There was no plot. Not even a remotely interesting one. The ghost writer (since the original author is blatantly no longer writing these) brought in characters from several books ago and introduced boring subplots in places no one cares about. Not only that, but the obvious marketing of the other two recent short books (The Private Life of the Cat Who & Short and Tall Tales) was absoutely ridiculous. To completely reprint a section from each of those books and claim it's part of the story is not 'creative'. It just shows that the author is a talentless hack in it for the money.Don't bother reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Story","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before bothering to read this tripe. I have always loved reading The Cat Who series, some books more than others, but this one was awful. No plot, no mystery, no fun.

They seem to have been written because the author feels she *must* churn out another book, not necessarily because she wants to. This book moved from anecdote to anecdote with little plot to tie it together and the mystery really wasn't much of one. When we did find out \\"whodunnit\\", we were still left wondering \\"whydunnit\\" -- at least, I was. It's kind of sad to see what's become of a series that used to be a lot of fun and a guaranteed good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"the cat who talked turkey","review":"Very disappointing. I have read all of the Cat Who series, and found the last two very disapointing. The characters are very thin, and the relationship to a mystery non existant. I am a reader who does not like excessive detail, but The Cat Who Talked Turkey is definately lacking. Perhaps after 26 Cat Who books Lillian is running out of material. It might be time for Mrs. Braun to retire Mr. Q and kill off Polly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to retire this series.....","review":"Lillian Jackson Braun has given her readers a lot of pleasure in the \\"Cat Who...\\" series, but it is obvious that she is now writing by rote and no effort at mystery is evident in this latest ho-hum book in the series. This book demonstrates that a very popular formula can pall on even the author eventually. I think she has exhausted the possibilities here - although the residents of Pickax are charming as ever, this is just a compiliation of characteristics with no exposition to anyone who has not read the series previously. It's time to call it a day and for Ms. Braun to rest on her well-deserved laurels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Later Entry in the Series - About What I Expected","review":"Summer is starting, and the people of Moose County are planning to back in the excitement. First, there's the groundbreaking for the new Pickax bookstore, which Polly will be managing. Plus the town of Brrr is holding its bicentennial celebration, and Jim Qwilleran has agreed to write and perform a one man show about the winter storm that devastated the community almost 100 years ago.Oh yeah, and a dead body is found on Qwill's property.You'll notice the emphasis I gave on the happenings in the area versus the murder. I'm just following the emphasis on the book. Very little time is spent on the mystery and Koko's strange behavior. And the mystery resolves itself without any real detective work.Having said that, if you like the characters you will still enjoy visiting with them. And the book is short enough that you won't waste much time reading it.However, I can only recommend this for die hard fans who need their Moose County fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much left unsaid","review":"The 2 stars are for the charming goings-on in Moose County and the neighboring communities. I love following Qwill around, seeing what he sees, meeting the same characters he meets. But the tone of this book is slightly disturbing. The book begins and ends with the same murder -- a body found on some beach property Qwill owns. We never hear what happened. In fact, I'm not even sure Qwill knows for sure what happened. He doesn't seem that interested, so I wonder why I am. Likewise, he doesn't seem that interested in Polly anymore. There are two instances where something rather noteworthy happens in his life, followed by a call from Polly during which he never mentions these events. What's going on with that relationship? And the Big Storm performance left me rather flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Civilization? Not!","review":"This was the worst purchase I have ever made at Amazon. The book is apparently out of print and consequently, was quickly printed for my order on the cheapest paper imaginable. The book was riddled with typos and there were no illustrations or maps-this in a book about Renaissance Art in Italy!I gave the book away without even finishing it. A terrible disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"for scholars","review":"for a dedicated Renaissance scholar (of which I am not) this book is enchanting and informative and has been much enjoyed by my friend (who is a scholar)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon should be ashamed of selling this","review":"CIVILIZATION OF RENAISSANCE IN ITALYAMAZON SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF SELLING THIS BOOK....IT APPEARS AS THOUGH IT WAS PRINTED ON DEMAND.

It is not worthy of being on your list. I am a former college history major and this book was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intellectual Tour de Force","review":"First, what this book is not. If you are new to studying the Renaissance this book is not for you. The author Jacob Burckhardt, presumes his reader has a strong command of European history. There are countless other good books that lay out Renaissance history in a more structured manner.Having said this, if you know your European history you will find \\"The Cvilization of the Renaissance in Italy\\" to be a true delight. The depth of Burckhardt's learning is remarkable. Known as the father of the study of cultural history, Burckhardt beautifully weaves together the many different strands of Italian popular and elite culture to produce a landmark study of Renaissance culture. Although written in 1860, \\"The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy\\" is still read today by serious students of the period. The book is beautifully written and it is a sheer joy to see such brilliance in action. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - Multi-volume set (some editions)","review":"First, let me say, I hate the idea of rating this book before I have read it -- it just came today -- but I was so disappointed that I received volume 2 when I was not expecting it, I wanted to warn others. Look at the product descriptions and most of them do not tell you anything about multiple volumes - and perhaps some of them have both volumes in one, who could tell? Just be careful. I had to go back and order volume 1 of the same edition (Harpers Illustrated Edition). Happily, I got it for a good price and, from what I have seen so far, and read in other reviews, this will turn out to be a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Note to the editor","review":"This is a reference book for those that need a concise edition on Renaissance. However for the reader less learned, this issue is lacking an editor's information, for example, a brief comment on the author; wich language his work was first published; others english translations after 1878 Middlemore, and so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"this edition is a disaster","review":"This edition of a fine classic of history is a complete disaster -- pages repeated, pages missing, pages in the wrong order, mistranslations -- I don't understand how it could have been published in such a form.I returned my copy to Amazon, as the product is deficient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible reproduction","review":"I never write reviews. But when an \\"editor\\" leaves footnote numbers in the text while cutting out the footnotes, you know there is a major problem... I'm fairly sure that this book is produced through some sort of illegal process. It was printed to order, and the massive amount of typos make it look like it was cut and pasted from another text online, and then they pushed \\"match destination formatting.\\" A nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant book, awful edition","review":"Burckhardt's brilliance is undeniable. His erudition is obvious and his synthesis of numerous themes and what would now be deemed separate academic disciplines is magnificent. The edition, however, was awful. Individual pages had literally dozens of typos and an entire half a chapter was printed twice. While I would gladly recommend the work, I strongly suggest finding another edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will be seeking a refund -- typos on every page","review":"This review is of the edition of The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy published by BiblioBazaar. This edition should be recalled by the publisher: there are typo's on every page, making it nearly unreadable. I attempted to continue reading the book (which is of course a classic) but was too annoyed with trying to figure out what certain jumbled characters meant.I think BiblioBazaar must has scanned the text of an old edition of the book whose copyright had expired, but then never bothered to proofread the finished product. Very bad business. Save your money and get an edition by a reputable publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful explosion of God's love!","review":"As always J.P.

Very easy to understand and will help you get an A in your class."},{"rating":"2","title":"What does that verb mean?","review":"This unit is the perfect substitute for a spanish/english dictionary. Upon using it a few times, it picked up words quickly and easily. Probably on of the coolest things about it was that while reading, I could type in a fully conjugated verb and it would take me back to the root meaning of that verb. Especially useful if you don't know what the root verb might be. Great unit.

I spent two weeks with non-English speaking people, and this was my lifeline to effective communication. Regardless of level of your proficiency, this is essential to learning and provides immediate access to expression of ideas in a form everyone can understand. I still have not exhausted the information in terms of phraseology and idiomatic expressions. I think this will always be my ready reference when I don't know the right word and need it quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this one, you won't regret it","review":"I am a language student in Costa Rica. This is helpful in class and on the street.. no more bulkly dictionary to carry. It conjugates well, gives you options for poor spelling attempts and unlike most translaters out there, it will take you to the root word. This is very helpful when you are just beginning and don't even understand what a root word (or infinitivo) is. Buy it in the states though becuase they are $100 down here in CentroAmerica. Difficulties are the small screen but that is also what keeps it small and easy to carry... all in all, a pretty good tradeoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where'd the slang go????","review":"I just purchased my third one of these. The first was stolen, and the second one broke inexplicably and wasn't covered under their warranty. The great thing about this dictionary is that it had, i repeat HAD, such a wide variety of words. Now, since it is no longer Larousse but Merriam-Webster, it has absolutely NO slang. None!!! In other words, it doesn't have crap!! I'm not even talking swear words (which the old one had plenty of), but it doesn't even have silly words like fart or barf. This may sound ridiculous, but these are words are part of the average persons vocabulary.I thought about returning mine, but there's really nothing better out there that I know of. And I'm studying Spanish lit, so it's kind of a necessity. It's fast and has a lot more words than your average Spanish-English dictionary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob","review":"Came in good time.

It's worth spending the money twice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design for travel","review":"I took this on one trip and I tried to pack it safely but the screen on the unit still somehow got broken. The cover is pretty flimsy so my theory is that the entire cover pressed into the screen causing it to break. For a travel piece of equipment to have the most vulnerable part of the unit so weakly protected is really bad design. I didn't own it long enough to evaluate it's usage. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAIT! Don't buy this one!","review":"After 5 days of minimal use, this pad stopped working. Kaz replaced it. After 3 days of use, the pad stopped working again. Kaz replaced it again. After 7 days of use, the pad stopped working a third time, but this time Kaz VOIDED the warranty! Then, they said I should get an electric blanket if I wanted to keep warm. I wonder if they really think an electric blanket and a heating pad are interchangeable for soothing a headache or backache!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy kaz!","review":"I bought this kaz heating pad from a local store. It worked for 2 weeks, then died. I figured I got a defective one, so the store exchanged it for another one. The second one gave out after one month. This product is a piece of garbage!! I would never buy another product from this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"not hot enough isnt necessarily a bad thing","review":"i have this pad and for the most part, i like it. one problem with it is that its a little too thick for me. But thats only because i have a broken back and have had rods attached to my spine and they are slightly curved forward instead of being arched. So , i need my back to be cradled and this does the opposite. But i do have an older one which does not have the safety shut off switch and gets WAY too hot. Ive been seriously burned by it and appreciate this pads feature. Also the massager is just a vibrater but it helps to get the blood flowing, which is what its designed to do. Its not going to give you a deep tissue massage. I think the settings are good. One is low and one is high. if it were any stronger your whole body would be vibrating. i paid $35.00 plus tax which is the only other thing i didnt like about it. it should be cheaper. $25.00 including s and h is a decsent price. And its warranted for two years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money JUNK!!!","review":"I purchased this heating pad hoping it would be long lasting.. After about a month it is all but junk. It will not vibrate and the heat is to low to feel anymore. Plus with the way it was made the heat after a while shrinks the pad up into a ball of plastic that just makes it worse. Do not buy this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hate it","review":"Way too thick to lay on, awkward position for my back.

If there is a better heat / massage pad, i haven't seen it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have listened to other review","review":"Maybe my expectations were too high. This heating pad does not get hot enough; not nearly as hot as others I've used. The massage feature is not effective and is simply two speeds of vibration I bought this one because I was attracted to the thickness of the pad. I've had problems with other heating pads bunching and folding up too much. If this one only got hotter it would be nice; I don't really care about the massage feature.

I though people were over exaggerating about it not getting hot enough. Truth is my other heating pad's low setting gets warmer than this one does on high.

There's trivial, but then there's ridiculous. If you're over 30, playing this game is laughable.

My biggest complaint, however is that there is only half as many cards as the previous edition.

The questions were poorly worded (it took 3-4 readings just to understand them) and they were extemely obscure. We could only answer 10% of them. What fun is that? We went back to the Genus 5 cards (too easy) & the original cards.

I wish I could return the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult-stick to genus 5","review":"I'm all for raising the bar, but they just over-shot it with this one. My boyfriend and I are both great at Trivial Pursuit, and sometimes it only takes 45 minutes to complete a game, but this game took us 2 and a half hours. And I forfeited. I know what trivial means, but the questions are beyond trivial. It's just too hard to be fun. Educationally speaking-the questions are so hard that when you find out the right answer it's so obscure that you can't remember it.

Five played--ages 30 to 57, college educated and well traveled folks. There are many things I could say about this game, but fun, durable, fast paced are definitely not the descriptive words I would use. The questions are poorly written, difficult to understand and well beyond the definition of trivia. The board is flimsy, hardly even lays flat. We have to order the card dispenser which was \\"temporarily out of stock due to high demand\\". Why bother! This game will not be played again in our house. The earlier versions are fun.

Oh the me Senate majority leaderA: Tom Daschle... this game stinks.This was repeated often. Some questions are trivia of various difficulty. All are basically extended current events related.

It felt like whoever authored this game was stretching to find tidbits of trivia from the past 20 years to finish this game. We only finished the game because we had good food and drink to help tolerate such a difficult game. I'm donating mine to the Goodwill and going back to the editions we've had for years.

The questions were also really hard and not very interesting.My advice, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Millenium edition is much better","review":"I was very excited by this version from the commercial, and was very disappointed when I got it home. I really like Trivial Pursuit and I love the Millenium edition, and I thought this would be great for anyone who grew up in the 80s, but first of all, this has to be the cheapest board ever made by trivial pursuit. I enjoyed all the real life photos on the millenium edition and I thought this version would have some too. Also, the categories are obscure and the questions aren't very interesting or entertaining. If you were only going to buy one version of trivial pursuit, get the millenium edition for sure, I wouldn't even recommend this one as a second or third best. I hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Questions good, physical quality bad","review":"The questions in this version of Trivial Pursuit are a lot of fun, and not always as easy as one might think.

For the price that I paid I expected a lot higher quality than a flimsy board with no pictures and dull coloring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questions are too out there!","review":"We bought this game hoping that for once there would be a Trivial Pursuit game that was not too difficult, since we were born in the 70's. This game still proved to be full of questions that we had no idea what they were asking most of the time let alone what the answers were! We are both university graduates and we both felt pretty stupid!!! Maybe the 80's edition would be better for us???! If you were in touch with many of the world events of this time frame you might do better with this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Trivia but Factoid Debris","review":"The old Trivial Pursuit, as well as the Baby Boomer Edition, was tremendous fun. Most of the time, when one got an answer wrong, the correct answer at least gave one the feeling: \\"I should have known that.\\" Not so with this game. Anyone who consistently gets correct answers in the 20th Anniversary Ediction either has entirely too much time on his hands, or spends that time reading, watching, or listening to inconsequential garbage. I got the game for Christmas, have played four games with various people, and only enjoyed it when the game was finally over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trivial Pursuit is a good game, but not this version...","review":"The questions in this game are fine. They did seem a little more difficult than some other versions, but my complaints are almost solely on the design. The board is flimsy. It feels something like one of those games you might cut out of the back of a cereal box, and there are maybe half as many cards as in the standard versions. What you are paying for is the fancy-schmancy plastic card dispenser that doesn't work! You're supposed to just slide a card out and start reading, but you usually end up holding two or three. What was so difficult about taking the cards out of a box? The game is a classic. You don't need to redesign it every time, just make more cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you are under 40!!","review":"I recently recieved this gift for Christmas and played it with family. The kids (under 14) had trouble with a lot of the questions even though they they are cultured. The adults ( 30's to 50's) also had trouble even though they too are well cultured. Overall the adults had more fun because obviously they were around when these facts were collected and every time at least one person knew the correct answer. The kids also surprised us when they answered questions that you could only learn by watching TV or reading some magazine. Occasionally they would know the correct president who did something or correct rock star. But overall I would not buy this game for a crowd under 40."},{"rating":"1","title":"Updated questions? maybe from a 5 year old","review":"I bought the game hoping that there would be the same type of great questions as the original. I am very disappointed with the lame questions. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"20th Anniversary Edition","review":"Most of the questions in this game are ridiculous. The old trivial pursuit used to actually be about knowledge, but this anniversary edition asks questions you could not actually know the answer to, you just have to guess. For instance, 'which Charmed star likes spam sandwiches?' It's one thing to not know a piece of information but it's entirely another to be asked about information that isn't knowable. Most of our fun was had talking about how ridiculous the questions were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questions too recent","review":"We played this game and the questions were all from the past couple of years (with maybe 3 from further back).

I think if you're a trivia buff then this might be the game for you, but otherwise the questions are way too...well, trivial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"First, the game board is flimsy. Now the game play: it sucks. This version of Trivial Pursuit is billed for the younger crowd, all questions being from the past 20 years.

Be prepared to play for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"The questions were impossible! We tried playing with people aged 21-35, which is the target audience, and it was terrible. One tip for a new rule to make this game even slightly fun: set a timer and let people hop on the internet and see if they can find the answer.On the other hand, we also bought Cranium this year, and I highly recommend that game over \\"impossible pursuit\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful game, a wet blanket on game night","review":"Six of us get together to play games once every two weeks and were looking forward to playing this new edition. The TV ads made it look fun and more accessible than previous versions, we had not found trivial pursuit to be fun before. The questions were extremely difficult and we found ourselves making a \\"who cares\\" face a lot. Yes there are two decks of cards (those should be labeled impossible and ridiculous), we even tried to mix them to find some fun ones, but things did not get better, we eventually gave up. Our board was damaged when we opened it. The card shoe is a nice feature, but not enough to make it worth the money. All in all a real wet blanket on what we hoped was going to be a fun night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"We recently bought this game to play at a family gathering. We have kids in their 20's who were always discouraged playing the Genus edition because many of the questions were before they were even born so we thought this might be more age appropriate. Boy were we wrong! The questions were so trivial that there was no one at the table who had even heard of many of question's subject matters. In reference to one reviewer, no we did not expect easy questions but we did expect that with people in age ranges 20's to 50's that someone would have heard of the subjects. The questions were so convoluted and wordy with unnecessary garbage that by the time the last part of the question was read you had forgotten the first part of the question. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding!!","review":"This is pure trash. Just trying to understand what someof the questions are asking for is worth a pie. Do thepeople writing the questions have an education pastthe 6th grade level? This game (if you can call it that)should be called \\"Trivial Minutia.\\" Please spend yourmoney on something you know you'll enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves alot to be desired","review":"I was thrilled to find out that Trivial Pursuit, one of my all-time favorite games, had a new 20th anniversary edition! I wanted this game so bad for Christmas! Our local store ran out of them and I didn't get one...I was heartbroken. But, alas, in late January there it was, sitting on the store shelf beconning to me...I did not have the money at the time, so I quickly put it on layaway. Before I had the chance to get it out of layaway, a friend of mine brought her game over (SHE got one for Christmas) - I was HORRIFIED. The game was stuffy and boring, and the questions were of little or no interest. I am a relatively intelligent person, and I found the questions to be next to impossible to answer. After 5 minutes, it was packed back up in the box and we have yet to get it out again. Needless to say, I am quite glad that I got a glimpse before I spent [$$] on this game. SAVE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like the commercials","review":"I think the game is frustratingly hard. Other versions are much easier and more enjoyable. The commericials make you think the questions are about sheep and Kato Kalin, not rocket science. I'll probalby sell mine ...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the reviews!","review":"Don't do what I did folks. I read the lousy reviews, decided I needed to find out for myself, bought the game that night, and guess what I found out? That I just wasted money! This is NOT your fun, yet challenging trip down memory lane for 20 to 30 year olds like I thought it would be. The questions were impossible to get answers to, took the fun right out of it. The commercial that advertises the game is very misleading; instead of showing pictures of Michael Jordan and Clara Peller, they should be showing the Wall Street Journal and Newsweek Magazine. In fact, this game is ideal for those of you 30somethings that did NOT spend any time watching TV or listening to music when you were growing up. Instead, you were glued to CNN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"This game was so difficult. We played with 8 adults, all college educated ( with Masters Degrees ) ranging in ages from 25 to 38. We all found the questions to be poorly worded and difficult to read. Most were also impossible to answer. All 8 of us agreed we had no desire to torture ourselves again with this game. Warning: This is no Genus Edition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely tough","review":"We bought this thinking we had a chance to get some right. We were so WRONG. This game is hard, if not impossible sometimes. We are 25 and struggle with Brown (virtually impossible to get any right unless you get lucky) and Yellow. It is very expensive at ..., the card holder is very nice, it can be used for blackjack also, but the board is not very durable. You'd think for [the money] they would have a more durable board. I reccommend it, but be prepared for games longer than Monopoly!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"What a disappointment. I purchased the game for the holidays. We got ready to play and were very disappointed. The game board is flimsy and cheap. The questions were seemingly from the last four years and dull. I will probably give it to the goodwill as no one has any interest in playing this verison!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Game","review":"This game is extremely hard. I purchased it for my husband for Christmas. We played with 10 college graduates in the 40-45 agegroup. I think we correctly answered 1 out of every 20 questions. We finally just gave up with the \\"winners\\" having only 3 wedges. The questions are poorly written and so ridiculous that nobody would know the answer. This was a severely disappointing purchase. I wish I could return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bueno","review":"The game is not fun and is to hard for the average mind to come up with the answer. It gets to a point where everybody tries to help one another just to finish the game. Long and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"My husband and I got this game for Christmas 03 and have already used all of the cards. We have weekly game nights with friends ans everyone loves this game because all of the questions have happened since 1982. The only thing is that they need more cards from this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Hard and Frustrating","review":"I bought this game to play with my boyfriend and his parents. After 2 and a half hours we gave up, citing the fact that none of us knew any of the answers to these extreemly obscure questions. The entertainment questions were ok. But we were stuck on the written word for about an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I'd read the reviews before I bought it!","review":"Ugh! If I had read the reviews, I never would have bought this game. Even in the \\"good reviews\\" you still hear people saying \\"the board was cheap\\" or \\"the dispenser didn't work right\\" and then the bad reviews were correct- what is wrond with teh people who wrote these questions? Where they translating from Latin or something? I couldn't understand what they were looking for many times, and we'd have to re-read questions over and over, which made for a very boring game! It's nothing like previous versions, and I can't undesrtand where they justify charging the amount they do for this game. I nejoy the Genus version so much more Look at all the reviews before you buy, you'll see many people had the same complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as fun as other Trivial Pursuit Versions","review":"Trivial Pursuit has been a tradition in my family since I was so small the only contribution I could attempt was rolling for my team. I have played the old Genus edition, the Baby Boomer's edition, the new Genus edition, the kid's edition, the millenium edition, and I had the misfortune of receiving the 20th anniversary edition for Christmas this year. What a waste of money/time. Everything in the negative reviews below is 100% true. I am at the tail-end of Gen-X, have an IQ over 140, stay fairly current on events of the past 20 years, but most of the questions were so obscure they gave me a headache. The ones we could answer were totally obvious. The new Genus edition and the millennium edition are ten times more fun than this horrible game. Playing a game should make you happy, not upset you! I would highly recommend avoiding this version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane and Obscure Pursuit!","review":"If you know what three genus and species crosses were used to develop lettuce in 1998, you'll be able to answer the questions in Trivial Pursuit 20th Anniversary. Gathering with family and friends for a game of Trivial Pursuit is always a blast- except with this edition!Packaged in the usual square durable colorful box, the box invites you to play what promises to be a fun game of question and answer. Except the questions are incredibly obscure and nearly impossible to answer. The usual game components are there: sturdy plastic trays to hold the durable cards, the triangle chips, and circular holders for moving around the board.The question categories are split into \\" World View, Sound and Screen, News, Pages, Tech and Game On\\". I don't know how they came up with the questions for this game but it is not an easy one! If you like tough games, try Trivial Pursuit 20th Anniversary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the negative reviews and avoid this edition.","review":"See all of the negative reviews? Notice that they're all saying the same things? Avoid this edition!I'm just going to be repeating what everyone else has said. The questions are obscure, poorly worded, and uninteresting. It's as though the people who make Trivial Pursuit just slapped together another edition to cash in on the brand for the holidays.Save your money and buy another edition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This version has harder and less interesting questions then the classic version","review":"One would think that a trivial pursuit game with more recent questions would make the original easier. It doesn't. I think we actually answered LESS questions in it. Typically when I was the reader of the traditional game, the other questions would spark my interest and I would find myself looking at the answers while the guesser was thinking. In this game, I could care less about most of the questions. They just aren't interesting. And the board is relatively cheap, popping up at the creases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely trivial trivia","review":"My family has always enjoyed playing Trivial Pursuit on holidays but when we recently played TP 20th Anniversary during a family gathering, we were very disappointed. We thought that this version might be a little easier for some of the younger family members that wanted to play along with the adults. Like many of the others that have reviewed this game, we too found most of the trivia so obscure that it nearly made the game unenjoyable. In addition, many of the questions seemed to be worded so poorly that we could barely understand them, much less answer them. I recommend sticking with one of the previous versions of this game. They were much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst reading of a book-on-tape I've ever listened to","review":"This is not a review of the book; rather, it is a review the performance given by whoever read this book on tape. It is, quite simply, the worst reading of a book on tape I've ever heard! The reader's southern accent makes her attempted Irish accent sound like something more suited to a Saturday Night Live skit in which the joke is how bad the Irish accent is. It's almost impossible to listen to after awhile. In fact, I can no longer hear the name Billy without hearing the ridiculous parody of an Irish accent that this reader employs endlessly. So who makes these decisions? Would it be that hard to find someone with an actual Irish accent for a novel with the theme of Irish ethnicity at its core? Would it be that hard NOT to choose someone with a thick southern accent? Hello?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interestingly different view, with historical perspective.","review":"After all the hype and techno-babble about the Year 2000, I found this title very refreshing. It not only put the change of century into perspective from a religious and spiritual viewpoint, it opened my eyes to some of the nonsense being talked about in media I don't normally listen to.I thought it was a very good, brief, overview of the reality -- minus all the silliness. (Perfect length to read on a plane flight, by the way.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Students!","review":"This handheld Franklin MWD 400 electronic dictionary is an excellent buy because it is efficient and accurate, as well as small and easy to carry around, and relatively inexpensive. It has a spellchecker that is comparable with higer priced, more elaborate electronic dictionaries; it offers several feasible options. It offers viable definitions for thousands of the most commonly used words. The purpose of the dictionary is just that: to be a dictionary - it is NOT just a spellchecker [which often is not helpful in other models] nor is it cluttered with a scheduler or other distracting major features: It focuses on words, their spelling, and definitions.

I am now requiring it for my college English students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elementry","review":"I have never written a product review but I felt very compelled to do so after buying and using this product that had received such high marks. This product does not even contain the most basic words that a middle school student would come across in their daliy work and I a very certain that this would be of no use to a college student. I read the review of this product that the university english professor had posted highly endorsing this product. This will be of absolutely no use to any college unless they are looking up words like \\"house, car, people, ect.\\" This machine will not give definitions for many of the basic words that it can spell such as \\"compell.\\" There are some good spell checks but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeeeeah, no.","review":"The product image seems just a LITTLE different from the name if the item...

I use my computer to watch all my TV shows on DVD and have never had this problem with other DVD's before. I just got season 2 of Downton Abbey, and there is no issue with the DVD at all.

The story lines are fairly complicated and they don't introduce the characters well. That having been said, I'm sure I'm not the first to be interested in both the help and the bosses and how they have such nearly entirely different lives in the same house. Of course, it's harder for Americans to understand, but as our own wealthy class gets richer and the rest of us have an ever decreasing percentage of the wealth, it's not as hard as it may have been 20 or even 10 years ago.Of course, great acting.

I'm not much for watching TV because so much of what seems popular is junk, but this program is fabulous. I love the story lines, the characters, the acting, the costumes, and the opportunity to step back to this time in history. I also enjoy seeing how the very rich lived during those times. So I am now caught up on season 1 and working on season 2. My biggest problem is keeping myself from watching it all day! My record is 4 episodes in one sitting. This is top-notch TV in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"I watched the first few episodes of Season One as this show was very highly rated and reviewed on Amazon. I was disappointed. The story is disappointing, basically a mountain made out of a molehill. Yes, the acting, direction, and production values are good. The production is a bit over the top (arguably) with attention to every minute piece of detail. However, it is the story which just doesn't grab me enough to make me want to watch any more. The show tries to lure viewers with fascinating trivia of early 20th century life in England, and I do not understand why viewers (the reviewers who rated this as 5 stars) are so caught up with it. Finally, I did not see a warning posted by anyone - this is a chick flick equivalent of a TV show. One of the rare occasions where ratings on Amazon are not justified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Addictive Series!","review":"I love period dramas and I love Jane Austen, so this series is right up my alley. Not so high brow as it appears and soap opera twists make for a thoroughly entertaining show. I was discouraged to see that almost all the negative reviews are based on a scene where two men kiss (fully clothed and for what, all of two seconds ??!!!?) -- important to an interesting plot line and character development. Grow up people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Fabulous","review":"I would highly recommend this series to anyone. This unedited version expands upon what we saw on PBS this January but the expansion only adds more to the characters and makes the show even more likeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful miniseries","review":"Comment: This is a wonderful miniseries. Classy, cultural and just darn right entertaining. This is how historical dramas should be made. It is done in the spirit of \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\". It will probably only appeal to \\"older more cultured adults\\", but never the less, a job well done by the BBC. I can't wait for Upstairs Downstairs to become available on Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latest from BBC","review":"The Downton Abbey first season was simply wonderful. Wanted more at the end and I hope a continuation is in the works. If you loved Upstairs/Downstairs or the Duchess of Duke Street, you'll love this one too. Superb acting as always from the BBC. There's even duologue that makes sense. How wonderful that there's still good theater around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey","review":"This item is fantastic.

There is a flaw in the DVD itself that makes it drag however and no way to return it after the package is open. Thinking it was my DVD player, I spent the extra money to and purchased a lens cleaner. Nothing worked. You can actually see the little spot on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc Quality Very Bad!","review":"I ordered the import, region free, UK edition blu ray dvd. Very disappointed. The Interior scenes are very grainy. I have the UK edition Season 2, (PBS release) and it is very sharp and clear. I wanted to get the rumored 'unedited' versions for the extended scenes, but I don't think they really exist. I did not find any extra minutes in the versions.If I can, I am going to return this set because the viewing quality is so poor compared to my season two discs.I love the series, the show is impeccable and very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !","review":"What a fabulous presentation. Excellent cast...excellent script...beautiful setting...perfect attention to details in scenery, sets and costuming. Very informative story line. You get to learn alot about English estates and their inhabitants...how they were run...how the relationships between the gentry and the help worked...and you are not given a \\"perfect family\\" to swallow. Quite a few undercurrents in this excellent presentation. I can't wait until \\"Season 2\\" is available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton 1","review":"I didn't think PBS would make these kinds of shows but it is cool they did. Very enjoyable to watch.

The accessibility was great and the HD was well received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soap Opera","review":"Each of the characters has been given a unique twist to make them interesting; even if you don't like one or more of them you can't help feeling as if the characters have been fully developed and you know each of them. Violet rocks because she knows she is out of touch with current times and opinions and she just doesn't care, she knows what she likes & expects and everybody else can just deal with it and then you just want to slap Cora for listening to her maid and being so obviously manipulated (at times, but not always) but isn't that a testament to how well the characters have been interpreted by the actors portraying them? You do get 'emotionally' involved with the storyline because you do have a desired outcome... because you care that makes for grand entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Loved the show and can't wait to see the rest of the seasons!

BBC carries a wonderful array of period dramas. Each in its own class.Kudos to PBS for carrying this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific show!!!!!","review":"This is the best period piece I've seen. I just love the clothes and hair styles.

Beware that there is homosexual content if you find it offensive. It was sad to see the worst brought out in several characters, especially the hateful relationship of two sisters. Not as ruined as Northanger Abbey with it's nude scene (which would completely embarrass the author of the work), but still disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed wife","review":"My wife wanted to watch a girly movie that was clean and watched this movie.

What a sick, perverse generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the homosexual content","review":"As a frequent viewer of Masterpiece Theatre's films and series I was quiet surprised when they choose to include homosexual content in the very first episode of this series. I have always held their shows in high regard for their high moral and ethical standards, but have been proven wrong with this production. I presumed that their programs were family safe, but will now have my guard up when considering to view any of their productions. I am very dissapointed with Downtown Abbey and hope that Masterpiece Theatre will do a better job making their films appropriate for children and families. Don't let appearences fool you, the depravity of the world is now being glamorized by Masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a family movie","review":"This was really well done from an artistic stand point, that is, right up until a footman kisses a duke in his room in a very seductive scene.

Will Daisy somehow tell William she doesn't want to marry him, and how will he respond? Will Lady Mary's scandalous secret be revealed, and if so, what will happen to the family's social standing?

The video was apparently transferred incorrectly from PAL 1080i 25 fps to ATSC 1080i 30 fps. It stutters noticeably every few seconds to the point of being very distracting no matter which Blu-ray player, TV, or video processor I used to deinterlace/play it. I recommend buying the Region B version and playing it on a region-free player and TV that can handle PAL 1080i 25 fps formats without conversion to 30 fps. Unfortunately, Whatever post-production company PBS contracted with did a terrible job of converting this to region A formats, which is a shame because it is such a great series. The only reason this gets two stars is that the series is so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted","review":"This series is extremely well written and acted.

These elements are so valuable to a skeptic like me who struggles to \\"suspend disbelief\\" long or deeply enough to enjoy most fiction.My only criticism would be the somewhat improbable (and at times a touch predictable) turns of the plot, which occasionally strains my credulity. The strengths and sheer beauty of the story and the production more than make up for this small shortcoming, however.I was content to ignore the Downton phenomenon, until I just decided to check it out one night.

Alas, the three disks of my newly received DVD titillatingly stopped MIDWAY! How disappointed I was, for nowhere in the advertisement did it say that the three disks told only half the story.

The point I would like to make is that we felt that we had been subjected to seeing sexual imagery that we would rather have not seen and it was upsetting for us all. The film seemed to be well-made and intriguing but it is a shame that the producers felt they needed to include such topics to attract attention to their movie. Badly done...badly done indeed.

This movie is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell buyers to beware getting Blu-ray if they have the wrong sort of player!","review":"I was dismayed when I gave this DVD of Downton Abbey, a show I love, as a present to a friend to find she couldn't play it. Then I noticed I had two types of DVDs in my give-away stack. I had stupidly ordered Blu-ray because I thought Blu-ray meant the same thing as HD--that it provided inhanced picture quality--not that it required a certain type of DVD player. I freely admit to low scores in technology savvy, but I'll bet I'm not the only one who is (was, for me now, the hard way) ignorant of the term, As an oft-returning customer of Amazon I would suggest a warning on all Blu-ray DVDs; your customers will thank you for it!Sincerely, Duane Hampton"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show to step back in history with.","review":"This show takes a step back in time to portray how the high and mighty houses were actually run during the early era's. It shows the elegance of the upper class as well as the lower class lives and struggles. There was a few minor \\"shock factor\\" scenes which I don't think were required, and did cause some lower rankings for the show, but did not sit on these shock factors and quickly moved past them. The second season was even better in my oppinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good character development.","review":"A good episode, but once again plodding. It is said \\"One cannot please all the people all of the time,\\" and this episode will no doubt prove the maxim. Indeed, the machinations of the writers were vexatious at points, but in all things they seek to please just as the honourable servants of Downton. One has awarded this episode four-fifths of the possible points, but as my dear professor said \\"per aspera ad astra!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"I love Downton Abbey...

From what I recall, there is a lot more included in the first season in the UK version. I'm glad I was able to see it all! In addition to the series itself, there are extra features included that are well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite, but yet","review":"I feel there is something missing. It is an outstanding program which well deserves all the praise and acclaim it has. Yet, I feel it lacks depth and content. For all the visual perfection achieved with excruciatingly correct attention to detail in interiors, dress and so on, I am left wanting more dialogue, plot abd character definition and development.I cannot help but think of 'Upstairs, Downstairs' and how much time and effort was devoted to character and plot development with each episode. There was a lot less left to conclusions drawn by what you observe in long, silent lapses.Dame Maggie Smith is a real treasure as the Dowager Countess. The rest of the cast are wonderful, I just wish we had more insight into them via dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demise of An Era","review":"This is so good, it's hard to cover everything about it!

Sometimes there's a bit of tasteful naughtiness, as well... Definitely a quality production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey Series 1","review":"If you like period dramas this is one of the best we have seen.

After reading all the great reviews, we decided to give this program a look. With Amazon Prime, we can watch all the episodes for free (and at our own pace), which we really enjoy.The cast of Downton Abbey is superb, and the production values are second to none. The dynamic between the \\"upper crust\\" and the servants is interesting, but the meat of the story comes between the relationships of the servants themselves. Every episode is solid, and the screenplay is first-rate. Personally, I would watch this show for Dame Maggie Smith alone. Truly one of the most talented actresses of her time.

The first episode is a bit overwhelming in that many characters are introduced in a short period of time and one can be a bit confused initially. However, from the start you realize this Masterpiece Series will be very interesting from a human relations standpoint. I believe it will show how complex \\"families\\" can be, and how a household, like Downton Abbey, is one family. It also shows how the \\"family\\" is a living, breathing organism that has many interdependent relationships. It is a fascinating view of lives most of us will never experience or understand completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey is Da Bomb!","review":"I stumbled onto this lovely series by accident. To my delight, I fell in love with the Masterpiece Classic! Would highly recommend this series and all following to this spellbinding drama.

It is hard to stay with the often radily spoken script."},{"rating":"2","title":"this version is missing one of Maggie Smith's best lines!","review":"As I watched this supposedly unedited version of Season One, I looked forward to one of Maggie Smith's best lines, but it never came. In Part Four of the DVD version, Cora and Violet are having tea outside on the estate and are discussing Mary's future, specifically the question of whether she's an heiress or not. Cora says,\\" What we need is a lawyer who's decent and honor-bound to look into it. I think perhaps I know just the man.\\" The scene ends there on the DVD, but in Episode Two of the PBS version, available online [...], Cora responds by saying,\\"I hate to go behind Robert's back,\\" to which Violet says, \\"That's a scruple no successful wife can afford.\\" Too bad this version doesn't include that priceless line!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"My wife and I watched it for the first time and couldn't stop!

The main characters are rich and develop well through the episodes. And the drama is playful yet suspenseful. Several nights my wife and I ended up watching two back-to-back. We are now on to Season 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey","review":"Have heard all the hype and thought I'd try the first season and see if I liked it.

With great actors and excellent writing like this, you can't go wrong. It's a must see"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Quite British","review":"This series is certainly on par with other British-produced series I've watched such as \\"North and South,\\" \\"Bleak House,\\" \\"Upstairs/Downstairs,\\" etc. \\"Downton Abbey\\" is a welcome change over the gratuitous sex and violence shown in many of the American TV series. I will definitely watch Seasons 2 and 3. Being able to watch \\"Downton Abbey\\" for free as an Amazon Prime member was a big plus. My only complaint is that on a few occasions the streaming bandwidth was not sufficient to continue watching in HD. Perhaps that is normal since I have watched very few videos over the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service, great price.","review":"Makes it so easy to be able to shop from home and when you bundle you qualify for free shipping and handling.

So I ordered Season One and Two on DVD and I would absolutely recommend this collection to anyone looking for outstanding entertainment. I am excited for Season Three to begin and when it has finished airing I will of course order it and any remaining seasons until the program has ended which will be a very sad day for me. I have thoroughly enjoyed every single episode so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful series","review":"If you're into costume drama, then Downton Abbey is a must watch. I loved every minute of it and all the women in my family are big fans too. It's a bit faster paced than your usual period piece and it covers a large span of time in few episodes. The story itself is interesting and the characters are well rounded. They all have their flaws and their good sides; there are no purely good or purely evil characters. In any event, I highly recommend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Downton","review":"I have been completely captivated by htis series and look forward to every season, and watch it air at least 2-3 times each episode.

Just finished all three seasons and looking foward to the next. Love most British tv shows as they are much more into showing that not all stories have a happy ending and the 'good' don't always win."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the entire series!","review":"Recommend to everyone. Great character development in both the upstairs and downstairs staff. Great dialogue and amazing costume design. Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"5-Star Video Series","review":"I gave Downtown Abbey Season 1 five stars.Compelling drama about the life of a British aristocratic family and the staff who serve them.Great insight into the class distinction of Britain during this period."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"Many of my friends recommend I watch this show and I decided to check it out to see what all the hype was about.

I am so involved with these characters that by having the DVDs I am able to watch when I have time and enjoy over and over.

I got engrossed in the lives of the different characters and the way of life in the early 1900's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite","review":"I so rarely turn on the television that I am in the dark on most shows. Downton Abbey is one of those shows that everyone talked about, and just kept talking about. I finally gave in and purchased seasons one and two, then spent a weekend wallowing in the English countryside and living right along side the downstairs staff and the upstairs family also. Every character was drawn with such precision I do feel I know them. The stories are so exquisitely told, through costume, scene and character that not once do you think what marvelous acting--because they are not acting--they are just living. And only when the screen goes dark do you appreciate what a marvelous job all have done. I, in America, am now waiting anxiously for season 3 to be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS SHOW!","review":"Was introduced to this series by our son and daughter in law and LOVE IT!Ordered all three seasons! Can't wait for season three to arrive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stories and great actors","review":"Loved every minute. Would watch again! These actors are so well suited for their parts. They truly bring this family and its' household to life. Makes me (well, for maybe a hot minute) wish I had lived in this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey - a masterpiece!","review":"I has been a rare occurrence in my 62 years when a TV series has so grabbed my attention that I found it difficult to wait for the next episode to air. The Downton Abbey series has certainly accomplished that.Due to my lack of a DVR and a hectic schedule, I found it impossible to consistently watch the episodes as they aired on PBS. I have now purchased all 3 seasons on DVD, and I can say it was \\"money well spent\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted to the series","review":"I missed the very first episode and I really needed to see it to make sense of later televised events."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey back in time","review":"A beautifully played series with well depicted characters in an era where order was the must and everyone knew what their role was.The Edwardian period was so rigid and formal that few had the courage to challenge it.Maggie Smith is at her best and steals the scene with every appearance, but like any good show we couldn't imagine one character without all the others even the less likable ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey","review":"A good show.

The whole story line about the \\"Flower Show!\\". So obviously taken from \\"Mrs Miniver\\", one of my favorites. Whoever was responsible didn't need to 'steal' that. SHAME! on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly written and acted--and FUN","review":"So many great words have already been said about this show in other reviews that I will keep this brief. Downton Abbey has the amazing ability to sink you completely into its character world, with all the tumult of the period. But I just want to add that, unlike anything else on television, it makes you feel so very sophisticated and cultured when you watch it, yet it is so much fun at the same time! That is quite a feat! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as i thought it would be","review":"After all the hype it was very disappointing never even finished the first episode.

I was not disappointed! The acting, the sets, the cast, are all excellent. You will not be disappointed in this if you liked UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS, and NORTH AND SOUTH. This is another great series from the BBC. I loved it even though I was a bit disappointed in the ending. Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern were never better. I also appreciated that this was the original Uk production."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best shows on TV","review":"I love this show and the cinematic features and costuming are incredible.

Excellent viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"I must admit I was hesitant about watching a show of this length but I enjoyed it !

The issues of modern life encroaching on tradition, conflicting standards of the generations and an excellent plot make this series well worth your attention.

Just witnessing the attitudes and ways in which they carried out their daily lives and duties, in that era, has been an education and delight. The last moments of Season 1, when the announcement that war had been declared was stunning. The expressions of disbelief, shock, horror, excitement, etc. These poor souls had no idea what was actually coming to an end and the true horror of everything that would eventually take place. I so look forward to Season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love it","review":"This is a wonderful show, I bought the disc because I had not seen the show, Now that I have seen this I watch the show every week"},{"rating":"2","title":"Upstairs, Downstairs...","review":"A show about people who live a different way.

This is very good however and the only thing I have to complain about is Amazon's interface--they make it much too difficult to figure out and to keep up with what you've already watched. But regarding the series, you gals make hubby watch it and he'll soon be hooked like I was/am. Having it in HD and \\"free\\" (because I have \\"Prime\\") doesn't hurt either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic","review":"I have not yet received my purchase.

Can't get enough. So glad it was part of Amazon Prime! I would suggest that everyone watch Downton Abbey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening and great entertainment!","review":"As the parent of teenagers, it is eyeopening to observe the portrayal of the British class system in the first quarter of the last century and consider the detrimental impact that life's events could have on women - and even men. We enjoy watching and learning through this historical fiction masterpiece. The characters are multifaceted and complex-we love and loath them! The actors are exceptional, and if you are a fan of Harry Potter or Law & Order UK, you will see some familiar faces. The storyline twists and turns through the course of every episode, there is always a surprise, and there is a proper dose of humor and scandal, which adds just the right amount of levity and spice, i.e, \\"You have a job? But why?!\\" or \\"What is a week end?\\" We are hooked on this great escape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again!","review":"The homosexual kiss in episode 1 sealed the deal for me.

I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys an English period drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is the difference?","review":"I don't know where else to address this question. What is the difference between the $30 version and the $60 version of the \\"Downton Abbey\\" blu-ray, especially in view of the fact that the description lists the less expensive version as having 3 discs and the more expensive as having 2 discs? It doesn't make any sense. A more detailed description of both items would be helpful to make a decision! I take it that both of these are the longer UK version? I would like to buy this, but only after getting these questions answered. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey","review":"Outstanding acting and great story.

So many cuts that one has to ask too many questions that will not be answered. The holes are numerous leaving one dissatisfied and disappointed.The series presented on PBS' Masterpiece Classics is absolutely outstanding, the full story with no questions left unanswered.I purchased my copies via PBS and promptly returned them for a full refund. The UK version apparently the only one available however, the uncut version can be viewed on the Netflix website. If an uncut version does become available, I will be one of the first to purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful, well acted, dreadful plot and writing","review":"Downton Abbey is addictive. The sets are lush, the acting is wonderful, but the plot and sometimes the dialog have all been done before. It is a pastiche of Upstairs, Downstairs and Mrs. Miniver. I was appalled that an entire subplot was lifted almost word for word from Mrs. Miniver. For Greer Garson substitute Penelope Wilton, for Dame May Whitty substitute Dame Maggie Smith, even the dialog is almost verbatim! The plot twists are right out of Upstairs Downstairs (remember Albert the footman?)and headlines of the 1970s -- shades of Nelson Rockefeller!Downton Abbey is a like an old Hollywood set -- beautiful facade with absolutely NO substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful, addictive soap opera!","review":"My coworkers have been haranguing me for months to watch this show, because they're all addicted. But it wasn't until another coworker said how terrible and boring it was that I finally gave it a chance.We whipped through season one in a week, because after the first episode, we just couldn't stop. Heck, I'm amazed we were able to stretch it out to a full week, because every episode left us wanting more. And you know how sometimes an hour of TV feels like three hours? Well, each hour of this show feels like just 15 minutes. I got so engrossed in every story (even the stories of the bratty Mary or the unlikeable O'Brien), the time just whipped by.I'll try to mete out season two to last a little longer, but it may be a losing battle with a show this addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Series!","review":"The British series Downton Abbey is one of the best television products to come out of the UK in decades.

Do not miss this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing out of Britain since my wife","review":"I married pretty much the best woman this side of the sun, so that's very high praise for Downton Abbey. The quality and intricacy of the story, as well as the thoroughly developed characters makes for the most engaging and entertaining television in recent memory. Watch it and see for yourself. Truly masterful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upstairs, Downton","review":"Enthralling, mesmerizing, involving, enchanting -- there aren't enough superlatives to adequately express how enjoyable this production is! If you loved \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\", you will wear this DVD out. Maggie Smith is wonderful, as always, and the the rest of the cast are flawless in their roles portraying people during rapidly changing times after the turn of the century. The plot twists are startling, the characters rich and multi-faceted. I can't wait for the next chapter of this thoroughly engaging drama!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed but read on","review":"Alas, I was looking forward to this series on my large TV using Apple Tv remote. I can get sound but no picture. Did Amazon forwarn me of this happening? If so, I did not see it, and this would be my mistake. I feel totally ripped off. I can still watch it on iPad on which I ordered but might go \\"blind\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"This product had a \\"region 2\\" on it which I finally found out meant that it could only be played on DVD machines in Europe.

Now I find it for sale on Amazon. First time I have been aware that I could buy a Masterpiece series before it was completed on US TV...I find that pretty strange that the production company would try to undermind its own American bankability...With the other Brit series carried over--like the Lyndley shows or Jane Tennison--we always had to wait until the series had played here to get the US DVD versions...Why this???"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't hate it.

Some don't and I am disappointed. Will have to try again to get the right thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"*****Spoiler Alert*****I'd been sick and decided to watch something online. I love the works of Jane Austen and other period pieces. I was hoping that this would turn out to be a good show. It was very hard to track what was happening during this first episode, as well as the sudden onslaught of men kissing. It didn't even appear to fit into the story. Anyway, I totally wasted an hour of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"1080i/60","review":"1080i/60, this review is for the blu-ray disc transfer only. the series is a 5 star.What?

They are choppy, jumpy, in any movement,even when someone walks downstairs. I don't know the technical term for it, but the picture is not smooth. flickers in motion. What was england thinking? why not 1080p/24?Maybe I have a bad batch run of both disc 1 and 2. Anybody else having this problem with this blu-ray. Ready to return. Hurts my eyes.

It has excellent storylines that include both the residents and the service staff which give the viewer different perspectives on the events that occur at Downton. Each character has their own unique personality that as you get to know them you develop strong opinions of each one. The history from the time period makes it even more interesting. I highly recommend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the series.","review":"The series continues with England in a war. I thought that was life changing for these people. To see the changes that take place is very interesting. Especially the woman. The war isn't very pretty but I still enjoyed the way the lives changed and how you get to see who has courage an who doesn't. My friend says the show is a complete downer with every turn there is death sickness and betrayal. That is true, however it's how people handle situations and how their lives are changed because of the troubles they have that keeps me tuned in.I also love the acting and the costumes. Love seeing the decorations of the house and how the staff related to the Lord and Lady. Love the evolution to the electric age too. It's a nice way to see history, which I really never learned well in high school.The seller got this item to me very quickly, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unlikable characters","review":"I was SHOCKED by how much I hated this. I kept waiting for it to get better. I have to say, I typically adore this type of movie/tv and I even paid for it just a few days (unknowingly) before it became free and I'm still mad I paid money for it.While it's gorgeous and the acting is good and the writing is good, the story is just trope after trope, nothing original in the slightest. But worst of all, none of the characters are likable. I don't care about them, could not find any redeeming value in them whatsoever. McGovern is slightly likable, and you feel sorry for her, but at the end of it, I was left with the feeling of being robbed. Like, ok, now everything is going to suck even more than it did before and nothing that we just watched matters at all. Why? Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasantly surprised","review":"(This is not a review, but rather a content warning.)I recently saw on broadcast TV part of a first season episode and thought this mini-series had promise. I reviewed many of the reviews here on amazon, and saw mostly praise, with a few negative reviews based mostly on what did not make it into video versions. So, I bought a copy.However, within the first 30 minutes of the first episode a sodomite \\"love\\" scene compelled me to stop the player, apologize to my wife and trash season one. Ruined.It's getting more and more difficult to find modern productions which have not been altered to include sodomite characters and themes.

Beginning with the first episode where the death of a main character dying on the Titanic and causes upheaval with the inheritance of an estate. The story line continues episode after episode to thieve ideas from the Original 1970s Upstairs Downstairs program so much so that it should be renamed Upstairs Downstairs Abbey!!! They should be sharing the royalties with the writer of the 1970s Upstairs Downstairs. I enjoy the show but plagiarism is plagiarism. The majority of its viewers have never seen the old 1970s original TV series Upstairs Downstairs and so are unaware of the obvious story snatching.

The clay spade attachment is beautifully made, with a large spade area sharpened to a nice ground leading edge. It weighs 12 lbs. so altogether with the H65 the tool weighs 52 lbs. The overall weight benefits the clay cutting action and I found it worked great for loosening the tight clay subsoils here in Michigan.

My husband put them on in no time at all and he said they went on easy. Then I waited and it didn't rain for a couple of weeks. Well, finally it rained and I went out just to try the mud guards.

Like in the comics, Dennis does not cause mischief out of malice, and this movie really shows that trait about Dennis, that he's not mean (no matter how annoyed Mr. Wilson might get by Dennis' antics) It is especially hilarious how Dennis innocently interacts with the bad guy in this film, and the criminal ends up not wanting to keep Dennis as hostage anymore because of how darned annoying the kid can be. Overall a pretty funny film, if you liked the comic strips or cartoon, this movie is definitely a worthy version of Dennis the Menace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dennis the Menace","review":"A funny all around family movie which keep my two grandsons ages 5 and 7 entertained too.

After watching it with my kids, I think it's horrible. There isn't much of a plot, and Dennis doesn't actually spend all that much time annoying Mr. Wilson as he did in the cartoon. There are several sexual references which could have been left out, and a scene with teenagers making out on a couch, none of it really is needed for the plot and especially isn't needed in a movie targeted towards young children. The \\"bad guy\\" in the movie is extremely creepy and you're not really sure what he's up to (is he some kind of pedophile?!?). In short, I found the whole movie to be awful.

Now Where's the Complete CD?","review":"When I started listening to Jars of Clay's music, this was one of the first CD's I bought because of my love of Christmas music. It perfectly blends a traditional Christmas song with their unique style. It whetted my appetite for a complete Christmas CD from them.There are a total of four songs on this CD. The regular recording of \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" is followed by the Grinch Mix of the song. I tend to like the original arrangement of a song and not care too much for remixes, and that rule applies to this as well. Same can be said for the next song, the Fluffy Saw Mix of \\"Blind\\" from their debut CD. Finally, we get \\"Wicker Baskets,\\" an acoustic instrumental piece I really like.It's been almost 10 years since this hit the market. Here's hoping they finally get around to following it up with a full length Christmas CD soon. If this is any indication, it would be great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars!!!","review":"Although not an album, this Jars of Clay EP contains one of the best Christmas songs of all time - \\"The Little Drummer Boy\\".

The acting was stiff. Maybe something was lost in the translation. But it seemed they took a 10 min dialogue and stretched it to 2 hours. Basic story left me saying get over it, get on with it. I fast forewarded through most of it and didn't miss anything. If you're a lesbian looking for a movie with strong female interaction, it's not this one. This movie, definitely was not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"High-tier Fassbinder","review":"There is something irresistable about Fassbinder's early formalism beginning to melt into the psycho-drama of his middle phase. Based on a play which he wrote and taking place entirely in Frau Von Kant's boudoir, the viewer is firmly within Fassbinder's grip and he doesn't let go, like a cat playing with its mouse. Now that he's got you where he wants you, let's go a little insane with Margit Carstensen; I'm sure that you won't mind such a small indulgence from the director?The film pivots strongly on unrequieted love, although unrequieted makes it sound more romantic than it is; more of an obsession which destroys. A decidedly cleansing experience, if I do say so, myself.This is essential Fassbinder and one of the 4 or 5 absolute stone-cold masterpieces of his that I've seen. I wish I had seen it earlier, as it embodies much of the methodology of all his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely dreadful!!","review":"Art-house praise aside, this is by far the most painfully dull movie I have ever slogged through. The characters are incredibly irritating, especially the title character, a pathetic weirdo who is brought to her knees by the rejection of her manipulative, lesbian-when-she-wants-to-be lover. It is one of those films that one always thinks has to get better, considering all of the praise heaped on it. It starts out bad and gets worse with each passing moment, until one finally begins to wonder if it will ever end. If you want to watch a good foreign film with lesbianism in it, get Antonia's Line. It's delightful, and enjoyable for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Fassbinder's Best","review":"This one's a hoot! And it can be viewed on so many levels. The silent character represents the audience, it seems. And this film really covers the stages of romantic relationships: the first meeting, the first night together, the jealousy, the break-up, and of course, the anxiety that follows in the hopes that it could start again. The dialogue is incredible! The costumes are hilarious, but true to the era. And this film should be bringing more film students and film buffs into Fasbinder's world for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Reflection","review":"I had the pleasure of him teaching me from this book in which was a life and mood altering experience.

In fact, I like this TV special even BETTER than the short, because it covers more aspects of American history (or should I say \\"hystery\\"-the cartoons whose portions are reused in this cartoon are HILARIOUS!) than the short itself. You won't find \\"Yankee Doodle Bugs\\" or most of the older shorts reused in this special on video anywhere (except as a special feature onYankee Doodle Dandy (Two-Disc Special Edition)for \\"Yankee Doodle Bugs\\"), so I STRONGLY recommend that you buy this TV special! It's MUCH cheaper, especially considering how much laughing, entertainment, and good old \\"retro 'toon\\" experience you can get out of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"obselete ; buy the new one","review":"Got this model about two years ago. It was the only choice at the time that could pronounce words. It worked OK, the vocabulary was limited ; probably OK for spanish intermediate level at the most. It was plagued with poor design though. really bad battery door design resulting in intermittent operation. Hard to use volume control. unreliable connecter in the back for inserting other books, poor contrast made it difficult to read, and my son at one point adjusted it to minimum while playing with it and the display totaly disappeared. Took lot of blind hit and trial to get to the settings menu to get it back. pls designers leave the minimum contrast adjustment at a level that can still be seen. About two years of use the top half of the display stopped working.It has been replaced by a better model that is thin and smaller. Get that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"second year spanish student","review":"I had great hopes for this machine. Immediately I noticed that the first line of the entry always seemed to be in a dark shadow and I had to try tipping the unit to get light into the inner screen to make it readable. It too often doesn't have the words --- even many very common ones in its database. The voice is extremely fuzzy when you try the audio pronunciation feature. It only has a few forms of many of the the words I am seeking. If this unit really has 250,000 words -- as they tell us---then they should create a new one with a couple of million"},{"rating":"1","title":"BREAKs--","review":"i started out really liking this translator, but one I carried it in my bag for about 2 days the plastic screen started cracking eventually the whole thing and off and now it is almost useless if i want to carry it around.

It is comfortable, but it did not last well, and I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great heating pad","review":"I got this pad for Christmas and it hasn't worked properly since day 1.

I chose this one because of the features. It is long, soft, has a long cord, and offered several heat settings. The highest setting did not even get warm! It blinks, and blinks, and blinks. I ended up trying three different heating pads, and found one with comparable features that I was seeking, and it gets hot! Not warm! Hot!! It is a Sunbeam Ultraheat, and that is what it is! I have pain from my lower back to my calf so this covers a lot of the area, and it offers moist heat as well. This Softheat brand is exactly that. Soft heat as in no heat. I hope this review helps other consumers, and saves you time from having to return it. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do your research on this company!!!","review":"If you have a problem with this product, Kaz will NOT respond to your requests for help, even if you are within the warrenty.

They don't stay on as long as they say they will and the stupid green light just blinks and blinks even after you unplug it and plug it back in, it doesn't even take 10 minutes and its doing it again. Huge waste of money!! Would not recommend!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I have used this all of five times and it already died.

I will not be buying from soft heat again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"I wish I had read these reviews before buying this pad. I have had this pad 2 1/2 days. It seemed to work fine the first time I used it. The next time I turned it on and all times since it has heated inconsistently. Now it is shutting itself off after 5 - 20 minutes use, requiring me to unplug it each time to reset. Looks like I'll be returning it tomorrow.

Never had a heat pad do that. What a bunch of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FLAMES","review":"When this pad worked I liked it, but I've had issues with it. My mom and I have the same pad, and we had the same problem. It seems like there is a short somewere in the wireing because the when I used it, it would switch on and off many times and the red light wold blink very rapidly. I always knew it wouldn't turn on if the red off light was blinking fast. I think this same short caused this very dangerous problme. I woke up today and turned my pad on and I smelled something scorched. I looked around and I wasn't sure what it was. I left my room and came back, I layed back down and the smell got worse. I picked up the pad and where the chord met the first part of the clip, it sparked and a fairly good sized flame sprang up. I'm so glad that I was in the room or my bed would have caught on fire. I was really shaken and upset because I would have been hurt and the heating pad was only a little over a year old. I would have expected that for what I paid for it it would have been safer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crapola ...","review":"I ordered two of these heating pads and paid more because it looked like they have a better cover, instead of the usual cheap cotton cloth cover that looks like a rag after being washed once ... well, they do have a different cover, but the listing on Amazon didn't say that the pads SHUT-OFF after ONE HOUR. I am capable of turning off a heating pad by myself, and don't need/want any auto shutoff. These two heating pads are going right back. I can get the regular heating pads that don't have auto shutoff down at the the local discount store for half the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"SoftHeat Ultra Heating Pad Moist/Dry, King Size, 12-Inch by 24-Inch","review":"Very happy with this heating pad.

The fabric used to cover the pad is very soft and comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called hard heat.","review":"This is terrible and god awful. If you for some unknown reason want to get a nice quick heat up for about 10 minutes and then carry on with whatever it is you may be doing. Then please, buy this, because that is all you are going to get. This is actually quite funny, but the actual remote, is the only thing that stays heated the whole time and almost gets too hot to touch. It isnt even part of the pad!!! I've already wasted my money on this and am well passed getting a refund, sadly, but I have used it enough times to say that this is pure garbage. I thought that maybe it had to be worn in or something, that maybe, its like a pair of new shoes. HA! That was a joke and I was only kidding myself. I wish I had checked out other reviews before buying this, but at the time, I had no idea that not all heating pads are created equally and this is whats on the other end of the spectrum (the terrible side)... Dont buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your $$","review":"I was really happy with the design of the pad when I first purchased it. It had no sharp plastic corners to poke me and was big enough to cover my whole back. My pad lasted a little longer than the other reviewers' pads... several months. It quit working, so thinking there may be a bad fuse, I took the controller apart. Yep, a bad fuse. Only problem? It's saudered directly to the board. I can't just pop it out and replace it. Based on this and the other reviews, I definitely will not buy another SoftHeat heating pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire! Fire! Fire!","review":"From the beginning it felt like it was getting hotter than it should, even on the lowest setting. The controller would get hot, too. We should have stopped using it and taken it back, but we didn't. About the 2nd or 3rd day of use, it actually got so hot it melted itself, the pillow cases, pillows, blankets, sheets, mattress cover and part of the mattress before my girlfriend could get it unplugged. Thank God all those items are made of flame-retardant materials. The house could have burned down and she could have been hurt or killed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy another one","review":"This is a good heat pad if you don't like a lot of heat. The highest setting feels like warm and when I put it on warm setting I can't even tell it is on. The only thing good about it is that it's quilted and you can machine wash it, but there are other quilted brands that give off more heat than this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great heating pad, but the controls burn out.","review":"My first impression of this heating pad was, \\"GREAT!\\" It is large enough to wrap around a sore shoulder and well down the back, it has nice controls and four heat settings, and turns off after an hour or so (for safety). Unfortunately, it was only 3 weeks before it stopped working. I exchanged it for another unit (thought maybe it was a fluke). The replacement lasted about two months of almost daily use, then died. It appears that the controller simply burns out. I would not recommend this heating pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Product","review":"I had the exact same experience as Stan, another reviewer. I bought this heating pad and when it turned itself off, I could not get it started again. Like Stan, I thought it was a fluke and bought another. Same problem, two days after buying the pad.

I followed the directions on their site, to unplug it and plug it back in after 10 minutes, but it did nothing.I contacted Kaz and they told me I can pay to ship the pad back for a replacement. I've decided to save my money, why would I want to pay even more money for another faulty heating pad?

Well, this is no different except I now have more expensive heating pad that is useless. Just like the other reviewers, my controller suddenly started blinking red and would not allow me to press any other button to start the heat process. I plugged and unplugged the unit several times with several long time increments each time. I also tried holding down all of the hear setting buttons for several seconds, sometimes two or three at once. Nothing worked. Its was nice while it lasted-- heated well without getting too hot.

One big drawback is that it takes forever to set up and the roller coasters don't stand up well. It's better to play with 3 or 4 players to make it more exciting. It takes about 30-40 minutes to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Roller Coaster Tycoon Lovers Only!","review":"This board game is great but it easily gets very, very boring. The only way you will like this game is if you love the roller coaster tycoon computer game. There is a new RCT game coming out which all fans are eagerly waiting for it. If you feel you might have the slightest inrest in the game buy it. BUT my warning to you is that it IS HIGHLY adictive."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok if you are ten","review":"This game is for kids not adults. It is very short game play, not much strategy, and the cardboard coasters fall apart. If I were ten again I would enjoy this game.

It will just end up sitting on your shelf taking up space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits well, does the job","review":"The cincher fits well and cinches. It also has a nice retro-sexy look.

I had read other spiritual books and this was the only one that simplified spiritual matters instead of confusing the hell out of me. I am one of those spiritual people that you have to allow me to find my own way instead of being pushed in a certain direction. Jeff writes in a way that you can understand what your own path is and not follow the path of the one writing the book. What drew me to the book was the title because I was in search for something and I was not sure what it was. I felt a calling. The way that I came across this book was truly divine, but I will not go into that story, but if you are looking for spirituality explained on a level that you can understand and gain simple wisdom, then this is the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"think of cliff notes for the spirit...","review":"Amidst a plethora of new age/populist books on spirituality, this book stands out for its concise survey of the best in the genre. The author concisely extracts the best concepts from the leading spritual writers, providing both a nice introduction to their works as well as a handy little reference guide. A great way to wade through the genre and sort the wheat from the chaf for those schooled in traditional religious and/or philosophical approaches to spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply profound book for all ages.","review":"I have been a receiver of Jeff's Daily Ponders for years, and rushed for the opportunity to read his book on spiritual growth.

I never got that done, but last year I did much better. I gave my kids all copies of \\"Spirituality Simplified\\", just as I continue to give this book as gifts to friends and family.

Concise and to the point, this book should be read by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Marvelous","review":"One's spirtual journey is not simple, however Jeff makes you believe it can be. I think what makes this book so easy to understand such a complex topic is Jeff's clear, concise discussion of spiritual concepts supported by very personal experiences of his spiritual journey that help the reader to not only understand but believe. The best part is he has done all the research for you, and gives you the tools and direction to continue your own journey of self discovery. This book will open your mind to life's possiblities you never dreamed of.Thank You Jeff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and Inspirational Work","review":"The book presents concepts in a clear and concise format.

They let someone else make it and slap the B&D; brand on it.To be fair, the machine was great when it was working. It has an extra large water reservoir that lets you store enough water for 2-3 cups of coffee. Clean-up was a snap. You just take the podholder (and pod) and dump the used pod in the trashcan.

I love that the poems point towards nature, which is a subject both children and adults can appreciate. I could have easily used a book of poems that were written for children using silly rhymes or phonetic structure. However, introducing the well crafted work of Ms. Worth to my children has added some beauty into our day. We start each morning reading our poem for the week. They are being introduced to concepts such as imagery and poem construction within a structure and subject that they can understand. Love these poems! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Baby Can Talk - a relief for communication!!!","review":"I love both videos of the My Baby Can Talk series. We bought the first video when our daughter was 10 months old and started showing signs of frustration because she could not communicate her needs. We had heard that sign language was a great tool for babies and toddlers to communicate - definitely the truth! We bought the second video as soon as it was available. Our daughter,now 2, signs over 50 words! It has bridged the gap for communication and it is so much fun!! We also think that the sign language has even encouraged her to talk more than most children her age.I have bought atleast 10 of these videos! They are one of my favorite baby gifts to give!I recommend this video series to all parents with children between 10 months and 4 years of age."},{"rating":"2","title":"good lessons for engaged learning","review":"My toddler LOVES all the My Baby Can Talk DVDs and has learned every sign that matters to him - help, more, please, cracker, shoes, socks, car.... It's great to be able to communicate with him. We found the model to be a little off-putting, but her signing is clear and our little guy can understand. The DVD employs generalization, which helps teach each sign as a concept, and places it in context. The music is hinky, but works somehow. In any case, despite production flaws, the structure and design of these DVDs is solid and works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for another great product!","review":"Here is another great product from the folks at Baby Hands Productions!I have a nephew Luke that has learned many of the signs from My Baby Can Talk - First Signs. (My wife watches him 5 days a week.) He loved to watch it every day but seemed to be loosing interest in it lately bacause he had learned most of the signs.This new title My Baby Can Talk - Sharing Signs is just what we needed!

We started using the first signs video at that time. He picked it up right away. We recently got the Sharing Signs DVD. He immediately started trying to do these new signs. It was amazing how fast he picked it up. Not only does he know the signs while watching the video, he uses them each and every day. We will walk outside, and he will sign tree. We are in the grocery store and he signs apple. We were in a toy store, and he saw a giraffe... He immediately signed giraffe. It is absolutely amazing how much he is able to communicate with us before he is even a year old! These videos are a wonderful tool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the first DVD","review":"We got a lot out of the first video, it was like Hellen Keller and the water sign to my child. The second DVD is not nearly as good at teaching signs as the first. It moves very quickly, they spend little time reinforcing the meaning of the sign - blink and they've moved on. They barely show the actual signs. A new child is featured whose signing motions are very off base, he does not belong in an instructional DVD. My daughter is now doing mystery signs, she is developing a sign language speech impediment. We will have to switch to the Signing Times videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again amazed at such great quality","review":"This is a great follow up video for the first. I would reccommend that your child know how to do the first video's content in signing as the second video is more difficult with its concepts.However my daughter still loves to watch it I showed it to a 2 year old cousin and he immediately started picking up the ideas of please and thank you and baby from this video. He loved learning baby, monkey, mommy and daddy. He just squealed with delight and ran around the house showing his mother over and over again that he could sign her now.He learned the entirity of the first video when he was about 18 months old and has been practicing that ever since.anyone who says any different doesn't understand that the concept of this video is obviously harder to teach and i think they do an excellent idea of trying to teach children some very useful words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I can't say enough wonderful things about these Dvd's.

You can't go wrong with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highest possible recommendation.","review":"My daughter is just turning 17 months and we have been using all 3 my baby can talk DVD's since she was 9 months old, she knows nearly every sign on all 3 dvd's and uses them in her daily life. This is a fantastic tool and I could not imagine raising my daughter and not being able to communicate like we can with the signs she has learned.When I first watched \\"First Signs\\" I thought give me a break, this is so lame. But it shows what I know, my daughter loved it, it was like baby crack. At 9-10 months she would watch 25-35 minutes straight before she would loose attention. To contrast we tried some of the Baby Einstein sign videos when she was around a year old. They are more glitzy and have the TV Actress Marlee Matlin signing. But my daughter didn't appreciate any of that production value, she barely paid any attention to them at all.I tell everyone I know with infants about these DVD's and recommend them at the highest level."},{"rating":"2","title":"The My Baby Can Talk series is absolutely wonderful!","review":"The first video taught my then twelve month old son to sign the very first time he watched it and the Sharing Signs DVD is just as amazing. He is now fifteen months old and is already signing please, thank you, help, baby and more after just a couple of viewings. Everyone who sees him signing is amazed by how well he can communicate and by how calm his ability to communicate has made him. No other videos have been able to capture my son's interest like the My Baby Can Talk videos have.

My baby has learned SO much from these!","review":"Highly recommend these. My daughter has learned so many signs from these videos. All of them in context, so she will only do the sign when she sees the object or thing or when she wants to communicate something. I am SO impressed! She has more signs than my friends babies who go to sign classes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 2nd video in this series","review":"We have owned the first video in this series (i think there are just the two) since my daughter was about a year old (she'll be three in two weeks). Both of my kids LOVE this video (my son is 21 months), so i was incredibly happy to receive an email from My Baby Can Talk before Christmas, advising me that the second video had been released. I bought it for the kids for Christmas, and I think they have watched it almost every day since receiving it. The \\"formula\\" of the video is very similar...some of the same tunes in a similar order, but the signs are all new, and it works! It has captivated my kids -- and the fact that they are learning something(my daughter knows most of the signs on both videos) makes me more comfortable with letting them watch this daily!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAD SPOTS","review":"This product has many dead spots.

Dean Jones and Kurt Russell are a great team of actors. And we really enjoyed them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Screen Sucks ......... most of the Time!","review":"DVD Movies have many great features: great picture quality, making of documentaries, trailers and much more. However my favorite feature would have to be \\"Widescreen\\". So that is why I was so disappointed when I found out this movie was full screen. I bought this movie anyways, because at less I could replace my old faded VHS tape with superb color and sound and it did. However it did more than that. Upon closer comparison I noticed that was getting a lot more picture on the top and bottom and left and right of the screen!!!! On my 32 inch TV it's about and extra inch and a half more picture around the out side of the screen compared to my VHS tape. I was overjoyed and delighted by this discovery. So don't be too hasty in judge this movie if you love widescreen. Give it a chance it will be sure to please."},{"rating":"2","title":"old-fashioned fun","review":"This is not an exercise for the intellect, but a plain, innocent film with the familiar boy meets girl theme done the way Disney used to make films. There's a refreshing quality to this very non-technological movie with no computer graphics. I enjoyed the horse-show footage, and it will most definitely appeal to horse lovers of whatever age. This is not just for the young folks, but for us older folks too. It will cause lots of amusement, and the acting is just right for this kind of a film. This is just right for a break from the violence, and so called \\"adult\\" garbage that the movie makers put out now. Sit back and be prepared for old-fashioned fun that everyone in the family can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent","review":"I recommend this great movie to everybody. It is a great comedy.

Wilson- This cd was remastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound, NYC in 3/1999. I don't know why your copy doesn't indicate as such.This is a great cd. Mainly because the Eagles had the incredibly good taste to cover a Tom Waits song. In addition, the song \\"My Man\\" is simply excellent. And, in the words of Forest, \\"that's all I've got to say about that.\\"As Eagles cd's go, this is a great one. But, they all are. I can't really recommend one over the other.

Every song on here is different, and every song is great. \\"You Never Cry Like A Lover\\" - can't understand why this one isn't played more - tender and intense! \\"Good Day In Hell\\" flat out smokes. The harmonies are flawless (as usual) and the instrumentation is superb. Add this one to your collection for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Eagles Fall in the Music Industry","review":"Although The Eagles started out as an upbeat rock/country band, this cd proves that The Eagles just don't have what it takes anymore. The lyrics drag on and are very bland.

It has nice rock rythms that will keep this album exciting. Felder's slide guitar playing on a good day in hell is awesome. the only downside is ol '55 that is pretty lame and weak vocally and instrumentally. It isn't a song that the eagles could make sound magnificent and gets a little boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Was hoping for all scenes to be depicted in order with stills and some explanation, but just like the 'Pictorial History of GWTW,'just a bunch of random photos with no meaningful order, nothing to help a film artist understand something of how the film wasmade, nothing was sequential, just a lot of useless random photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for hiking with kids...","review":"Great little guide.

My biggest disappointment with this one is with the drawings, most of which are from Pamela Gosner's Caribbean Georgian, published by Three Continents Press in 1982. (You'll get many more informative drawings if you can find this book.) One of the other illustrations, a \\"classical\\" column and pediment, is filled with the most basic errors. The text neither contradicts not adds anything new to Gosner's book or Buissert's Historic Architecture of the Caribbean (1980, Heinemann Educational Books) or Crane's Historic Architecture of the Caribbean Islands (1994, Univ. of Florida Press). The photography is better in the later two books as well.I recommend searching for used copies of these other books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as my old one.","review":"I had another of these or rather similar that lasted forever but this one has ridges in it and it has the tendency to roll up under my neck.

It barely gets warm & that's on the highest of 4 settings. Taking it back tomorrow & will try a different brand. Read several reviews on SoftHeat heating pads...many similar complaints about lack of heat. I have used Sunbeam in the past, & heat seems to be good, but they only last a few years, then don't heat up very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last a day","review":"I don't have anything to say about how hot this thing would get because I took mine out of the box, plugged it in, and the green light would start flashing. I did check the instructions and trouble shooting, and I will say this is the first time I've had to read the owners manual for a heating pad. Anyhow, there was nothing in there about that symptom; I could not use the control to turn the thing off, and it never got hot. Bummer, now my neck still hurts. Guess it's another night of Icy Hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price....","review":"I purchased this heating pad based on other reviews and am glad I did. It heats up very quickly and will shut off if you happen to fall asleep (very good safety feature).

Very good product and would recommend to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk..","review":"This costs twice as much as the most popular brand and barely gets hot at all.

The idea is great but this particular product is garbage. There was no brand name markings on the jars except for the \\"made in Mexico\\" sticker. Of the six that I received three were crack very badly. The rims are slightly warped and don't make a good seal. The plastic doesn't seem to be dishwasher safe as after a few washes they started crazing (cheap acrylic?). The manufacturer didn't even take the time to clean up the excess plastic when they cast the jars.

They are not like the ones made by Oster."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good history for non-scholars","review":"I am not a scholar of Chinese history. I just wanted to know more about the culture. I found the book to be very enjoyable. The topic was too broad for the book to spend much time in any detail of the subject. The book is well reasoned and excellent for those of us that want to know the basics about Chinese history. For those that read the other reviewer comments, bear in mind that the book covers Chinese history for prehistoric time to present day. Any commentary about US policy occurs in the very tail end. The book does do a good job contrasting the Chinese outlook to the western viewpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"great addition","review":"I have read other histories of China. This offers a diiferent perspective i.e. that of this particular author. It also filled in some holes not in other volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed reading","review":"Wish there was bit more coverage of earlier history of China as 1/2 the book covers 20th century China. I enjoyed his coverage of Mao and PRC politics, read like a novel to me.He tried to throw some economics in his review of China which was good but his economics is very weak. Apparently he believes that there needs to a special form of economics different from the balance of humanity to explain China. There is something very unique and strange about China that makes macro economics and microeconomics useless in China. For some reason low cost labor is a problem and not an asset to China in his eyes. And of course we says we can not compare economic development in Taiwan with that of the PRC because they are different.I do get a feeling he is one of those progressives that grew up in the 1930s hates classical liberals and really believed that Communism would work if it only could be tweaked a little and has only failed because of bad men such as Mao and Stalin."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much different from previous editions","review":"I bought this book because I was misled by the information displayed on Amazon's web site. This edition in its paperback form actually runs to 560 pages only, not to 640 pages as the \\"product details\\" claims.

But no."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must have\\" for outdoor photographers","review":"This is an outstanding guide to taking landscape photographs. John Fielder takes you through all of the elements that make a successful landscape photograph. He guides you through well-written text and examples of his own stunning photography. This book is a \\"must have\\" for any aspiring landscape photographer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Novice Photographer","review":"Fielder's book provides the basics, at best, for those who don't already have some technical knowledge related to the art & science of photography. It is a good primer for those who are interested or already taking nature photographs but really haven't learned why it is they do what they do.There are, no doubt, better books out there that go into far more detail and if you already understand the basics of this hobby, then you may want to search elsewhere for a better education on this subject. If you don't already possess a basic knowledge of this stuff then this just might be a good place to begin.As with most of Fielder's other books, this is NOT a good coffee table book.And while he may not have graduated with a degree in photography, Fielder solved the dilemma of how to make money selling your work by creating his own publishing company and promoting his work through that model. It has obviously worked very well for him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for photo composition and technique","review":"I saw John Fielder at a public event and I was impressed with his matter of fact work flow model. This book lays it all out. Its a great how to resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I bought this book because John Fielder is very well known throughout Colorado, and I assumed he must be a good photographer. Unfortunately, I later realized that he owns his own publishing company, and this is the only reason any of his photos get published. Do not buy this book. John Fielder is, at best, an average photographer. I would recommend, instead, the how-to books by Art Wolfe or John Shaw. Wolfe, in particular, is a far better photographer than Fielder, and certainly provides much better advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, flat, flat","review":"Although Fielder is admirable in his persistance, ambitiously pursuing the ultimate bland shot is not the pinnacle of artistic endeavour. Fielder has little to no sense of composition...read Muench or Maeda, this is not a good \\"how-to\\" book...the author doesn't know how."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that bad, but not that good.","review":"I do feel that Fielder deserves more than one star for his efforts. He does take some good photographs. But he has built his reputation - not from the quality of his photographs - but from the fact that he owns his own publishing company. And there definitely are better photographers out there than Fielder. If you really want to learn how to take better photographs, I would have to recommend that you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Art of Taking Marginal Photographs","review":"Unfortunately, John Fielder is not in a position to be giving advice to anyone but the most hapless of photographers. His photographs are rather boring and uncreative and he consistently does a poor job compositionally. He should have written a book on how to mass-market photographs, because that is really what Fielder does best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant and Annoying","review":"I recently purchased this book on the advice from a fellow photographer that critiqued my work as an amatuer photographer. He said that this book helped him personally in his photography. I'm half way down with this book and find Fielder unappreciative of his ability. I agree that he is a good photographer, but the way he explains his photos is annoying. On a decent photo he will go into detail about the composition and how you eye flows across the picture. Sorry, but some of the photos he describes are not as good as he thinks. If you are looking for a \\"how-to\\" book, don't pick this one. Try John Shaw's Nature photography and you will get your moneies worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"As with all things done well, the bottom line is hard work..","review":"Fielder's \\"The Art of Seeing\\" is above all a testament to the power of passion and hard work in the life of an artist. The author's writing is personal, proud and sometimes a bit arrogant, but he supports his panache with some powerful results--a collection of lovely and powerful landscape photographs. He moves too quickly through some of the technical information, and his \\"pizza\\" analogy is disappointing. But this \\"how-to\\" book is about more than technique. Between the lines, Fielder tells us that talent and technical skill are not enough...that life-long passion, dedication, care and hard work are the foundations of superior art."},{"rating":"1","title":"He can take pictures but he can't write","review":"The entertaining diatribes in this customer review section to the contrary, John Fielder does know how to take striking large-format landscape pictures. I bought the book because I thought some of the pictures were really lovely. As a how-to book, though, it was a disappointment: derivative and boring and written in a smug, self-congratulatory style. Think of Donald Trump telling people how to do real estate deals and you get the idea. For example: \\"By some undefinable mental process I have never allowed objects to be out of place, even unbalanced, in an image. Only when I began to study design theory did it become clear to me how I do what I do.\\"To me the class act in how-to photography books is Galen Rowell's \\"Mountain Light.\\" John Long's books are also good.

Obviously Hollywood liked it as well since you can find several movies with the same name. After the title, I found the book to be a little of a let down. When a band of outlaws decide to take a wagon load of goods going west from an unsuspecting and unprepared family of three, they never counted on Con Vallian. He could care less about anything but himself, but the coffee that lady made sure was good. He found himself entangled in a fight that they could not win without him.

It came with two free very small vials (perfume sample vials, if you are familiar with them), one of vanilla and the other of patchouli. The samples were useless to me as I dislike both as perfume scents. I wish they'd given me at least other floral scents to try.The three main bottles are: Sudanese Black Rose, Arabian Wild Rose, and French Rose. The Arabian Wild Rose is delightful, and I wish I could just buy that by itself. It was very rose scented, with only a touch of some other base note. The Sudanese Black Rose was not in the least rose scented and smelled sort of like a cross between medicinal and Catholic church incense. Not terrible, but not my thing. The French Rose smells like a combo of baby powder and soap, with no inkling of rose in there at all.

That said, if you want more detailed maps or more concise country profiles, you might be better off checking other resource materials such as National Geographic (Magazine maps) and The CIA World Fact Book respectively.

Career goals, friends (including one with AIDS), and New York City all passively conspire to make daily life and dreams for the future together impossible. Beautifully photographed in and around the Upper West Side (like \\"You've Got Mail), it contains a wonderful party scene, reminiscent of that one in \\"Breakfast at Tiffany,\\" where even though there are a number of conversations going on all at once, you can understand them and they're hilarious! The final scene at the beach on Fire Island, just like in \\"Longtime Companion,\\" epitomizes the life cycle not of just life and death, but of renewal of spirit, rebirth of opportunity, and hope for the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, a little dated, but realistic gay film","review":"This is one of the first and few realistic portrayals of gay life. It deals with AIDS (early on) and some very good scenes of a loving gay male couple. Very good movie, should be seen by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAKE A GLANCE AT A MOST PERFECT LOVE STORY","review":"We leave you with a parting glance at Bill Sherwood's directorial debut, the funny, romantic and bittersweet 1986 film that was a pioneer of gay cinema and that remains the best film about gays and the AIDS epidemic ever made. It is a story of love, compassion and friendship -- the flick made a star out of lead Steve Buscemi -- told with style and sophistication that will you breathless whether you're gay or straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This is a genuinely touching, honest, and dramedy about human relationhips of all types. I've seen it three times in the past 26 years, and each time I derive more insight into and pleasure from the story and the incredible performances - each of which is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parting Glances","review":"A film now dated, but for the year (1985)was a bold subject and a bit far-fetched. But, it started to get the message across of the spreading of H.I.V. An enjoyable film nicely handled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Reading...","review":"So far this book is great, And I think that there is a lot of things we can only try to understand. Faith and Facts do go hand in hand, but even the most obvious things will never be enough for people who refuse to Believe God's Word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should just be \\"In the Light of the Bible\\"","review":"This is a religious book, not a science book. Does not answer even the most obvious questions regarding a great flood theory. Why is evidence of early humans only found near the earth's surface? Why are fossils found stratified rather than jumbled up as if deposited by a flood? Did the author really go to a quarry, canyon, or cliff and look? His explanation is that all the big animals ran to the top of the hills! Apparently this book is still being published, but its bias and lack of rigor are obvious. But Christians don't have to abandon their faith to accept modern evidence. Many books such as \\"Saving Darwin - How to Be a Christian and Believe in Evolution\\" by Karl W. Giberson are rationale as well as spiritually inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"You MUST Read this Book!","review":"Wow! This is a mesmerizing, evocative and sensual tale of a time gone by, as well as time today. It's set in South America and the US, but its real territory is the heart. How do we love? Why do we love? Whom do we love? The answers are spiced with recipes of food, decorum and (ahem) sex. This is unlike anything I've ever read -- you must read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lady, the Chef, and the Courtesan by Marisol","review":"I enjoyed the story line and the recipes and reading about traditions that differ from our country's. Reading about the grandmother, mother and daughter relation and their viewpoints and communicating with each other always makes for an interesting read. This year I plan to give The Lady, the Chef, and the Courtesan as gift to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader, beware","review":"It is possible to have an interesting book club discussion about this novel, the issues it raises of how women view themselves and how their society views them. However, readers should be aware that this book contains several extended and very explicit scenes of men engaging in oral sex with the two protaganists, Pilar and Gabriella. Supposedly these experiences were pivotal moments in these women's personal lives. Perhaps. But not only are these scenes jarring, they are clumsily written - much closer to my idea of pornography than Latin American sensual literary tradition. A disappointing read, for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"I registered for and received this as a gift when I was pregnant with my first son and I was very disappointed in it. In order to use it, it has to be attached to the car seat's carrier bar, which is supposed to be folded down while you're driving. So, you can't use it while the car seat is in the car. And to use it while the baby is in his seat while you shop is just frustrating. The thing won't stay in place. I tried using it a few times and now it's just sitting in my trunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not what I ordered","review":"The picture and description online is nothing like the product I received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the stroller but not for use in the car!!!","review":"By all means use this on your stroller or on your carseat while not in the car!Items added to your carseat are not recommended by any carseat manufacturer as they were not tested with the seat. These are called after-market products. In addition to that reason, please read your carseat manual to determine proper positioning of the handle for vehicle travel. The carseats are only tested with the handle in the position noted in the manual. In the event of a crash, a handle in the wrong position could break off and injure the baby or another occupant of the vehicle.Buckle up safely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"8 months old and still loves it","review":"This toy has been one of the best gifts we received!! At first (anound 2 months) our daughter would just look at it, and would quiet down if she was fussing and we played the music. Eventually she started spinning the mirror and ball to entertain herself. Now she uses the teething part and can push the button on her own to soothe herself on long car rides. I give the toy two enthusiastic thumbs up!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud, Annoying and not safe","review":"I received this as a shower gift and thought it would be a cute toy for my daughter, but stopped using it soon after. I had it hung from her car seat and later her carriage but found the music to be loud and annoying. I stored it with her toys for occasional use and one of the pieces that hangs down broke off leaving a sharp edge. I discontinued use for safety reasons. Also, when the batteries run out, they cannot be replaced. Don't buy this product for your child. It should be recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure it WORKS before you leave store","review":"I got this for my baby shower. The buttons never worked though. And there is no batteries to change so I had to take it back. I decided not to exchange it for another, just in case the batteries die too soon or something. Made me weary. Also when I tested another one, they sounds it makes are pretty annoying. I decided to buy the Lamaze Link A long friends instead and Just LOVE them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with Painted Toys","review":"Have any of you experienced problems with the paint rubbing off on this product? If so, please let me know at tali@iwon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrified of it!!!","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was 3 months old and attached it to her carrier thinking it would give her something to look at. She was terrified of it so i took it off and waited till she was older. I tried again at 5 months, terrified.Again at 7 months 8 months 9 months, still terrified..Now she's 15 months and will toss it back at me when i take it out. What is it? The music? the triangle face of the toy? I don't know, she just doesn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my flowers in Toledo, Or","review":"Very colorful pictures with a great story line. One book that when my children were young returned to many, many times. Any time I need a gift to give to a new parent or a young child this is one I always return to.My youngest is 24 years and I still remember this book just about word for word."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful gem","review":"\\"Fukai Mori\\" by Do As Infinity is one of those rare songs from an anime that works outside of the show. In my honest opinion, it is the best end theme from the series \\"Inu-Yasha\\"; the moment I heard this song I fell in love. You don't need to understand a word of Japanese to appreciate beautiful music."},{"rating":"1","title":"it gets warm","review":"It gets takes about 10 minutes to get medium warm even when it is set at the highest temperature setting. It never gets hot. I think that it has some sort of timer limitation because it seems to cool off after 20 minutes or so even if I leave it at the highest temperature setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard","review":"I bought a 12x15 inch Kaz SoftHeat heating pad in December 2007. On 12/07/2008 the electrical cord unexpectedly broke at the junction of the cord and the blue stress reliever, shorted out, and began sparking. Fortunately, I was not shocked or burned. The pad had seen daily use due to a back condition, but it was not abused. I have contacted Kaz for a refund. The materials used in the pad appear to be inferior and I won't buy any more of their products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice heating pad","review":"Nice heating pad. It gets HOT if you want it to, has 4 heat settings, is a dry or moist heating pad, and it auto-shuts off after you've turned it on. (This is a big feature for me because I sometimes sleep with it. Yeah, I know you're not supposed to do that). It also has a control that is very faintly illuminated, making setting it in the dark a snap.The cover material is soft as well. This is my second model of this heating pad as my first one gave up the ghost after about 3 years of moderately heavy use.My only real gripe with this heating pad is that where the power cord enters the heating pad has kind of a wide and somewhat sharp edged plastic flare to it. Not a huge deal but it can poke you somewhat, particularly if you're trying to sleep with it. I will either end up *carefully* trimming the sharp edges (being careful to stay away from the wires) or putting a piece of tape over them.Having said that, this is a good product and well worth your consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"fire hazard","review":"I had this item for about 6 months, using it for a stiff back and shoulders. The automatic shut off failed (or something else went wrong) and the electrical housing started to melt. Fortunately I was next to it and smelled the wires burning and was able to unplug it. By this time the heating pad and switch were too hot to touch. It really freaks me out knowing this thing could have burned down my house if I hadnt been paying attention. BUYER BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS HEATING PAD","review":"The auto shut-off feature is ridiculous. I try to \\"pre-heat\\" the heating pad so that it will be ready in a few minutes but by the time I go to use it, it has already shut off. In addition, if I am using the damn thing, it shuts off way too soon for my tastes. Maybe I simply missed the \\"feature\\" but it's awful and should be made FAR MORE CLEAR. I'll have to buy another heating pad cause this is useless. But it won't be a \\"SoftHeat\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Older Model is Better","review":"I bought this after giving my older model to a family member...and I'm not impressed because it doesn't get as hot as my older model did and as a result doesn't provide me the relief that I need. I like the simple, and easy to use design but I am probably going to end up returning it because it doesn't get half as warm as my older model, even on the highest setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Automatically shuts off after 1 hour","review":"The write-up on this SoftHeat Plus heating pad makes no mention of a \\"New\\" feature that automatically shuts the pad off after 1 hour. I specifically wanted one that did NOT have an auto-shutoff timer. Damn!Back it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"Bought this product at a store. It did not work and the store will not take it back. This is a horrible product avoid at all cost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Heating Pad","review":"Although this heating pad is not inexpensive, it is very cheaply made. I have a lower back problem and wanted to use it while I sat on my couch. However, regardless of what I did, the heating pad unit inside the cover bent over on itself in the middle on the long side so that I ended up having a heating pad only about 6 inches wide. In addition, one whole end looks like it was wadded up into a ball and it will not flatten out at all making that end useless. The resulting heating pad is 6 inches by about 14 inches. I hesitate to use the parts that I can't flatten because I am not sure from a safety perspective that the heating elements should be squashed together as they are. I have tried everything to get the heating pad to lay flat and contour around the sides of my back and nothing works. Although I have had it for only a few months, this heating pad is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't get hot","review":"I guess it's a safety feature to prevent people from burning themselves but this heating pad just gets mildly warm. It's a waste of money and the instructions says do not return to store. I will definately not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product did not work","review":"I purchased the product, used it for 2 days and it has not worked since. The compnay has yet to respond to my request for return, and Amazon excepts no liabilty. Needless to say I wasted money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This heating pad has four settings and I can usually put it at setting 2 or 3 and have a comfortable level of heat. It does have an auto-shut off, which is for safety, so I dont mind the inconvenience of having to press the button again every now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhealthy garbage stinks like plastic","review":"I can't believe no one is complaining about the powerful plastic smell it give off when cold, I can't imagine how bad it is when you heat the plastic up. When you breathe plastic fumes it gets directly in your blood.I can image this wrapped around my neck with my nose so close by.The plastic cover is stiff and will not bend to your body contours. Do not buy this get a softer non plastic one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Heating Pad EVER!","review":"Don't buy this garbage, it barely gets warm even on the highest setting! It was a total waste of money and I don't wish this piece of garbage upon no one else. It warms up (barely)then turns itself off. So I got NO relief from my knee pain from this item. Amazon is great I'm sending it back for a full refund. I will buy this item somewhere else. And this item isn't real cheap as it should be since it is defective!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking For A Better Translator","review":"This item is $42.99 at a local electronics store. Amazon's price is much better, but the product has shortcomings, so I returned it. It has a primitive screen and it lacks many useful phrases. It claims to have over 210,000 words and phrases, but it is not clear whether that is the number of words in any single language (which is the really relevant number), or whether it counts all the other languages' translations (in which case it multiplies the relevant number times the number of languages it offers). It also uses \\"button\\" batteries that I found to be expensive to replace. Other reviewers said they found other translators that are \\"1,000 times better\\" than this one. I would like to know which ones people have found to be better than this one, why they are better, how much they cost, and where they can be found. I am specifically looking for English/French in any available units."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK product - I've seen MUCH better.","review":"I thought the Franklin was an OK translator.

For fans only.","review":"This one did not age well. It's very poorly paced and so predictable it's difficult to watch. For collectors only, or people who want to see what you could get away with filming back in the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP LOOKING JUNK","review":"A g (!) rated variation of THE DEVILS and MARK OF THE DEVIL, with WILLARD also thrown in---all 1970s movies.very lackluster direction, almost amateurish look to this thing...a number of hammer horror movies are better.and donovan by this time was burnt out; no worthwhile music here from 1960s drippy hippy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for die-hard Donovan fans","review":"The year is 1349, and the people of Hamelin are building a cathedral in hopes of warding off the Plague. The Burgermeister is happily planning the marriage of his daughter to the Barron's son (John Hurt), and a band of actors and a piper (Donovan) come to town.I expected this 1972, Donovan movie to be a hippy-dippy, rock fairy tale, but I was way off. It's dreary and pointless, with a completely forgettable script and soundtrack. The film focuses on the Burgermeister's money problems, and the Piper story is almost an afterthought; his piping-the-children-away doesn't even merit a comment.Donovan has no discernible acting talent or screen presence, mostly plays a modern guitar, and is a minor character. Top-billed Jack Wild, so likable in \\"Oliver!\\" plays a disabled apprentice, but he is well-past his boyish-prime and adds nothing to the story. Both children and adults will probably be bored by this cheap misfire."},{"rating":"1","title":"stick to the old school end of the market, go onyx!","review":"dissapointing to say the least, this doesn't do justice to the homies, this was a difficult album to find and i wish i'd never bothered."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite now!!!!","review":"When I started reading this book, I just knew it was going to end up on my favorite list.

Two simple cowboys trying to live a simple life with complex issues. The sex is pretty steamy but flows naturally with the plot; always a plus for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this novel. The characters engaged way too early in the book.I found myself confused about which character was which because of how fast the author had the characters involved with each other. It was difficult to care about the two leads and I ended up putting the book down and not finishing it at all. Perhaps I will pick it up again some day but for now- I cannot care enough about the characters or story to finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cowboys in Love","review":"Two cowboys find love on the open range and must overcome everyday issues so they can be together, happily ever after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really excellent love story","review":"This book has enjoyable characters and a poignant love story. It's not overly sappy or formulaic, even though boy gets boy in the end. The main characters are adults, with adult baggage, trying to make a life together. My only complaint is the 'cowboyese'. The author seems to think cowboys do not use personal pronouns, which is odd.Anyway, I couldn't put this book down. I cried at the painful places in their relationship where they hurt one another and I was thoroughly satisfied by the end. Plus, the sex scenes were HOT.Buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"...Wow...","review":"This was my first read by Chris Owen but it won't be my last. I wasn't so sure about this book at first because the first half was basically gay porn. Since I'm a woman I thought this just wasn't for me but I hate not to finish something I start so I forged on. Thank God I did! The relationship between Tor and Jake took me through so many emotions I was a wreck by the end of the book. Their connection was so intense, and Owen pulles you in so deep, that when they went through their heartbreak you felt it right along with them. I damn near cried twice and I'm not the teary kind. I finished this book over a week ago and I still can't get it out of my head. It's that intense. I didn't really like Broke Back Mountain because who wants to go through all that boredom (too much sheep hearding) just to have a sad ending. This is the book that should have been made into a movie. It was ten times better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"really?","review":"For the first half of the book, i would say was all about sex! I got tired of it, i thought i had bought a porn book (if that exists) i was really bored and had to shuffle through the pages, it felt that every other page was about sex, the last part of the book, the actual story was OK, not what i expected of the writer... sorry but if i wanted a porno i would of rented one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic...in Both Good and Bad Ways","review":"I was awake till one this morning, finishing this book. Great romance and only a little incredible (superhuman sexual stamina and a just-a-bit-more-tolerant-than-realistic worldview). Perhaps because of my own history (none with cowboys, alas), I sometimes thought I heard the offscreen voice of a couples therapist, whispering cautions to our very hunky protagonists about passive-agression and honest communication. A great read, my caveats and cavils notwithstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat little gadget","review":"I recently purchased the Rio 500 to download books for a long international trip. When I got the product (through audible.com), I was pleasantly surprised by the small size and streamline look. The instructions (or lack thereof) leaves little to be desired,however. It was pretty easy to set things up in retrospect but at the time I had some trouble figuring out how to use the software and the actual mp3 player itself. I was happy to be able to download nearly 28 hours of audio books into my player. Like everyone else had mentioned already, the earphones are terrible. I couldn't hear the player even at the loudest volume on the plane so I had to get a new set of earphones for the return trip and that worked like a charm. I haven't yet downloaded music yet but I'm looking forward to doing so as I've been reading that the quality is excellent.

The Audio Manager is a pain to use as quite a few steps are required to transfer each piece of music. Facility being the watchword of the Rio, this seems a bit of a shortcoming in the software design department. Also, I have not yet been able to transfer 2 hours of music from any source to the Rio. One hour and forty minutes is the most I've been able load before I reach the saturation point of 64megs.

Of course they do not have a tech support you can call. So after a lot of e-mails I was allowed to return the product and got it back after 3 weeks. It was fine for about 2 month and then the same thing happened. In summary this is a bad product manufactured by a terrible company with bad tech support. Don't make the mistake to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like this product","review":"I find this product too expensive you should be able to get an MP3 player that has a gig of space on it for the same price.

Then nothing showed up and I could not even turn it on or off.

There are misspellings, awkward punctuations, and improper spacing of sections. They even are missing several of the last few pages of the book, which is utterly inexcusable. This version was hard to read. They say you can't judge a book by it's cover, but this I think this plain book cover is totally indicative of the effort that went into printing this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book in the series","review":"I loved this book & read it straight through. At a dog training symposium, the dog trainers are dropping like flies. Rachel & Dash work undercover in this whodunit. With lots of twists & turns, the story kept me guessing right up until the very end. Woven into the story is info about various training methods, plus entertaining grumblings from the various trainers. Having spent a good deal of time with people in the dog world, I enjoyed the personalities of the dog trainers and found that they shared many of the same aggravating traits of the dog-fanatics who I have met through the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A Hell of a Dog is another one of the terrific Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries.Love her stories and style, book was a very good price, arrived quickly, excellent product and seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caught in Atlanta","review":"This is a wonderful story based on the true life of a young girl. The author has taken Sallie Clayton's diary and turned it into an account of life before, during, and after the Civil War.The only problem is the long footnotes. Some of these notes take up most of the page and tell boring historical information. Sometimes, it helps set up the plot. At other times, it's annoying and makes me want to throw the book against the wall...I say you should read this book if you want to look inside the life of a Civil War woman, or if you just want to learn more about life during the Civil War...either way, it's a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Pumpkinhead finally gets a starring role","review":"This book gives a major role to Jack Pumpkinhead, a character who never really had one in the Baum books. In this story, Jack must test the capacity of his pumpkin seed brains, and he really does come up with some clever ideas. With the help of the Red Jinn (who becomes a more important character in later books), he eventually manages to save all of Oz from a restless and ambitious baron. As is usual for Oz books, this one contains a lot of clever new creations, including an Iffin, a baron with a never-ending beard, and a runaway Christmas tree intent on finding new ornaments. There are also many new magical items, and some well-written sequences, including the description of the main characters' entrance into the fortress city of Baffleburg. While not one of the best or most important Oz books, it is definitely a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, tell me not again","review":"Horrid, horrid and ghastly that Amazon would literally scan and self-produce a book and then sell it as the original item. I have been looking for any of Ruth Thompson's Oz books for years and finally succumbed to buying at Amazon.. thinking that I would finally get to hold such an item... I was fooled, this is a mock-job and a bad one at that. The cover graphics are blurry, the inside back cover even mentions the exact date of my purchase and the words \\"Lexington KY\\"....

Awsome rappers like D-Shot, W.C., UGK, Eightball, MJG, 3X Krazy, Celly Cel, Tela, A-1, Mossie, E-40, B-Legit, Richie Rich and many mnay more drop some real bombs.

It is written on an adult level, reminiscent of an era when DC was still mysterious.I'm a resident of DC, and this book reminds me of the Jimmy Stewart movie \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\" not for the story line, but because even though this story was set decades ago, written decades ago, it could have been written today. DC absolutely never changes.Read this book for a higher-level \\"West Wing\\" from the congressional side.

I quickly realized that the politics of the novel only made up about 1/4 of the story. The other 3/4 were used to describe the love affairs of the characters.

Not that it was a bad book, or that it occupied countless volumes of my time. Rather, it was an easy read, one that went by quickly but did not leave many lingering afterthoughts in its wake.As would be the fashion, bits and pieces of this book are to be incorporated in the following 12, each overlapping a small amount. I initially ordered the first six of the series and intend to read through them; I hope that the intrigue grows, or even, appears. Like other books of a series, though, I'm hoping this is just a lead-in to much better material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and over advertised.","review":"The story in and of itself is somewhat interesting, yet it's nothing to really look forward to. It's fairly basic, showing most of what Kindred do, not just Toreador. The other downside of the book, is the length. It's so short that nothing really goes into much depth, and you get a little overview of everything, but never get into anything. It's a good book if you're bored and have nothing else to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor characters saying poor dialog","review":"Basically it's a book to set up the 12-book plot. Only a very few of the mainly peripheral characters are interesting. If you're looking for a better White Wolf vampire novel, try the Masquerade of the Red Death trilogy. I'll admit that there were some good scenes though, but for what was told it should have been cut down to a short story. I'm just hoping the series gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite up to mediocre.","review":"If you enjoy the Vampire roleplaying game, and don't object overmuch to a book that is sloppily written and edited, and that has no real ending (granted, to give it its due, it at least doesn't end on a cliffhanger, as so many \\"series\\" books do these days; the end just sort of trails off, but it doesn't really give a feeling of completion) you might enjoy this book. The characters aren't bad, and the plot is tolerable. But great literature this certainly is not, nor even especially good genre fiction. An okay quick read, nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story...","review":"I loved the story. The Toreador as they were meant to be seen. The writing was so so in places.

You have to remember, this is the first book in the clan novel series, and as the first book, I think it does a good job of setting up the plot and the characters.

Setite, Gangrel, and Ravnos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deader than a staked vampire.","review":"There is only one word I have to describe this book...boring. It was slow right from the beginning. Every single character in the book is 2 dimensional and under developed. The author had a concept when he wrote this book and the concept was sterotype. There is so little development in both story and characters that it staggers the mind. I am hoping that the second book will be much better. Most rpg adaptaions are not very good, and this author didn't want to break that tradition it seems. A pity as the Toreador are a very interesting clan. If you are a die hard vampire fan then give it a read, if not pick up something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting through it is required...","review":"Well, quite frankly, this novel wasn't very readable. It does its job of setting up the rest of the series adequately. That's about it. The other novels in the series are all superior to this one. One just had to set everything up, and this one drew the short stick. You have to read this one in order to understand the series of events, though, so this is a must read if you want to read the rest. Just get through it, and I promise the rest of the series picks up tremendously."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting look at the Clan.","review":"If you are fan of the World of Darkness you will enjoy this interesting look at the world of Kindred Politics. The characters are deep and very real. The only problem I have with the book is that it wasn't long enough; there were a few unanswered questions. I do understand that this is an ongoing story, however it would have been nice to have some closure with some of the characters. I enjoyed it and look forward to the upcoming novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad start for Storyteller","review":"I find it somehow ironic that a company who call their Game Referees Storytellers should have such a thin grasp on the meaning of the term. Typically one would assume that the first book in a series would be used as a hook to draw the reader into the world being presented.Clan Novel Toreador fails miserably in this respect. There is little, if any, character development and the idea of plot seems lost on the author. The Book never even graduated to painfully bad... at best it was boring.I will endeavor to struggle with this series in hopes that the other 'Storytellers' in this series can manage to live up to the term, though I dread the upcoming Clan Novel Malkavian as it seems to be regurgitated by the same 'author'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally inappropriate trailers","review":"Leave It To Beaver is in my top 3 favorite television programs of all time - so I was exited to be able to buy the whole first season in one set.However, and this is a huge however, Universal stuck some highly offensive ads for other television collections and movies on the front.Provocative television programs and Brokeback Mountain with Leave It To Beaver? Who in this perverted world makes decisions like these?After just receiving it in the mail from Amazon, I put it on for my grandsons to watch.

A tiny regret for this collection and its companion season two for me is seeing it on saleand NOT buying it. I was watching my pennies around the Thanksgiving holiday when I am sure I saw it at Target for 14.99. And of course, Target is famous for carrying product a short while and then you never see it again. Now Leave It To Beaver is priced at 37.99 and I can't understand why. It is after all a 50 year+ television show. I think perhaps a warehouse filled with DVDs went up in flames somewhere.

Especially since the show is becoming increasingly hard to find on TVLand's cable network. However, I would like to know what administrative idiot thought it would be a good idea to put trailers for classic horror TV shows such as Kolchak and Amercian Gothic as well as commercials for R rated films such as My Summer of Love on at the beginning of the DVD before the menu comes on?

Universal has several other sets with four movies, movies which last shorter than the films in this set, but those sets don't have double sided discs. Shame on you, Universal, for giving us this inferior dvd set. If I had known there was a flipper disc in this set, I would've just bought the individual dvds of Little Rascals and Casper, and forgotten about Flipper and Leave It To Beaver, which I didn't want in the first place.

Now that there is only one week to go I'm a little apprehensive about buying it so fast. I've bought other TV series on DVD and was pleased with what I saw. Will the same be true for this set?For one thing, the discs are going to be double-sided. I have never seen this on other series I have bought in the past. Movies, yes but TV series no. I have to wonder if the quality is going to suffer because of it.A bigger question: Since the discs are double-sided, does it mean they were trying to cut down on space? That might mean the episodes are cut.Sadly, if the episodes are cut I'll have to stick to watching the reruns on TV. Universal knows the series is popular, give the fans of it what they deserve, you know we'll buy it.Uncut, clear picture episodes are what I would like, extras would be even better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made and lots of problems","review":"I was really disappointed in this package.

The first season was probably the best and has almost 40 episodes, however, as soon as I put the disk in all I could focus on was the grainy fuzz that's like watching a tv with bad reception; the picture detail is slightly sharper than cable broadcasts, but the overall quality is much worse (not what I expect from DVD). Universal execs and management who released this series should be ashamed to treat customers this way.

I haven't had any problem with hundreds of other television shows and movies I've bought, manufactured by Paramount or Sony. Stop cutting corners, Universal. And double-sided DVDs? Give me a break! I'm going to buy other discs from other companies before I even think about buying the subsequent seasons of Leave It to Beaver--at least until Universal fixes this problem.

The Munsters, the classic Monster films of the 30s and 40s, and now Leave it to Beaver. I agree with the previous reviewer -- Double sided discs are a pathetic excuse in this day and age, especially for a show that kids will undoubtedly be loading and unloading from the DVD player themselves. Just look at the recently released Adventures of Superman for an beautfiful example fo how a classic television show from the 50s should be released -- singlesided picture discs, commentaries, bonus features.

Hey, I know the picture will never be perfect, but DVDs are almost always better than home copied videos. I object to the two sided DVD format! Disc One froze up right out of the box, even after running it through a DVD cleaner. The very fragile nature of this format practically guarantees future viewings will be worse, even with the most careful handling. Outch!! The good news is that the Amazon replacement service is fast, free, and rates a Five Star. So, order without fear. Maybe your copy will be the one good cop in a bad town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Universal---Now on to Season Two","review":"I've waited for this set for years. My family loves it, and the real \\"plus\\" here is that we have never seen the first two seasons, so the Season One episodes in this set are totally \\"new\\" to us. The restoration looks pretty good. (We watch it on a progressive scan player attached to a hi-def flat screen CRT monitor.) I've seen others quibble about the use of dual sided discs, and about the lack of chapter stops, but those \\"problems\\" are just minor inconveniences. Each episode is only 24-5 minutes so chapter stops are probably not critical unless you watch with numerous interruptions. The bottom line is that we finally have this on DVD.

But for the ones who are REALLY interested in Philosophy the urge to go on for the rest of the book is irresistable. As you get closer to the indefinite end, you examine your view of life.

It seemed like the kids would have some innocent fun. It's been a week. I have already grown sick of chicken-dancing. The other day I accidently hit the button and he began dancing the chicken thing for the billionth time.

We saw it at the store and I played it to entertain while Daddy finished talking - she LOVED it. We put that on her \\"get me\\" list. She loves it.

Smile on!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a naughty toy!","review":"My son of 12 years old didn't accept elmo at first. But then he started getting taught by Elmo. Taught to do drugs, swear, and play tennis. If the people at the toy making company would look more at this, they would stop it with the subliminal messages when he says \\"Lets break dance\\". But all I hear is \\"lets go smoke a big fatty\\". IT'S HORRIBLE! In fact, I'm going to go on a sueing spree now. Who's with me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"My 12 month old son received this toy as a birthday present and has always LOVED elmo. Soon after he played with this toy, he started to imitate Elmo's head movement. The reviews say that the head movement is adorable, but in fact it teaches kids to roll their head in a 360 degree movement. Needless to say, a 12 month old who has just started to walk is rolling his head all day and this causes him to fall and hurt himself!!!... This is a terrible toy for a new walker/runner!!!... Forget about buying it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont do it","review":"I got this thing with thoughts of how much fun the chicken dance is at weddings and oktoberfests.

My son thinks it is fun, but it has little educational value. It is a fun little toy, but not a favorite! My son gets so much more out of his wood puzzles, or dancing to his music CDs. If a gift or on sale, then a fun addition, but don't pay too much, as realize it's value is limited."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son Loves this toy","review":"My son really enjoys this toy. He plays with it all day long dancing with elmo. I have read other reviews about this toy breaking but I have not had the same experience. My son throws elmo, smashes him on the floor, drops him etc and our elmo is still going strong. This used to be his favorite toy until he got Touch my toes Pooh and that is a toy that I can not leave the house without. If chicken dance elmo is not your thing try that toy it is similar but a little less annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas hit","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter(6) but I felt she was a little old for it till my nephew (2) was playing with it and loved it, she then showed more interest.

When I pressed Elmo's feet and I instantly fell in love with it, personally. My son was amazed with it as well, he was 5 months old at the time. At first, I didn't want to get it for him because it says 18+ months, I decided to get it for him anyway. He likes it and he'll grow into it next year. It's a great toy!! The only drawback in it I wish it does more, and it will probably will get annoying after a while, other than that it's cute and definatly worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard to find","review":"this toy is older.

I was thrilled to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicate toy, not for younger children???","review":"Although this toy is very, very cute, it is not durable. Elmo's head no longer moves. It does make a loud clicking noise. The mechanism that is supposed to move his head must still be working, but we have tried everything to put the head back into the right track. This happened the first week we had it! A two year old broke it - maybe if your child is older it would be ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to take it home","review":"I bought three as an investment.

Installation went fine and the device works almost as expected. The problem is that Slingmedia, without notifying customers or potential costomers has downgraded functionality.The new devices (and the old models which incorporate new firmware) now utilize an encrypted stream. This breaks programs such as \\"At Large Recorder\\" which let me record my TV material for my review at a time of my choice.Since I travel abroad a lot, I have a great need to be able to place and time shift. Sitting in a hotel in Tokyo at 6:00p.m., I'm not much interested in watching what is on in the US at 3:00a.m.!I'd advise looking at other solutions.

Everything worked just fine until August 2011. Everytime the power went out in the house we had to completely reset the Slingbox which also involved resetting the Sling and router IP addresses. Resetting the box is incredibly convuluted and multi-stepped. And then there is the really big problem that renders the whole thing completely useless...to reset the Slingbox you have to be IN YOUR HOUSE...which is impossible if you're utilizing the Slingbox to view programming while traveling. Customer Service is via a community help page and/or FAQ's unless, of course, you've paid to talk to the Sling people(approx $39). I get the feeling Slingmedia did something to their software in Aug of 2011 that has caused this problem but as it's nearly impossible to get in touch with someone to resolve the matter the Slingbox will get packed away in the useless electronics box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slingbox Tuner","review":"It was easy to install and works fine with my Netgear Router..

Then the connectivity to the box would be lost.Thanks to the hassle-free return policy of Amazon, I was able to have it easily returned for a replacement. The second one has been working flawlessly. The video quality is not the greatest, but still quite enjoyable. The audio portion is clear and interrupt-free, which contributes a lot to the overall experience.My only gripe is that the Slingplayer software does not allow recording. It seems that the only way to do time-shifting with any version of Slingbox is to get the At-Large Recorder from Applian Technologies."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an innovation!!!","review":"I studied this item a bit before purchase and was prepared to takle a few problems with installation, especially with Vista....I figured on a call to tech.support.

I just put in the finder code into the software on my other computer and it was up and running.I'm watching the NFL and local news over 1,200 miles from home.

I cooked the lemon rice which was good. Also I enjoyed the butter chicken even though it didnt have the same color shown in the picture. My complaint so far is that the cashew chicken with black spices recipe was truly terrible and inedible. I have never before cooked something I would not eat. First problem with this recipe was that it calls for too much oil and too much water! The second problem is that it took so long to cook something that tasted so bad. I hate to waste food but that entire dish ended up in the trash. I dont know if I will cook from this book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camellia Panjabi knows her stuff","review":"This is an exceptional authentic Indian cookbook for those who are willing to invest the time for the proper outcome and want to expand their repertoire.

The illustrations are first-rate. This book is not for those who want to quickly throw something together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water, water everywhere!

Is life utterly boring for them now?Unfortunately, while failing to answer these questions, Smith writes tediously about himself and his life as a boy in the sixties.

You would be much better off with a copy of Michael Collin's 'Carrying the Fire'. There you will enjoy superb writing and a more interesting story. After reading Michael's book, Apollo 11's flight will stay with you for life, as though you'd been there. I can't say anything of the sort for 'Moondust'.

However, it turns out this is much more about what the author thinks about the space program, the 60's, and pretty much everything else, than the astronauts. If I wanted to read a personal memoir on this topic, I'll read one written by an astronaut. Some people may enjoy the \\"everyman author puzzling his way thru a topic\\" format, but to me, it's waste of time and annoying. I mean, a book about the space program written by a guy so clueless that he thinks the moon always shows the same face to the earth because it doesn't spin?! Please. I did learn two things that I didn't know already: 1) the LM computer only had 37k memory, and 2) Alan Bean has a wonderful outlook on life. Oh, and one more thing - that Andrew Chaikin (A Man on the Moon) is a much better space author than Andrew Smith.

I have never experienced such an abysmal failure rate for any product in my life. Out of 7 discs, 5 failed. After that, I couldn't be bothered trying any more. I had been using a batch of TDK discs before, but only switched to the Maxell because I couldn't write on the TDKs! Bad move - I had not a single problem in 10 TDK discs, unlike the 5 out of 7 failures with Maxell. I will NEVER buy another Maxell product again, and I would strongly urge anyone else to do likewise. Incidentally, my DVD recorder is a Panasonic, not some fly-by-night job no-one's ever heard of."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot recommend them","review":"I have been a longstanding, loyal Maxell customer when it comes to blank audio cassette tapes and VHS tapes. Maxell's tapes were the best.I carried this loyalty over to Maxell's line of blank +R DVDs. I stupidly bought spindle packs three times, despite a large burn failure rate. After this third purchase and suffering a large failure rate again, in TWO different burners, I must sadly say that I will buy them no longer. I got an email back from tech service from the manufacturer of one burner who said they are simply not recommended for use in their recorder.Now, if you have had different experiences, more power to you. But be aware that many people are experiencing poor results with this product. The two brands of burners I have tried them in are Cyberhome, and Memorex Burners. Neither have had any problem with most other brands of blanks, just the Maxell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good TV Cart","review":"I like this cart. I was having difficulty finding a black TV cart that would hold my DVR, DVD and other items and fit nicely inside of a closet with french doors. This cart fits perfectly.

Overall a very good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Burke, but could have left this one on the shelf","review":"I've read just about every book James Lee Burke has written -- from his Dave Robicheaux series to Cimmaron Rose and others. I've loved them all and eagerly await new ones. This is the first time I've read one of his books that I didn't like it. I couldn't connect with the characters, didn't bond with them, didn't find their situation to be compelling to read about. It took all I could do to finish it. It certainly wouldn't dissuade me from reading anything else he writes (although there isn't much left that I haven't read...) but this is not a great book, not up to his usual exploration of characters or his colorful description of surroundings. There was not a likeable character in the book, nor was I able to get a good visual for the surroundings. Skip it if you love Burke, you'll only be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What paradise?","review":"I got this at a garage sale, and there is no mystery why it ended up there. I held out hope that something -- anything -- would happen to either connect all the separate storylines or make me care about the characters, but I finally had to skim the last 100 pages when it became painfully obvious that the whole book would be a litany of sordid, horrible things happening to characters I didn't really care about. No one comes close to paradise in this book -- everyone starts miserable and goes downhill from there. Its only redeeming benefits are that it offers a window to race relations in the 60's and lets us see that James Lee Burke went through a Hemingway phase early in his career, either accidentally or on purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.......","review":"I typically love Burke's books, especially those featuring Dave Robicheaux, so I thought surely I would like this one as well even without Dave.

Being able to download the songs instead of recording is great. However, the lack of storage space and the prohibitive price of memory expansion is what convinced me to buy a Sony Minidisc recorder instead. The compression techonology used by Sony gives quality equivalent to over 320kb/s. Using that kind of quality on a Rio would result in the amount of music being ridiculously low. Trust me.

Would the same 12 songs over and over really keep you entertained on a road trip? I suggest you save up for the HanGo Personal Jukebox or a similar item (Creative Labs is coming out with a big one for less), which will hold a good 1500 songs- at the very least, more than 12! The software also is terrible with Rio and it seems to be a lucky buyer thing... half the time they break after working fine for a month or so. In conclusion, wait for the next generation of MP3 players or pay the price to experience the future now, but don't waste your time on something that will be like the 8-track compared to a CD player in a few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good player, terrible company","review":"The player is great, small, light and easy to use. You must either use a Mac (works great with iTunes), the Riositude program (freeware, google for it)or win98. I use mine whenever Im outside:running, yardwork whatever. You'll need to replace the earbuds but if you buy a used one do you really want to use someone else's earbuds? The serial number will rub off so write it down as another reviewer suggested.Also, if you buy a used one, make sure you get the USB cable. It's proprietary and you can't get it anywhere.

The device is small and so easy to use. The all in one volume control may confuse some, but it works exactly like the casiopea, you can both select and scroll with one knob. I agree with other reviews the software that comes with the rio is not very good, just get download musicmatch and it is cake. The sound quality is perfect, just get good headphones.

Not for me. The Rio comes with no written instructions and the software \\"HELP\\" is next to useless. A myriad of small irritating problems such as why when I check off only one or two songs to transfer do I get a message that the rio doesn't have enough memory available. The only clue being that mysteriously all songs on transfer list are now checked. Probably most of the issues I had could have been easily resolved but to make a long story short I threw in the towel and gave mine to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great MP3 player!!","review":"I searched around for an awful long time trying to find the best MP3 player to buy, for the best price. The Rio 500 is hands down the best MP3 player I've ever seen. Sure, you can get a Nomad Jukebox if you want to listen to a lotta music at once, but this MP3 player can hold a lot. I thought 64 MB wouldn't be enough for the songs I wanted to take with me. I was wrong. I have 13 songs PLUS an Audible.com audio book store on just 64 MB of space. Considering the low price of this player, getting a 64 MB SmartMedia card is not so expensive. The size is perfect, the shape is perfect. I am kinda tired of these MP3 players that are silly shapes. I know that an MP3 player does not require a specific case shape, unlike a CD player or cassette player, but they could stick to a simple rectangle shape for once. If you are new to MP3 players and want a simple, effective player, get the Rio 500, it is da bomb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Nomad II instead.","review":"I owned a Rio 300, and after awhile, it became very sensitive that the slightest touch would stop it from playing. So I exchanged it for the Rio 500un, which worked great til the next day when trying to download songs into it, the Rio 500 went dead. After getting a new Rio 500, the same thing happened after two weeks. Technical Support said that if the battery is low while downloading files, the player dies. Apparently, 2 out of 50 calls Tech Support recieves are due to this problem. Don't waste your time with the Rio 500, instead spend the extra money and get a sturdier and more reliable MP3 Player that also has many extra features, the NOMAD 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newest Firmware Upgrade Compatible With 128mg Ext. Cards","review":"I won't rehash most of the comments hear except to say that I am generally pleased with this player. The sound is good, though it lacks some punch and detail, and it can be a little cranky about handling files consistently (skips or forgets bookmarks, etc.).Mostly, I want to let folks know that the newest firmware upgrade (for free, available on the Rio website) allows the player to recognize 128 smartmedia cards. So currently I have 192 megs of music on my player! This alone makes this a very convenient player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, bad battery","review":"I recently purchased the Diamond Rio 500 just because I'm a \\"new gadget freak.\\" Upon opening it i immediately loved it. It's tiny enough to conceal and simply looks really \\"cool,\\" for lack of a better word. The software was easy enough to install, although the instructions are extremely vague. I had to try a couple of times before I even got the USB driver installed.The software is very easy to use and the USB connection allows for extremely fast music transfer.The 2 downfalls of the Rio 500, however, are, of course, the lousy ear buds, and the poor battery life. If you don't intend on changing the music often, then the battery life is just fine. However, if you like to have a little variety now and then, plan on purchasing a lot of AA's.I recommend this unit to anyone who always wants music with them but doesn't want the burden of having to carry around all their cd's or tapes in those big, clumsy cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"I've had this player for over a year now and all I can say is that it is extremely durable and a joy to listen to.

It never skips, the sound quality is excellent, and the features on the player offer enough playback options. I bought some Sony miniature headphones (MDR-W08) instead of using the included ones.The Rio software is relatively easy to use, although it could be more user friendly.

I use it when I go running. It is very light, has no moving parts so it won't skip, and can handle getting sweat on a little. I didn't need a multiple GB storage player, I just wanted something small I could take out to work out, and this is perfect. With an expansion card, it can hold a couple hours of music, which is more than enough.There is also support for it in Linux -- I got it, plugged it into my Linux box, and was off and running, very easy (the kernel module is in the 2.4.x series stock kernel, plus Hotplug for automagic USB support, and I have been playing with the graphical interface grio500, which can be found on SourceForge).Overall, no complaints, I am very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Player - Poor Software","review":"I've had mine for 2 years or more.

But for the price your paying for this, you could get a great Mini Disk player, and even plenty of discs for over 6,000 minutes of recording time with the same sound quality! Dont believe me? Goto the Mini Disc section and do the math! Even better, you can record mp3's onto the MiniDisk players, you can also record your voice, your playstation/N64/Dreamcast, VCR, TV, Radio, Tape, everything! I almost bought an mp3 player, and im glad i didn't. MP3's are too expensive compared to Mini-Disks, and if you look at the Mini Disk trend right now, its exactly like the CD trend 10 years ago. They are already making Mini Disk drives fro computers to store info. Just check out the Mini Disks before you buy this, trust me, you'll thank me. If you have any questions, email me, Ill answer them asap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hardware, Documentation and Software Needs Work","review":"Major gripes for the Rio500 seem to be headphones, software and Audible.com support. Just got mine in and immediately I updated the Rio500's firmware to 2.11 (it ships with 1.04) to allow for Audible.com support and support for 64MB flash cards. Next you must download Audible.com's AudibleManager - the software that ships with the Rio doesn't upload the Audible.com sound files themselves. The software (RioPort) was my biggest complaint... after I registered the 2.x version that comes with the Rio500 (gotta register the 2.x version FIRST), I upgraded to the 3.x version. Works okay... but some tracks seem to be getting stuck in the middle of downloading tracks to the MP3 player (RioPort just freezes up). Never tested the headphones... heard so many bad things about them... immediately ditched 'em and got a nice pair of Sony earbuds. Sounds great to me. Sound quality and hardware: very nice. Software and documentation: needs work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative to portable DC and tape players","review":"Have used the 500 for about three weeks. Had to email support a few times (because of the pathetic lack of documentation online or accompanying the player); response time varied from 24 to 48 hours, and instructions were clear and solved my challenges. Why can't they print this stuff up and put it on line or include it with the player? The 500 can hold more than the 60 minutes referred to by another reviewer. You determine the copy rate from the cd, and the download copy rate to the player -- and that will determine how many songs you'll get onto the player. The controls are simple and intuitive. I agree w/ previous comment about mesh holder and thanks for the tip for 'fixing' it. I find the software easy and intuitive to use, but it's certainly possible other software programs are even better. My only two complaints are: cost of addt'l memory and lack of documentation. I highly recommend the 500 - buy it now, and upgrade in a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUCKS!","review":"I just bought what I heard was an awesome mp3 player, what a crock!

The PMP500 still uses the flash memory cards for the extra storage. The removal of the parallel connector has been replaced with the new USB which offer transfer rates approximately 5 times faster than the parallel port. The new USB also offers cross platform compatibility but won't be able to connect to the older parallel ports, but an USB/parallel adapter (sold separately) can fix that.Besides holding more and being faster, it's more expensive. Plus, the extra cost of the 32 MB Card. But if you aren't in the poorhouse and prefer space, comfort, and easy setup to an extra hundred bucks, this prouduct is for you. And, if the economy continues at this rate, all electronics will go down, making the MP3 player the best of both worlds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete","review":"Whatever you do, do not make the mistake of buying one of these units today (10/2002) unless you are an antique dealer and you get a REALLY good price.I bought mine in April 2000 for around ...--worked great, good quality. I have not been able to get this unit to work with WinXP--I was using it with a Mac and SoundJam previously. An item as expensive as this with such a short technological life is shameful.Sonic Blue appears to have disowned the Rio500. They claim to have a USB driver for XP but it doesn't work.

It plays well and only takes one AA battery since it has no moving parts. That's the good part. Well....The problem lies in the fact that the manufacturer has dropped the ball on customer support. I have upgraded to Windows XP, just as most people have. Rio refuses to put out software which enables you to connect your Rio 500 to your computer via USB port if you have Windows XP. I have tried many solutions, including those found at Rio user sites, trying to come up with an answer to this. The outcome: the same songs are on the player for over a year.

One of these features that it lacks is that Rio has a lot of memory for a MP3 player these days, and it can only play 2 HOURS of songs with its onboard memory. After that, its $100 for a 1 hour (32mb) flash card. With CD's and MD's, the hour is for about $3. Also, there are not many different models to choose from, whoch is a drawback. There is also the problem of BATTERIES. Now, I have a suckie CD player, so I only get 6 hours every 2 batteries, but some CD players can accomnplish 50+ hours of CD playing on 2 batteries. 12 hrs/1 battery is pretty much outragous (thats why I need a new CD player).

The USB cable is useful, and even though it doesn't download as quick as advertised, you can get a drink or make a bathroom run in that short time.Okay here it is, THE SOFTWARE SUCKS! It installs quickly and effectively, but thats about all it does. It has a lousy harddrive search, it only recognize .mp3 extentions and its CD identifier takes too long (my connection went down while waiting). I have managed to get around this with Realjukebox 2.0 software. It records your CDs to your HD, has a more accurate CD identifier and integrates well with various MP3 players.

I already own the CDs and they aren't eating up space on my hard drive. Since the Rio only comes with enough memory to hold approximately one CD anyway, what's the point?I could load the Rio with MP3's found on the net, but what's to find?

For this price, you are MUCH better off buying a MiniDisc recorder from Amazon.com! (don't worry Amazon, you aren't losing any business) You can purchase blank MiniDiscs for $1.50 now, and that gives you much more then you get with the Rio for $100 in flash memory (the blank media that music is stored on in the Rio) So, in short, go with something like the Aiwa AM F70 MiniDisc Recorder, I guarentee you will thank me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've returned once, I'll need to return again...","review":"This MP3 was nice, when it worked.

The controls are intuitive once you get the hang of what each button does - especially the bookmark key which is VERY handy for transcribing music and the cool blue backlighting. I have deducted a star due to the non-existant manual which makes getting up and running with the machine a little harder and the poor quality headphones.

Get yourself a 128MB SmartMedia card...Now everyone should be giving positive reviews for this product..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Player, ... Software","review":"The Rio 500 is a great MP3 player. It has all the features I wanted, pretty good battery life, and is a perfect size.PROS:-Basic, easy to use interface.-Decent battery life, although not as long as the manufacturer claims.CONS:-I hate the software interface. It is slow, unstable and poorly designed. I suggest you use Windows Media Player instead to upload files to the device.-As of firmware version 2.15 (availible from ftp://ftp.s3.com/pub/multimedia/rio/rio500_firmware_215.exe), the player only supports additional smartmedia cards of up to 64mb, to give it 128mb of total memory. Although this is a decent amount, 128mb smartmedia cards have gotten a lot cheaper....-There is no Windows XP support with the included software. It will work with XP using 3rd party software, which, consequently, is better than the included software..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usless","review":"One star is gernerous for this useless book.

In fact, I use a child's fishing pole I bought from Walmart which is half the price of the Catfisher pole and lasts way longer.Cats love this and they get exercise while you get to lie on the couch.These ones are great because they're weighted properly so you can get a good cast on the pole. Others I've used are not heavy enough or the loop isn't very sturdy and breaks easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the real nasty stuff is missing!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Yes, this is a very sleazy WIP from Italian exploitation master Vincent Dawn, but don't record over your bootlegs just yet. Hopefully WPM will someday be released by Shriek Show or Blue Underground, because this DVD is cut to hell. A quick flashback near the end of the film even contains scenes that were trimmed from the source print. We shouldn't still have to put up with this crap in 2005! An exploitation movie without the exploitation is like porno without the penetration."},{"rating":"1","title":"R-RATED MORE LIKE PG","review":"Just finished watching this movie and all i got to say is that i see a lot more violence on a saturday morning cartoon show. the movie is so badly edited i couldn't follow the story the film transfer is crappy, all the blood and guts are cut from the movie, everytime there is an action scene there's this big jump in the film and sound. it was almost like watching an r-rated movie on primetime television. the worst part about it all is that this movie looks entertaining but because they cut everything out you can't tell. whoever is responsible should go to jail."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't deliver","review":"This movie is the sequel to caged woman but not as good. For a movie like this you would expect a reasonable amount of nudity etc.You will be disappointed like I was .

Male prisoners escape and take over the womans prison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre and slow moving","review":"Mediocre and slow moving. The filmmakers luck briefly into a couple of good scenes - well, they're too short to be called scenes, let's say a couple of good shots.

Sadly, I didn't catch his name, though from later reading I think it may have been Gabriele Tinti."},{"rating":"1","title":"You ve gotta hand it to the publicity boys....","review":"No one could ever say that \\" Womens Prison Massacre was a good film, but you have gotta hand it to the publicity boys. It seems obvious that the guys who designed the cover had never seen the movie. Made on a budget that would nt cover the cost of making a 2 minute TV comercial this film was just a complete bore. No graphic violence to speak of and the nudity, often the backbone of this kind of film, was also non existance. It could have been, should have been, and would have been a decent film if it had been handed to someone who knew what they were doing but I am afraid \\"Womens Prison Massacre\\" would even leave the \\"Raincoat Brigade\\" dozing in their seats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I give this a thumbs down --> if this were a school grade it would receive an F in all catagories.

Recommended by my healer, I read it as fast as I could. Written by the head of the Children of One, Jon Peniel, the book covers his experiences growing up, living at a hidden monastery in Tibet, and the teachings.The book gives a sense of urgency to following the spiritual path, as the end times are coming quickly. It goes into the beginning of the earth, how it was created, the souls that came before us, and answers many other life questions.It's 2 main lessons are connected to spirit (oneness) and unselfish love.

Simple truths can be so simple they are overlooked. The author brings to focus what we are here for. I was especially delighted to discover just what some of the lost Atlantean teachings are. All the references to ancient Atlantis were very exciting. I felt so uplifted reading this that now all my family is reading it too.

The supposed history is false. The \\"hidden monastery\\" is little better than an expansion of the centuries old belief in Shambhala. This is a damaging book written by a man with too much time on his hands, not enough intelligence, and a warped idea of the basic concepts of Buddhism (not to mention the total lack of understanding of Tibetan history).Save your cash, and skip this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many contradictions in the teachings","review":"The book may make sense, or even be enlightening for those who aren't familiar with Buddhism and Vedanta. In fact, the teachings presented in this book are taken from Buddhism and Vedanta. The only originality in the book is the story of Atlantis, which can only remain fictitious. There are big differences between Buddhism and Vedanta. When the author mixes teachings from both Buddhism and Vedanta, the book turns into a whirl of contradictions. If you want to follow true spiritual paths, look up Vedanta or Buddhism. This book may be a good read for those who aren't serious about spirituality, but those who seek spiritual enlightenment must disregard this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jon Peniel, YOU ARE MY CHAMPION, Thank You So Much!!!","review":"The message (teachings) in this book is so alive and written with such clarity that it brilliantly shines and awakens your inner being.

Apparently amazon.com exercises no editorial judgment of its reviews - after all, selling CDs, not objectivity, is amazon's goal. That makes it easy for you and/or your best buddy to make it seem as though your music is of 5 star quality. This album is a perfect example. The 5 star rating came from the same review sent in twice by the same person using an alias. \\"Best Instrumental Album Ever\\"? Sure, if you ignore the several thousand albums of New Age music which are infinitely better. Compare this to instrumental music by Mike Oldfield, Mehdi, Jean-Michel Jarre, Jesse Cook, Ottmar Liebert, Chris Spheeris, even Yanni, to name only a few, and you'll see that there is no comparison.

Started reading her in the Loveswept series and continue to this day. She has just the right touch of fantasy for my taste. And I_like_fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"The storyline in this book might have been interesting except that a mood was never successfully set. At one point, the heroine, Laura, describes Daniel, the hero, as \\"expressionless\\", enigmatic\\", and \\"showing barely more emotion than a sphinx\\". I found this to be true of all the characters. I had no sense of involvement in the lives of the players, with the possible exception of Alex who was more animated than the others but had a fairly minor role.I did not at all like the way in which Peter's murderer was revealed. But on the positive side, I never came close to identifying the murderer on my own.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled....","review":"What an unbelievable, messy hodge-podge of a book! A lot of characters to keep straight (even though there was a genealogical chart on the first pages) and if that weren't enough, a wimpy, \\"I'll-believe-anything\\" heroine to set your teeth on edge! Get this: She's implicated in a murder. Without hesitation, she calmly accepts an invitation to live at the murdered man's house and paint his grandmother's portrait! SURE! There should be no reason to doubt the sincerity of this family! Ick. A real waste of my reading time. Too bad. I kinda liked the hero but the heroine made me sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding Laura","review":"I have read many Kay Hooper novels and found them all interesting, particularly the \\"Shadow\\" series. That's why I read Finding Laura and was not disappointed. This romantic suspense story revolves around an antique mirror, a wealthy dysfunctional family, and murder. I did not figure out who did it early on as many books seem to divulge. I liked the original storyline and interesting characters. I would recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and confusing before getting to the conclusion","review":"With all the 5-star reviews this book received, I had to look at the title to confirm it was the same book I was reading. Because of all the murders that went uninvestigated and unpunished, this book was totally unbelievable. Peter's murderer came completely out of left field. This was a terrible book. The first of Hooper's that I've read the the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"After reading the hype about this novel in Romantic Times, I was sorely disappointed when I finally read it, in spite of an intriguing mystical plot twist.The hero and heroine did nothing to motivate me to root for them. She was dull and undistiniguished from a hundred other females in a hundred other books, and he was cold, distant, and lacked solidity. He seemed to me to be just a flat character on a flat page.Their relationship did not seem to develop or intensify.... one day they had sex, then they were in love and moving in together. Where's the intrigue, the slow build-up?As for the rest of the characters, wow! What a thoroughly unlikeable bunch! Not a single character elicited my sympathy. They were a bunch of spoiled, selfish, malicious, freaks with few redeeming qualities. I pity poor Laura.... why in the name of God would she want to marry into a family like that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and Well-Hidden Answers.","review":"Kay's book is fascinating, despite some of the negative comments. Keeping the reader from figuring out who committed the murders was masterfully done. I found very little to complain about in this piece, though reading tastes are so subjective, it's impossible to please everyone. Her characters were complex and highly interesting, though I would have liked a bit stronger characterization in the hero. He was the kind of guy I wanted to know more about. It's still a great book. When a reader wants to know more about a character, it speaks well of the author who created him in the first place. It takes a lifetime to perfect the craft of writing, and not nearly that long to learn how to criticize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to the very last page.","review":"This is the best book ever written by Kay Hooper. It's one of my favorites. It has suspense, romance, and a bit of fairy tale all between it's cover. I enjoyed it so much that I will probably read it again. If you enjoy this book you should read \\"Amanda\\" and \\"After Caroline\\", they are some of her other writing masterpieces. Kay Hooper is one of the most talented writers, she's as good as Sandra Brown and Nora Roberts, some of my other favorite authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully romantic page-turner--don't miss it!","review":"I loved this book and can't believe I missed the hardcover release!

Boy was I wrong.... The speed is agonizingly slow and looking up a word especially if you're not sure about the spelling, takes forever. In addition, the unit is much bigger than the previous Franklin's and the buttons do not have a good feel when pressed. And on top of that, the pronounciation needs to be improved greatly.

No need to stop, figure out spelling, and turn to the right page. The vocabulary is sufficient and the pronunciation is okay. Although I have little use for the speaker, I found the pronunction a bit censored. It will not pronouced words such as anal, boob, or anything like that.

Overall everything else is satisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"MWS1840 gives poor pronunciation","review":"When it comes to the English language, the most important aspect is the pronunciation. This is where I focus now. In general, the pronunciation of this unit is not too bad, but there are words that are mispronounced; for example, the word \\"spank\\" is pronounced as \\"stank\\" - this is unacceptable. Another area of concern is that the pronouncer in this unit uses \\"monophthong\\", so much so that in certain words diphthongs are minimized to an extent that it is inaudible.

This one focusses on the conductors of symphony orchestras, poking fun at some of their stylistic excesses. The other books point the finger at the musicians of the orchestra, as well as operatic singers of the time. Some of the caricatures are recognizable for who they portray, at least by those of us over a certain age.Hoffnung was SO popular in his day, that several \\"Hoffnung Interplanetary Music Festivals\\" were staged in the mid 1950s (and fortunately for us, recorded!) with well known composers (Malcolm Arnold comes to mind) contributing scores.

Craziness and the inability to follow a plot does NOT make a movie a classic. It makes it garbage . . . And this movie certainly fits that term.I STILL don't know what happened. I've since read online reviews that tried to explain it, but I don't see how they are coming up with their opinions. If a movie requires massive amounts of discussion just to figure out what happened, then this is a DOWNFALL! Come on, people! How can anybody give this movie TWO stars, let alone FIVE?!And, about twenty minutes before the end, the movie goes from being an impossible to follow mystery . . . to a PORN flick! I know that this made the move more \\"watchable\\" to some people, but, in my opinion, it caused even more deterioration to a movie that I had thought couldn't deteriorate any further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust me, its all about weird sex!","review":"Just consider this movie without its lesbian hazy shadow and without the stunning offensive few shots of the amazingly sexy Laura Harring: the movie is not worth watching at all. It is nothing like Blue Velvet, Leaving Las Vegas or Pulp Fiction (real Noir and Mayhem).I strongly believe it is only these shots of naked extreme beauty calling for weird sex that entice the viewer to see the movie repeatedly. You may notice from the reviewers that everybody saw it more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Watching This May Cause Distress","review":"What is this movie about? I rented it and watched it. By the end of the film, I wanted to scream. I couldn't believe I had just wasted money on this. Normally, I don't mind films that are weird and mind-bending, where you scratch your head and say, \\"HUH?\\" (after all, \\"Fight Club\\" is one of my all-time favorite movies, and it took a couple viewings for me to understand everything that had happened in it.) But this movie...I don't even know where to begin. Everyone I know who has seen it absolutely HATED it. By the end of the movie, you don't know who is who, or if anyone is anyone, and the ending was just TERRIBLE. If you don't like strange movies, don't even bother going down this road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk from a Has Been Director","review":"David Lynch, if your reading this, Mulholland Dr. was the same material you were producing ten years ago on \\"Twin Peaks.\\" The goal of an artist is to move ahead, not to stagnate for ten boring years! This \\"movie\\" was the worse piece of garbage I have seen \\"The Brady Bunch Christmas Special\\". This abysmal piece of junk might fool some who are easily fooled by the \\"arts and croissant\\" crowd into believing this is art. The dialogue was forced and phoney, the acting more phoney than the script, and the story flat out boring. Even the lesbian scenes were boring; how is that even possible! I have seen commericals for cellular phones that are more artistic than this. Any finacial executive that gives David Lynch a penny for any future film might was well throw his money out the window and let it fall into the street gutter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insane drug vision","review":"This movie was terribly long, interesting at times, but overall very ridiculous. I watched this with a few highly educated friends. We watched this movie, discussed it and dismissed as a pile of incoherent drivel! The acting was extremely well done, unfortunately there was really nothing to do. Save the 2 hours of your life and do something constructive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa","review":"I'm sorry for all you people that liked this, but to me it was extremely boring and the meaning is DEEP. SO deep that half-way through the movie i said \\"What is going on? and, is it over yet?\\" I don't not like writing negative reviews, but this is just my feeling. If i were you, I would save myself the money (renting,buying) and the TIME, and find someting more interesting to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie is boring. It took way too long to get me interested; I even fell asleep about 20 minutes into this movie and had to go back and re-watch it. Unfortunately, this DVD only has ONE chapter, so you cannot go back easily. Isn't this why they invented DVD???? I was not impressed. There are much better movies that deal with amnesia, mystery, etc. (Memento). This DVD has nothing, just the trailer. The video quality is good and the sound is fine, although there's not much sound in the movie. I know a lot of people really like this movie, but it's just too slow, too random, and not nearly engaging enough for me to go back and see if I can figure everything out. And this is one of the worst DVD's to come out lately since it only has a trailer and no scene selections. If you do like this movie, they will probably release a special edition at some point."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"All through the movie I was busy trying to understand it. By the end I had put the movie back to a prior part like three times or more, and afterwards it took me more then an hour to (try to) puzzle the pieces together. Especially the parts with the \\"demon\\" were completely confusing.My question is, what is the point? Clever as it may be, I did not enjoy this movie and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Lynch's great folly","review":"Isn't it possible that all the \\"mysterious\\" and unexplainable plot twists in Mulholland Drive really are just a result of having to slap together a feature film ending on a tv series pilot? Lynch sets in motion many intriguing sub-plots and characters in the first half of the film, which is very watchable, in my opinion. But then the film unravels, and in effect forgets itself, which is very unsatisfying. The care with which these characters, even the minor ones, are introduced, makes the finale seem unfair. I wanted more...as in a whole season of episodic television, which is obviously what Lynch had in mind. I've read a lot of intricate analyses of this film, and I keep thinking it is all one huge case of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\", with David Lynch having a laugh at all the film \\"experts\\" who see brilliant symbolism and metaphor instead of a naked failed tv pilot."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAZY!!!!!!","review":"Ok im so confused on how this movie got five stars by EBERT!!!! from the Chicago sun times i was like wow! I rented the movie on DVD and was trying to stay awake. The movie is a complete mess! it really dosent make sense to me. I tried and tried to make sense of it but i really couldnt. Ebert said that the whole movie is a dream, but still its really boring and stupid and the lesbian sex scenes really didnt have to be in the movie....lol then ending was totaly confusing, and i couldnt wait till the movie was OVER!!! but i guess the only pro i can give the movie is the way it is visualy but thats about it. I wouldnt recomend it to anyone......really!"},{"rating":"1","title":"head shaker","review":"This film did have all of your Lynch-isms, and I am a fan of Lynch, but it did not hit home for me. One of the funnest things about Lynch is watching the movies again and figuring them out. I got it for the most part, but honestly I didn't care to give it another veiw even for the sake of proving I could understand everything. I really had high hopes for this movie, but I'm not gonna like it just because its Lynch. If he does another movie with the double-life/doppelganger/dream-realtiy theme its gonna really start to wear thin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Directing, Great Cinematography Worth Watching","review":"Ok... I enjoyed this movie until I saw the credit lines coming up! Then I asked myself \\"what was that all about?\\"The making of the film is obviously great. The production and cinematography just jump out.But I cant rate something that I didnt understand a 5 star movie! The plot twists were all good too. But the pieces just didnt fit together afterwards. Just as soon as I thought I got it, there was another twist which threw everything out the window...But like I said it's worth watching for the cinematography. I will try to follow some suggestions and watch this one more time. Maybe I'll understand some more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Lynch - and then some","review":"This movie is an excellent journey into the weird and dark mind of David Lynch. It's a bit similar to Lost Highway in some way, but it's far more complex. Lots of clues here and there that has something to do with that incredible way the movie changes direction mid-way through. This I think is the best Lynch movie I've seen.You just have to go see it and after it's finished let your mind wonder what the hell does this mean...?Go see it and expect not to understand it (at least not the first time)Great stuff from the most innovative director of our time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Babbling Idiocy","review":"Please don't say that this film has no plot. Its plot is tight and sound - you just have to look for it. Once you find it, it's heartbreaking and brilliantly conceived. That's what makes this such a fascinating movie - it allows you to discover its meaning on your own. I haven't had that much fun at the movies in years.And Naomi Watts was robbed by the Academy. She was by far the best actress last year. Mesmerizing in every single scene, she pulled off the last act persona shift without batting an eye. As for Lynch, he always been a technical master and his ability to control such dramatic mood shifts is astounding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extras not included on U.S. version of Mulholland Drive","review":"Four interviews including Lynch and Watts, behind the scenes, music video for I've Told Every Little Star, photo gallery of publicity stills, trailer, booklet (which hsa the European style poster image), and chapter stops throughout the movie (the U.S. edition has only one chapter). NOTE: this was an official dvd release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give in to it - it doesn't have to make immediate sense","review":"David Lynch is his own man and he is unafraid to put out films that are untouched reruns of his own wild imagination. MULHOLLAND DRIVE drives some people crazy because of their need for absolute resolution of stories. This little gem of a film is more like a carefully staged stream of consciousness and if you can't jump on the ride then you're missing the joy. Lynch has captured fine performances from a strong cast, explores terrain rich and strange, and even goes over the edge just enough to test our thinking and conceptual skills. The ending is up to the viewer.......and what a refreshing turn for a film to take! Give in to it. The DVD allows you to see it at home where you don't need to fret that people around you may think you confused."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute.","review":"My main problem with the DVD is the fact that it has NO CHAPTER SELECTIONS. I don't just mean that there are no thumbnails in the menu that let you pick specific scenes visually - I mean that the whole movie is just one long track, so if you hit \\"Previous\\" you'll go all the way back to the start of the film, and if you hit \\"Next\\" you'll go all the way to the end. This actually makes it worse than a VHS tape because in order to see a prior scene without starting the entire film over, you just have to sit there holding down \\"rewind.\\" (On my DVD player anyway.) This really [stinks]. But maybe it was just some purposeful arty decision, to force people to watch it continuously and not be able to instantly refer back.This film would frustrate enough people regardless. Personally I'll wait for the \\"Collector's Edition\\" with tracks and a nice weird director commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"And why am I rating this 5 stars again..?..Oh yea...","review":"This movie....totally....before this I beileved that Clockwork Orange was the weirdest movie I've ever seen but this film totally blew that movie 10x out of the water my friends....I am giving this so much credit because how thought provoking it actually is....I still don't know how to decipher what is it about, My english teacher and my freinds have also seen it and the only explaination I got was that life is not static and things can change...but if you're in for about 2 hours of full-blown imgination and freakiness...enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"RHIZOMATIC!","review":"The term, Post-Modern, is often misused or overused. In this case it is right on the mark. Lynch has created a post-modern masterpiece.This film relates to Gilles Deleuze's post-modern concept of the Rhizome. \\"A rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing. Where are you coming from? What are you heading for? These are totally useless questions. Making a clean slate, starting or beginning again from ground zero, seeking a beginning or a foundation - all imply a false conception of voyage and movement (a conception that is methodical, pedagogical, initiatory, symbolic...).\\" ('A Thousand Plateaus,' written by: Deleuze + Guattari)Lynch fabricated characters that were coming and going, rather than starting and finishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest waste of time yet...","review":"Let me set one thing straight, I LOVE movies that make you think. My boyfriend and I watched this waiting for the moment where everything clicked, but there was no moment. This movie is a mess. It has too many characters that are never explained and seems like 4 different movies wrapped in one. Anyone who thought this was a stroke of genius needs to get out more and watch more quality films. If you like putting together puzzles that are missing half the pieces, or contain pieces from multiple puzzles, this one is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure, you can figure it out, but why?","review":"I believe in strong stories that tell stories through symbols. One can experience a movie in a sensational way when viewing the undercurrents of a good story. I think of when I read books like The Scarlet Letter or The Chronicles of Narnia.Yes, I understood the story of Mulholland Drive, despite its hodgepodge methodology in the storytelling, I did not benefit from seeing it. The \\"profound\\" way in which it was presented was tedious to say the least, and I found myself waiting for it to conclude, regardless of what other reviewers would say about its \\"fast-paced\\" third act.As a friend of mine said, what we have here is a case of The Emperor's New Clothes. We have a director caught up in creating this and other movies which become fan favorites and which receive great praise for reviewers and critics; but, in the end, we're all to afraid to say that all we truly see is nothing more than a naked person walking down the street."},{"rating":"1","title":"First two thirds were good, but then...","review":"The first two thirds of this movie were very suspenseful, but the last third really ruins it. To date, I have not been a David Lynch fan and now I know why.The last third of this movie did not seem to have any connection whatsoever with the rest of the film. Same cast, but different characters and a different story. It didn't make any sense to me and I didn't see any resolution to the story by the film's end.There's a scene just before the movie takes a dive, where the two lead actresses are watching a woman sing a Roy Orbison tune in Spanish and they start crying. I think the real reason they started crying was because they figured out they were in a movie that was about to tank.For the David Lynch fans, if you enjoyed this film (and understood it), more power to you. I, however, did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie be good for curing sleep problems","review":"I watch about 20 minutes of this dog of movie. It is just flat out bad and if a person can get this movie for under cost of a rental or PPV great. If you spend more than that then as the saying goes buyer be ware.Form the title the viewer would think they be tuning in to a good one but not so with this one. It has a very poor script and to many chactors to keep the viewer attention. In one scene you have this goofy looking movie director driving out some place to talk with another goofy looking cowboy dude. And for over 20 mins the viewer is left wondering where in the blue blazes is this movie going?It only rate a 1 star and that being kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"royal piece of crap","review":"nothing. you get nothing from this movie. its basically a pretentious piece of work that calls itself art. david lynch did a terrible job, and the story had no substance. The end made no sense. just an all around waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dare I criticize Lynch?","review":"...Mulholland Drive was the worst movie I have seen in the past 10 years. This is MST3000 fare.I was a fan of Twin Peaks, and enjoyed its esoteric qualities, but this is purposefully dense and cryptic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"This movie is terrible. By the time things start getting a little interesting, you could really care less as to what the point of the movie is. I would not recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow","review":"Yes, I get the film. And I like convoluted movies. However I have never seen such wooden acting. Perhaps David Lynch intended that to seem dreamlike, however it doesn't convey \\"dream sequence\\" to me- it just reminds me of really bad D-- movies I have seen in the past - made on 3 digit budgets. Also, the slow disconnected performances and delayed responses are not really consistent with the theme - so as an artistic form it doesn't work. If the main character were OD-ing on drugs maybe.There are many very cool movies where the viewer has to work to figure out what is real and what isn't. To me this one seemed lame in the extreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Lynch needs a hug...","review":"\\"Wow\\" or \\"What in God's name did I just see?\\" = Your choices of what to say at the end of Mulholland Drive. This amazing film centers around an aspiring actress (Naomi Watts) and an amnesiac (Laura Harring) who are searching for Harring's identity and something about a car crash. Wait, hold on... now there's two guys sitting in a diner... ok now there's a film director and a man who is way too particular in his taste of espresso... Now there's a hitman... a poolman and pink paint, WHAT'S GOING ON!!! All set over Angelo Badalamenti's haunting score, Mulholland Drive proves to be a true cult classic. If you enjoy movies that require you to do more than just watch, then buy it and dont waste your time returning it to the video store. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie that I've seen this year....","review":"Choppy, confusing, exposition problems, and unexplained plot turns. I hope that whoever funded this movie got what they wanted, since I don't think that any member of the viewing public will. I don't think that I've ever seen such a waste of celluloid. I totally agree with reviewer above who states that this is just a self-indulgent mess on the part of Lynch. Don't walk, run from this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie.. DVD [stink]s..","review":"Movie is really great.. But DVD [stink]s..

I thought it was just my copy. Luckily it isn't, but unfortunatly the DVD is far from what I expected. With all the mind games that is played in the movie I expected the DVD to contain some mindblowing extras. Instead I found nothing. The movie I give 5 stars...the DVD I give 2.

And so it is that the heroine on \\"Mulholland Drive\\" dreams of how she would have liked her Hollywood adventure to be.But what of those daytime dreams that provoke us to leave our safe haven and naively make Dorothy think she can leave Kansas?Heroic when the dream realizes itself; devastating when the dream becomes a living nightmare, from which only sleep and reverie can bring relief. Finally that is not even enough as the reality of what has happened and what she has done invades the dreams of the now jaded young Canadian. Only the ultimate \\"silenzio\\" can end the perturbation...she hopes.Of course, this movie should have gotten the Oscar for Best Film and the Oscar for Best Actress...but, of course, it didn'tThomas"},{"rating":"1","title":"David Lynch Finally Gives Us An Ending. But Not A Middle!","review":"After Lost Highway I had almost given up. Remembering Fire Walk With Me, however, I gave Mulholland Dr. a shot. I should have remembered that Fire was a prequel to a series that went nowhere. Although Lynch must have felt a need to get an ending that made sense this time, he for some reason didn't feel a need to make a movie that makes sense most of the way through. Yes, the larger parts do tie together in the end, although hardly everything does. But just because the puzzle is difficult does not mean there's much joy in solving it -- the payoff, though eerie, was just too long in getting there, and the story too sloppy, and with too many never-explained turn, events, and whole characters, to warrant much interest. David Lynch, I see that you're trying, and I wish you the best, but that's the last time I plunck down my money to see one of your pictures. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get The DVD Version","review":"If you really like this movie, either get it on VHS or wait for them to re-release it on DVD. The people who produced this CD are obvious not familiar with DVDs because they made it in the form of a VCD. In short, you cannot select different chapters in the movie. In order to go to a specific scene, you have to use the fast scan. This makes the disk even worse that VHS tapes because with tape, you can at least stop the movie and fast forward the movie to a time or counter mark. I guess the makers were more focused on putting out little things like trailers or cast info instead of useability. Because of the length of the movie, they could have made it a dual DVD set and put all of that extra ... on it. Oh well, I am so glad that I am just renting this DVD and didn't buy it. You all know what the store's policy is on returning items, even if they are ...!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie but poor DVD realization.","review":"I liked the movie but found the lack of scene selection deplorable.

It has so much going for it that a good portion is lost in its initial viewing. That said, this is one movie that has stood the test of time. I have watched it at least 6 times now. Watched it twice when it came out on DVD and then every other year when I needed a guaranteed cinematic experience. It hasn't lost its luster after all these years. Naomi Watts delivers such a convincing performance in the audition scene that, to this day, deserves an Oscar or some similar form of recognition."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I liked","review":"I liked three things about this movie; the jitterbugging pre-credit sequence (or pre-'action' - huh!), the eye makeup of the 50s and Latina singers, and a few nice shots of buildings.

I tell you it one waste of my time and money (thanks to God I didn't buy the tape I just rented it- still a buck is a buck). The movie starts so well - crime, suspence, a little detective story.

David lynch, along with Peter Greenaway, is probably the best director of our time. Thanks to him, cinema really goes forward, introducing new and uncommon narrative and multi-dimensional characters.His fiction, then, gives us to try and reconstruct a plot, feelings and characters, which is a unique and wonderful experience.Grasping reality is not an easy matter. Instead of giving us straight forward answers and certainties, David Lynch, as a real artist,unveils the complexity of life and human relationships. I 'd also like to say how wonderful Naomi Watts is. She is the one who brings life to Betty, the multi-facets cornerstone character of 'Mulholland Drive'. This film is so different from what we are used to seeing, so subtle, clever and exciting that anyone owning a dvd player should buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting movie, poor DVD special features","review":"My wife didn't like it because she couldn't figure it out. The fact is, no one can figure it out, no doubt including David Lynch. The women in this film are great to look at. \\"Diane\\" glows from the inside out, and \\"Rita?\\" . . . fuhgedaboudit! She'll knock yer sox off. The DVD has no Scene Selection feature, which is a serious oversight IMHO. How hard would that have been to include? The sound is either Dolby Digital (2 channels? 5.1?) or DTS (not on my machine!) . . . your choice. No director's commentary or anything other than a trailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I waited about an hour and a half for the movie to finally start. When I realized that it had, I spent the rest of the movie waiting for something - anything - to pull it all together. I'm still waiting. This is probably the most disappointing movie I have ever seen. I like to think - I really do. I like movies that make you puzzle out the answer. I like the moment of revelation where everything suddenly clicks. This movie has no answer. I'm not even sure that it has a question. It is simply a bunch of unrelated, badly directed scenes strung together in some incomprehensible order. I wish I could give this movie the 0 rating it truly deserves, but that doesn't seem to be an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unfluid film full of irrelevant scenes","review":"David Lynch stuck everything he possibly could into this movie.

This started a general discussion lasting several minutes with almost the entire audience staying and not one person understood it, was happy to have seen it or would recommend it.Truly deny this observation if you wish but this is a long, disjointed movie that has absolutely no plot, not even a shred of one and I challenge any reviewer to tell the rest of us what the plot or message is without sprouting nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've ever seen.","review":"It seems like a lot of people think that if something is different then it must be good. While different often is good, this movie's a great example of that not always being the case. You shouldn't have to watch a movie more than once to understand it.

You cannot skip to your favorite Lynchian moments (cowboy) or dialogue (napkin)! The disc is DTS and 5.1! It's WIDESCREEN ANAMORPHIC! It is ONE HUGE SCENE! What is going on? I forgot how to fast forward the day I threw out my VCR, and I thanked god I did.Universal DVDs tend to look pretty and sound good with zero extras, but this is really absurd. I GIVE THE MOVIE 5 STARS BECAUSE I LOVE IT, AND -4 STARS BECAUSE I WANT TO EDUCATE CONSUMERS on this less-than-spectacular DVD.Finally, if this is the way David intended his film to be shown, then I think he's way off the mark in terms of the medium; which is odd, because davidlynch.com is so wonderful.If just my DVD has this problem, please let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale","review":"A return to the Lynch-canon in the worst way: a bunch of recycled old motifs waiting hopelessly for a clue, plus a bugaboo round the corner.

EVER.","review":"Typical David Lynch...is he paying the critics to write positive reviews for his disjointed, badly played bits of weirdness?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a loss for network TV..","review":"I purchased this DVD on reputation alone. I was not disappointed. This is an absolutely stunning piece of work by David Lynch. If you are a fan of features such as 'Requiem for a Dream' and 'American Psycho' and 'Memento', you will love this movie. I do have one suggestion - do not watch this at midnight by yourself with the lights off.. it gets creepy.. everyone should own this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste 2 and a half hours.","review":"It's movies like these that ruin it for the rest. David Lynch brings us another story that should make sense but screws you over for the 45 minutes. The movie was good for the first 90 minutes(believe it or not), but it seems as if this wierdo director tries to confuse his audiences so that they'll end up thinking that it is good and then they'll buy it. Not only that but this is an absolutely horrible DVD release. Only a trailer and Cast & Crew info! This also has to be a first for a DVD that doesn't have any chapter stops. I heard Lynch purposely did that and will be doing it for all of his other movies. The 3-second car crash is all that I enjoyed. If you liked this hunk-o-junk then see Lost Highway, it's basically the same Lynch [stuff]."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Head Scratcher","review":"First off, the DVD does not have chapters. Took me a while to figure that out. Second of all, I really just didn't get it. This film is so obviously Lynchian, in all it's twists and memory erasing turns. I suppose I didn't like it simply because I didn't get it, that may seem like a bad reason but it's true. Some of the moments were worth seeing, the Silencio sequence, but most was just a bunch of hooey. I felt as if I needed Cliffs notes to figure out what really went on. The performances were quite good, and it looked really great, with great direction by Lynch, but in the end, I just didn't get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lynch's approach: how can I salvage this mess?","review":"It started as a TV pilot. Lynch apparently pasted together nearly 2 hours of miscellany from Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, and Twin Peaks: Long, pointless (dreamlike) shots with low moaning backgroun noise/music; eccentric characters for the point of eccentricity; horrible dialogue; cute, guileless people naively dragged into a seamy other world; lip-synched saccharine 50s tunes; Roy Orbison tunes resurrected to portray deep anguish. Absolutely nothing new or cohesive.When it wasn't picked up, knowing that he never intended to reach closure on the story, he used the oldest trick in the book: aha! It's a dream sequence! The last half-hour is interesting, but let's not fool ourselves. This is a (mostly) good half-hour art movie, not a great 2-1/2 hour motion picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid movie.","review":"I read the glowing reviews about this movie, I remember David Lynch's other works (\\"Twin Peaks\\", \\"Blue Velvet\\" and \\"Wild at Heart\\"), and since I grew up in L.A. just off Mulholland Drive, I bought the DVD despite my personal rule of never buying a DVD without seeing the movie first. **HUGE MISTAKE!** While this film may be very artsy, the story is disjointed and just plain wierd. Yes, I 'got it' - the plot is basically a dream sequence. I feel like I wasted not only the money I spent on the DVD, but -more importantly- 2.5 hours of my life watching it. I have since sold this DVD. In my humble opinion, this is an awful, terrible movie. It is a complete waste of time and money. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Scene Selection, No Stars!","review":"I generally like Lynch's work, but I never thought I'd see a feature film on DVD that didn't have a basic Scene Selection menu!

Lynch probably thought this would be funny..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie of 2001","review":"Quite simply, Mulholland Drive doesn't contain a shred of plot; it is just a series of unrelated scenes. If you're looking for a movie that tells an intelligible story, then you need to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you want to marvel over pseudo-intellectual BS that nobody can understand, then this is the perfect movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: May cause symptoms of drug-induced coma.","review":"I have David Lynch completely figured out. His whole intention in film-making is simply to throw every Freudian cliche, nightmarish symbol, and bizarre twist that he can dream up into a pot, thereby creating a confounding stew that even he doesn't understand, because there's nothing TO understand.This product is then marketed to an ersatz intellectual audience who debate and decipher all sorts of meaning out of this stream-of-consciousness mess, while Lynch laughs at his audience...all the way to the bank. Ludicrous, but true.This is the most accurate, in-a-nutshell review of \\"Mulholland Drive\\" you may ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I was amazed by how people tried to justify a junk as being \\"artistic\\" because of Lynch's reputation. This movie is definitely no \\"Blue Velvet\\"! However, I agree that Naomi Watts delivered an Oscar-winning performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"a movie without a message","review":"Thanks to exposure to some of Lynch's previous work, I anticipated being confused but ultimately sufficiently enthralled to make the movie-watching experience worthwhile. I was disappointed. The nonexistence of plot would not be so egregious, perhaps, had the first half of the movie not implied that some form of film noir convention would be in place. When does a movie cross the line between being quirky and being pointless? It does so here."},{"rating":"1","title":"...and I thought watching Fantasia 1000 times was boring","review":"You know the scene, your kids insist on watching Fantasia over and over again. You try to justify this to your brain for its classical, experimenting artsy-fartsy appeal, but nothing can be as boring and unsatisfying as Mulholland Dr.Formula for a guaranteed boring movie: dragging out almost every scene, subplots in the film that are better left on the edit room floor and an ending that demands the two and half hours of your life back. This film had it all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie is great -- DVD has flaws","review":"This was a complex movie requiring several viewings to unravel the clues and solve the puzzle. The movie is more along the line of Blue Velvet rather than The Straight Story (both directed by David Lynch). However, I found the DVD rather disappointing. There was no way to access individual Chapters to go to exact sections of the movie. It ran just like a VHS tape. To return to a spot, you must actually put the DVD on rewind. Further the DVD has a bad flaw. It stops suddenly after about 90 minutes. Since there are no Chapters, it's not possible to simply jump to the next Chapter. After much trial and error, we figured out we start the DVD from the beginning at fast speed until it fast forwarded past the stopped area. I returned the DVD twice for a new copy; all 3 copies have this flaw, so it must have been manufactured that way. The DVD is pricey and has no extras except for Cast bios."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think.....................................................","review":"Everyone is dead and in hell.

There was no plot, and the director's probably laughing at all the people who claim to have found one. I've watched this movie twice. The second time was with someone who claimed that they \\"got it\\". I could see the symbolism, but why go to that much trouble to hide a story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't all Lynch movies be like \\"Dune\\"?","review":"This movie is inscrutable. Watts' performance is its high point. See \\"The Ring\\" for a more tolerable dose of this fine and pretty actress. The sexual encounter in the bed midway through was so predictable and obvious that I could not wait for it to be over. That goes for the whole picture as well. To make matters worse-- when I went to use the chapter search function to review a few of the more bizarre sequences-- I was surprised to find this disc has NO CHAPTER SEARCH. I recommend \\"Dune\\" instead. While allowing director Lynch to have his usual type of fun being weird, it is more entertaining than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive Away!","review":"This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Worst acting, worst casting, worst editing, worst writing, etc. I would say worst story but there wasn't one. I can't believe someone read this script and said, \\"We have to make this into a movie.\\" I can't believe anyone would give Lynch the money to make it. I can't believe it was voted one of the year's best. This movie is a joke. All I can figure is that it has some kind of hypnotic, subliminal message hidden in it saying, \\"Love this movie. Love this movie.\\" Thank goodness I was immune. There's nothing to love."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a Zero, but it's not an option!!!!","review":"uh... what?That's the feeling I got at the end of this movie. I, along with many of my friends, feel we wasted both our time, and money when we rented this movie. It's like a BAD version of Momento, only the viewer is the one in the dark, who doesn't know what is going on. I kept waiting for a great hook in the end, to tie it all together...

I really could not get into it. I was lost.I bought the DVD, but decided to rent the movie and watch it first...I'm glad that I did. I returned the un-opened DVD the next day.I know that some people said it was great, but in my opinion it wasn't. If a movie doesn't grab me in the first few scenes or at least in the first 30 minutes, then forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Either I'm dumber than I thought, or...","review":"I don't know if I'm just naive about what he was trying to do when he directed this film. He would know more than I would what he wanted the viewer to come away with. I wanted to rent it again right after I returned it. It stimulated my brain thats why, and my libido. I thought that the lez-curious scene was very real and sensitive. My heart was beating so fast. Then people started disappearing, little Lilliputan characters were walking under doors, people were swithching identities... You will need a notepad to keep up with the names and who switched with whom. It was just like an episode of Twin Peaks, or even CSI. If you want to be stimulated in the brain and body watch it. Don't buy anything that cuts out scenes, (even the nude ones) because they really help to pull you into the characterizations. I will re-rent it just to break it down like a Shakespearean sonnet. I hope I can still enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Second Half","review":"I really wanted to like this film, but as happens in about half of his films, David Lynch gets too frustrating/confusing for me.On the plus side, the entire film features great cinematography, and the first half of the film builds a storyline that keeps my interest.Sadly, the second half of the film self-destructs in a ball of confusion that makes the ending of 2001: A Space Odyssey seem clear in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Academy Does A Mullholland Drive-By","review":"It's Oscar nomination time again and I noticed that Hollywood's insiders have only given a passing nod to David Lynch's \\"Mullholland Drive\\", by only nominating him as Best Director (which we all know he won't win). I saw \\"Mullholland Drive\\" several months ago and I'm still haunted by it's images, long after the tearjerking senimentality of \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" and high the tech overkill of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" have dissipated. We live in a world where the transparent charm of Julia Roberts passes as \\"Best Actress\\"; and both Laura Harring and Naomi Watts don't even get nominated. Come on guys!...you could have given at least one of them a best actress nomination. David Lynch, the most daring director since Louis Bunuel, gets passed over again. I have a feeling David Lynch could care less, but I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense psychological thriller!","review":"In my opinion, Mulholland Drive was by far the best movie of 2001. I think that in some of his other films, David Lynch just gave up at some point and released his grip on reality and even coherence. What sometimes resulted (and I'm thinking here of movies like Lost Highway) were some fascinating mind trips that didn't really hold up to intense critical scrunity. Mulholland Drive is different. There's no way to explicate the mysteries of the movie in this short review, but I think that persistent and thoughtful viewers will find Mulholland Drive to be a brilliant exploration of a troubled mind as well as a blistering criticism of Hollywood and the movie industry. The movie is by no means simple or easily accessible, but it is definitely worth repeated viewings and long discussions with good friends--I don't think that a single, solitary viewing will do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome To My Nightmares","review":"Let me give Mulholland Drive a whirl...A compassionate director (Lynch) hates that his hands are often tied by associate producers when it comes to making films. One of the aspects he hates most is when talented, beautiful, and young would-be starlets are overlooked in the casting process. It happens often. One day a particularly appropriate actress has to be ignored by Lynch, despite the fact she's perfect. When he goes home, his conscience rips him apart and even spills over into his dreams. He can't help but wonder is she still ok? Did she take it hard? Did she eventually make it or go over the deep end? Fortunately, that artist--David Lynch--has a medium through which he can vent his frustrations and fears. The result: Mulholland Drive--Lynch's frustrations, fears, nightmares, hopes, and ultimately a tribute to the starlets that never were. (Quentin, the master has spoken and it's time to go back to taking notes.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing film, but DVD disappoints","review":"Mulholland Drive is one of my favorite movies ever. I won't go on about how great it is here, cause enough people have done that! The reason I gave it only 4 stars was because I was a little disappointed that the DVD didn't have more special features. It's pretty bare bones; just the film, the preview, and some written info about the cast/crew. A director's commentary would have been awesome, or at least some interviews or behind the scenes. Oh well!(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"dont try so hard to understand it.","review":"Even if Mr. Chronological's interpretation of this film is correct, this type of narrative construction can hardly be considered simple to follow. This film is deliberately confusing, as Lynch films are more like dreams than conventional stories. If Mulholland Drive would have been constructed in a fashion that was simple to follow, it would not have the same dramatic effect. This film is open to many interpretations, and trying to simplify something that is intentionally complicated is not the answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie to Mess with your Head","review":"This movie is seems normal throughout the beginning scenes. But since the director is David Lynch I knew it would not be for long. Naomi Watts plays Betty a sweet girl from Canada. When she finds Rita played by Laura Elena Harring. They try to find out who Rita really is. A lot of other stuff happens im not going to give anything away. I will tell you this if you understand the ending you are a genius!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeeeep nonsense!","review":"I rarely walk out of a movie...I did with this one! It is totally BORING! People can wax philisophically about the deeeeep meanings but it is simply rubbish! Yes, the ladies are pretty and sexy, but you can get that from a whole lot of good movies, why waste your time with nonsense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not logical","review":"The first half of this movie is really arousing. I kept thinking how Lynch will wrap everything up in a logical way. I found nothing except for a mess of events. It was really a waste of time. I think all those guys that say this movie is great or whatever must take a look at themselves. They must be some unlogical, non-mathematical folks, trying to give gredit to the movie just because so many people say so or ... 'forced' to say so - just a kind of groupthink.On the philosophical basis, this film is even worse. Letting characters to play other character through the film is pointless. Even pure idealists always make very clear distinction between different selves, let alone materialists. Otherwise, why do we all have to distinguish between good and bad all our life? Pointless, maybe this is a dream of some maniac.This film cannot be compared to Vanilla Sky on any side. I give 1 star credit for the atmosphere of the film on all audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"GO SEE MULLHOLLAND FALLS","review":"I was tremendously disappointed in this movie. It was difficult to follow and the acting ranged from average to poor.This movie is not even worth talking about. All I can say is if you rented this movie by mistake thinking it was \\"Mullholland Drive\\" then go see \\"Drive\\". It is a much better movie with more believable plot and great acting...plus Jennifer Connelly is in it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point of the sex scenes?","review":"This is a film that I am almost sorry I watched. It is disjointed and confusing, which by itself would be okay because it does make some sense when you realize it is a dream until the last part of the movie. What is disturbing to me is that this film has unnecessary scenes, which, as far as I am concerned, are pornographic and don't add anything to the movie. In fact they take away from it. They seem to be included for sensationalism and to satisfy some sick fantasy. Otherwise the dream symbolism, the way Lynch has used stiff seemingly bad acting on the part of the characters in the beginning, and the way he has used the lighting and affects makes for an interesting study in the genre of fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"does nobody see the emperor wears no clothes?","review":"Mulholland Drive is the most pretentious, discombobulated, self-indulgent drivel since the last bit of slow-moving, sepia-colored dreck Lynch foisted on a subservient and servile tribe of critics who have been too long in the land of too much sun (for the skin), too much dope (for the mind) and too much hot tub (for the proper and efficient functioning of the nervous system). Those who would sit still for the full length of this (film) manifest the surest signs of an eroded sense of time and tempo and a completely lost sense of dynamics, musical, emotional, and any other, including aesthetic and olfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"Out of all the movies I have watched, (and I have watched a lot)Mulholland Drive is the most boring, pointless one I have seen. It is so boring, and has no story at all. I couldn't stand having to act in a movie as boring as this. The first hour in a half is just a bunch of people walking aroud. During that first hour in a half, they say about 15 words. Then, the last half hour is the most weirdest thing you've ever seen. And that weirdness has no point, or relation to the story whatsoever.I even whatched it again, too give it a sencond chance or see if I missed any important plot, but still, it was the same boring slow movie. There's no suspense, just people doing normal stuff. Please don't watch this movie, it will be a waste of 2 hours of your life, and you will be dissapointed, and bored. I have never seen anything so boring, not even a Ken Burns documentary. TERRIBLE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird but good","review":"I chose this rating because the movie was a little long.

When he makes a dud, we get a crock of excrement like Mulholland Drive.The film begins well, to be fair. But soon the sense that Lynch is repeating himself came over me, and I sat there not giving a damn about the characters or plot events. The now famous/notorious plot machinations seem more born of desperation than of any real artistic impulse.This is one of the very worst films ever made, from one of the finest filmmakers alive. Let's hope that next time Mr. Lynch gets it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful","review":"I live down the street from an art theater and see almost everything that comes there. As a result, I see some interesting films (\\"The Filth and the Fury.\\" \\"Bread and Roses\\") as well as some of the worst films to ever be shown on the big screen. (\\"Requiem for a Dream\\").It's not that those of us who hated this movie \\"don't get it.\\" We are not stupid. Anyone can see that Lynch is trying to mesh together certain images/scenes/characters to create an atmospheric film that says something about a place - LA, here - or characters without actually telling a traditional, linear story. Fine. Understood.That being said, it's not near enough. This film took no more skill to create than your average MTV video featuring a montage of things that also, in a way, follow a theme: girls in bikinis, expensive cars, choreographed dancing and macho posturing.

On some laptops, the only portion that plays is a short macrovision movie - yea, thanks. I finally discovered that VLC will play this disc correctly so NOTE, it may or may not play on your DVD machine correctly even though it claims to be a DVD.Also note, Universal was too cheap to make chapter marks - there are movies on DVD from the 1920's with chapter marks - none here so if you miss the days of rewinding and fast forwarding like VHS - here ya go ... the resolution is also just a B - probably has something to do with the macrovision interfering with the picture quality.So, great movie but SKIP this disc - wait for a better version if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great flick, USELESS DVD!!!","review":"how they could release a movie this long without chapter search/track selection totally baffles me.This is one of the best films of the new millenium, but i can't justify owning it without the ability to access it without 8x fastforwarding through the whole thing -- especially with a movie as complex and interesting as this one.

I attempted to sit down and figure out where everything connected once the movie was done, but my mind felt like it had been spun in the washing machine at top speed. The only reason why I am not giving it one star is because I agree with everyones' opinion that it's an extremely intellectual movie, like Memento.

However, this film wore down my patience. There is no way to ever completely understand a Lynch film. The enjoyment in his work comes from mood and intrigue. Mulholland drive did not have nearly enough intrigue to compensate for the lack of logic. Scenes were strung together in a frusterating order. I kept anticipating some funtctional link tying previous scenes together. But as the movie went on, all the audience is treated to is mindless vignettes that only confuse the plot until the only sensible explanation to what you are watching, is that Lynch wrote the script after waking up from a dream. A very tedious dream at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still happy","review":"Once again, a pleasant buying experience buying from Amazon. Although the movie was a bit darker than I expected, it still is a noteworthy addition to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Lynch movie holds up well...","review":"This film oddity from acclaimed director David Lynch is incredibly strange, but very entertaining. It's like watching a strange dream unfold before your eyes. There really isn't any sort of concentration on a plot here. There are devices injected into the film that look like a story, but there is no real direction that the movie takes us. It's enormously hard to follow and nearly impossible to decipher, but the watchability factor makes this flick a definite 5-star. Creepy and very confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOVIE OF THE YEAR!","review":"I'm not a great movie fan anymore. Most of Hollywood's productions don't impress me much these days, but this movie is just fantastic! Without giving too much away, the movie is about two lesbians with a love/hate relationship. I really can't say much more without ruining the story. One helful tip: you must read David Lynch's list of clues before watching the film. It will increase your enjoyment tremendously. This is a movie that you have to unlock. The storyline doesn't present itself in a straight forward manner. There are still some aspects of the movie that I don't understand, but the list of clues helped me to get most of it.It may be a good idea to watch the film more than once to get it. Its unique, I doubt there is anything like it in the world, even among Lynch's other works. Approach it knowing its not going to be what you expect. It [plays]with your mind a little, but that's what makes it so [very] great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What???","review":"Well that David Lynch has gone and ticked the whole world off once again!! I swear this man just makes movies to drive his viewers crazy. Don't get me wrong. I swear he his the only director who can film 146 min and leave every single door WIDE open. Take off your thinking goggles,people because you just ain't gonna get it. Sure, watch it 4,5,8 times. It's not gonna work.I was intrigued yet very disappointed of the how the movie went on. I mean it's one thing to watch crappy ending but at least you understand how the movie got to ending. Do you know what I mean? I'm not going to critique this movie. You can read other viewer comments. But as you read on, you will begin to notice that no one can really explain the storyline to you. It's a movie you have to experience on your own. But as I said before, David Lynch is sitting in his $500,000 rocking chair laughing at all us poor souls that are still shaking our heads,thinking\\"What the hell just happened?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie. BAD DVD RECORDING.","review":"The movie is one of the best in 2002 according to the Times Magazine, but the movie was recorded badly because my Toshiba SD-3006 DVD player could not play the entire movie. It stalled in the switch layer change. The recording studio should do a better job for recording two-layer disc movies. Every other DVD movies play fine in my DVD player.Also, this movie does not offer chapter skip. You must fast-forward or rewind where you left off. Since my DVD player stalled while watching Muholland Drive at 1:08:00, I tried to get it played again but there was no solution for me to recover. Therefore, I am unable to watch the entire movie. Not sure if new DVD players do that also.Walter Chan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the DVD version...","review":"Whether you like the film or not, the DVD is garbage for one simple reason. There are NO chapters or scene selection capabilities! Is this Lynch's ego trying to out-weird himself? I have never bought a DVD without this feature and usually it's a huge reason to opt for the DVD. If you have to stop the feature for some reason, you either have to pause it forever or stop it and then have to start all over. It's idiotic and unbelievably inconsiderate of his fans, like he's thumbing his nose at them after he's got their money. Sorry, but that just makes him a jerk in my book. If you want the film, save some money and do yourself a huge favor. Get the VHS version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of 2001: An absolute masterpiece","review":"When watching this movie for the first time your initial reaction is gonna \\"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT\\"? After watching it again your gonna say \\"well I never noticed this before.\\" After watching it a third time the thing you noticed before isn't gonna make a whole lotta sense because something is off with the scene. My point is for those of you trying to decipher this film and make sense out of it don't bother. When you think you have a grip on it something happens in the movie that turns it all upside down. I'm not gonna bother explaining any plot here, because it wouldn't do any good.

I twisted it and turned it in my mind to try to figure it out. I kept on thinking that I'd figure it out when the movie ended. I actually pondered the movie for a week without a single clue. Finally, the wonderful readers of my Amazon review helped me with their e-mails. Evidently, as you're watching the movie, you should think of the first part as a dream and the second part as reality. This is not enough to spoil the movie for you. In fact, the movie is left wide open for interpretation on purpose.

I heard all the hype and said, boy I think I should rent that one. Unfortunately it made absolutely no sense. The film ended and me and a friend looked at each other in disgust. Nothing really happens. I couldn't make out a plot, and I was really hoping they would clear things up in the end, making it a good movie, but no, the ending makes you want to hang yourself with a belt or something. I should have known when I heard that David Lynch directed it. Has anyone seen Dune? I read the whole series and then saw the movie and haven't seen a worse film adaption of a book since Breakfast of Champions with Bruce Willis. All in all, this movie kind of [was bad]. But if you just want to see two chicks get naked and make out, and you don't really mind the total absense of a story or a plot or cohesiveness or relavence of any kind, then by all means..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A triumph for Lynch...An annoyance for the rest of us...","review":"This movie does exactly what I believe Lynch wanted to do...make an unsolvable puzzle. The movie is filled with too many loose ends for any reasonable interpretation to be the true. Much like some contemporary artists, Lynch is seeking to elicit responses from his audience, rather than convey a message. While such an objective is fine, unfortunately our scholars cannot allow for such a goal. Since they believe everything has a meaning, they will endeavor to find it. Then, they explain the \\"great answer\\" that they have found to all of us.My personal reaction to the movie is negative. The movie did not seem well-made technically. Most importantly, the movie failed to draw me and didn't elicit much of a response from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing","review":"I didn't understand it after the first watch but after reading more about it, the movie does make sense.

Sorry, I'm not interested in playing that game. Yes I suppose there might be a semi coherant plot somewhere in there between all the onresolved subplots, abandoned characters, hallucinations, and dream sequences, but I was just too bored to care enough to sort it all out. I was not impressed by all the symbolism or the baffling way the story unfolds. This was pretentious garbage, though stylishly done. After reading the reviews raving about this movie, I'm even more sure of that. I really couldn't care less about how the cowboy represented Diane's conscience, the tiny old people \\"spectors of her lost innocence\\", etc etc. I have to laugh when I read how profound some people think this nonsense is. Yeah, I get it, its a dream for the most part. So what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A muddled mess ...","review":"I know a few people who liked Mulholland Drive, and one who loved it. Pretty much universally, when they praise the film they say something like, \\"Don't expect a story or a plot ... just enjoy the images and symbolism.\\" Then the guys add, \\"Oh, and the lesbian scenes.\\" Then the kicker: \\"Most people just won't get it.\\" This, of course, in a vaguely disappointed, vaguely pitying tone.There are plenty of movies out there with imagery and symbolism ... AND a story. I'm actually a damned bright fellow, and if there were anything in Mulholland Drive to \\"get,\\" I'm very capable of getting.But there's not.

That puts this one right up there. I thought it was a little easier to follow than Lost Highway, but it was still twisted enough to really enjoy the way your brain feels like jelly when it is over. I heard this was originally planned as a t.v. series. I wish it would have been done that way.

Personally, I'm a Lynch fan, so I found the movie to be funny, suspenseful, scary, sexy, and thought-provoking.Now, on to the DVD itself. No chapter menu?!? This is completely ridiculous! This type of movie lends itself to re-watching certain scenes to solve the mystery. Sorry, no can do! You'll have to watch the entire movie again or go through a tedious fast-forward search.I'll give the movie four stars, but this lousy DVD gets one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem from the master of the cinematic subconscious","review":"\\"Mulholland Drive\\", like most of Lynch's work, is not meant to be understood in a rational way. It is a movie of ethereal beauty, one of Lynch's best, in my opinion. This is true Lynchian magic, and if you want to know why he has such a devoted cult following, you should definitely see this movie.In this particular film I think Lynch is trying to provoke us, even enrage us, by openly ridiculing our basically relative and ultimately bogus ideas of 'identity' or 'reality'. The movie opens with a botched murder attempt, and from there spirals into a darkly erotic and dreamlike tale of madness, amnesia, mystery, and troubled beauty. The scene in the theater is maybe one of the most unforgettable and hypnotic scenes I've ever encountered in a movie, and surrealism addicts (like myself) will be engrossed by it from start to finish. A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"mulholland drive","review":"Very well done. A David Lynch good one i really liked itGood direction and good acting. Will watch again..

It's David Lynch. What more can be said? The DVD is bare-bones, but the transfer is superb. I adore this film such as a flower adores the rain. It is haunting, beautiful, astonishing...simply breath taking. Though it is long, and offers no chapter skips, it's to be viewed without pause. The only pause will come after the credits roll, and then watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"another Lynch masterpiece","review":"For the first time a David Lynch movie is nearly a whole dream.Because of that the film is more understandable than \\"Lost Highway\\" for example. Everybody knows that everything is possible in our dreams or nigtmares, so the surreal scenes seem normal.He should have win the oscar for the best director this time. Although, and that is something I notice in all his movies, except the first one \\"Eraserhead\\", the different parts of the film doesn't create a 100% globality. They seem very distanced from each other, like 10 different dreams compiled in one. Perhaps because of the radical flashback-cutting method we have to get used to.The performances are great, the lesbian scene is also great (and HOT!) and the music of Badalamenti is perfectly adapted to the images.You have to see this film to leave the boring reality during 140 minutes.If you like \\"Lost Highway\\" and \\"Blue Velvet\\" you'll love \\"Mulholland Dream\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If something could get less than 1 star, I'd rate it that.","review":"Sorry to all the fans of this movie out there, but I've got to say that this was by far one of the Top 5 WORST movies I've ever seen.

To be honest, it started out pretty good. Then about half way through, BAM! The whole story goes from a smooth ride to straight in the middle of nowhere.When it was over I asked my self,\\"What the * did I watch\\"? I still don't understand it. Stay away from this movie.

This rambling, pointless, incoherent piece of garbage wasted 147 minutes of my life. At no point did this movie attempt to tell a coherent story. If you haven't seen this movie, you already know more about it than you will after you have watched it. Mulholland Drive is a well-acted, well-directed, and well-filmed drug induced hallucination. If you like a movie that tells a story, or at least tries to make some sort of sense, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"is everyone insane?","review":"the only reason to watch this movie is the lesbo action with Laura Harring, she is by far the most beautiful woman I've ever seen and carried the movie for me. Oh, everyone else is pretty good, and the shots are eerie and cool, but the movie itself is just HORRIBLE!! The whole thing is apparently a fantasy of this girl who may or may not have actually had someone killed and gone insane. By the end, you won't know what the hell happened (no one else will either) and you'll feel something greasy on your sphincter. Not only is it boring, but David Lynch's attention to little details throughout is irritating (to say the least). Imagine wasting your valuable \\"entertainment time\\" watching a blank television and there ya go..Mulholland Dr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragments of Cack","review":"I once read that David Bowie used to construct his song lyrics by wrting random phrases and words on strips of paper and then plucking them out of a proverbial hat and assembling them as they came.Lynch apparently employs a similar approach with his film making, as this admittedly visually appealing mish-mash of symbolism just skitters from one scene to something completely unrelated until the credits roll.The acting is ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL. I have to stress this, as everyone else here comments on Oscar nomination performances, but trust me, the level of acting is comparable to Yankee soap operas (perhaps purposely?) and everyone just ambles about spouting vacuous lines at one another.I've seen some tripe in my time and this is up there with J-Lo's Angel Eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible movie, horrible DVD!","review":"Don't get me wrong, this is a simply incredible movie- the acting by Justin Theroux and especially Naomi Watts is perfect, the music by Angelo Badalamenti is beautiful, and the direction by David Lynch is haunting. I can't recommend this film enough for fans of well-made film noir. However, the dvd itself is crappy. The 'extras' are a joke and you can't even skip through the movie unless you fast forward the 'old-fashioned way.' Why Lynch or the studio even bothered to release this film on dvd is beyond me, they may as well have just stuck to the VHS format if they weren't going to take advantage of all that dvd has to offer. This rating applies to the dvd format ONLY, not to the film itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploitative, Manipulative, Unworthy","review":"I agree, you don't always have to \\"get\\" a movie, but there should be something intriguing and well done about it. MD has nothing but exploitative lesbian love scenes (obviously for the sake of male viewers), a director able to manipulate the audience into thinking there's some significance behind his audio-visual ramblings, and a movie unworthy of anyone's time, money, or thoughts.I even enjoyed Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, and some other Lynch tales. But he lost out on this one. We laughed through most of it, and then fastforwarded when we couldn't even find this trash funny anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst","review":"BORING!!!! I gave it one star because there are no negative stars. I really like David Lynch, but this totally lost me. It was boring - I kept waiting for something to happen. I can take it if all the loose ends are not neatly tied up - but when NONE of the loose ends are explained it is just too much. There were too many odd characters just apparently for the sake of having odd characters - they didn't mean anything, add anything, and were never explained. This is certainly NOT Lynch at his best - I loved Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, especially Wild At Heart, etc. etc. This however, was a huge waste of life.I am thankful that I only rented the DVD and did not pay to see this in the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie and terribly annoying!!!","review":"I am glad I did not buy this movie!

I came back to it grudgingly and had to FFWD through the movie.At the end of the movie, I sat wondering what the guy at the diner who had a paranoid fear of some homeless guy living in the alley had anything to do with the story's main plot. What was that???I get that there was a shift from reality to fantasy but I suppose that David Lynch expects most movie viewers to tie up the loose ends in this movie but I was left with too many loose ends to make any sense of it all.Too annoyed to watch it a 2nd time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"total garbage","review":"David Lynch, give me back the two and a half hours of my life I lost forever by watching this garbage!!

The narrative isnon existent and who really cares how many hiddenclues (if any) are to be found upon subsequent viewings.(this is no Usual Suspects).The film collapes upon itself, perhaps by design, butleading to my own attention span collapse.

The music, the visuals and the intensity drew me in but I was put off by not understanding. After reading an essay or two and discussing the film with some friends, I realized that it is intricate but not impenetrable. A small bit of digging will get you to see the truth of the film and the basic devices in its flow. Once that is understood, the movie comes alive and introduces powerful themes, complex symbols and many, many nuances. Lynch has created a film that, once one can get through the tough exterior, opens itself to immeasurable depth and impeccable acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naomi Watts' Performance is Unbelievably Impressive","review":"Mulholland Drive is creepy as hell and beautiful to look at.Some will enjoy the music, the colors, the lighting, the pacing etc.Others will enjoy Naomi Watts incredible performance where she has to convey the full spectrum of human emotion.Think about it...the first part of the movie she plays a perky, naive idealist and by the end of the movie she is equally impressive as a burnt out, suicidal depressive. Anyone who has ever acted can tell you how hard that is to do in the same film.This is one of Lynch's best films. It is filled with unforgettable scenes (Club Silencio, The audition, The casting meeting with the director and the mobsters).This is one of those films that will stay in your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mulholland Drive","review":"I'd like to shake Mr Lynch......by the neck! This film is a series of totally unconnected vignetts that really start to irritate you towards the second half of the film. You can see that he is losing his grip as the film staggers on towards the last quarter. The only thing that holds it together is the lovely use of colour throughout the film. All the shots are 50% too long. Dreams and fantasies don't make good films unless you are Andrey Tarkovsky. Disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I like deep movies, i like artsy movies, i like thinking movies. This is none of those. This is over-hyped garbage. Blue Velvet, good movie. Not great, but good. Every other thing this man has done is [junk]. He is laughing at all of us. I can only hope he is doing an experiment to prove to everyone, that a man can make movies that stink, and if he packages them well enough, he can convince everyone he is a genius. That.....is David Lynch's only genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF???","review":"PUKE!!! UGH!!! WRETCH!!! VOMIT!!! Worst movie ever! A bunch of deep nonsense. Utterly unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"how can anyone like these movies?","review":"This movie reminds me of the famous \\"last-season-was-all-a-dream\\" Dallas episode. Who wants to invest 2 hours in a movie only to find that all of the plot strands never DO connect and the excuse is, well, the whole movie was a dream and that's why nothing makes sense? A lot of other reviewers purported to like this, and I don't want to impugn their honesty, but to me it's just another case of \\"the emperor has no clothes.\\"I give it 2 stars because the pieces were interesting for about half the movie. Oh, another \\"minus\\" -- the spanish language version of \\"crying\\" was ENDLESS>"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Film For Those Who Claim They Like The Taste Of Caviar","review":"David Lynch is an acquired taste, bad taste. Another example of overused and underdeveloped Lynch film cliches. I can only imagine that folks who think this is a great film, 5 stars, are afraid that people might think they are unsophisticated if they do not drool over this and other Lynch films. Not worth purchasing for a dime at a garage sale. I mean how many damn times can one director use the dream as allegory? Alice Cooper did it better in Welcome To My Nightmare. Maybe Lynch can pick a few bucks up making bad videos for Metal Bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Simply terrible.","review":"Here's my only point of a review on this movie: Can anyone honestly tell me what this film was about?That's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably boring and slow","review":"It is seldom that I don't finish watching a movie even if I'm not enjoying it. I try to stay with it until the end,and a number of times I have been happy that I did. Mulholland Drive was so slow and boring that it was impossible to stay with it. This movie was everything that is wrong with film making; an incomprehensible plot, characters that you don't care about, actors walking through the role making it painfully clear they're just in the movie for a paycheck.The best words I can use to describe this movie are pretentious babble. Don't waste your time. If you want a solid, well-acted, intelligent film noir, purchase \\"The Man Who Wasn't There\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakiness at its best!","review":"This was the first David Lynch film I had ever seen. I was hesitant at first because after watching it I was like what the heck did I just watch but with some help I found an explanation of the events of the film that seemed to make the most sense to me. David Lynch's work is frustrating at first but if you are looking for a thinking movie and a freaky movie, then look into this one.In addition, look intoLost Highwayas well but I don't recommend buying the \\"USA\\" version (it's a Canadian manufactured import) currently as it is not the quality befitting of Lynch's greatness. Unfortunately, there are apparently other \\"good\\" versions out there but they are not made for Region 1 DVD players. Who knows if it will ever get an official United States release (it's ten years old now) but for now, rent it, enjoy it, but don't buy the Canadian import version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very odd, yet interesting, movie","review":"This movie is confusing at first (especially the last half-hour or so), though it is quite funny in some areas and erotic in others. It becomes extremely interesting and distrubing after a little thought and analysis. It's at least worth a rental--it's an interesting movie, but I don't know if I'd buy it. If you're having trouble coming up with your own interpretation, please check out www.mulholland-drive.net for some pretty good articles, before writing off the movie completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"The arroganc of hollywood directors","review":"Why do I get the feeling from Mulholland Drive that I am supposed to like it simply because David Lynch directed it. I have never before seen a film where a director played on his name as much as Mr. Lynch did in this particular movie. To be perfectly honest, I did see the film because I have always enjoyed Mr. Lynch's films in the past but expecting anyone to sit through or enjoy such a piece of unbearable tripe is pushing things a little too far. MD was not only disjointed and poorly acted, it was probably the most boring film I have ever FORCED myself to sit through. The only redeeming feature in the whole show was the disparate group of characters s l o w l y trudging their way through a badly put together piece of David Lynch's folly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of ado about nothing - strictly nothing","review":"This movie is about......well, it's not about anything. There are a lot of characters, including an amnesiac woman befriending an aspiring actress, and a movie producer that has his hand forced by weird mafiosi to cast a certain woman in his movie, but there is no coherent thread or story, not even the patina of naturalism. This is the most disjointed and pointless movie I've ever seen. It's as if a pitcher with muscular dystrophy threw symbols around until there were enough of them to make a two-hour movie....The first third was somewhat interesting, but the rest is such a meaningless jumble of symbols that it makes you hate film just on principle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Average","review":"This is not a masterpiece, nor is it in any sense horrible.THis movie was a pretty good movie, if you know what to ignore. There are plenty of scenes in this movie that you could take completely out, and it would have no effect at all. Why? Because many of the scenes are thrown in there, for apparently no reason.Yes, I got the point of the movie. But some of the dots do not connect, and a lot of people try to act smart by saying they love this movie. By saying you love a movie with some parts that made no sense, some people might be \\"What a smart person, they got it and I didn't.\\" Well, that's pretty much what it comes down to with Lynch and his fans. I know a lot of what it is symbolism and illusion. But it's just not needed.Some of the stuff that gets thrown into this movie would be like randomly throwing some paint on a finished, very well made portrait. It only hurts it and it would have been better if left out. Which is why this movie only gets 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red dot art","review":"If you're the sort of person who considers a single red dot on white canvas as the epitome of creativity and talent, this movie is for you. You can dissect the excruciatingly long scenes of dialogue between extraneous characters, the genius of unfocused shots, and symbolism of blue boxes and shrunken parental figures with other fans, pretentiously mocking those of us who \\"don't get it.\\" Here's what we don't get: those 2.5 hours of our lives back."},{"rating":"1","title":"thank god i didn't pay for my ticket","review":"i'm a big movie fan, and i like almost anything. but this was the worst movie i've ever seen. i've never heard a whole movie theater laughing in unison at how bad a movie was before. we got a free sneak preveiw and all left saying \\"thank god i didn't pay to see this.\\" the movie is beyond strange, and beyong borning. for those who saw it their are 2 maybe three scenes i enjoyed and u know which ones those were."},{"rating":"1","title":"highly overrated","review":"The only virtue that I can say that this movie has is that, unlike most movies, it leaves you wondering what the story is. Therefore, it not just another movie in that respect. In other words, if you think a plot that doesn't make sense makes a good movie, then this movie is for you. I wouldn't rewatch it to understand the story better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually appealing but nonsensical","review":"First of all, I write this as a fan of David Lynch movies. Please disregard all those \\"top reviewers\\" who have nothing better to do than write reviews on this web site. And disregard all those people who say you have to be smart or open-minded to understand this movie. Bottom line: this movie makes absolutely no sense. Even after the supposed \\"explanation\\" for this movie - sorry Mr Lynch - it still makes no sense, and it is just an exercise in frustration to try and figure it out. Anyone who says they understand this movie just wants to be part of the crowd.This movie has great cinematography and some excellent dramatic scenes; one of my favorites being the scene in the theatre toward the end. The acting is superb. Sounds like a formula for a great movie but unfortunately its a convoluted mess with an even more convoluted ending.Unless you are a big fan of David Lynch avoid this film. For the average movie-goer it just won't be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one","review":"This DVD does not have scene selection--the first DVD I have ever seen that does not have this feature.

Not because it is bad all the through but because it is a great movie for 3/4's of the way through and then completely falls apart. It has wonderful David Lynchisms and is stylistically appealing. Creepy, sexy, mysterious and quirky yet maintains a linear path and you really want to know what happens. Then the last 1/4 is as if it is a completely different film with the same actors (although you may not be able to tell who's who). It turns into a surreal mess with no explanation for anything that you have seen in the first part. While visually interesting, a frustrating waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"DO NOT buy the DVD version","review":"The movie was interesting, frustrating, captivating, puzzling and bizarre. The other reviews can shed more light on the movie. I wanted to comment on the DVD itself. This must be the first DVD released by the manufacturer! The DVD lacks any interesting extra features and also lacks the most basic of DVD features. The worst part about the DVD is the lack of chapters. If you want to return to a part in the movie, you must fast forward through the entire movie! Hopefully, the will re-release this DVD with at least the basic DVD features."},{"rating":"1","title":"No story line, very unorganized and sloppy","review":"Okay! I'll admit I liked, no I loved the girl-girl scenes between Laura Harring and Naomi Watts (especially the bedroom one). Besides those, there was no other good part to the movie. I think the ending [stunk] majorly, not summing up the story in any way, and the whole name change thing was confusing. Tere are some people that liked this movie, and who am I to argue, I can understand liking it for its mystery, it just wasn't my type of movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seven faces of Eve?","review":"...P>My problem with this movie is that the purpose of this medium is to relay amessage. Whether the Writer/Director intends this message to be purelyentertainment based (Bruckheimer), or expects the viewers to work a littleharder (i.e. Memento). Lynch seems to have decided that his cult followingis enough and there is no need to tell anyone what this message is. Thefact that he tries to bail himself out by tossing in some eye-candy and agirl on girl sex scene is apalling. We the viewers are expected to bemesmorized into watching this movie because it has pretty people in it, allthe while praying that the answer to the puzzle that Lynch lays out in thefirst half of the movie will be answered in an acceptable manner.This movie provides a ringing endorsement, as well as a reminder, to avoidfuture Lynch projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dark side of Hollywood","review":"Lot of people are trying to get in to Hollywood.

I really did. But for the life of me, I can't see how it's received so much praise. The story makes great efforts to throw in a twist at the end ... but the preparation leading up to it makes such little sense that you know it's coming so it's no surprise. There is little or no music to add suspense/emotion/etc. to the plot, and there are about a billion common-sense questions that go unanswered. This was one of the worst movies I've ever watched."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!!","review":"This movie was strange, perplexing, and unsatisfying. Even after reading several of the five-star reviews on this site, I still do not understand why this movie got such critical acclaim, or why it was nominated for an academy award.I rented this movie because of the rave reviews quoted on the cover, claiming that it was \\"hypnotic\\" \\"beautiful\\" and \\"suspenseful\\". Talk about false advertising - was I ever surprised! It was one of the worst movies I can ever remember watching. The beginning is somewhat interesting, but it quickly deteriorates into a confusing, tedious, rambling mess. I kept hoping that it would improve, but it didn't. Sitting through this film was an unpleasant experience..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This [was bad]!!!","review":"If you ever want to feel like you're on a bad acid trip just rent this movie.

Hang it up until you can put out something good ol'Davey, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I stayed up very late watching this movie becuase I was waiting to see how it would come together at the end. I'm still waiting. It started out with intruiging plot lines then disintegrated into artistic babble. I wasn't aware of this director's history prior to buying the DVD. Had I been I would have passed. If you are the type that can find deep meaning in a painting consisting of splatters and splashes then by all means buy this movie.

No Scene Selection for this DVD!!!","review":"I'm a big fan of David Lynch and I was really looking forward to getting this film on DVD. Upon release, I picked up the disc and only after throwing it in my player did I realize there is no scene selection menu! What's up with that? No jumping to a scene for this disc! Maybe its in the works for the \\"limited collector's special hard to find\\" version. Great movie, but being spoiled by just about every other DVD that have more features than they deserve, the very least Universal should have done was provide scene selection. It is one of the best features of DVD. Oddly enough, letterbox, sub-titles & languages (Spanish and French) are in tact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spectacular movie, wretched DVD","review":"Mulholland Drive is one of my favorite movies, but I regret that I cannot recommend buying the Mulholland Drive DVD. Though reasonable in theory, David Lynch's decision to present the entire film as one chapter on the DVD is in fact a terrible idea, for reasons of unfortunate technical reality.If you a typical blundering idiot like me, you sometimes scratch a CD or DVD. If your DVD player finds a scratch, it can freak out and jump to the beginning of the current chapter. Woe be the David Lynch fan, for his scratch will deliver him back to the beginning of Mulholland Drive, from whence he has to fast-forward to find his place again. Talk about a breach of cinematic continuity.My advice is to (a) rent it while some copies are still scratchless (b) buy it on VHS or (c) be vewwy cayfow with your Mulholland Drive DVD. Don't lend it to any David Cronenberg fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie=awesome dvd= rip off","review":"I love mulholland Drive. i absolutly adore the movie, but this dvd release is the only material thing i have ever seen that actually made me angry. Not only is there no bonus features. but theres no scene selection. What is the point of having a dvd if there is no bonus material or at least a scene selection. Now the one thing that makes me want to grab every copy of this dvd and destroy it is that its edited. THE MOVIE IS CENSORED.

It is made up of one chapter, one 2 hour and 20 minute chapter!Others have speculated on why the DVD was manufactured in this way-did David Lynch request that it be distributed without interruption? Who knows, and more to the point, who cares. From one consumer to another, I recommend that you pass on this DVD, especially at $32 retail."},{"rating":"1","title":"goes downhill","review":"This was a great movie until, unfortunately, David Lynch has no idea how to end it.

I'm not sure why they didn't take easier words, such as cut/cat, dog/dig, etc. Instead we have oddities like six/sax and ten/tin. There is a strong presumption that not only does the child know her numbers, but she also knows how to spell them???Also, an oddly sadistic streak to this book. A pig gets uprooted from his home into a pan, a squirrel loses his food, a kid has problems with his book, and worst of all, a mother bear holding her cub has the cub turned into a corn cob. That could be rather distressing to a child with a little imagination and ability to project.This could have been a much better book had more thought gone into the word selection.

If you're looking for a fun, realistic reflection of the joys and hardships of living abroad, read Tim Parks or Frances Meyer. Peter Mayle is a snob and he patronizes his neighbors. I really wanted to like his books, but I don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toujours Provence is better","review":"It was interesting reading the first book after having read Toujours Provence. Of the two I prefer Toujours for it's vingette style of wrapping the author's autobiographical elements around the eccentric lives of those he meets. In A Year in Provence, it's exactly that, twelve chapters that start in January and go linearly through to December. Both are valid story telling methods but I think that the thematic method used in the sequel made for a more entertaining book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"I really enjoyed the book.

However, for someone who does not know French, I wish Mr. Mayle had used less French interspersed where English would have sufficed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Delicious & Inspiring Year in Provence.","review":"Spend a delicious year in Provence in a matter of days! Every stereotype of the Parisians (apparently and resoundingly true after reading this book) will be proven accurate through the light-hearted insights and (mis)adventures of a Brit ex-pat who moved to France on a whim. This charming and cleverly written read authentically relives each month/season though the eyes of a transplant in search of just simply living life. Who of all people knows better than the French? You'll be envious/inspired through his ingenious storytelling/observances. Maybe even find yourself in a love/hate (more love, come to think of it) relationship of somebody who one day left everything behind in the safe zone and threw themselves precariously in the middle of joie de vie.*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cultural information presented with humor","review":"If you are looking for travel information for spending a week in Provence, this is not the book. Instead try Rick Steve's tour books or other sources. However, if you want to go deeper than just tourist sites and Roman history of the area, this is an excellent book. It gives a lot of cultural info of the locals. It would help you to understand both the people and the area better. To top it off, the book has a lot of humors that even my 11 year old daughter find it interesting and funny. She finished the book before I did. The only \\"cons\\" is the book contains some French words or phrases from time to time without any translations. It would be nice if the editors of the book put a footnote for each of those phrases, especially for non-French speaking readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor and Food - En Francais","review":"This being my first encounter with Mr. Mayle's writing, I enjoy the spunk his writing style brings to one's experience of life in Provence.Oh yes, the food and drink are foremost.

One year in the life of a boring snob, even worse, a food snob. Peter Mayle does nothing to help us understand another culture. No truffles of wisdom here.Read this book if you want twelve chapters of the eating habits of an elitist snob. My advice - if you get the chance to read this book, don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich Snob Ruins Good Writing Career with This Garbage","review":"I like Peter Mayle's fiction a lot, but when you meet him as a character, you wonder why a fictional snob is fun but a real one isn't. Maybe because his characters actually have jobs and lives, while he's a dilletante who spends his time eating and complaining. Some people dream of doing what he did. I don't. He runs away from the real world, moves into a house most of us could never afford, and glorifies the life of the idle semi-rich.Despite a good writing style, Mayle fails to make this book accessible to those of us whose lives are not about leisure time and food. I wonder if this man ever for one second realizes just how condescending he is, or how out of touch his snotty way of life has gotten. I would much rather he stayed at home in London and got a real job.Skip this book unless you really care about how well the French seemingly eat. And truthfully, I don't really believe half of what he wrote about the peasantry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not badly written, just boring.","review":"The fault may be mine. I think travel diary is just not my genre. I appreciate stories driven by plot and rich characters (the only rich character in this story is the food!). I kept asking myself where the book was heading, but basically it was just heading to the next dining experience, home improvement project, or inconsiderate guest. If I hadn't been reading the book for a book club meeting, I never would have bothered finishing it.That being said, the writing does flow nicely. The book is well written, and some of the experiences are fun to read. If you enjoy travelogues, you will probably enjoy this book.Warning: If this book were a movie, it would be rated PG-13 due to one strong expletive that blindsides you as you are reading along."},{"rating":"1","title":"a year in provence","review":"This book was a great idea (and had great cover art), but it killed the dream of provence in me and left me cold and bloodless...

I guess this book is \\"of an era,\\" written by a man whose life had been in advertising, and so with an eye on popular appeal. As such, it was not gritty enough for me; it was too comfortable and quirky, reminding me of a BBC rural sitcom. Mayle portrays himself as a homey bumpkin, sensitive to the butchery of animals, but on the other hand, he'll let nothing stand in the way of his stomach, and will as enthusiastically devour veal--ignoring the implications of torturing the children of other animals--as ask which wine goes best with calves liver. Sorry, Peter, it was all just a little too quaint and not reflective enough for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly overrated","review":"The appeal of this book is in the fact that Mayle has created a Shangri-La for his readers. But at what price? He has fabricated a world that does not exist, just as Disney created a home spun fantasy on Main Street USA. This Provence did not and does not exist. I don't argue the value of fantasy, but to sell it to the masses as an accurate representation of southern France does everyone an incredible disservice. This book is a fiction.

The people of Mayle's adopted country are represented with respect, something that is not always found in the travel genre, and there is the strong feeling that Mayle loves the country because of it's inhabitants. For me, like many others, this book has inspired travel plans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully charming and witty..both the book and the author","review":"A charming story about an English couple who vow to someday move to Provence. The story captures their first year experiences of life as know in Provence, and the comedy of life in the French countryside. The writer is clever and the book incredibly charming and funny; I could not stop laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provence","review":"Peter Mayle created a genre with his first book set in Provence, France. He is a keen observer of human behavior, and when combined with his sense of humour, he writes wry accounts of of his exeriences renovating a house in the Luberon. This is a funny, enjoyable read, both rewarding in information and lighthearted in tone. I highly recommend it.Gordon Bitney,author of 'PROVENCE, je t'aime'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and see for yourself!","review":"A French national, 4th generation \\"provenale\\" (from Provence), I couldn't help being both surprised and annoyed by the controversy around Peter Mayle's book. I loved his work and so did my whole family, still living in Provence. We found it refreshing to see our little world seen through a British eye, and got a real kick out of all the anecdotes. My (American) husband along with his parents read the book as well before discovering Provence and my family for the first time and enjoyed it tremendously.My advice to you, potential reader: do not pay attention to negative comments about this book. Read it and make your OWN opinion. You may love it or not.And if you end up touring in Provence, you're in for an unforgettable experience, especially if you avoid Summer months (Anyway the light in September is THE best), and if you get to know locals. This is better than any guide book. it is Provence from within... Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to Provence","review":"Provence is my favourite place on earth. Peter Mayle's book is junk.

Not a stalker-really.This novel will make you want to pack up and journey to the south of France. Must take French lessons first!I have only one complaint, I found myself craving the foods described and had to purchase a book on the cooking of Provence to replicate them. Yummy.......Who wouldn't like to experience a goat race? That and stories of the neighbors will have you laughing out loud. This is an enjoyable read for those armchair travelers and more.Now, I'm reading more of Peter Mayle's novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"I love this book. If you love French culture and food and wine, this is the book for you. It is well-written and makes me yearn for a vacation in the South of France."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful memoir","review":"Peter Mayle and his wife fulfill a longtime fantasy by leaving their native England and living in Provence. The chapters of this book have titles of the months of the year as Mayle writes about the interesting weather and the more interesting inhabitants that they find in their adopted land during their first 12 months. Running throughout the book is the progress, or lack of progress, with the home renovation which is going on. Sometimes for no particular reason, the workers decide to go elsewhere or just take some time off from their labors. The French temperament dictates that time is of little importance, and work is not always valued as much as fellowship and breaking bread together. Author Mayle brings a wry, self-deprecating wit and a keen sense of observation to bear on the customs of Provence and this book is a humorous and delightful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took about 7 years to finish, once I got into it I really enjoyed it","review":"I bought this book sometime in college (I think it was an impulse purchase because I was into travel books and this seemed interesting), read 20 pages and put it down. Fast forward years later after graduation/working/getting married I was able to get into it and finally finished the book. I think the reason I couldn't get into it before was because a) I didn't cook, b) I've never been to Provence. Having gotten into shows like Top Chef and whatever looked good on the Food Network recently, I was able to appreciate the delicious food descriptions and hunting truffle scenes in the book. Plus having visited the region, I was certainly able to appreciate the book better. So yeah, this is definitely an enjoyable read! Right now I'm listening to Mayle's \\"Encore Provence\\" on audio book and plan to watch the movie based on his other novel \\"A Good Year.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely visit to France-for its Italian=read AS THE ROMANS DO","review":"I read and re-read A Year in Provence and longed for the European sensibilities; the sensual, amusing, delicious ways. Then I visited France and although it was beautiful I found it lacking in something that I couldn't put my finger on. Then I visited Italy and my life changed. Years went by and I finally took the plunge and moved to the place that captured my heart, bella Roma. Then recently I read the new book by Alan Epstein, As the Romans Do: The Delights, Dramas and Daily Diversions of Life in the Eternal City and he described exactly what it was I was feeling. If you didn't get enough with a Year in Provence or if you love Italy as much or more than France then you MUST read As the Romans Do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twee, boring and patronising","review":"Who could imagine that such a dreary book could come from such a delighful place.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Year in Provence seemed like 10 years in Provence","review":"I just could not stay interested in this book.

Most of the experiences represent the every day ones we all go through e.g. hiring someone to do work on our house, meeting neighbors through a party, etc. However, the people in Provence have a decidedly different perspective and character, and thus these ordinary experiences appear strange, fascinating and entertaining. This effect comes in part from Mr. Mayle's wit, writing style and emotional reactions to the events of his life. I particularly liked his description of the dress (leather), method of arrival (motorcycle) and behavior and attitudes of students coming into a certain town-absolutely precious. As with the French, food and drink in a Mayle book take an exalted status."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"This was a sweet look at how culture shock can be a positive thing. Life in Provence is ideal in many ways- the towns are real communities. Peter Mayle and his wife discover interesting characters who become friends, neighbors with funny stories, and the glories of wonderful food and wine (the book WILL make you hungry). I really liked all the descriptions and am now hankering to get away myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fine escape from the mundane travel writing we see now.","review":"Mayle presents travel escapism at it's best, although this book should be digested in small portions to avoid the feeling that you've eaten too much candy. Mayle's Provencal lifestyle and the true, colourful characters he encounters in his day-to-day life are just the ticket for the hordes of stressed-out office workers who are still three months away from vacation who seem to read his books.In all, a book to be celebrated.

The songs have excellent edits between different years of performances. I have heard of the studio enhancing rumors too, and they are obvious in a few places. Great sound quality all around, and excellent performing! My only regret is the playlist. The Joe Walsh songs came out great but seem out of place for this collection. And why did they include the \\"Doolin-Dalton Reprise II?\\"(obviously a Bill Szymczyk studio creation) So many other classic tunes should have been substituted in place of LBG, ANL, and Doolin Dalton... Perhaps there were no pristine multitrack recordings fit enough to work into the collection. The total playing time is about 77 minutes-- so much more could have been inserted here. Hopefully someday the album will be remastered with extra tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"One From The Road","review":"I recently purchased this recording without any preconceived ideas....I just saw it and bought it.

The whole set is quite good - for a live set. I'm not sure what all the complaints regarding the remastering are all about. A live album is going to have flaws that's why they are \\"touched up\\" for listener appeal; there's no such thing as a flawless concert.This set is, for me, a good introduction to the Eagles music.

The proofs are very enlightening, and even though they are constructive (wich perhaps is what it benefits it most) the book still remains pocket-size, unlike the more commercial treatises on the subject. It also deals with matricial algebra, bilinear forms and inner product spaces. The exercises while interesting, are perhaps not enough.

It takes them from feelings they experience when a loved one is sick, right now, all the way through to handling the funeral and the death of someone so close.

The hero is satisfyingly desperate for his recalcitrant bride, and the heroine handles his obnoxious family in a delightfully assertive and humorous way.

Mr. Silver picked wonderful subject matter for his book, the rich and storied histories in Savannah, but he can't capture it and the book has contridictions galore. The introduction is almost unreadable, the book is often boring and not as entertaining as the personality of the author. I met him at his shop in Savannah and I heard him say over and over that evening, \\" I wrote Great Balls of Fire!\\" by way of introduction.

The author's first-hand experience makes this real and human. There is some language in the book, meaning sensitive or young readers need Mom or Dad to do some gentle editing. Some of the scenes include graphic descriptions of injuries. With above-mentioned editing, I believe the book appropriate for mid-to-older teens and adults, especially those with a bend toward trauma nursing, like my daughter -- who thoroughly enjoyed the book (after editing).debbie in Texas"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! Entertaining, touching, emotional, informative","review":"I bought this book because I am in nursing school and personally aspire to be a flight nurse. This book was wildly entertaining as Janice Hudson's way of writing is very informal, descriptive and emotional. I particulary enjoyed this book because it takes place in the bay area with which I am very familiar. Two of my favorite memiors of her's are written about the '89 San Francisco earthquake and the '92 Oakland Hills fire - both of which offer a unique perspective only to be appreciated by reading her personal experiences. This book is a quick and easy read, never boring and often very informative with regards to the scope of practice in flight nursing. Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in EMS, prehospital medicine, or nursing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

But...it's really not my type of book. It actually reminds me of the books I used to read in 6th grade -- lots of corny dialogue (often \\"muttered\\" in head of the author, to herself), manufactured personal drama, and, for good measure, a juvenile story about flatulence in the first chapter. I think it's a fine book for people who like this author's writing style, but it definitely wasn't my thing at all. I much prefer books like COUNTY: Life, Death and Politics at Chicago's Public Hospital by David Ansell, M.D., in which the author provides a bit of reflection and insight to go along with the medical situations he attends to.

It will give you a glimpse into the world of nursing and emergency medicine. Good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe I only paid about $ for this book!","review":"I was surprised how many things this book had going for it. I was interested in the topic, and I just happened across it on the majorly discounted rack. The chapters are grouped by subjects and incidents. Hudson did a great job of not only limiting material to the interesting annecdotes, but in not going on endlessly about nothing. The medical terminology will be difficult for the unfamiliar, but there is little of that, and she explains most of it. The themes in the book seem like those related in other EMS stories, but these are very well told.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reporting, great information","review":"As a newspaper reporter who covers health and fitness, and someone who's had acne-prone skin for 20 years, I'm impressed with this book. Preston did a lot of research and covers all the bases. It's clearly and concisely written, with a lot of little tidbits of information that help us to make informed decisions about our skin care. For example, many of the benzoyl peroxide products on drugstore shelves are 10 percent strength -- but for most of us, 2.5 percent or 5 percent gives the same acne-fighting benefits without all the dryness and redness and irritation. There's a great appendix in back detailing what products contain which ingredients. Preston has suffered from acne herself, and her writing reflects that. I was left with the impression that she knows exactly how you feel -- which is very comforting. A very helpful and reassuring book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for acne sufferers","review":"As woman in my mid-thirities, I've suffered from adult-onset acne for the last 15 years. With the help of my dermatologist, I've run the gammut of treatments from her office, from birth control pills to Acccutane. But still, I have acne. I finally quit going a few months ago to sort out what I wanted to do and to educate myself better. One trip to my library found this gem, \\"Breaking Out\\". It is easy to read, no nonsense, and thorough. More importantly, the author doesn't have an agenda to sell me products. I read the book quickly, and feel educated and empowered to know exactly the course I want to take with my skin and my body now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Guide to Understanding Acne","review":"I am not sure why this book is specifically aimed at women since it is a great guide to the causes of acne and to all the different treatment options that are available. Preston is a journalist whose research skills really shine through in this work. I would say that this book is a great read for someone who wants a comprehensive background about acne. Since the book came out in 2004 there have been some new advances in acne treatments, but nevertheless the book gives you plenty of information and will teach you a lot too. The book is clearly written and very useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I read through this book from cover to cover and decided it wasn't going to work with my group.

A paycheck is a paycheck,and so Judy needed the money. The parts are very miscast, the story line embarressing. \\"BlueBird\\" and \\"By Myself, Alone- shine. The title song- a joke.

Judy deserved better and the Oscar for \\"A Star Is Born\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film!","review":"I was able to snatch a copy of this at my local Border's (for some reason, they put it out early), and I was extremely impressed with the quality of the transfer. I watched the widescreen version as opposed to full-screen. I HATE full-screen presentations. You will not be sorry you got this film! No extras, really, but the film makes up for it. Good quality, great acting, good story, AMAZING singing by Judy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What? Not anamorphic?","review":"Sad! Really sad! Here I've been waiting for years for this beauty to be released on DVD, and what do I get: Non-anamorphic 2.35:1! Hey, MGM, this is 2004! No one produces \\"scope\\" movies on DVD any longer without having them enhanced for widescreen televisions. When enlarged they turn fuzzy and dull, and if you let them stay within the 4:3-frame you get a tiny image in the middle of your screen. Yes, MGM has at least cleaned up the dirt from the image since the LaserDisc release, but it's still pretty grainy with difficult contrasts and variable color intensity from scene to scene. In other words: a sloppy transfer done with minimal enthusiasm! Sad! Really sad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Judy goes out with a bang","review":"This is one of my very favorite Judy Garland movies because the plot is almost haunting and because Judy plays such a multifaceted person. Jenny Bowman is a lot like Judy Garland and perhaps because of that viewers can identify with her and relate to her. In this film Judy plays a concert singer who is reunited with her estranged son and decides that she wants nothing more than to be a mother. Of course the movie ends dramatically and tragically (can Judy do it any other way?). It's a great movie, not just because of the story, but also because it includes Judy singing many original songs. We get to see Judy do so many different things in her final feature film role and she goes out with a bang."},{"rating":"2","title":"the lady still has it","review":"\\"I Could Go on Singing\\" warrants most of the criticism & praise it's received - over-the-top soap opera with Garland edgy & brimming, her voice spilling over the lines like a none-too-carefully-wielded crayon in a coloring book, but the colors are vivid and the pleasures here are significant - even if they come more from incidentals than the central meat. Garland was just so SMART, innately: her intelligence and wit inform many lovely little asides and inflections - her speaking voice insinuates & encompasses with the musical dark flush of a viola. She's great to watch - even if the film itself is a pretty hoary flapping affair. However varying the quality of the material or its expression, you can't take your eyes off her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judy went out with a Bang!","review":"This is probably in my top five favorite Judy movies! She is and always will be the greatest entertainer who ever lived. This film shows that Judy was an amazing actress! In the early MGM days, she made some fabulous films, but they never gave her the chance to play a dramatic role she deserved. I think another reason Judy was so amazing in this film is that she practically lived the life of Jenny Bowman. I also love the plot, Judy is kind of an Auntie Mame charecter, anyone who's seen the film knows what I'm talking about. It's a great movie for anyone who likes Judy, drama, or just a damned good film! What's also interesting is that in the hospitol scene (which I'm sure most of you know) Judy helped write a great deal of the dialogue. I'm glad they finally gave us a dvd of this film. I've been waiting forever! I actually paid $80 for a vhs copy of it a few years ago! But of course I still bought the dvd lol, after all, IT'S JUDY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garland's Swansong Before Going Over the Rainbow","review":"Garland's last film is melodramatic and over-the-top but absolutely fascinating! The singing sequences, including the vibrant \\"Hello, Bluebird\\", \\"By Myself\\", and the riveting title number, reveal the true depth of Judy's extraordinary talent. Dirk Bogarde is stoic but effective as Jenny Bowman's former lover, and Jack Klugman hits the right note as her manager, but this is Garland's film, and her performance is emotionally raw and vulnerable. Unfortunately her appearance and weight (some of those witchy hairstyles---yikes!) fluctuate noticeably throughout the film, and she is poorly dressed for the most part (the one exception being the blue sequin ensemble in \\"Hello Bluebird\\"). One also wishes that the film had retained it's original, and far more effective, title, \\"The Lonely Stage\\". Despite these drawbacks, you shouldn't miss the opportunity to see one of the 20th century's great film artists show you what it's all about. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Judy's Stellar Cinematic Swang Song","review":"I can't add too much to what many other people here before me have written. I just wanted to add my own two cents to note that this movie is indeed underrated including because of its totally remastered widescreen presentation as shown on TCM tonight, 8/6/09. I'm noticing that in this, her last film, ironically this one has a very glossy, very \\"Metro\\" look. It seemed as if it could've been one made by Judy as a returning actress to MGM, if that studio had ever made it and she'd returned one more time. Not many people note that when reviewing this film. Judy was filmed, recorded, lighted, and performed in this film as good as, if not counting A Star Is Born, maybe since 'Til The Clouds Roll By or Words And Music, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great! But Wires Tangle Easily.","review":"Just got this for my home owner's association board meetings. Has good sound quality and does the job. My only complaint is with the wiring. The cords are nice and long to be able to reach from our office to the meeting table on the main floor, which is fantastic. But the wires are easily tangled since one cord goes to the main unit then splits off for the power line, the phone line and there's also a video connector. Being used, I didn't get instructions with it so it took me a couple of minutes to figure out the connections. Since the wires are all connected instead of being separate, it makes them a little unmanageable - except for the power adapter which detaches from the main line half way up the cord. I've used a couple of wire wraps and color coded tape to identify which is which for other board members who are not as electronically literate as I.Beside that, I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bogen Teleconference Phone","review":"Phone works great and was NIB.

After that I got two for medium room and I put one in my bedroom and one in my bathroom. Several weeks later I found one silverfish in my bedroom (near the repeller) then I thought these things might be pest attractors. So I unplugged the one in my bedroom and put it in the kitchen.

In this mediocre British comedy, Sellers plays a crook in prison, a prison more like a health farm. This must be one of his weakest performances. There is little opportunity for the mimicry which really was his specialty. Without that, Sellers is simply not much of an actor and dull to boot. With a familiar cast of British comedians, in particular the always hilarious Irene Handl, the film has some amusing lines but most of the jokes are too broad without the subtlety of the best of British. There are also some very coarse moments which are worthy of 3rd rate music hall comedy.It is worth noting that the print is good but there are no extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch heel!","review":"Bought these for my son to use for soccer and t-ball.

I would give this novel 0 stars if Amazon allowed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooooo Bad","review":"This was my 11th Walters' books and I'm thankful that it wasn't my first as it would have been my last. I read about 20 books a month so I think I have a good opinion on what's good and what's not!:) I had such a hard time keeping up with all the various characters and who was who and why. As one character stated in the book, \\" Couldn't see the wood for the trees. \\" Considering this is her most recent work, maybe she is just wrung dry????????????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standards","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. Walters' other books (particularly her early ones) are marked by graceful writing, subtle character development, (at times) creepy psychological insights into the more twisted parts of human nature, and well paced suspense. This book missed on all four counts. I wondered initially why the book was not released first in hardcover in the United States; having read it, I think I know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this book","review":"Despite all the negative reviews, I actually enjoyed reading this book and thought it was well-written overall. I found the book engrossing and hard to put down. The \\"book chapter\\" within the book and the emails correspondence actually did add a lot to the story once you understood why they were there. It was nice as a reader to be asked to figure out some of the evidence for yourself without just having it pre-digested and handed to you. I have not read all of Minette Walters books, but the of the few I have read, it does seem that she gets better and better with each subsequent book. I plan on reading more of her works and especially like that they are not all about the same characters or settings, so they can be read in any order without missing vital information. I would recommend this book as a good read for a mystery lover and fan of psychology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Minette Walters; Hated This Book","review":"I've read all her books. Usually, they're great. This one was awful; full of her far-left political views. Just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have great admiration for Walters but was very let down by this effort. The two protagonists were interesting and I settled in to enjoy their progress only to find them used to insert political opinions and exhibit personality quirks, which served no purpose in the total context of the narrative. Halfway through a female of interest is inserted into the story to provide a quick solution to the male leads low self-esteem. His phobias and anxieties were deeply real, but too quickly resolved for belief. And while the main characters were tied up rather too neatly, the murder mystery is left inconclusive. On the way the reader must muddle through dialog that is used to examine innumerable scenarios, and keep track of email addresses in the intros to e-mails so you knew who was \\"speaking.\\" This grew annoying, as it was too much like being at the office. And although I did manage to finish the story in a few evenings, I did come to the end feeling it was a waste of valuable time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous and verbose - not the usual Minette Walters fare!","review":"I agree with those in the majority who have reviewed this book. It was a terribly boring story and hard to follow at times. I am a huge Minette Walters fan. In my opinion, she's right up there with Ruth Rendell. She normally writes very captivating stories with a true storyteller's touch but this veered off in quite a different direction than anything else I have read by her. The word by word e-mails from one character to another were dreadful. I found myself skimming over them. It appeared to me that they were put there to take up page space because they certainly were not there to enrich the story or provide anything of interest. There wasn't even really a mystery here. It was obvious what was going on right away. I did not care for this book one bit. The two star rating is because I do love this author and one star would just be shameful (although two stars seems generous)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disordered Editing","review":"You can usually rely on Minette Walters for a seminar on criminally disturbed minds. There's some of that in this novel but it's way, way too long. Ms. Walters introduces us to an interesting character in George (female), a councillor trying to unravel a couple of long-ago murders blamed on a young man with mental disabilities. She teams up with a professor with an enormous chip on his shoulder.The two of them go off investigating and the book bogs down into hypothesis after hypothesis after hypothesis. It just goes on and on. If it hadn't been a Minette Walters book I would have put it down unfinished, but I kept hoping it was going to click into gear. It didn't.Where was the editor? The book could have been whacked down to about half its length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This isn't a great book. The characters aren't that interesting, the plot isn't believable, and the writing is at times, for Walters, pretty average. It didn't make much of an impression on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"comprehensive and not too dry (pun)","review":"I agree with all the above praise. The book was meticulously researched and well written. Great personal recollections from the people who were there.There were two minor annoyances1. The author repeats himself fairly often.2. You get bounced back and forth in time a bit. From pre-prohibition to post and then to the 90's then back to WWII.Minor issues that probably won't bother you unless you're reading the book on and off over the course of a couple of weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sizzling California Recipes!","review":"I've been enjoying California Sizzles since my daughter gave me a copy several years ago, and had to find another one as a gift for a friend. I have had nothing but raves over anything I make from this collection, and think the book is a MUST on the shelf!I love having the recipe on one page, written clearing enough to read as you work. In fact, I've changed to copying the pages, inserting in plastic page covers and keeping my favorites in a notebook.

Worked well"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I was very exicited to give this toy to my 9-month old daughter for her first Christmas. Every time we played with it in the store she couldn't get enough. Finally, Christmas came and Pooh came out of the box...the only way this thing works is if you push its' tummy. It never works when we shake the rattle. Sometimes it will be sitting in the other room with no one around and start singing. I certainly won't recommend this to anyone in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary Pooh","review":"This Pooh looks like he is having a seizure! He's pretty freaky in our opinion. And I don't like the \\"baby\\" look; he doesn't even look like Pooh."},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERY 6+ month old should have one!!","review":"My Mother got this for my Son. And he L-O-V-E-D it! Once he figured it out, it became the favourite toy! Since it responds to loud noise, my Son figure it out and use to talk to it. SO cute to witness them reacting to a moving toy!I think it is very entertaining to them and great for their co-ordination and motor skills.A must-have toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Cute!","review":"There are a lot of cute toys out there, but this one was definitely one of the cutest. Not only is Pooh cute, but the noises he makes and the music he emits is perfect for a little baby. Babies will be entranced by both his movements and sounds. People will find that Pooh will make an adorable \\"friend\\" for their babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised the value hasn't gone down in a year","review":"My mother-in-law bought this Pooh for my daughter for Christmas 2002. It was difficult for my then 7 month old daughter to use. you need to put the rattle in front of Pooh's rattle to make it go, and my daughter wants to wave teh rattle more freely. After a year, my daughter is still having a hard time with it, so we just push Pooh's stomach to make him dance and sing. I figured this item would be gone by now, but I see it is still selling big this year. Definitely not worth $25, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken within a month of little use.....","review":"My husband and I bought Pooh when my son was 5 mos. At first he was scared of Pooh. Then when he did warm up to him, he treated the rattle and Pooh as two different toys. (I guess too young for the cause and effect of the toy) Pooh was very hard to understand, but my son still liked him. After a few weeks with not that much use, he broke completely!!!! What makes me upset is that poor Chicken Dance Elmo got such a low review by the editor and this piece of junk got such a good one. Yeah, Elmo is loud, maybe even annoying, but hey, my son loves him, he isn't broken yet, and you can actually understand him!!!!!!! I guess I need to pay more attention to the parents reviews and not the editor!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprised","review":"My husband and I could not wait to buy this toy for our 6 1/2 month old. However much to our suprise my child did not like it at all. He was very afraid of the shaking motion pooh makes when you shake the rattle. Our son is 8 months now and will hug pooh but is still a little leary when he's switched on. This is a great educational toy that baby activates himself, however, Moms and Dads might want to try it out with there child in the store first. Its a lot of money for a toy your child doesn't like."},{"rating":"2","title":"The age-appropriate level is too low","review":"My daughter got this item as a gift for Christmas. She was about 10 months old and she did not understand that the rattle needs to be directly in front of the pooh for it to work. She finally realized how to use it at the age of 15 months and she loves it. It is a great toy but not for younger babies that doesnt understand that it needs to be directly in front of the pooh. So unless your child is a little older than the recommended age i wouldnt recommend buying it until a later age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very fun","review":"My daughter received this toy for her 1st birthday. It's a cute concept -but it doesn't work. You have to be very close while you are shaking the rattle and you have to shake it very hard. And I can't understand a thing that Pooh is saying! My daughter loves to shake the rattle - but I wouldn't recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy is a RIP OFF!!","review":"My mother bought this toy before my son was even born... we saw on the comercials how the baby shakes the rattle and winnie the pooh is supposed to shake, yeah right that rattle doesn't do anything you have to keep pushing the toys stomach to make it move. It was a waste of money!What a RIP OFF!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"We bought this toy for our 6 month old for Christmas because it looked very cute on T.V. It is really hard to get the thing to shake! I thought it was just running low on battery power so I changed the battery but still...getting Pooh to shake and sing takes work! My son cant make him dance on his own, you have to shake the rattle very hard right in front of the toy. Cute premise, but pretty useless in its design. Im pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"We're a little jaded.","review":"I also was dissapointed by this toy. The commercial on tv makes it look like a blast, and my son loves winnie the pooh. We would always show it to him in the store and he would smile and reach for it. Finally, we bought it when he was 8 1/2 months old and he could care less about it. My husband and I play with it more than him trying to show him what to do.After you press pooh's stomach, you shake the rattle near pooh's rattle which can be a little tricky sometimes. My son just winds up putting the rattle in his mouth and playing with the rattle alone. Hopefully he'll grow into it so we don't feel like we wasted the money.One sidenote though; One time my son was crying loudly and I was trying to cheer him with the toy and I noticed it is also activated by screaming children!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was so excited, but now disappointed!!","review":"I want everyone to know that I was sold on this item from the commercial alone. When we put it in front of our 6 month old daughter, we could hardly understand Pooh's voice. It is very hard to understand what he is saying. Then we did everything we could to get him to move when we shook the rattle, but he only moved when the rattle was right next to him. We tried new batteries, but he sounded and reacted the same. I was so excited about this item, but now I am very disappointed. I am returning it to the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best interactive toy!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this toy for my 6 month old son and he loves it. He really wasn't interested in rattles until I bought this toy. He shakes the rattle constantly to keep Pooh moving and the music playing. I would highly recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must know magic if you can get it to work....","review":"We received the Magic Rattle Pooh as a Christmas gift for our infant son. There were no instructions with the toy. I had to come to this website to learn the mechanics of how the toy operated. I was unable to get Pooh to \\"magically\\" wobble by shaking the rattle. The dog likes it when the we manually activate the toy, but the motion sensor only sensed my anger and frustration and failed/refused to respond. I'm also dissatisfied at the Fisher Price/Mattel consumer response website. It's a one-way only email, requiring the consumer to further waste his or her time with holding on a 800 number in an attempt to get a response to their questions/issues. I see no reason for the consumer to sit on hold when the company created the problem. The consumer should be able to get a response at his or her convenience since the consumer is not at fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Awful!","review":"I am also extremely disappointed. What a piece of junk! I can't believe you could not find them in the stores at Christmas! The rattle works 1/2 the time and baby loses interest. Shame on Disney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"My son received this toy as a Christmas present, and I sure wish I had read the reviews here before throwing away the packaging, because I would definitely take this toy back for a refund. What a waste! Like the other reviewers, I could not get the rattle sensor to work, nor does it move by just moving the toy around. The only way it works is if you press it's tummy.What a piece of junk. Don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter last Christmas. She was not impressed and either was I. The rattle has to be directly in front of Pooh or he will not work. The advertisement was very decieving. I would not reccomend this toy for any child."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth a cent.","review":"Sounds cool in theory but DOES NOT WORK in practice. Maybe we got a lemon, but seems like our son has to be practically on top of the Pooh with the rattle in just the right spot to get it to move. It also \\"reacts\\" if your child yells or cries loudly, not a habit I want my son to get into!! It also goes off at random when we're not even in the room!Bottom line - you're better off with a plain old battery-free stuffed animal for [$$$]. The rattle is ugly, but entertaining enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pooh doesn't do anything","review":"I got this magic rattle pooh bear for my daughter, that would laugh everytime she saw it on our t.v. and she is only 7 months old. So my boyfriend and I went out and got it for her. We get cute little pooh home and the only thing he did was say \\"hello my name is pooh\\" and that was pressing on his belly. Now the rattle situation I just don't understand how a 6 month old is suppose to make him dance with the rattle if a grown adult can't even get it to respond to the rattle at all. I have read some reviews on this toy and some say there is a plastic tab that neds to be removed where is this tab? Then he may work! Who knows!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a six month old","review":"I had to have this for my son before he was even born. He got it for Christmas at six months old. He was excited as he also has a Pooh that talks when you press letters on his belly. However, the rattle is too big and hard for a six month old. He also does not understand to shake the rattle to get Pooh moving and gets frustrated, so we wind up pushing the belly. Also, when my son hits himself with the rattle, it hurts. It is rock hard plastic.It is nearly impossible to understand what the doll is saying and the movements are jerky. I am wondering if something is wrong with it actually. If that is how it is supposed to sound, it's terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We bought this as a gift for our 6 month old daughter. She liked it at the store but when we got home, she played for about 3 minutes and then left it alone. She doesn't really play with it anymore (except when she's mad and throws it), but the rattle came in handy. She chews on that to help her in the teething proccess. Pooh may talk clearly at first but it gets harder and harder to understand him."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE LUV U POOH!!","review":"WE PURCHASED POOH FOR OUR 6 MONTH OLD BABY, AND NOW ALL THE ADULTS IN THE HOUSEHOLD WANTS ONE OF THEIR OWN.POOH NOT ONLY SHAKES WHEN THE RATTLE IS SHAKEN BUT HE ALSO RESPONDS TO SOUNDS AROUND HIM.

Forget it! We could not get the Pooh to work correctly. We changed the batteries just like the box said and still nothing. It only would work if we pushed his belly. We shook the rattle, screamed at him, hit him, and nothing. Than, like magic, one day later, it worked perfect. Well, maybe perfect for an adult, but not a 10 month old. This toy should be A LOT more sensitive for it to correctly work for the 6month+ that they recommend this toy for! It was a gift and the box is gone, otherwise, we would have returned it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the chance!","review":"We purchased Pooh for our 9 month old for Christmas, we were very frustrated to find that between 4 adults we COULD NOT get Pooh to respond to his rattle! I thought that perhaps we had gotten a lemon, but looking at other reviews our problems with Pooh are not an isolated case. Seems as though you either get a Pooh that works or doesn't. Loud noises do seem to \\"set him off\\", but if loud noise is the only way to get this Pooh to dance...forget it!Don't waste your money hoping your Pooh works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too cute for words","review":"This is the most unbelievably cute Pooh EVER! I still every once in a while can't resist the urge when I see one of these to push the belly and let him do his little dance. If you have a little baby they would certainly love it, if you have a Pooh fan in your house likewise. Regretably after continued use his little Pooh shaking motors start to get a bit loud, otherwise a near perfect paragon of cuteness"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for infants","review":"I really like this toy for my 5 mo old son. It really caught his attention. Developmentally, it is great for teaching simple cause and effect relationships. The only thing is that it goes threw batteries pretty quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute for a while.","review":"My son received this when he was less than a year old. It didn't get his attention right away. He'd watch Pooh dance and sing but it didn't excite him. He'd play with it if it's the only toy around but he'd chose other toys if he could. It's cute but isn't soft enough to cuddle with. It also requires a large movement or sound to activate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BAD INVESTMENT","review":"Ok, I was seduced by the cuteness factor of this toy, but it's really difficult for me, let alone my 9 month old daughter to get Pooh to actually move by using the rattle... too bad - I was really excited about this, but it just sits on our daughters bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This toy has a really good idea for play but it does not work. On tv the toy started dancing and singing with just a small shake of the rattle, in order to get this toy to work you need to shake the rattle very hard. I would suggest to anyone do not buy this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I thought this toy was a great idea. Unfortunately you have to shake the rattle pretty hard to get pooh to respond. My daughter wasn't able to shake it hard enough so she never understood that shaking the rattle made pooh move. This toy now sits on a shelf untouched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure what to do","review":"We recieved this toy for Christmas for our 10 month old. He really likes it. I read on the Toys r Us review that it suppose to move when you touch or wiggle Pooh as well, but none of the Fisher Price websites state that its suppose to do that. It says that it works if you shake the rattle or push the belly. So I was confused as to what info I was suppose to go by. We do have to have the rattle quite close to pooh to get him to go. I'm debating yet if I should exchange it. If I do,I will check each and every one till I find one that works correctly. I think it's an adorable toy. His singing and talking is totally understandable."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS CUTE AS THE COMMERCIAL","review":"We saw the commercial for this toy and immediatly wanted to get it for our son who is 6 months. After unwrapping it, which took quite a while due to the packaging we were somewhat disappointed. In order to get Pooh to dance etc. the baby's rattle needs to be very close to the toy. The baby also needs to \\"really\\" shake his rattle quite vigorously to get Pooh to work. The toy itself is cute but smaller than imaged in the commercial. One other drawback..... to get the toy to start his tummy has to be pushed. We find that we need to do that for our son. The dancing and music captures my son's attention. Unfortunatly, Pooh's voice is very distorted and hard even for adults to understand. This was a very good idea for a toy but could use some improvements."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very cute easy toy","review":"Unlike the last review we found ours to be easy to operate no matter that angle, and from across the room. The pooh bear rattle seems to be sensitive to any movement. My 8 month old figured it out very quickly.

We like the toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I bought this toy for my son when he was about 6 months. It looked like a great toy for my son to interact with.

This book is my favorite. The language consistently uses the richest verbs in a gentle poetry that transports the reader to the site: \\"Morning slinks onto the savanna and licks up the night shadows...\\" The illustrations are gorgeous. And the content includes all the relevent animals of the savanna and puts into perspective how they are all living together -- even as some are predators and some are prey. An authors note at the end puts this fictional story into context and explains what is fiction and what is true in the story. I think this book is fantastic for any read-aloud, even if you aren't \\"studying\\" Africa. It is a beautiful piece of children's picture book literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Treasure Chest","review":"This book is smaller than a wallet. It can literally be carried in your pocket, in your backpack on a long trip, in your purse, anywhere. My copy is dog-eared. Each of the selected quotes from Thomas Merton is but a paragraph or two. The perfect length for meditative reading and reflecting. A chance to slow down and think with your heart and whole mind. I really can't do it justice. Thomas Merton has opened a new realm of spirituality to me, one that is far deeper, but that does not contradict in any way the Gospel as I have heard it preached from a hundred different pulpits. His ideas have made me understand that all that I have known is just the tips of some icebergs.

No instruction is given on musicality or rhythms. It's basically just for people who want to clang their cheap cymbals together and feel exotic. Maybe it would work for a quick Halloween persona.

Of course the orphanage is going to be closed by the bad guys and enters a contest (singing) to try to win enough money to save it. He is of course very nervous and can't sing, but the kids show up to help him. There is a love interest also. Very sweet movie. I would love to own the DVD. I did purchase a PAL version from Amazon.com.UK and had it converted to NSTC. If you like Tommy Steele, get Finian's Rainbow or my favorite Half A Sixpence."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the price","review":"product is descent.it is a bit noisy, but does the job and isn't too distractingthe blue light glow is a nice featurethe tilt of the cooling pad allows your hands to type more easilyit is difficult to type with the cooling pad on your lap, so flexibility is limited"},{"rating":"1","title":"it sound like a tank rolling after 3 months","review":"When i first bought this. its good and quiet.

Who doesn't consider songs like Rivers of Babylon, Daddy Cool, Sunny, Rasputin and Ma Baker to be first class dance tracks (all were of course #1 in Europe). My personal favorites are Rasputin and Ma Baker, they are in my top-10 of ALL dance songs! There's also this excellent mega-mix in track 20 who has them all in just less than 4 minutes! Here in Greece it's a dance club favorite and also a must in all beach clubs!

And when their favorite band doesn't shut up about it, how can you not remember it?What I'm trying to say is, this album is filled with too many tracks that just rant on and on about how ICP hates mimes. It's okay for the first couple of songs, but when each one of your 20 songs talks about nothing but hating mimes, then it gets a little tiring.Best songs: \\"I hate mimes\\", \\"Attack of the mimes\\", \\"The war (on mimes)\\", \\"All Juggaloes should attack any mimes they see\\", and \\"Am I a nazi for hating mimes?\\"Worst songs: \\"All mimes should go back to mimevillie\\", \\"If there was a movie on being a mime, then everyone would hate it\\", \\"Clowns vs. Mimes: The ultimate battle\\", and \\"Beat Down Those Mimes\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathitic","review":"Much to the urging of one of my friends, I actually did listen to this whole alblum, and it was one of the single most painful expirences of my entire life.

That is about the only one of their songs that actually has decent background music, it's quite amazing.

It's a good album but it could be too commercial in my mind. Its defenitly produced and made well which is why its getting 4 out 5 stars. I also understand that it is a mixtape before the album so its not going to be off the charts. There was a good mix of artists on here but it all sounded like I was riding out to a club or somnething. When I want to hear about sluts, or just stupid girls where can I?

Sure it included \\"Witchy Woman\\" and \\"Take it Easy\\", but the remaining album tracks were quite ordinary.After that, two more albums were released including \\"Desperado\\" and \\"On the Border\\". These two albums were an improvement on the first, but not outstanding.Along comes the \\"One of these Nights\\" album in 1975. WOW, in one word. This is nothing short of brilliant. The album tracks are just as good as the lifted singles, which is also the case for Hotel california. What I do like about \\"\\"One of these Nights\\" is that it defines their talents clearly (eg. Journey of the Sorcerer, Hollywood Waltz), opening the way for \\"Hotel California\\". I never tire of playing this album. The digital remaster version adds more life to an already excellent soundtrack, and is worth hunting down.Eagles - have been one of my favourite bands since I was 8."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eagles Embrace Rock Even More On This One","review":"With ONE OF THESE NIGHTS, the Eagles embrace rock even more than on ON THE BORDER, with a new sound drawn as much from the Allman Brothers Band's BROTHERS AND SISTERS and Stax/Volt R&B as from California rock. The title track is a pure R&B groover that I'd someday like to ask a new female friend I've made for a dance to, while \\"Lyin' Eyes\\" and \\"Take It To The Limit\\" (the latter featuring Randy Meisner on lead vocals) draw on their earlier sound. People who care about others might want to note that the band members currently advocate sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, making this album an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience. Overall, this album is definitely as essential in its own way as HOTEL CALIFORNIA, GREATEST HITS 1971-1975, ON THE BORDER, and THE LONG RUN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one","review":"I would rank this one third on my Eagles list.

We felt a warm vaporizer would be better for her types of breathing issues and colds.This proved to be a bargain lifesaver.Be forewarned it DOES create a HOT mist. We were VERY careful about placement with babies & children in the house. It suggests adding salt to get it working, do not add more than recommended or it will boil over.We've used this with and without vicks menthol liquid. It works well either way, but the menthol adds quite a punch to the air, great for bad stuffy colds.The major downside is cleaning. It can, and will, get gunked up with nasty stuff. You need to run either bleach through it or make sure its taken apart and dried FULLY which is VERY hard to do given the shape of the container. Given the price at pharmacies, I wouldnt mind replacing it once a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good lower grade vaporizer","review":"This is a good lower grade vaporizer for a good value price. Keep it clean and it will last you a good while and do the job for one room. This is a heat steam, so if you need a cool vaporizer, do not buy this one but specifically search for a cool one which will run you some more money.Again, for the price, this does the job and will last for a while.

Don't let the cute cover fool you - and the same goes for the Dear Son book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good buy","review":"I don't have anything to compare this to, but I love it. I did a great deal of research before making this purchase and I know it paid off. It is light weight, easy to use and so far the battery life is great.Highly recommend this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very expensive disposable camera!","review":"I bought this last Christmas for my teenaged daughter. We both loved it, it took great pictures, was easy to operate, though pretty bulky/heavy compared some other point & shoot digital cameras. The battery life was good, all in all, we were pleased.Until it just stopped working 3 weeks ago. We bought a new battery, thinking that was the problem, but that didn't help. So I started looking online and found this is a very common problem with this camera, after about 1 year, it just stops working (just as the warranty ended) and the repairs are very expensive. So we basically bought an expensive disposable camera. Very disappointed. Her replacement camera is a Nikon Coolpix."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken battery door","review":"I have purchased 2 of these cameras from kodak and The battery door cover cracked on both in the same exact spot.It is very difficult to use now.I duct tape it shut but it usually does not work. I would NEVER EVER buy from Kodak again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Door Breaks EASILY","review":"I have purchased 2 of these cameras in a 1 yr range. BOTH cameras I paid more then 300 dollars for each one w/ the printer docks. The battery door broke on both. They take beautifull pictures but when you have to duct tape your camera it looks like crap and to send it to Kodak and pay 105.00 for a problem that is quit obviously a manufactures defect with these cameras, THEY should pay for it not me. I will never purchase another Kodak again. While it does take wonderfull pictures its of no use when after 6 months to a yr. of use the battery door breaks and you have to pay the company who made it wrong 105.00 dollars to fix it, it just isnt worth it in the long run.Purchase another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"My second EasyShare is as good as the first","review":"This is my second Kodak Easy Share - my first one lasted about 3 years and had some kind of electronic meltdown. Ah, it had served me well, and nothing electronic lasts forever. I bought this one because I had liked the Kodak menuing, easy to use and intuitive. This one was not a disappointment. I've taken some absolutely gorgeous shots, especially in macro mode.Some people complained about the EasyShare software - I tried it out and thought it was just awful, so I deleted it and use another program for my photo management. I'm reviewing the camera, not the free software the manufacturer includes in the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"This camera is so easy to use. Takes great pictures. I didnt give it 5 stars because I believe there is always room for improvment on everything. Kodak provides great customer service for those who can't properly read instructions (like me) and they dont make you feel like a dummy. We compared the pictures from the DX6340 to the Sony mavica(pictures had alot of yellow) and although close Kodak won (true in colors). Kodak DX6340 has so many great features and the software is easy to use. I highly recommend the Kodak Dx6340."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],B={key:0},N={key:1};function j(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(M,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-95c1597d"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/28.md","filePath":"guide/28.md"}'),W={name:"guide/28.md"},P=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{R as __pageData,P as default};
