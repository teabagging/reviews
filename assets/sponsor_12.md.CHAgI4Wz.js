Although the title creature is clearly an orangutan, he is referred to as a chimp. It looks like his naturally reddish fur has been dyed dark brown or black.The one scene I recall most vividly is when Shue's character is undressed and about to take a bath, Link opens the bathroom door, enters, and looks at her naked body longingly as she freezes, about to step into the tub.Shot on location in Scotland, the emotive score is by Jerry Goldsmith. The taught direction is by the late Richard Franklin."},{"rating":"2","title":"monkeys, monkeys, monkeys","review":"I\`m only ten and if you like monkeys as much as i do you will LOVE this movie!!

Gasaraki has been builing momentum right from the start and with disc 7 it is speeding along at full bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Animation, Dull Story","review":"At first look Gasaraki looks very good in terms of mecha design and animation. Gasaraki is undoubtedly one of the best looking animes I have ever seen but the story is very uneventful. They try to mix up mythology with mecha (kind of like in Neon Genesis Evangelion), but the story is lacking. In the first couple of episodes in the series there are actually some decent action scenes, however as the story progresses all they do is just talk. It basically becomes some kind of political drama mixed with some not so original religious type story. It is just very slow and in my opinion VERY VERY boring. It just drags on and on about politics and that stupid kai thing. For people who are looking for action and good story this will not be for you as this mediocre anime is seriously lacking in both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yet","review":"There aren't enough stars in all of Amazon to let me describe how much I liked these episodes. A fight of political powers to determine the shape of the world, in the setting of a disaster so believable and well presented it felt like it was ripped from tomorrow's headlines.

And you can't tell the gender by looking at the word the way you can in Italian. A lesser complaint is that it doesn't mark the tone. Norwegian words have tone. Haugen's dictionary marks the tone.

Without giving away too much, I'd just say I wasn't exactly disappointed with the ending, however I was anticipating it to go in a more sinister dramatic direction towards the end rather than the way it did.

Ralph Bates lacks the screen presence and charisma of Peter Cushing, and his portrayal of Victor Frankenstein is actually rather irratating.There is nothing new in this film. In essence its the classic story re-told, but its all strangely flat for a Hammer film. The only reason it got two stars rather than one is because both Kate O'Mara and Veronica Carlson look gorgeous in the film and there are couple of lovely comedic moments which made me laugh out loud. Sadly though I think this is a reflection of the fact that Hammer really had nothing new to say with this film. Dave Prowse (the Green Cross Code Man) only appears in the last 1/3 of the film and is rather wasted, which is a shame because he made quite an imposing monster.My advice buy only if its very cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Hammer","review":"Don't get your hopes up for this 1970 Hammer film as it's several rungs below any of the other Frankensteins made by Hammer.

A black humored misfire."},{"rating":"2","title":"He was quite a nice monster, really.","review":"This is late Hammer, so the baron does a lot of his anatomical study in the bedroom. Still, it looks and feels a lot like classic early Hammer even if it's a spoof. Very familiar Hammer sets. Very knowing and witty script and direction. Great colors. Gorgeous but clueless Veronica Carlson is the only female in the movie whose anatomical parts seem not to interest the baron in the least. The ending is a hoot. This one is so different from other Hammer Frankensteins that it may take a few viewings for some fans to appreciate. But taken on its own, it's enjoyable and better than some of the Cushing Frankensteins."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"This book is amazing.

In episode 13 Between Dreams & Reality you see Each Hunter's deepest fantasy. Carrot's is a no brainer.

It is rather firm if it is going to be used opened for sleeping. It should hold up well due to the firmness and structure. It is heavier than other chairs I owned like it in the past. I found it a little more difficult to quickly change back to chair from open but that is a fair trade-off if it last longer because it is sturdier.

Good for student life: living in little dorm rooms and having an occasional friend spend the night. Used to call it the \\"mushy chair\\". It lasted 6 years without losing its shape and its feel. When I moved to the US I had to sell it, and I missed my \\"mushy chair\\" for several long years until I found this one. It is a bit more firm than what I used to have.

While it's definitely an improvement from sleeping on the floor for sleepovers, I can't recommend it. After several months of usage, the foam cushion loses it's shape. Should have gone with a lower end futon, because I doubt this will hold up much longer. Okay for little kids (under 12) as temporary sleeping arrangement, but not good for much else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not cushy, but it works","review":"I bought this to use as an everyday bed in my mobile home. It's VERY firm; I mean, it feels like a rock. Whatever foam they use must be something like you'd find in the heart of a neutron star. At first you think, \\"Bigods, this thing is hard as a rock, I cannot even sit on it comfortably, let alone sleep\\", but actually, it's not bad. You lay there going \\"this is rock hard how am I ever gon---Zzzzzz.\\" Having gone from sleeping on a Fufsak to sleeping on this thing, I say firmer is better. Also size-wise; I am a Lady Of A Certain Girth and yet I have no trouble sleeping on my back or side with no overlap here. It's not a bed you could share with anything bigger than a cat, but it's not too small. Also it doesn't smell (the Fufsak was leatheroid and I would wake up smelling like a fetish party) which is nice.

(I discovered them in the bowl while cleaning up, after the cake was in the oven!) I called KAF, and the baker explained what would happen to the cake without the extra yolks.

Instead, I've found these recipes disaster-prone (and yes, I'm a good baker). The gingersnap recipe, for example, yielded an impossible batter & disastrous cookies, and the timing on the wheat crackers left me with burned, inedible crackers. I found myself checking Joy of Cooking or Baking with Julia to discover that KArthur had left out steps (like the apparently all-important refrigeration step for gingersnaps; also, the baking time for the crackers is twice that of other cookbooks). Now I make nothing from KArthur w/out double-checking w/another cookbook first-- and really, then, what's the point?

Lousy production gimmicky unconvincing effects and those awful bats. Why Hammer had to resort to copying Universal is beyond me. No wonder the great Mr Lee got sick of Hammer using the Count in daft storylines and having to speak ludricrous dialogue. The only good points are Hammer regular Michael Ripper as a suspicious publican and the ending in which Dracula is struck by lightning. I was also very surprised at director Roy Ward Baker who had directed such Hammer classics as \\"Quatermass and the Pit\\" and \\"Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde\\" was he not bothered? Most definately the worst in the Hammer Dracula cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"I simply loved it.","review":"I have always loved the Gothic horror tale - from Bela Lugosi's Dracula and the rest of the Universal Horror family through the Hammer years and their various monster mashes. If you love period pieces and the old monster classic - you'll love this one. The Hammer films are much more edgy - pushing the envelop with regard to how they handle sex and nudity - but by today's standards they are pretty tame. The only Hammer Film I would say to avoid is the Circus of Vampires - very bad! I collect classic horror films and have all of the Universal films and most of the Hammer films - but the Circus is one I will not buy - for any price.If you like Christopher Lee/Bela Lugosi films - you'll love this one.Larry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer, beware!

The lobby card art is also missing inside, so buyer, beware. \\"Scars Of Dracula\\" isn't bad as a latter entry in the Lee Dracula canon. It's spoiled slightly, though, by jarringly fake and excessive gore, with regrettably gratuitous sadism. Christopher Lee felt similarly, as optional on-screen commentary attests.

Despite some original scenes (one of them is the door opening by itself for Christopher Lee) and Lee's dynamite performance this, along with DRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE is not really as good as many of the other films in Hammer's series of DRACULA movies in fact, it's pretty dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but the most horiffic of the entire series!","review":"Great movie although I still say \\"Horror Of Dracula\\" was the best of them all. This film is the best of the sequels. Only one confusing part of it though. In \\"Taste The Blood Of Dracula\\", he is destroyed and rots away into dust at that ruined church. \\"Scars\\" begins, presumably, right after that film, yet we see Dracula's remains lying on a stone slab at a castle. How did this happen? Did someone pick up his dust at the church and then sprinkle it in the castle? Maybe it was the bat who comes in to drip blood on the remains? Who knows?In any case, this was a rather good film. Unlike the previous one, Dracula is present for nearly the entire film this time. And, a great demise at the end this time.If you buy any of the Hammer \\"Dracula\\" films, stick with this and the previous ones. Stay away from the ones that take place in the 20th century. Not the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dracula Delight","review":"This film comes from the period when Hammer was getting \\"spicy,\\" tossing a little nudity into their films to increase the sensation. I remembered the film as being much racier than it turns out to be. All-in-all, it's an entertaining Hammer Dracula entry with Christopher Lee in top form, more savage and sadistic than we've ever seen Dracula before. This is another film in which Hammer tried to inject a touch of Bram Stoker into the tale by having a hero held captive in Dracula's castle watch as the vampire scales the walls similar to the scene described in Stoker's book. The only real drawback here is that Dracula is pretty much castle-bound throughout the picture so all of the action comes to him. Not the best of the Hammer Dracula films, but still a delightful envenings viewing for the horror fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay Sequel to Taste The Blood of Dracula","review":"Hammer was never able to top Horror of Dracula with any of its sequels. This is a direct sequel to Taste the Blood and it does, however, have its moments.There is one scene involving a matte painting(I suppose) outside the castle that is awesome. The bat-chewing scene is good! One criticism of this film's predecessor was lack of screen time for Lee.Well, critics of an almost Leeless predecessor, this one delivers for you because Lee is given more to do in this one.This one was the last Hammer Dracula to take place in the 19th century.The last two got pretty wild!(Dracula-A.D. 1972 & Satanic Rites of Dracula)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow-moving","review":"The Scars of Dracula spends more time with folks riding through the woods in horse-drawn carriages than it probably should. However, that won't affect the five-star rating I will most always affix to Christopher Lee's films. My admiration is not without merit.

Then, I happened to catch their performance at The Middle East Nightclub and was awestruck. The singer prowled the stage like a caged panther, the bass player was a mass of energy, bouncing around all over the stage, the guitar player seemed to me the most serious one in the band, added beautiful melody and sang backup vocals, and the drummer, well, he was just perfect for the band. That night, the band played a lot of new material not on this CD, but, as great as this CD is, their next one could be even better, from the songs that I heard. Either way, you need to get this CD. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Must Buy this Album!!!","review":"Although I consider myself more of a heavy metal person, I really enjoy the Soupbones's music. the grooves and lyrics are so addicting!

While the plot evades me (I last read it at the age of eleven) the things that stood out were the vivid descriptions of Southwestern landscapes, a world where cowboys and horses still roamed. I could certainly relate to Trixie's having to finish an English composition on her vacation time to keep from failing the subject! (Compositions and term papers were the bane of my existence all through school!) Her efforts were complicated, of course, by the mysteries which seemed to follow her everywhere.Trixie was the kind of girl I wanted to be--tough, independent, and smart (often smarter than the adults she encountered).

After the first twenty pages, I found that I wanted to, throw it away in a burn barrel and then burn that too. It was a predictable, poor exuse of a mystery novel. The only mystery here was why I chose it in the first place.It had a bad setting,in the 40's or something,where everything was a mystery, including cereal. It was a predictable at every turn and easily solved for the reader less than halfway through. It was an unrealistic and fake sounding, let alone \\"looking\\" book.In conclusion, I hated the stupid bundle of paper. It had the worst setting ever in any book in my displeasure to read from slimy cover to sticky end. And who in their right mind says \\"Gleeps\\"?

One wheel became slightly bent and is harder to turn, and the steps had to be \\"forced\\" to convert to the ladder position, so I bought the new one last week, and am thrilled to have them both. Since I weigh over 200 lbs., I am loath to use the old one as the step ladder when I clean out my gutters; however, I will continue to use it for utility uses, like pallets of sod, and for moving heavy and unwieldy objects up to 300 lbs.I have recommended the TT to friends, and have loaned mine out for years now, and it has served well in every use for which it is advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Enjoyabe Read","review":"I was very excited to read this book because I love historical fiction, but I was not at all satisfied.

She always lets Napoleon have his way. The only reason I finished this book was just for the sake of it. I would definitely not reccomend this book. It's a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show trapped under Sony","review":"The show is great, but Sony needs to stop being so stubborn, get the real 'Love and Marriage' theme music back, and why no bonuses? How much can it possibly cost to throw in a few bloopers? Those are funny and they must have hundreds of them lying around. I can't fault the show, though.. Al Bundy is truly the King, and he has some of the best lines like \\"GET OUT OF THE WAY, BEHEMOTH!\\" to a fat woman immediately after promising God he'd be nice to everyone in a prayer, if only Kelly could win a modelling job. That cracks me up every time, no matter how many times I see it. Some people don't like Ted McGinley, but I think he does a good job as Jefferson. He really bonds well with Al in the later seasons.. I am looking forward to those later seasons for two reasons: Big'uns magazine, and No Ma'am! Can't wait!

While I love and can appreciate many of the classic episodes from earlier seasons, I have to disagree with several reviewers in that I feel we are only now breaking into the BEST seasons. For as much as I liked Steve Rhoades, Jefferson Darcy grew on me and became a more likeable character. The NO MA'AM stuff (which doesn't even come for another 1 or 2 seasons) is the stuff of legend. Who *doesn't* like Bob Rooney? My point is that I felt the show really found its footing in this season and, while it may have become a bit more cartoonish and Al may have became a more hateful person, it made the show that much funnier. Personally, I cannot wait for the infamous \\"Ms. Blaub\\" episode from season 7. Bring on the rest, bring on the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just gets better and better","review":"MWC is one of funnier sitcoms to ever appear on TV. It has an approach to \\"family\\" life that is unique and quite different from any other family sitcom. This family is certainly not perfect. Great performances from all of the cast and very funny writing make this a great series of DVDs to own. The absence of the original soundtrack is a little disappointing but does not make the show any less funny. I hope to see more seasons released on DVD very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill Bundy","review":"Married with children has been my favorite comedy tv show for a long time. Unfortunately, on the fifth season the show begins to lose the style and focus that made it so great. Al changes completely. He goes from a struggling shoe salesman who gets no respect from his wife or kids(or from no one for that matter)to a bully. He does'nt get a lot of lip from Peg anymore, which was hilarious to watch from the previous seasons. I think that was the funny subject of the show, how no nobody would listen to him or respect him, and still he would go on. All that changed during the fifth season, changing completely the focus,style (and the quality of the storylines)of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Married.... with Children gets 5 stars, but Sony only gets 1 star.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Married....with Children. I think it is one of the greatest shows ever created. If anyone besides Sony had released the DVD's, I would have given it 5 stars instead of 1. No special features, no bonus materials, no interviews, no nothing, just the episodes and nothing more. Yet it still took Sony a year and a half to release season 5. In my opinion, the people at Sony who put together season 5 need to be fired. The episodes themselves are great. At least Sony didn't screw them up like they did in season 4 by releasing the edited episodes. Married....with Children will live on forever as one of the funniest shows ever aired on television, but Sony has alot, and I do mean ALOT to learn about producing decent DVD's in a timely manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Told You So Awhile Ago","review":"I wrote a review for season one, saying basically that this series was one of the best written and acted for a comedy, for the first 5 years...Actually 4 and a half.

Thoughtful and Suspenseful.","review":"Eleven years after graduation, Jake Rivers is asked by a wealthy businessman to discover the whereabouts of his wild college buddy Alec, causing Jake to revisit the demons of his past and a dark secret.Admission is a fast read and a compelling mystery. Thrasher's characters are real and wrestle honestly with feelings of guilt, regret and love. In some respects, Admission is an insightful character study. I read this book in three days and found myself wondering what the characters were up to whenever we were apart. Admission is thoughtful, suspenseful, mysterious, and a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Terribly Compelling","review":"This is my first Thrasher novel and I was far from impressed. The switching back and forth in time did not work for me. I really felt the book was more about people being sloshed and less about remorse for wasted years. Yet, I get the impression the author was trying to focus more on the latter. I was not terribly compelled and in the end, I cared little about the characters and only wanted to know what had happened on spring break. I also noticed a switch in language. For the first 3/4 of the book, the author carefully avoided the Lord's name in vain and by the end, he through in several. It did not make for good character continuity either. Overall a mediocre read with mostly unlikeable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Admission","review":"I may be the only person who did not enjoy this book. I found it hard to even finish it. I have liked and read others by him, some of which were very good. This one I found myself putting down, then skimming through just to end it. Maybe it is my age, but the jumping back and forth, the college years, the not knowing what the crime was and then even when finding it out, it all left me annoyed.The fact that I have read very good books by this author makes me wonder why this one just did not have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Christian thriller, ending a let down","review":"Admission by Travis Thrasher is a well-written psychological thriller. Jake Williams left college 15 years ago and hasn't spoken to any of his friends since. But he's blackmailed into searching for his former best friend by events that he can't remember regarding their last days in school and the death of another friend. Thrasher does a great job of feeding out only a little information at a time to the reader, and because even the narrator doesn't have the answers, it doesn't feel forced. He also does a good job of dealing with Williams' faith in God: the faith of a new believer uncertain how to talk about it and still struggling to stay on the narrow path. The true flaw in the book is the overly quick resolution. The story quickly jumps ahead after the killer is revealed, and I felt shortchanged. Just one more chapter could have smoothed over those rough spots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing....","review":"Travis Thrasher's latest book, Admission is simply amazing. I highly recommend reading this book. Jake Rivers is on a search for a long lost friend and also trying to recover memories from a college Spring Break trip that went terribly wrong. All the while, he meets up with the love of his life once again, but can he reconcile past mishaps and start over again, or will the consequences of trying to uncover the past ruin his chance? Travis Thrashers weaves a suspenseful and thrilling story, one that keeps you on your toes for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"When You Have to Face the Past....","review":"It had been eleven years and Jake thought he had put his college years behind him until one day a stranger calls Jake to find his daughter. In order for Jake to find her, he must rekindle old friendships and dredge up the past, but someone is trying to stop him. As he reconnects with his old friends, he discovers who his old friends really were, especially on that fateful night eleven years ago that changed everything.The story flips from past to present as Jake remembers bits and pieces about his life and what he's become. He looks at his friends and how some have changed and how some are the same. Thrasher does an excellent job of tying the story together with suspense and discovery.

I was out of breath by the time I got to the end of this! I've read all of Badal's books and this one ranks among his very best. Bob Danforth faces one of his greatest challenges, and son Michael is there to play a key role in thwarting a terrorist nuclear threat against the Olympics and world order. Badal weaves a tapestry of tension, leading to a climax that kept me on the edge of my easy chair. This one is a great ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enraptured","review":"Badal's knowledge of the geographic setting coupled with his writing style makes this book a fast and enthralling read. This book, unbeknown to me, is part of a series. While it would have been nice to start the series from the beginning, it didn't matter as this book in isolation was well worth the read. I am looking forward to other books by Badal as he has a style that allows the reader to become engrossed in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing and intense","review":"I found this book to be gripping from the first chapter on. Hard to put down. While the book may have been more fun to read in 2004 when the Athens Olympics were actually taking place, this did not take away any relevance from the plot or action.Having read Badal's previous and debut book, The Pythagorean Solution, I thought Terror Cell was of a higher caliber and Badal clearly made gains in his writing technique (though I still enjoyed TPS, as well).Perfect for a quick, fun read.

Great character development and timely story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"terror cell","review":"Mr. Badals book, Terror Cell, is enjoyable suspense writing. He brings believable characters into his tale of political corruption avoiding the overused superhero motif so common in much of today's writing. His writing style is a refreshing relief with its short chapters clearly defining the object of the books purpose and not filling pages with useless descriptions to add pages and cover up for lack of writing skill.

I even went ahead and measured the depth of my cabinets to be sure they would fit. My whole family loves them. The coffee mugs are AWESOME - I can get enough coffee in one mug to wake up and not have to go back for another! The bowls are larger than I expected and hold enough food to fill up my \\"tween\\". The only problem we had was one set arrived broken - I really don't think they were packed well for shipping. But, luckily, Amazon has a great policy. We had the replacement set before I could even get the broken ones in the mail!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too heavy","review":"I ordered two sets of these dishes and find them very heavy and actually a bit to large for fitting comfortably in the cupboards. The shape is not uniform in all the plates, some are more flat than others so they don't stack well. All in all I would have been better off going for the basic Corelle rather than these. Guess these will wind up in the garage sale when I find another square set that are lighter and a bit smaller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Beautiful Stoneware","review":"I just recently purchased this Dinnerware Set and I love it.

I bought the Indigo Blue, a very nice color but it shows fingerprints easily and that makes the dishes look dirty. Customer service has been excellent which is great because one bowl arrived broken and a dinner plate chipped after just three weeks (my husband swears he was careful!). The other problem I have, and my husband says it's just me, is that the sides of the plates curl and my fork and knife are always rolling off. These are nice plates but I think if I had seen them at the store I would not have bought them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearthstone","review":"I have been a Corelle user since it first came out in the late '60's. I loved my Corelle and always had great cooperation from the company, which is why I was so surprised when I washed my new Hearthstone in the dishwasher and the black backside on one plate came out with a huge chip (?). It seemes to have just flaked off several layers in a 1/12\\" spot.Since I had gotten it on-line I had no idea what to do about it. Any suggestions? Otherwise I am completely happy with it. The dinner plates are very generous in size and all in all it is a very attractive set."},{"rating":"2","title":"PICK 1: LIGHT OR CHIP-RESISTANT","review":"....These resist chipping. They are heavier than most stoneware. If you want STONEWARE that won't chip or break it will be heavier than normal. They have never chipped or broken even when dropped, unlike ALL the other stoneware I have used. None of my plates have scratched in daily use.....When I received my order, two small plates in the same packet had broken in shipping. That's normal for something so delicate thrown around in a shipper's truck/airplane. The plates were IMMEDIATELY replaced by cooking . com....Small plates are big enough to use as dinner plates. Big plates do fit in my cabinets. They don't fit in my dishwasher.....If you have arthritis or carpal tunnel syndrome don't buy these. If you are a normal adult you can carry these just fine.....If you want pretty stoneware that won't chip or break buy it. But I recommend buying only the small plates, bowls and mugs. The big plates are useful only as platters for serving, or as chargers for holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corelle Hearthstone Stoneware Bay Leaf Green Square","review":"Deep rich color and great workmanship make these dishes a pleasure to look at and eat on.

The color of the bay leaf dinnerware was exactly as shown on the website.The plates are large but to me they are not excessively heavy as somebody else complained.The only observation we have relates actually to the red set: the actual color of the dinnerware was different than shown. The red was much less vivid than on the website (not bad, just less ... red). Now, my monitor shows my pictures from my camera without significant color distortion so I suppose that this should not be an excuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish","review":"This is a nice looking dish set. Of course they are quite heavy since they are stoneware. My only \\"issue\\" with this set is that the large dinner plate doesn't fit in my cabinet. I knew this might be an issue after reading a few other reviews about these plates. We are in the process of getting new cabinets and we are designing the cabinet around the size of the plate. The large dinner plate size is 11 5/8\\" square. Take your measurements before buying. Other than that, I really like this set and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Striking Dinnerware!!","review":"I can hardly believe it...I ordered these handsome dishes on Monday & they were delivered to my door in just 2 days!The color is more burgundy than the orange-red one associates with a \\"chili\\" color, but they are beautiful.

I LOVE the square shape.I ordered 3 sets & each set was packaged separately & shipped, beautifully packed & arrived with not even one piece chipped!This is my second set of casual dinnerware, very different from my Sango.

The most recent casualty happened when we just put food from the stove onto the plate and it cracked. Many of the dishes have cracked this way, with only moderate heat. Because the other characteristics of this set have been covered at length, I will leave my comment focused on the breakage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved everything except its size and weight","review":"I saw these dishes in Wal-Mart in another color and ordered them from here in the color (turmeric Yellow) that I liked for even less money than at Wal-Mart. I received them quickly and loved the color and the way they looked. However, I returned them when I realized how big they were. The dinner plate fit in my microwave, but it was so big that it wouldn't allow the plate to turn while cooking. They wouldn't fit in my dishwasher on one side either--too tall. The bowls were so big that they were really heavy to hold while eating--like on the couch with a bowl of ice cream. They were all pretty heavy and I felt like I would have to be careful of which cupboard I stored them in. I also couldn't get all the bowls in the usual spot I keep them, because only 2 stacks instead of 3 or 4 would fit. I'm still looking for dishes as pretty as these are. Hope someone can find room for them, because they are beautiful and seem like great quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dinner ware","review":"I have a set of this dinner ware and my son and his wife liked them so I purchased a set as a Christmas gift, when they arrived they had broken pieces, I contacted Amazon and another set was sent at once.

The dinner plates are huge. I had to rearrange and empty my cabinet to fit my set in. I had a service for 12 plus extra small bowls before and now I can barely fit a service for 8 in. My husband says the mugs are too big (but I like them). Difficult to fit into the dishwasher - can't cram it full like before. Other than the size, I love the color, the way they feel, the strength and they are great in the microwave. I hope that Corelle comes up with matching large serving bowls and platters to go with it. I will find a place for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Chili red","review":"Dishes are nice - heavy and larger than average.

I WAS FURIOUS, BUT THE NEW SET ARRIVED IN A FEW DAYS AND, ALTHOUGH POORLY PACKED, IN ONE PIECE. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS WORTH THE TROUBLE. A LOVELY BLUE, AND STURDY. THE PROBLEM IS THE PACKING, NOT THE DINNERWARE ITSELF."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"This dinnerware is really great. It makes a fantastic looking up to date table, but can take the everyday abuse that families bring. The only problem that I had with this product was the shipping. The way that it is packaged in the carton it took 5 sets to be able to get 3 full sets of dinnerware. Now that we have it, we have not had a problem with it. It has lived up to it's Corelle name, no chipping or cracking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This set disappointed me on several issues. The color was more on the mauve or burgundy tone. The dinner plates are too large to fit into my dishwaher. Silverware slides onto the floor on a regular basis because of the rounded corners and my spoon falls into the bowl. 2 plates have cracked for no apparent reason. Overall these have been frustrating and disappointing dishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning stoneware makes a bold statement","review":"When I searched for cobalt blue dinnerware I didn't have stoneware in mind initially.

The bowls are a bit too large but I still love them. They are durable and heavy. Although you wouldn't want to drop one on your foot. I also love the mugs. Good for eating ice cream as well. The only complaint is that there was one large dinner plate broken when I received them. There is a waranty and I can replace it. I just haven't yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big","review":"I Love this set. The dinner plates are huge so some may have trouble fitting them in a cabinet.

The plates are about the size of a regular Corelle platter and the smaller plates are about the size of the regular Corelle dinner plates and the bowls the size of serving bowls.

I did have one plate chip early on but haven't had problems since then. As mentioned in several reviews - these plates are huge and don't fit in my cabinets. I've learned to angle them and put the dinner plates in two different cabinets.

Theywere just what I wanted, color and all, but when I tried to put the dinnerplates in the dishwasher they only fit if I placed them using two spaces.This reduced the dishwasher capacity. Next problem surfaced when the samedinner dishes didn't fit in my standard sized kitchen cabinet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corelleware","review":"The Corelle Hearthstone set is exactly what is stated. It is STONEWARE. One of the reviewers downgrades this set when she didn't even buy, just looked at it somewhere. That is not a review, just a gripe because this set is heavier than regular Corelle. Don't we all know that from the description? It is good to know that the dinner plates are larger than normal and probably won't fit in the average cupboard. Okay, buy one of those wooden drying racks and keep them out on the counter. There are trade-offs with this set, but I believe the positives far outweigh the negatives. I like the heft and size of the pieces and enjoy the distinctive look. Knowing this beforehand, I am certainly not disappointed and would highly recommend this set if you are looking for settings that reflect the choice of food being served, your personality, or just having something that is unique and to your taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT WERE YOU THINKING CORELLE?","review":"The overwhelming majority of American homes come with 11 inch deep kitchen cabinets - it's a standard.

Yet, 10 minutes after arriving I've already filled out the form to return them. THEY ARE NOT BLUE. They are flat out, straight up PURPLE.

They are nice plates though, and I will order another set, just in a color that's not purple."},{"rating":"1","title":"But it's NOT Corelle.","review":"Nowhere on the packaging, on the box, on the warranty can I find the name Corelle.

One day while microwaving some dinner on the plate, I heard a loud noise from my microwave, the plate cracked and split into two. Seriously what the heck, of all the other dinnerware sets I've owned in the past, this is the first occurrence of the plate cracking and break so completely. I will be contacting their customer service to demand a new plate, if I encounter any problems from their customer service.Not happy so far.I contacted the customer support, and the rep was very friendly and offered to ship me replacement plates free of charge. However, it took 2 months of back and forth before I received the replacement plates from the warranty.One thing of note is that this set is phased out and Corelle customer service told me they no longer make any more of these sets. So buyers beware.Despite the plate cracking, Corelle did backup their product and gave me replacements, so I will still give it 4 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corelle Hearthstone Stoneware Bay Leaf Green","review":"There was a plate broke in one box and a bowl broke in the other box and I was unable to replace the items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Shipping","review":"I ordered these from amazon around christmas, I like the plates fine.

The Indigo set is more of a royal purple, and has a lot of matte black on the outsides and undersides of plates and bowls. I ordered the \\"modern square\\" version, and the photos do not show how the plate edges are swooped and wavy. I can't get the 4 dinner plates to stack neatly. The rims of the mugs are thick and designed with a round interior stuck into a rectangular exterior, which makes for an awkward coffee drinking experience. Even for the bargain price ($48.95) and free Amazon Prime shipping, I can't live with these dishes. I would have given one star, but Amazon's customer service and fast shipping bumped it up to two."},{"rating":"1","title":"received broken","review":"This is a nice set but one bowl and one plate was broken when I received it.

I am so tired of toys made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This toy is super loud with no volume control. of course you can turn it off but any toddler will know how to turn it back on.I also don't like how every character has to be in the correct seat to talk with nothing to really help my toddler figure out where they go except the feet don't fit right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, they made a rocket that does something!","review":"My son is completely in love with the little einstiens and it seemed like there was NOTHING out there that they could really play with. I bought this at Target and I swear I would have won the \\"mother of the year\\" award. He was a little frustrated when he couldn't open the lid and then when he did, it came off -- but that was easily fixable. You DO have to push the charachters into their seats pretty hard, but like my son says, \\"push hard, seat belts buckled.\\" If you didn't push them hard then they'd all off their seats when Rocket was flying -- so, I guess I can see why it's that way. All in All, this is my son's (and all of his friends) favorite toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got mine at Target too for just under $40. Not worth $90!","review":"Like the other reviewers, I don't understand where Amazon got their price, that's unusual for Amazon to be so much higher. This toy is fun. My four year old enjoys it, and even my 9 month old likes holding the characters and gazing at their faces because he likes looking at the little einstein dvds (mainly the intro) almost as much as baby einstein. He's fond of June especially, so he likes the June figurine. The voices are the authentic voices, and the quality of the sound is very good, especially Rocket's sounds. Nice variety too.Definitely shop Target first."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT as advertised","review":"seller pics and descriptions showed product in complete box, with notes in the photos about how all 4 action figures are included. product came with just the rocket shell... no lid, no monitor, no figures, no box. total bait-and-switch. returned right away and received refund. We went to buy this because or son played with his cousin's our entire trip home for Christmas. After this experience, my brother was nice enough to ship his rocket to our son because his kids just don't play with it anymore. our son loves the toy itself. I wish it had a lower volume switch... the noises it makes are too loud for regular playtime. it like it's shouting at you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool toy, but needs adjustments.","review":"The downsides:1. If you buy this, the first thing to do is put 4 layers of masking tape (cut into a circle) over the speaker. Otherwise, it is entirely too loud.2. It's also heavy, so 2 year olds need help flying it, but 3 year olds can handle it. Still, the wheels work well, so smaller kids can roll it.3. The characters need an older person to get them seated.The upside:1. Fun, educational toy. Designed well, except for the points above."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVEIT!!","review":"This toy is amazing. My son loves the little einstein's and he now has the opportunity to act out his own \\"missions\\". It comes with all of the characters however they are in a fixed position / arms and legs are not posable. One word of caution...this toy is extreemely over priced. I found it at target for HALF what it is listed for here. Look around you have plenty of time before christmas and WILL find it cheaper at target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint melts","review":"We received this toy as a hand-me-down from a friend, and the paint on the characters has melted onto our leather couches when left there for a period of time. Can't be safe for children.... Had no idea it costs $400!!! We threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for younger kids","review":"I think this a great toy for 1 1/2 - 3 year olds.

Or is it Amazon? Over 300 dollars for a plastic toy are you kidding me??? My little girl wants this and I so badly want her to walk out Christmas morning to all of the things she asked for under the tree...and it's not that I couldn't afford it with my Christmas savings...I just cannot bring myself to do it..spend this sort of money!!!?? It's ludicrous!! Am I not the only one freaking out about this???"},{"rating":"1","title":"price rising...","review":"Have been amused by the reviews of the cost of this toy. From it being $33 in 2008 to $300 to $400 and today it is offered at $700. Who would ever pay that much for something? Don't be an idiot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy for Einsteins fans","review":"My 22 month old daughter opened Rocket from Santa at 10:30am Christmas morning and refused to open any other present until Dec 30th. She has been playing with it constantly. The batteries last surprisingly well and you can turn off the sound and its still fun for them to play with. If your kids are watching the Little Einsteins series - I think they will love this toy. It is well made, apart from Rockets main door, which does not stay open very well, loading the characters. It also came off its hinges very easily. It snaps right back on - but it is a little frustrating for the kids trying to hold open the door so they can load the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIPOFF","review":"Agree with other reviewers.

The plot is convoluted but not in a good way....in a way that makes you think that this movie is the edited result of a film abortion. The movie is pointless and uses its lack of clarity to try unsuccessfully to develop a depth that it just does not have. The premise is thin and in the end ridiculous. The acting is very English and you do not develop any character attachment. In the end there is just relief...nothing else.Please save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I watch?","review":"I wish I could have given it no star's. 99 cent special from Amazon.

Most of it is set in our world and is about average people. I use that word \\"about\\" loosely. Of this one and a half hour movie about an hour of it is just people sitting or standing around looking sad. It focuses way to hard on trying to set a mood and not actually doing anything.

Since the reunion of Echo & the Bunnymen in 1997, Ian has released nothing but quality material and Slideling is no exeption. Let's face it, there is NO difference between the later Echo material and \\"Slideling\\". It's easy to understand how bands like \\"Coldplay\\" and \\"Travis\\" are influenced by Mr.McCulloch. All 11 songs are gems with \\"Love in veins\\" being the standout. I would go as far as saying that it's my favorite song of the year, thus far. All songs are in the mid-tempo mode. Ian has never sounded more confident in his songwritting and the melodies never stop coming.A must have for \\"Echo\\" fans or for the curious.

You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"I understand what they were trying to accomplish with the water control being located on the handle. The issue with this is the strength of the jet can be accidentally adjusted and if someone has sensitive gums/teeth that could be extremely uncomfortable.

I bought this model.It's loud (I wore earplugs) but it served the purpose, UNTil the tube sprung a leak at the base of its permanent attachment to the nozzle piece. I had not used it that long, and did not think I'd been rough on it.I tried to pull the tube out to recut and reattach, but couldn't. I foolishly bought a 2nd water pic. I tried to be more conscientious about the way I held the nozzle, and even strapped a tape around the area of attachment. But the 2nd one also sprung a leak in the same place after some months of (less than daily) use."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars for cleaning, 1 star for durability","review":"I too loved the way this cleans, but also found that mine broke after about 6 months (the curly hose detached from the handheld unit).

I hooked this up, read all the instructions, filled the reservoir and then tried to prime it as directed. This would not even prime thru the tubing.

I only gave it a 1 star because there was not a 0 star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it's working","review":"I've had two waterpiks over the years. I liked them both, when they worked, as they had plenty of pressure. Both died in about two years though, one with a hose leak, and my latest one, which died today, leaking in the attachment handle. I need the machine, so I'm torn about what to do. I bought another brand (Teledyne) about 4 years ago, and was not really happy with the lower cleaning pressure it produced, so when it croaked, I bought the second Waterpik, which cleaned well, but doesn't last either.I sure wish I could get more than 2 years out of these units. I only use them once or twice a week, so that's a pretty short working life span, I'd say."},{"rating":"1","title":"free but mediocre","review":"This product was sent to me by WaterPik after two of the battery powered hand-held items failed (first one the motor, second one the battery). They are quick to send out a replacement unit if you just call them. It seems they know they make such a poorly made and designed product. This unit is very hard to control, to keep from getting water all over the place. The tip comes out easily if you press the wrong direction on the knob. The \\"pause\\" button is hard to keep down, so more water all over. A very crude product - if they hadn't sent it to me for free, I would return it to the store. I will continue to look for a better product as my dental hygenist says my teeth and gums are so much better after using this kind of device."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a difference a waterpik makes!","review":"Too many little attachments for the storage space in the lid on the individual model. This one gets it right. Powerful stream blasting junk from between one's teeth. Nice. Hitting one's uvula is not pleasant on the higher settings. It's better than periodontic treatments on the budget. If it lasts a year, it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WaterPik WP-70 review","review":"We had used a WaterPik for many years and just wore it out. We bought the new version of WP-70/WP-70-W and have been very unhappy with the oeration of this unit.Apparently,over the years, WaterPik has redesigned their units to give a \\"pulsating\\" flow of water. Our old unit performed the cleaning with a \\"volume\\" of water, thus flushing out anything between thec teth. The new pulsating action is very poor. If you turn up the pressure to get more volume, the water jet is very hard on the gums.I wish we were back with our old unit and not this supposed newer technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Model if you want to keep it for years","review":"I've owned this model Waterpik for one year now and it just died the same way the previous Waterpik died: the hose became brittle and broke. Unfortunately, you cannot change the hose to the hand unit on this device, you have to throw the whole thing away. I suggest spending an extra $12 and getting the Ultra version so that you can change hand-unit hoses when they break after a year. Otherwise, the unit works okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Things Are Junk!","review":"I've had 3-4 of these things and they are very poorly made.

The set does provide that. The songs are mainly a greatest hits collection and contain most of best songs. I really enjoy many of them especially near the Thriller years. It also contains some songs that aren't as great as the others from the disco era and early 90s. The album provides a great wide ranging of tunes and I like owning them. Michael may be dead now but his music can be appreciated further."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good compliation cd if you don't already have one","review":"I bought this cd because it had alot of his music I didn't have. After his death I went and found my Micheal Jackson cds. Unfortunately my Jackson 5 cd was in bad shape and skipped alot. But my original Off The Wall and Thriller play just fine even though they have many scratches. Bottom line is this I have had to return this new cd four times at a store because it skips.

There isn't a single song you won't enjoy and if you're near his age when he passed, it will bring back fond memories of your youth.

They are all great songs, but in this day with online downloading and so many previous \\"hits\\" albums in the can what do they expect out of us. Anybody that is a fan of MJ's music already has whatever songs they want already, and if they are new fans they are just going to download them anyway. It is no longer a market for Gr.

The only major omissions are the Jackson 5 hits \\"I'll Be There\\" and \\"Dancing Machine\\", the Jacksons \\"State of Shock\\" and the duet with Janet Jackson, \\"Scream\\", but considering this is a Michael Jackson compilation it's not that detrimental.I'm impressed at the scope of this collection, and all of MJ's major albums, \\"Off The Wall\\", \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Bad\\" are well-represented here. The underrated \\"Dangerous\\" is also well-represnted including songs that were not on \\"HIStory\\" or \\"Number Ones\\", including the hypnotic \\"In the Closet\\" and \\"Who Is It\\".Invincible is only represented by \\"You Rock My World\\", although I think \\"Butterflies\\" and \\"Cry\\" would have been good additions.But, it's hard to complain when you have 30 years of some of the most incredible pop music ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album from MJ","review":"Absolutely worth every penny.

Pau's claim that his gospel was nothing but the fulfillment and proclamation of that spoken by the prophets has incredible implications for the proper understanding of the N. T., and yet, in the amillennial and postmillennial worlds, this truth is greatly misunderstood, or ignored.Hays' suggested rewording of Romans 4:1 is particularly provocative, and sets the stage for opening our eyes to a totally different interpretation of that text/context than has been the center of the faith-v-works polemic for so long.I highly recommend Conversion of the Imagination.

Over the last couple of years, the WWE has revolved too much around stupid storylines and wrestlers who portray silly comic-book characters. I'd rather watch a wrestling show that has real athleticism and not two men in underwear pretending to fight. The WWE doesn't take its hardcore matches seriously. Heck, they ruined the hardcore championship with the pathetic 24/7 rule. They use fake blood too much. The matches are becoming so darn predictable and dull.

Three of the songs, this time, \\"Handcuffed to a Fence...\\", \\"10 Miles to Go on...\\", and \\"A King of the Road\\" would all do well on the AAA circuit. \\"Corvair\\" is a low key rendering that maintains the kind of fragile beauty that one hears on an early Neil Young album.NO SUCH PLACE is more polished than WRONG EYED JESUS, making it apparent that the artist has improved his station in terms of access to a more upscale production team.

Combining the reading of, for example, anxiety disorders in the DSM with Austrian's chapter on anxiety disorders helps clarify assessment criteria. I don't believe the purpose of her book is to discuss the shortfalls of the DSM but rather to aid social workers in gaining a better grasp of its contents. I see her introduction as a disclaimer. The DSM is a necessary evil - whether we like it or not, many of us work in environments where its use is unavoidable. Given that, Austrian provides her opinion, rightfully in the introduction, and then gets down to business with the purpose of the book. I do recommend this book for people wanting to learn, but can't speak for those who feel they have already learned it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat but basic book","review":"I'f you've had a computer for more than a year and surf the 'Net daily, this book MAY be helpful, but I'm willing to bet you are pretty much further ahead.A good reference, however, for those simple factoids that escape us from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definite must-have for the Internet 'newbie'!","review":"If you're just starting out to use the Internet, this is a definite must-have book for you!

The rest talks about his version (fairly poor at that) of history and philosophies behind computers. The book is a buzzword seller, with no real value at all. He tries to impress you with a weak history and tossing of buzzwords than any real knowledge. People like him are the reason that programming jobs are going down hill. Write less code in the long run by doing it right the first time, skip this book. WebObjects will not increase development speed unless your developers are uneducated in design and coding procedures. If that is what WebObjects pushes, no wonder they are failing in the market. That is a Microsoft gimmick and has yet to work properly even for them. I am still in my quest to find what WebObjects holds in advantage to other languages and platforms.

If you want a celeb auto worth reading, I strongly suggest you pick up one of these autos: Drew Barrymore, Britney Spears, Jenny McCarthy. They're all young, but they've got a lot to say about the hell they've gone through their lives. (Or the hard work they went through, in Britney's case.)

Why can't she wait until she is a little older to tell us all? Many other people have accomplished just as many things as Charlotte and decided to wait until they had more material to write for a book. I would seriously question the value of reading something like this, since Charlotte refers to \\"mum\\" and \\"dad\\" so many times it makes you wonder about the literary quality. A biography is supposed to document one's life but if you are so young, you really haven't lived. Hence, there is nothing really to document.

This is but one example of the many historical errors that detract from the book's value. There are also transcription errors that could have been avoided had anyone cared to correct the Spanish.

The intellegence and absence of immorality that i have seen on the few episodes i watched outside the home caused me to purchase. I am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one. The rounchyness far out weighed the intellegence by far. Now i am very very leary about purchasing any other episodes. I did enjoyed episode one which i borrowed from my neice.

This season is solid all the way through, from the opening episode where they are called to rescue a Captain being held hostage by a maniac on his computer. But there's a twist at the end, that even Gibbs doesn't see coming. Now NCIS did a fantastic job in season one, by introducing Ari. And just when you think the last time they saw him was when Gibbs shot him in the shoulder. Now unfortunately, Sasha Alexander thought this was the perfect opportunity to leave NCIS. And so, at the end of season 2, Kate gets killed by Ari. And thus, the first cliff hanger ending a season of NCIS.

I own both, and now it looks like I will wait for the Volume II he talks about constantly in this one, where he will actually start to address some of the 3D programming and some advanced topics. 3D should have been left out of the title on this one.My advice: If you own his Game Programming for Dummies, don't waste your money, if not, buy this as a starting point.Also: Am I the only one who is tired of 20% or more of most programming books covering Programming 101? Over 200 pages on basic Windows programming in this one. 200 more pages on topic would have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely useless if you don't have Assembly Language","review":"I wish this book would have had on the cover \\"Microsoft Assembly Language Required.\\" If it did, I wouldn't have bought it.

For all you other people writing bad reviewsbecause you say the book doesn't have enough info on 3d-it doesn't say it covers 3d, it just says an intro to 3d graphics.Doesn't 2d graphics come before 3d.If you want to learn how to program in windows, this is the best book. It covers everything and doesn't give you all the extra bull. The only complaint I have is some of the code is inaccurate and you have to look it up on the cd. But other than that, it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No bedtime stories please, I'm studying.","review":"Many of us have said \\"I want to be a gameprogrammer!\\" but as soon as we start reading our first how-tobook we fall asleep. If you want a bedtime story to knock you out, don't buy this book! It's likely to keep you up all night reading. Breaking away from the boredom of simple technical writing, Andre LeMonthe weaves together information, visualization, and entertainment, much like that zany high-school teacher we love to listen to. I've been taking college courses in programming for a year now and I found this book to be and excellent reference source. The material covered in this book, such as sound, AI, and how to use binary shifting, complements my classes and often explains things better than some of my instructors. If you truly want to learn programming, or simply want to become a better programmer, I highly recommend this book. Even after you've read it, it will make an invaluable desk reference book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"I must agree with the previous reviewer. The only reason why I give the book two stars is for the decent information on the CD. This is NOT the book that was first advertised, this is <ahem> \\"Volume I\\" (Which really is just a rehash of windows game prog for dummies). The 3D stuff is apparently in Volume II. What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Advertised, But Still Great","review":"According to Andre the man himself, this edition is not the complete manuscript -- it's part 1 of 2. He apparently wrote way too much to fit into 1 book, so late in the writing process he decided to split it into 2 volumes.As it stands, it is an excellent introduction to the world of 3D game programming. You really can't learn 3D game programming without understanding something about 2D game programming first (well you can, but it's just much easier this way), so don't get you stockings in a knot if you think this book isn't as informative about 3D programming as advertised -- just be patient, and wait for the next volume -- this is only the intro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't worth the wait","review":"Am I the only one getting sick of \\"bonus\\" chapters on CD? Even when learning about programming, there are times when I prefer to sit down with a book AWAY from the computer. The first reviewer got it right when he said this is basically just a rehash a LaMothe's \\"for Dummies\\" book which was a good intro to Windows game programming. However, this time round I was really expecting more. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for beginners","review":"Tricks of the Windows Game Programming Gurus is a terrific book for beginners. It takes a gentle pace, making sure to explain even the most basic concepts of game programming. As another reviewer said, however, there is NO Direct3D in the book and the docs that can be found on the disc can also be found on the web (and they are not that great in my opinion). So, in short, do NOT buy this book to learn 3D game programming.Also, for those who already own one of Andre LaMothe's other books, Windows Game Programming for Dummies, you may want to think twice about buying this book. This book is the Dummies book, but with a few more chapters and a little more discussion of some of the more important areas of game programming. All-in-all, I would recommend Windows Game Programming for Dummies for the person who wants a brief intro to the basics of game programming and this book to those who want a very thorough intro to the fundamentals of game programming."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't","review":"This book is over 1000 pages of mindless drivel. The author spends a little too much time explaining how the hardware works and not enough time explaining the code.

Tons of examples, both for the beginner and more experienced programmers about the most common gaming problems. However this book is for 2d, the 3d stuff is on the CD and who likes to try to read 100+ pages of word documents? Also I miss DirectPlay, network games are almost the standard these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall, this book could have been a LOT better","review":"Well, i was very deceived when i read this book. It is very basic, and i just don't see where the \\"Guru\\" part fits in.The advanced topics such as Neural Networks and Genetic algorithms has only 1 page each and the rest is stuff has nothing that your average Joe would not know about game programming.Nothing advanced is covered in this book as the title may suggest and NO D3D.Oh, and half the book cover Win32 programming that has nothing to do with game programming.Sorry Andre, better luck next time. In a word, this book is very deceiving.If i could return it, i would. P.S: Thanks for Amazon for letting us express our honest feelings towards the books we purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Rushed, but Still a Great Book!","review":"While there are errors, and more errors, it remains extremely valuable. I think he could have skipped the Win32 section, and pushed the reader to Charles Petzold, nonetheless overall very valuable topics (especially the physics modelling, math algorithms, and others). The book is worth its weight in gold, especially since MFC is not used (There is a truckload of overhead from hell). I am patiently waiting for Volume II. One more thing, Andre' thinks he is funny, but he's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Covers the majority of topics involved in game programming with excellent code samples that reinforce each chapter.My only criticism is that the code is not very \\"OO\\" (object oriented) in nature and is more in the procedural / C-style of programming.This is a minor issue and I suppose it is up to the reader to understand the concepts, and refactor the code using OOA, OOD, OOP.The diagrams in this book are also excellent and help when the reading gets pretty heavy.Recommend this to anyone who has read a few introductory C++ (or introductory C++ gaming) books and wants to take the next significant step. You will need to be dedicated as this book is massive.Also a great reference book for Academia (Computer Science / Game Programming) as the exercises and examples are great and to-the-point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I bought this book expecting to get some serious \\"tricks,\\" however it turned out to be just a poor rehash of material from Tricks of the Game Programming Gurus. ALL, and I mean every last scrap of the information was basic, introductorly level material. But the most obvious problem with the book is that is cover so little on DirectX. Lamothe basically gives you a shabbily done version of the help files included with the Directx SDK. Information on 3d graphics is glaringly absent. The Directx portion of the book covers maybe 150-200 pages, the rest is banal knowledge on physics, Win32, and AI. All of it done in a cursory, unprofessional manner. This book is *not* worth the asking price. It WILL NOT teach you how to program in Directx, and if you already know how, it will not teach you anything new or usefull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, just a little unorganized.","review":"I just finished reading this book and at its end I found myself torn between whether or not to recommend it. As I was going through the book I had to force myself to continue reading and at many times I was very confused. Lamothe covers a huge amount of information in this book, so I expected to be confused. Even though the book seems thrown together and none of the sample source code on the CD worked, I learned a huge ammount of information about game programming theory, WIN32 programming, and DirectX. I highly recommend this book if you have the patience to figure it out and have a very strong backround in C/C++."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a review for the House that Screamed One","review":"There is a movie called the house that screamed, but I can not find it anywhere.

Whats shocking to me is most cheap headphones blow out after maybe a month or two of LOUD full volume music but my last pair lasted me well over 1 full year of mostly LOUD full volume music and I mean FULL VOLUME LOUD music before they gave out due to me going back to not taking care of them.

This was definately not a King's Quest game, at least not the one I remember. I love the puzzles and fairy tale creatures in King's Quest 1-7. And they are SO bright and colorful. Mask of Eternity has none of this. It is extremely dark, not just in plot but in color. When playing the game, I would have to struggle and strain my eyes to see where I was headed next. I have never been good at action games either...never have done well in trying to kill everyone around. I have no strategic ability, so I had an extremely difficult time with this game.If you are looking for a game like the previous King's Quests, do not buy this one, you will be disappointed. If you love action games, buy it, you will be satisfied.I must say that Sierra made a huge mistake in changing the King's Quest line with this last game, which is not worthy to be called King's Quest...it is simply, Mask of Eternity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere Near King's Quest","review":"I understand Sierra felt the need to venture into the 3d action part of gaming, but they didn't have to soil the noble King's Quest series in order to break into the market. It was a stupid trick to pull, I am glad that when I purchased this game it was only for 10 bucks in a bargain bin. I played the whole game through, and was thoroughly disappointed at each step. After running into an annoying bug on an old computer of mine after finally reaching close to the end, I replayed it again on a new computer more recently, and was annoyed to see the disappointing and short ending. They didn't even have the decency to put in a nice, long, conclusive ending like other King's Quest games. And the excess violence and poor excuses for puzzles are a disgrace. If you should buy this game, please do not mistake it for a true King's Quest, it is only a mockery. And play the other seven *real* King's Quest games instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sequel","review":"I grew up on King's Quest. My parents were playing King's Quest I when I was in the womb, and every time a new King's Quest came out they would play it. When I was very little, it was exciting to watch them play the games. As I got older, I would be very eager to help them solve some of the puzzles. By the time King's Quest VII came out, I could practically play on my own and it was such an amazing experience to explore the lands, meet characters, and solve problems with all of the items in your inventory. I learned a lot about mythology and fairy tale lore. I had very high expectations for King's Quest VIII. It was to be the first of the series I could play entirely on my own, without my parents' help. I anxiously awaited its release. Only to discover it had turned into a hack-and-slash game. I couldn't bring myself to play past the first level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Having followed the King's Quest games as they were appearing late 80's/early 90's, I have become a huge fan. The fact that the games did not fall into the fantasy cliche of the dark sword and sorcery junk that floods the market made the games truly a treasure. However, as others have noted, King's Quest 8 was a step in a different direction. They move away from the Royal Family (a mistake in my mind; why should we care for these characters, having only seen a short introduction?). The entire game feels like a fantastical version of Doom. Gone are the witty remarks and likeable characters... everything that Conner says is hugely (over)dramatic, that is when he is not being attacked by punch-throwing mummies (??) or some other hybrid monster. In closing, I would much rather have the early two-dimensional adventures of Graham than the sophisticated graphics of Mask of Eternity.I'm editing this to give it two stars. I was feeling far too generous when I first wrote this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overwhelmingly addictive","review":"Once the game is loaded properly and Conner is underway you cant stop.Graphic design is totally different from the Disney World(not that I didnt enjoy Princess Bride)Mask of Eternity is a game that you must purchase and begin your quest.My mistake was installing on XP rather than having the game on 98.However it can be done on both.Purchase...Quest...ENJOY!!!!!!!!!Susan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaw-droppingly bad","review":"My husband and I teach swing locally and I picked this tape up at the library for move ideas.

The look, the size, the heft, the utility, and the edge are all just perfect. Buck makes a great quality blade that shaved hair off the back of my forearm right out of the box, and better after a touchup on a fine water stone. Now, in terms of functionality, this isn't a one handed opener with a low edge angle and an ultra lightweight handle. It is a tank of a knife with lots of brass and smooth polished wood. The blade is easy to sharpen, and has a less acute angle on it that will take some abuse and still maintain a good functional edge. Personally, I don't find it too big to sit in my pocket, but clearly some prefer it in the nice leather holster it comes with. It opens fairly easily,and the pressure needed to unlock the blade and close it is a bit much for my 10 year old daughter, but I don't intend to pass it on to her for at least a few more years anyway.

For the money, this is the best buy in the entire blade industry. The 420HC steel takes a screaming edge (shaving sharp is not a problem for this guy), and the knife locks up tight like a bank vault. The brass bolsters will take a little polishing to keep them looking nice, and the knife itself is way too heavy for pocket carry (8 oz, also known as 1/2 lb). Keep it in the leather sheath and you'll be fine. Also, the Buck warranty is the best in the biz. It's under warranty 'forever'.

But I wonder how they'd hold up to what I put the Buck 110 through in the 1970's?Bottom line: Not as functional as the modern stuff, just like a Colt 1911, but like the old 1911, it won't let you down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Buck!!!!","review":"This is probably the oldest and most copied lock back design for a reason..

Once the LCD is broken you cannot use this camera. Don't be tempted to buy a used one without the LCD... it's useless. Lastly, when the camera is working properly, it does not perform nearly as well as other cameras in its 2007 class - there are many cameras that produce better pictures at lower retail prices. When I presented a working version of this camera to many friends and family I COULD NOT TRADE OR EVEN GIVE IT AWAY for FREE. My friends and relatives liked their Fujitsu, Nikon or Canon ALOT better.

The camera retailed for $199 and was 8MP which I was excited about. I also liked how small it was, that it used my old SD card and had a rechargable battery. Within 2 days the LCD screen cracked right down the center while I was turning it on. The on/off button is top center of the camera and when you press it down it puts pressure on the screen. I had bought it at Target and they exchanged it for another straight up. About 4 months later I had the camera in a cargo pocket and when I reached in to get it I found the screen cracked again.

I didn't drop it, it was possibly just sitting in my purse the wrong way. It is extremely delicate and it costs an arm and leg to get the LCD screen replaced.

I have tried every setting it has (as has my more technologically advanced friends) and we can't get it to take good pictures at night or indoors. The photos during the bright of day outside are fine, but go inside or allow the sun to go down, and no amount of light or flash can get this camera to take good pictures. It's also very sensitive and gives blurry photos a lot.

It can also easily fit in your pocket and go everywhere or anywhere with you!I highly recommend this camera for both casual and more experienced photographers who desire the clearest, most 8.0 MP vivid photos with no complications. Do not waste your money on a more expensive version -- the V803 will suit your all-around photography needs with sophistication, reliability, and simplicity.Side note: I would definitely recommend purchasing some sort of case for this camera, as it can easily get scratched (especially if you frequently use it, as I do). Securing its future with a one or two year warrantee is also highly advised, but with good care, this camera should last you at least a few good years of high usage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"Really like the Camera.

As he even says he does not try to psychoanalyse Pollock -- but instead Harris in an apparent \\"honest depiction\\" shows Jackson as a pathetic alcholic, compulsive adulterer and possibly a suicide (and perhaps a murderer?)who is struggling to achieve recognition within the artscene circle.As far as the trademark style of Pollock, director Ed Harris shows Jackson Pollock stumbling upon a painting technique or imho a novel never-before-done gimmick which the shallow art world chooses to consume.After viewing the film one is left less appreciative of the art of Jackson Pollock given the way the film depicts him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pollock","review":"I enjoyed this movie very much. It gave me a closer insight on how some artist relate to their work. Some of the works of Pollock are very intense and now I can see why. This picture revealed his personality; as well as his intensity that he brought to a lot of his paintings. Anyone interested in an insight to an artist's world should see this film. It helps you better understand the artist and how he affects the people that surround him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rorschach Test","review":"I'm glad that Pollock gave the world his art. I'm glad that the world has the wonderful Ed Harris to tell us stories in film. But, without any real insight into what made Pollock's artistic soul tick, what we are left with in this film is mostly a bleak, depressing and somewhat disjointed portrait of an abusive alcholic who doesn't fit in socially with the self-appointed arbiters of \\"what is art\\" -- or anyone else, for that matter. In spite of this, he achieves success - solely due to the efforts and belief of his wife. The inevitable trajectory of self destruction continues when suddenly, out of nowhere, the gorgeous Jennifer Connelly pops in and is madly in love with him! This final insult sends wife packing. Jennifer spends the rest of the film looking ravashing and cheerfully accomodating Pollock's boorish behavior as he descends into total degeneracy and ultimate destruction. Huh???"},{"rating":"2","title":"vivid scenes painted with darkness","review":"Jackson Pollock was a painter who invented and perfected a style that rocked the NY art scene in the late forties and early nineteen fifties. His dedication for his work was downright manic. Except when he seemed to hit some lulls and became downright depressed. At that time in the mental health field it was a syndrome that was not treated in the same way that it was now and if it were Mr. Pollock might not have created the work that he did. In the movie, the word bi-polar or manic-depressant does not come up, but you see him work as well as shut mentally down often in this film. You also see the ugly side of alcohol and what it does to people who are allready unstable. Ed Harris and Marcia Gay Harden are absolutely wonderful and their acting really shines. The movie also brings to light the works of Mr. Pollock and the time that he lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pollock!","review":"I cannot give a five star because I did not even get to see it.

Some may argue the genesis of the drip technique is not explored with enough depth, but the movie basically feels like a faithful portrayal of Pollock's obscurity, rise to fame, and tragic end. But the extras are where this movie really comes to life. They include a fun, knockabout interview by Charlie Rose of Harris, and the FUNNIEST EVER comment by a director in Harris' commentary - just listen to what he says during the very first gallery scene. Too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ed Harris is phenominal in this role","review":"Ed Harris give a very powerful performance as Jackson Pollack.The supporting cast is outstanding and the film does a very good job of evoking the feel of the time period through scenery, costumes and automobiles.

In each Van Gogh was a character that was portrayed in a manner that was human and who had ideas and humanity as well as a need to do art. By contrast, Harris' Pollock lacked any humanity, except for one scene where he takes a dog to a vet. And Pollock didn't seem to be someone who thought about life at all. He hardly cared about anyone and in the whole movie connected with no one with the exception of his wife, and that was far more a practical relationship than a love relationship. His wife Lee was portrayed as a generally uninteresting person as well. I was not drawn in by the film at all by any of the main characters. Pollock's gift to the world was his art; who he was and the life he lived were not worth making a movie of if this is the best the story can be told in film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sincere and informed","review":"A great tribute to a great artist. Ed Harris (Academy Award Nominee) excelled as an actor and director in this film. Marcia Gay Harden (Lee Krasner) received an Academy Award for her outstanding acting. It comes across as a sincere and informed biographical tribute as far as anyone can really know who Pollock was. Pollock was full of doubt concerning his art and was a complex person. Having known him (well) would not necessarily have meant that you knew him completely. This film shows the complexity of Pollock well and is well worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The essential anguish!","review":"Ed Harris is one of the most talented and real heavy weight character actors I the world.

Think in his incredible and amazing performance in The Hours for instance.In this singular project, Harris caught the essential roots of this mesmerizing artist. The artistic direction was wonderfully good taste made. Marcia Gay Harden is overwhelming too. Pollock is shown in all his primitive nature, his creation process, his troubles with the alcohol and twist of character supported by a very kinetic frenzy. The dialogues are admirably well depicted and so his inner demons and his irreverent mood.You must be absolutely immersed in those years to enjoy every frame of this portrait of one of the most fundamental icons in United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good info but disturbing editorials","review":"I do like the investment information in this paper, but you must be willing to put up with some disturbing editorials and some amount of very conservative bias in news articles.

Went to the store and bought the only available brand (Wite Out) and figured it was the same quality as the stuff I have used at work, which was Liquid Paper and another brand that I can't remember. I was wrong. The tape is WEAK and will tear about 80% of the time if you have to overlap a previously applied strip. The fact that you can write with pen over a single strip without the tape shredding is a miracle. If you have a choice, pay the extra buck to buy the better stuff. If you can only find Wite-Out, I would suggest leaving and trying another store. I swear, I almost look forward to making mistakes so I can get through this stuff faster.Also, do not fool yourself into buying combo packs of these things - there's no amount of money saving that will justify the selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mechanism for re-tightening!","review":"This tape worked fine, but at some point my toddler pulled a few inches of it out, and I could not figure out any way to re-tighten it and get it working again!

Within 3 weeks, all three (packs, as in SIX tapes) were unusable or broken. The tape breaks, the ribbon loses 'slack' and cannot be tightened, and the white out product on the tape is low quality. There is nothing good about these. Having since been purchased three other white out tape brands, I can honestly say this is perhaps the worst product on the market.

I have always used another brand, but these were less expensive and I figured they would be equal quality as the other brand considering they were made by a well-known company (Bic). I have been VERY disappointed with them. The tape never stays tight and I am always having to waste white out tape to \\"wind\\" the loose tape. Also, the tape turns easily so that the plastic side it facing out instead of the white-out side. I took one apart the other day to try to fix the turned tape and that was a disaster! I ended up just throwing the whole thing out because I was so frustrated trying to get it back together right.

[the old dispenser did not do that even if the tape wasn't dry]3. the tip of the dispenser is too wide and makes the use inaccurate and awkward.what a terrible product! the old design worked much better. this is a major redesign FAIL for bic.now where do i buy the old tapes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Product","review":"This is the best product to use as whiteout.

The CD would start with material from the book and then go off on stuff that I didn't understand because it did not follow the book material. I guess it would be fine for a formal course in a college setting, where you have the professor making the connections and you were doing tons of homework, but for the average person trying to get learn some language basics, I would not recommend it.

Each section breaks these categories down even further into specific areas and shows us how we often allow the very things we want and need to deal with and prayer to become the stumbling blocks that keep us from prayer.The author is obviously writing not only from inspired knowledge, but from having been down the road of \\"getting real\\" in her own prayer and spiritual life.

This is the type of book that should grace a coffee table as well as a library. It is intriguing and interesting. The type is set to allow for in-depth reading or perusal of pictures and captions.

The producers hired attractive women with gorgeous bodies and large breasts--but no Yoga skills. So this video does not combine the beauty of Yoga with the beauty of the human body. It would be absolutely wonderful to have a talented and flexible Yoga instructor do Yoga postures correctly...and in a manner that is intentionally sexually explicit and erotic. I don't see any problem with that. Probably few if any dedicated Yoga instructors would consider doing that sort of video. I'm sure it would be frowned upon by the serious Yoga community which might consider it degrading. So we end up with a second rate product like this video. Too bad. Nevertheless, I do enjoy watching these women show us their bodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I first viewed this as a VHS about three years ago as part of a research project.

I guess if they were real they'd bounce too much, but I thought it was inappropriate/ridiculous. Also, they wear socks (not those funky special yoga socks, but just regular socks). Socks are a big no no in yoga! The women didn't otherwise appear to be cold, so why they were wearing the socks was a total mystery.

How can you sell a Madden game and not have Madden's comments during gameplay?I have this to say to those that wish to check this out:RENT IT FIRST. If the game crashes, you will likely have the same problem with any other DVD you find. Hopefully, your 360 isn't worthless for EA games like ours is becoming.

I skipped out on the interim generation of consoles -- as a student, I couldn't justify the cost. I had almost every Madden title out there for the PlayStation, and so I did the same with Madden NFL 07 on the 360.I was, to put it nicely, displeased. Madden NFL 07 actually made me want my PlayStation back. Sure, the graphics are somewhat better than the PlayStation's, but the gameplay is three or four steps back even from that era. Madden's funny, if repetitive commentaries have been replaced with the bizarre 'Ask Madden' feature that has no realism at all, the radio commentator is nothing short of annoying, the crowds are lethargic, and on and on.This game really has nothing to redeem it -- the game modes are few and un-entertaining also.I most likely will not buy another NFL game for the 360 should \\"Madden\\" be in the title, and I certainly won't buy it on name alone if I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could have given it 0 stars, I would have","review":"Every year i buy Madden without playing it.

Trading is lame and pathetic - basically to get anything its like LT for a 2nd round pick...gee, thanks. Overall its lame and a waste. However, its all we have until the EA contract runs out or they rename the games from ESPN.

The editing the players is also nonexistant, i actually enjoyed changing face masks, helmet types, builds ect...as for the game play, what is up with the new way of kicking, the graphics was a total step back, as if EA used a different engine. I would rather have the game play look good rather then the instant replays.

It just happens. You get flagged for pass interference ALOT (especially after 2nd half, who'd of guessed?) I have instant re-played this flags over and over agian and none of my men where even around the catcher.

No team create, player creation lacks fun. And trying to increase players skills is hard and a bad way of improving your player.

On top of that there is a fatigue glitch, which means NO ONE GETS TIRED. The manual has been reduced to four pages (I can only guess next year it will be two), and there are at least 8 new rating categories per player, yet no explanation as to what they do.

They changed the control buttons that had been used for years and most of us who have played the series were used to them. The game is not challenging, memorizing or geting used to the control buttons is.The menus are confusing and there is a time when you can not change the game time duration which is frustating.Do not expect anything exciting from this game, it is at most an avererage game, but in my opinion is worth less than 10 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottem Line, EA has taken football from us","review":"No fantasy draft, no new features in franchise mode and an annoying feature that puts hall of fame players on teams during season play.

The cops are mad, the mob is mad, cars are stolen, and I was bored. Nothing substantially interesting is brought to the table, and the tepid classic rock tunes selected as the soundtrack make the going even more tedious.Basically a bunch of not-so-brights don't think their caper through and it all goes awry. The interminable dialogue interludes are downright boring, yet fitting what with the stupidity of the characters. Ice-Cube's non-acting ability highlights the moronic nature of the whole thing. Martin Sheen was absolutely hilarious as the mobster creepy guy. I laughed outloud many a time as he blathered about.

Acting was pretty good, and the script certainly wasn't the worst that has ever been. And the directing, well, not so bad.

The Day Trader is junk. If the plot had less imagination and the characters less development, it would be a children's book.The text is at a 3rd grade level. The financial component to previous books has been intriguing. This attempt is on the level of balancing your checkbook.The only thing good about this book is nothing.Sorry Frey, you lost a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"In my experience, I usually will enjoy a book if either I like the main character or if I can relate to the main character. In this book I did neither, I really disliked him, and as a result did not care one way or the other about what happened to him. I found this book to be a bit of a bore to read (probably because I didn't care what happened). The supporting characters were not realistic and didn't add anything to the plot. Even within the first chapter when there was a description of Augustus's boss I was thinking that it must have been a joke, because not only were the boss's comments crazy, but the responses to them were illogical as well.Some other reviews mentioned that other books by Stephen Frey are good, but unfortunately I don't think I will bother to read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"High-priced garbage","review":"Frey's other books were alright. Rather than being a suspense story about day trading, he sloppily built a mish-mash of plot devices. Rather than staying to a story line, he wandered like a cow through a pasture. His writing is unskilled, his characters are undefined; he built the story by wandering through a word and phrase supermarket. Glad I borrowed it from the library, sorry they bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and a lot of Problems","review":"This book was much Slower than Frey's other books. My major problem with this book was that it was Frey's only book that was in the First Person. The writing just didn't seem right, his third person books are all much better. BTW Frey needs to do a little bit better of a job doing research, When they go to the Baseball game the team plays the \\"California Angels\\" the team hasn't been California for some time now, second the home team is always in the third base side, not the first base side. It is stuff like that that makes this book off."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Day Trader - Does Not Deliver","review":"Day Trading may someday define the late 1990's. The boom, the bust, the empowerment of the individual. Unfortunately, Frey squanders his opportunity to help us make sense of it. If the title, THE DAY TRADER, attracts you (like it did me), do not be misled. The scope of the book is very small-minded. I was hoping to better understand the fullness of this huge phenomenon (through the power of fiction). So I expected good fictional characterizations and a more even-handed plot than Frey provided. His characters never really convince you and there's a plot that seems just too darn cooked up. I wanted a good fictionalized view of this phenomenon and I sure didn't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personal Review","review":"Day Trading was certainly one the most dynamic infatuations of possibly America's greatest decade. So when Frey chose to call his latest, The Day Trader, I was hoping he might capture the deeper meanings of such an interesting phenomenon. Unfortunately, I think Frey squandered a terrific opportunity. Instead of characterizing this naturally dramatic period fairly, he opted for plot devices and broad character portrayals. After it's over, you don't feel any clarity or much of anything, it's a few hundred pages of typical mystery that any subject normally provides. When fiction works well, it provides insight, gusto, and obvious enjoyment. I just didn't get it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"When I first purchased this book, I was looking forward to the same quality of story and detail that I had come to enjoy in Frey's previous books. Sadly, this book did not live up to those ideals in that there seemed to be an element missing from this work that was in previous works. On the whole, it's a decent quick read, but not quite the level that should have been expected from Frey. Some of the nagging points I found in this book dealt with specific Washington, DC area elements that should have been better researched in order to have been portrayed in a context that one would expect the characters to know. The old dictum of writing what you know stands true, and there are times where one questions the level of research that went into certain elements of this story because I was questioning them in light of my knowledge of the area. I reserve judgement for future works when I have read them, but if you are new to Frey, pick up one of his earlier books as a first read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Day Trader?? Made only a two trades throughout the 347 pgs","review":"I was a day trader in the 90s, and loved it. I thought there was going to be excitement about trading stocks in this book, and getting highs off making huge money, and suffering loses as well.

I was really looking forward to reading it, but was disappointed. I hope his future books have more deapth to them. The characters are really shallow and you really don't care what happens to them.

The \\"conflicts\\" keeping the characters apart were unconvincing -- I kept thinking, \\"no one would act that way\\". This made it hard to sympathize with their plight. Similarly, the roadblocks in our hero's way -- such as being considered a suspect -- rested on completely irrational behavior by all (not that that's unbelievable for government agents, but still).

Why do you think they don't call it 'deadbeat MOMS'? This book was written by folks intending to subvert the best interests of the children of divorce AND to help destroy single-parent families by ridiculing their need for the legislation currently in force to protect their needs. I think it was VERY shameful for John Stossl to give these irresponsible folks air-time on 20/20... disgusting! If Stossl wants to know what's REALLY going on, why doesn't he talk to the Deadbeat Dads social services folks or the police who enforce the child support laws, instead of listening to these nincompoops.

But really, it was quite the disappointment. The first chapter is delightful. But if you continue reading you will be upset. Not just by the none too descriptive writing but the action that leaves you confused and unknowing. I have a term I use for books like this. Reading in the dark. The plot drops in the middle, like the previous story never existed. It is not the kind of twists and turns that should be expected from a book, and this book doesn't have this either. Crossing the wire is an altogether dissatisfying book, one I beg you not to waste your time on. The story doesn't have the flair that makes you not be able to put it down, but it does have the drag that makes you put it on the shelf and walk away. I finished reading this with difficulty.

The classic, original Wicker Man today remains a stirring, frightening, hypnotic tale that still manages to deliver the shocks thirty years later. Edward Woodward plays police inspector Howie, an idealic, Christian who is lead to the mysterious island town of Sumerisle where a young girl has disappeared and is apparently dead. His investigations reveal a pagan cult with sinister intentions for the outsider, culminating in one of the most unforgettable climaxes in all of cinema. Everything about Robin Hardy's masterpiece stands out on it's own: the hypnotic music and seductive yet eerie atmosphere, helped by Britt Ecklund's naked night time dance and the great Christopher Lee's superb performance as the Lord of the land. As said before, forget the terrible, watered down remake, this Wicker Man is the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie - LOUSY DVD","review":"Wicker Man is a highly under-rated study in modern witchcraft.

It is hard to believe that a Limited Edition of a DVD could actually be worse than the VHS version. In fact it is worse that seeing it on broadcast TV, circa 1970. How they could have trashed the video quality is beyond me.The \\"Limited Edition\\" includes a wooden boxed set of two DVDs. One containing a wide screen version, and the other is in broadcast TV format.

The only good thing about this movie is the nudity and sex. Very thin plot. The ending was too predictable, I guessed it around the first half of the movie. I don't think the remake will be any good either, but it couldn't be worse. If you really have to watch this movie, turn the sound off, the subtitles on, and play some good music while it is playing.

Don't be fooled by the few people who say us \\"wicker Man haters\\" are narrow minded. I admit that it was very unconventional. I love things that don't go by the book.

He's got the stereotype down pat as he has repressed and prudish attitudes towards sex and he is angrily intolerant of any religious beliefs and practices that are not his own.Yet little has been made of the portrayal of pagans in this movie which is equally negative given the film's conclusion. Just imagine if bigots like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson ever got a hold of this movie. The ending would confirm a major fallacy they and those of their ilk would like to perpetuate against modern day pagans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film - but not this version","review":"The Wicker Man is a great film - a one-off unlike anything else. Christopher Lee thinks it might be his best performance, and I'd agree. However, this film has suffered release in butchered versions and unfortunately this DVD is one of them. The original verion of this film is 104 minutes long. The DVD version is an 88 minutes. Imagine another of your favorite movies with 16 minutes cut out of the climax. Someday The Wicker Man will be released as it was intended and I'll be able to give it 5 stars. Until then, hunt for the out-of-print uncut video version. It's out there and it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can get obsessed...","review":"I've seen this movie a few times and even though I can't watch the final scene, I love it. It's extremely dated, but somehow for me that just added to the atmosphere of subtly building and surreal horror. As far as I can tell, this is extremely well-researched, though there seems to be a slight mixing of different pre-Christian cultures. I can't explain the fascination of this film; a pagan myself, I'm very aware it does not paint a very flattering (or accurate) picture of modern witches. The soundtrack is amazing and Christopher Lee is enchanting as the sinister and charming Lord Summerisle. I highly recommend this movie. It will both entrance and deeply disturb you."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is important?","review":"See the movie. All this noise over which version is best, or which this one is, is irrelevant if you have never seen the movie before. This is a great story, with great acting, with a thought-provoking message, and a suprise ending.What are the foundations of your faith? How do you define right and wrong? What impact have our spoon-fed religions had over us as we shaped our beliefs and set our paths into motion? In the moment of truth... how will your faith manifest itself? Is neo-puritan rectitude (from a Christian point of view) more holy and desirable than a Pagan path?This movie will cause you to face these concepts, while entertaining you in the process. Ignore the quibbles about which version this is. It is a deeply provocative movie in any of its incarnations and worthy of your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I got the wrong version...","review":"I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for ages, so my expectations may had been a bit high.

However, I don't see how it could get so many great reviews! I mean I like a lot of movies from Magnolia to Hedwig and The Angry Inch. I figured this would be one of those movies that blow me away and I would go to each one of my family members and friends and tell them all about it.Oh how I was wrong.

I guess while others see this as being artistic or filled with taboo subject matter, I just see it as a laughably bad movie.The nude dancing sequence made me crack up.The music was so bad it was funny (although it was the 70's)Not much of a plot going on.The police officer's strong religious convictions come off as whiny and tiresome, and I was pretty glad to see his fate at the end.Christopher Lee is the only good point I can think of.All in all, I suppose it was an \\"educational experience\\" for me to see this widely celebrated 70's \\"classic\\". I guess maybe I expect every old horror film to be as good as the Vincent Price classics, so I learned my lesson.

Save your money, and your time! Don't watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A film that makes you think - How are you supposed to feel?","review":"This is a rather unusual film, set in the eerie, yet beautiful midsts of a remote Scottish island. The storyline is captivating and the ending is somewhat shocking although not unexpected. I feel that to some people this may give rise to ignorant prejudices against 'alternative' religions, especially Wiccans and other pagan groupings, but however horrific and seemingly unjust the ending is, the story is based on the fact that in ancient times many cultures did employ a human sacrifice to appease the gods and they believed that it worked. The basic question that the film is asking is; \\"Is morality a Judeo-Christian invention, or does it exist above and beyond religion?\\". Overall a well made film that makes you think. And the folky, melancholic music is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never seen the 87 minute version","review":"So I guess I'm lucky. The 103 or whatever minute version I've seen 4 times. It's an interesting film from start to finish, but I can understand why some people might not like it. If your idea of a brilliant film is \\"Men In Black\\" then you should skip this one altogether. However, if you like a strangely fascinating suspense film with religious themes, then rent it (the 103+ minute one). I don't think it's really anti-Christain as some have said, and it's not really pro-Pagan either, although there is due respect to the religion. It's really more of a suspense film about people's beliefs. It's also very erotic at some points. \\"Gentle Johnny\\" is an excellent song, and you can find the soundtrack somewhere... but I don't know what's on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"I had been hearing about this movie for years and just recently watched it.

The result is a near incomprehensible mess. That appears to be what this disc contains.Instead, seek out the 1979 restoration (around 95 minutes) or the Canal Plus/Anchor Bay release of a reconstructed 99 minute director's cut version.

THE WICKER MAN is one of the great overlooked horror/suspense films of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review of the original american release (88 mins)","review":"I had always heard the original \\"The Wicker Man\\" was a classic horror movie. I just recently saw the travesty of a remake with Nicolas Cage, and decided to see the original. I have to say the original makes a lot more sense and was by far the better movie in every aspect. The tale is one of mystery and faith, Christianity vs. paganism. The scene between Lord Summerisle and Sergeant Howie absolutely makes the movie. The scene with Willow trying to seduce the detective has to be one of the sexiest things ever on celluloid and manages it without being trashy. Christoper Lee and Edward Woodward are spectacular as the leads and Brit Ekland is absolutely beguiling as Willow. I did see the 88 min American release, which did seem to have some unexplained plot points, especially regarding Ed woodward's character Sgt. Howie but I am told there is an extended version that fills in some of the holes. I definately hope to see that version in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird but cool!","review":"Not your typical movie. I knew nothing about it going in accept that it is a cult classic and Nick Cage had done a crappy remake. It is definitely original. Part horror, part suspense mystery, part musical. I don't think I have ever seen anything like it before or since. I recommend if you like films that are very original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing Metaphors","review":"Sorry to use a non film comparison but The Wicker Man is the cinematic version of Brueghel's painting \\"Carnival Versus Lent\\". The Christian reviewers seeing this film as indicting Paganism misunderstand it in the same way various modern Pagans have thought of The Wicker Man as a celebration of Paganism. In reality, it takes an existentialist approach showing the hypocricy of all beliefs and I would hardly call that dated. Not just the music (haunting English ballads with bawdy themes) but all the imagery is so evocative that each viewing brings up more intuition. Just as significant as The Seventh Seal but a hell of a lot more entertaining and a lot less pretentious. Its too bad that the only way to get the extended version of dvd is in the special edition box.

It is basically a compilation of anything that can possibly go wrong in a film. If there is a theatre in hell, this is the movie that is playing. I am strongly urging you not to rent or buy this movie. No one (no matter what their sins) deserves to watch such a poorly made movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Predictable Ending Ever","review":"One of the most overrated movies of all time. It is worth a watch for the nudity and seeing Britt Ekland, and really isn't that bad of a movie, but to ranked as a great film by anyone is crazy. It's definitely creepy, but I knew after the first 10 minutes what was going to happen. There is no horror and no suspense, just creepiness. The 5 star reviews must be from pretentious film geeks who only follow whatever is \\"cool.\\" That being said, don't waste your money on the film, but watch it on cable if there is nothing else on at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS BY FAR MY LEAST FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME","review":"What can I say?

This was a typical 60's like flower child 'hippy' song and dance act with a lot of very slow evil lurking in the back ground that never seemed to develop. This could have been beter as an afternoon soap opera series like the original 'DARK SHADOWS'...very slow, never really getting to the point. Poor acting, poor script..not worth a dollar even if you find it at your local \\"GOODWILL\\" store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with occasional ugg!","review":"This book was really hit and miss for me!I loved the concept of this book, but take issue with the execution. The idea of using the Grail Castle as a central component of the Celtic male mysteries was inspired! I enjoyed the employment of psychological constructs and mythical archetypes, but was disappointed by the way the auther interpreted many of these. The phycology utilized in the text often painted the majority of men to be ignorant, idiotic, or arrogant by nature. Many of the Irish and British/Welsh myths were interpreted to be rather homophobic and misogynistic (despite the female coauthor).This book will have a permanent place on my bookshelf; though it will likely go through a heavy editing process involving coffee-stained paper, rubber cement, and a pencil"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book!","review":"I first met the book in the uni library. Having been teaching natural resources and environmental economics, I find this intermediate textbook with is useful and worthy of recommendating for those postgraduates who have strong interests in theoretical exploration. Since almost all textbooks in the market are elementary and are not suitable for the advanced readers, this book with new approaches has been increasingly used in the uni. However, this book does not pay enough attention to environmental policy. This should be considered by the authors when the third edition is composed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read for discouraged management accountants.","review":"For those management accountants who feel less than totally appreciated (the real ones will know this to be a common feeling) then this book shows how financial accounting usurped management accounting when the bean counters went looking for shareholders and needed to tell less than the truth about what was going on inside their firms.If auditors are just hookers with a degree, then financial accountants are then just politicians without a cause - you cannot run a business on late and averaged data from the financial perspective.This book reminds us that knowing what things cost to make and cost to sell is what keeps a firm on the black ink side of the ledger.Worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent treatment of subject","review":"This is a small book which puts forward the idea that we must return to a better use of product cost data to make decisions. The authors review the literature going back to the first industries in the 1700's that used cost data in a managerial way. The work quotes heavily A. Chandler, J.M. Clark and Vatter for their contributions. It then reformulates their idea's and other historical data to come to the author's conclusion. In summary, it is well done for those interested in the subject and have an appreciation for business history"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best diaper ointment we've found","review":"This is by far the best diaper cream we've ever found. We've used it over the years with 2 kids and now a 3rd. Hopefully, they don't change the formulation with the new owners. You can use it for other skin rashes as well and works great. It smells great and ingredients are safe as such that you can use anywhere without worry. I probably wouldn't recommend it be applied in the eyes though.

I was hooked within minutes. The Beales, Big and Little Edie, welcome us into their home and their lives. They make no apologies for the way they live and exude a sense of privilige even while living in squalor. I was left feeling quite taken with Little Edie, with all of her charm and innocence. After seeing both the documentary and the HBO film I am amazed at Drew Barrymore's portrayal of Little Edie. It is uncanny and absolute. This documentary, packaged with a bonus DVD of footage not in the original will make you laugh, cry and sometimes cringe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing At Best","review":"While it seemed amusing and benign at the onset, it was extremely difficult to watch this movie. Seeing obiously mentally ill people being so blantantly expoitedfor profit was very unsettling. Watching the competition between mother and daughter really hurt.Also, watching them eat in those conditions. It was worse than watching a family in a third world country. Why, you might ask? This should not be happening in the United States of America.For artistic purposes, I'd like to purchase the the made for tv movie, but I'd first make sure the younger Ms. Beale is entitled to part of the profit from these purchases."},{"rating":"2","title":"personality disorders, mental illness and possible alcoholism","review":"What a sad story . . . I am surprised to hear so little in other reviews about the mental health issues in this family (those things mentioned above) plus the emotional abuse big edie spewed upon little edie non-stop. She would not let her amount to anything, and used her to satisfy her needs. I noticed time and time again the double-messages she gave little edie: \\"you are a great singer-- don't sing!\\" \\"you need to loose that weight -- do you want some ice cream?\\" \\"you never got a husband or babies -- your boyfriend was horrendous!\\" \\"you are a great poetess -- stop reciting that poem!\\" Enough to make anyone insane. And their inability to function, magical thinking, and emphasis on images (the mirror, the pictures) instead of reality: all very sad to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+ Documentary","review":"This is one of the most hypnotic documentaries ever filmed. Big and Little Edie are fascinating and eccentric as their bizarre, reclusive lives are revealed. This is a documentary film in the truest sense of the word - gritty, unflinching and real. It has influenced many artists, designers, photographers and film makers and has a huge cult following. It's haunting... if you watch it, you'll never forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating and disturbing","review":"Grey Gardens is a fascinating yet disturbing look into the lives of two women, mother and daughter. Little Eddie clearly suffers from a mental disorder and her mother appears oblivious to the conditions they are living in, which are unsanitary and erratic. Despite that, the fascination with the characters and there theatrical way of expressing themselves and dressing is amazing. They appear to be living in an imaginary world they have created in order to rise above their actual circumstances. Breath taking."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is just two crazy old women","review":"Frankly I enjoyed the movie better. I realize this was a \\"documentary\\" but in the movie, things were explained. The documentary just portrayed them as two crazy old women, \\"which they were\\"! The only reason the documentary was made is because they had famous relatives. Had this been my relatives, or your relatives, it would just be two crazy old women living in a rundown house with too many cats and too many raccoons. Don't spend one dime on the documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive dose of humor at the expense of an american treasure","review":"Felt as if I was peeping through the Beale's key hole.

If you're a celebrity-gone-broke voyeur, you'll love this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd: Yes, Good: No.","review":"This documentary shows two annoying old biddies (relatives of Jackie Onassis) in their vermin infested and falling apart 75 room mansion on Long Island. Ok, so they're insane, they're related to Jackie O and their once beautiful place is trashed.We are never given any real biographies of the two women, other than hints of singing and/or stage work here and there. It was distracting trying to figure out why anyone would even care about these two. Nor are we given any real history of the mansion.Without the history, there's nothing interesting about these lunatics other than the Jackie O connection. I'd rather have seen a documentary on the racoons in the attic.This film is essentially a train wreck for intellectuals looking for camp that's not as mainstream as, say, Beavis and Butthead.Personally, I'd take Beavis any day.If nothing else, this film will make you want to clean your house, which is pathetic if you're the filmmaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Holds up after all these years. I can't help but feel really sad for little Edie every time I watch this. She could have made a living with a fashion industry job, given her creativity and fashion sense. I don't understand why her brothers or other relatives did not step in to help her."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Trip to Nowhere","review":"Grey Gardens obviously has a lot of fans. The documentary did nothing for me. It is the story of a mother (Big Edie) and her daughter (you guessed it, Little Edie) who are related to Jackie Kennedy. They live in a rambling, decrepit house in the Hamptons on Long Island.Little Edie has severe mental problems. She tells stories about her life that may or may not be true. The Edies are both codependent and engage in vicious fights. Occasionally, an outsider comes by and observes their weird behavior. That's it - nothing else happens in this film.The directors deserve credit for allowing the Edies to tell their own stories. However, the lack of a narrative causes Grey Gardens to meander along the road to nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The PURRRRFECT costume for the day.......","review":"I had read about Grey Gardens in New York magazine and was intrigued enough to find this DVD. I am so glad I did. I can see why this has become a huge indie/doc legend. Steven Spielberg could not have created these characters! I don't believe in being a plot spoiler or giving away content in reviews but if you are interested in high society of the 40s and 50's or are an Jackie O or culture junkie, this DVD is a must watch.The fact that it has become a broadway legend already should say it all. Make sure to watch all of the extras as they really are worth the time. You will understand the title of this review as it is revealed in the first few frames of the movie....ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grey Gardens is Golden!","review":"If you have any interest in these eccentric but infectious women - then you need to see these DVDs. You have a greater understanding as to why people are interested in them enough to do a documentary film and then make a fabulous broadway show out of it. Granted, the first attraction to them is the fact that they were relatives of the late Jackie Onasis Kennedy - but once you are introduced to them - you can't help but to want to know more about them. At first I thought they were just crazy - and although there appears to be shades of insanity, their views on some things seem to be dead on. These DVDs give you the chance to meet these ladies and see why they are so magnetic. I have watched it several times already."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 3rd Beale of Grey Gardens","review":"If you are like me, and delight in all that is eccentric and off-the-beaten-path, you will LOVE this set. These two women are extraordinary in their brilliance, glamour and eccentricity. I fell in love with their story, their existence in the run down mansion in the Hamptons, which they shared with raccoons and a plethora of cats. The costume changes, the singing, the bickering, the relationships they developed with the men who were filming. . This documentary is pure gold in my opinion. I wish I could have known the fabulous Beales myself. I would have asked to rent a room, then, after aggressive cleaning and added electricity, I would spend my days dressing up, singing old show tunes and eating pate with the girls. They led a truly amazing life of advantage, and it was extraordinary to me to see these two and what became of them when all they had left was their Addams Family type dwelling, cats, clothes, and memories of their pasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best you'll ever see!","review":"This is a very insightful, and at times, sad video.

I felt desperately sad for the younger Eddie, as depression from loss of interaction of a real life is driving her mad. To the writer and directors credit, the senior nuding and sentimental moments between the mother and daughter were worth watching it to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grey Gardens","review":"Grey Gardens is one of the worst films that I have ever seen.

Capturing an immense range of character while provoking in the viewer a stunning emotional response - from the deep sadness and loss of a life unlived, of thwarted dreams to the delight of wit and intelligence surviving, thriving in hardships. Edie Beale (jr) is an extraordinary beauty, trapped in a prison of her own choosing. The moments of humor and poignancy are too many to mention. Buy this movie and live with it.

A sad inside look at two women who obviously must have some deep inner demons. Of course the only reason for this documentary being made is the connection with the Kennedy family but there is little to none explanation made to the history or connections of these two very sad lives. If you enjoy spending an hour or two watching uncomfortably sad portrayals of a couple of women who fell from high society only to become the crazy lonely hermit living \\"aunts\\" then you might find this enjoyable. I only found myself squirming with the pony show these women were made into and left with no insight of the history of their story."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad, pointless","review":"Why did they make this film? What was the point? If there had not been a Bouvier connection to Jacqueline, there would have been no film and we all would have been better off.It's depressing and sad to see two women, both of whom were quite beautiful in their youth, descend to such insanity.

I sat through half and finally came to my senses and turned it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Grey Area","review":"In this amazing documentary, the Maysles take on the take on the story of Big and Little Edie Bouvier, living in recently-cleaned filth in their ancestral house in the Hamptons. The Edies bare all about what's left of thier lives, seemingly taking pleasure in defacing their \\"legacy\\" (at one point, big Edie looks approvingly as a cat pees on her portrait). Strangely, this is not played for \\"Baby Jane\\" value- despite the fact that the filmakers reportedly had to wear flea collars on their ankles to complete their epic, you get the distinct impression that they liked both Edies- certainly I did by the end of the film- which ends in little Edie giving a chilling revival of her dancing abiities: chilling because you can see how very close this strange, damaged woman could have been to being the person she was in her head.I can only imagine how much big Edie was thwarted as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you!","review":"Thank you for this amazing set of dvds.

Regarding a mild critique by another reviewer about Msgr. Elliott's bias, I did not find his occasional dispensing of advice when there is the liturgical equivalent of a \\"jump ball\\" to be off-putting at all.

In the past ten or twelve years, many books were published to cater to the exploding popularity of perfume bottles as a collectors item. Christie Lefkowith's book stands out because of its focus on the ART of perfume bottles (hence the title), rather than their monetary value. Bottles are viewed in the cultural context of their time, with photographs of by far THE best quality I have ever seen in perfume books.

This book offers only obvious pieces of advice, and furthermore, the author doesn't seem to have the background to be considered an expert in the field.

There are quite a few enlightened people in the world (many Buddist monks) but none of them live that long.

Hallibuton is such a talented writer and presents sometimes very difficult concepts with such effortless simplicity. One important aspect of this book is the way in which different ideas and different chapters are tied together. For example, the writter explains the infinite-alleles model and then goes on to describe why such a model could be useless at the molecular level, hence the need for an infinitely-many sites model. All the chapters are classic reading; his Chapter 4 on Recombination, Linkage and Disequilibrium in particular is a real treat. Halliburton also gives a very decent treatment of Coalescent Theory and even goes on to descibe extensions of it in the case of selection, population subdivision and recombination.This is a very recent important book, and a most deserving competitor to Hartl and Clark's \\"Principles of Population Genetics\\". It has my highest recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like and Dislike At The Same Time","review":"I like the product however once I washed the comforter the colors ran.

It resembles canvas more than cloth, and the color is rich. My only concern is washing, if it'll retain this color after several washes, and if the color will bleed.

Great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nice documentary","review":"This review is for the Criteron Colection DVD edition of the film.Salesman is a well made documentary on the now bygone era of door to door salesmen. This film focuses exclusively on the sale of Catholic Bibles. There are not interviews, but unscripted action of the salesmen doing their work. They film the sales pitches and the prospective customer's reactions. As one could guess, making a sale could often be difficult. The movie focuses on four different salesmen making their sales pitches in Boston, Florida and Chicago.It is one of many documentaries made by the Maysles brothers and the Criterion DVD is one of their \\"director approved\\" editions.The DVD has numerous special features including a theatrical trailer, filmographies of the directors, production photos, a 1968 TV interview with the Maysles brothers, a 2000 interview with one of the salesmen in the film, and audio commentary by Albert Maysles, Charlotte Zerwin who are two of the three directors of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film on Psychology of Selling and Sales Teams","review":"This movie was listed as an inspiration for Glengarry Glen Ross (according to the plays author, Mamet). The roles in the film are not unique to anyone who has worked with professional sales people and offers a detached view that gives insight into the seller and the buyer.

I read it cover-to-cover before class started to get ahead, and was thoroughly disappointed. There are a few interesting things, but nothing a good professor won't cover in just as much detail in class (and will likely do so in a more useful, applied manner). Quite honestly, this is a boring read lacking quality information, and I have since sold the book. Compared to my love of the networking, os and compiler books, my appreciation for this book is nil. I keep Software Engineering 8 around since it is a useful resource in many ways, and even that book trumps this UI book by far. I would personally avoid buying this book if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbosity at its finest","review":"This book looks more like a collection of references than a real text book. The author inserts references to other works and papers in such a random and repetitive fashion that makes reading the book a real pain in the ass.And then there is the verbosity. Apparently, Mr Shneiderman likes to list items and give examples. And he likes it a lot. If you make the terrible mistake of reading this book you will navigate through never-ending paragraphs that make circles and circles around the same idea, giving pointless examples of an anyways pretty obvious concept.This book is really bad. It looks like the author just copy-pasted the contents of his course slides and inserted some pretty pictures in the middle. Don't waste your money and/or your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Book is very well written, and covers all the topics necessary and with the necessary detail to grasp the concepts related to human interface design.

The book covers virtually every aspect of HCI and provides a comprehensive set of discussions regarding alternative presentation styles, different types of interaction devices, acceptable response times, windows management strategies, social impacts, and much more. Those readers familiar with Shneiderman's work will appreciate the extensive amount of real-world experience (with supportive examples) that has gone into producing such a book. For me, the most important revisions to this edition are his discussions on information visualization. - a mainstream HDI (human data interface) technique which is clearly presented in Chapter 15.

Roy Blount once said that King writes like an angel would if it grew up in West Texas and drank. It's hard to improve on Blount's assessment. King's rollicking missives, directed to friends, family, politicians, critics, and fellow writers offer a fascinating portrait of the writing life. There's also the vicarious thrill of reading someone else's mail. Stories range from fellow author William Styron's run-in with \\"Mexican boo-smoke\\" to King's feud with the \\"alleged actor Burt Reynolds.\\" The fact that a book this interesting has been published by a university press instead of a major trade house is as indicative as anything of the sorry state of affairs in the publishing industry these days.

Suberb story teller, and you will love the prose. Dark Story though"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rate Work","review":"Any reader of McCarthy's work knows that he views the human condition as one of substantial adversity, but not without redeeming value. His earlier work, set in Tennessee (including this) seem to have a more affecting quality. Something seems more \\"true\\", closer to home. These books evoke an emotional reaction to the characters. His later work set on the border, reflects a world of great natural beauty and incredible human savagery. I prefer the earlier works, although this may just be a matter of personal taste. This is a really fine book, as are most of the works of this excellent writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"disjointed and self indulgent","review":"Having first read \\"The Road\\" McCarthy's brilliant apocalyptic tale I was expecting much more from this, his first novel. While the characters are developed nicely there is no story for the reader to grasp, just an occasional glimmer of continuity. What we expect never materializes and the reader is left wondering what they've just spent time trying to digest. McCarthy tends to ramble on about nothing in what appears, at times, to be a Miriam-Webster exercise in obscure and abstract terms. At times it seems as if Mr. McCarthy is peering down his nose at us and saying I'm just too smart for my own good and you, my layperson friends, just don't \\"get\\" me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible, slow gibberish","review":"Although I have favorably reviewed this author's later work, including The Road, this novel just did not resonate in my mind and soul.

Many of the people who made great sacrifices and fought to build the business and brand are not even mentioned. Who did the marketing research? Who made the programming changes? Who created the brand image campaigns and advertising? Who wrote the strategic, marketing and programming plans that led to the growth in ratings and revenues.

Excellent picture quality and excellent detail to sound. Would have been awesome to have been in the crowd and not watching at home on Blu Ray. This is an intimate concert (400 people???) so for surround sound of the crowd, you're not going to get that stadium/arena/ roar effect after each song, or the bellowing sound from the stage either. But saying that, this is defintely a must for all Hall & Oates fans, even if you only know a couple of their songs. Perhaps this concert sounds better in pure stereo as most of the sound appears to be from the stage rather than entire venue, rather than setting to surround sound??? After all that I can only give 4 stars in total. Compare the sound on this Blu Ray to Adele live at Albert Hall, or Sade and you'll see why (I know they're not the same kind of concert, but it just lacks that wow factor). What are you waiting for? Just buy it! I'll definitely watch it many times again :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will be watching over and over","review":"Well I have albums of concerts that I pull out weekly for viewing- LOTS!! And this one on blue-ray is the number one I reach for. Video for the most part is well above par considering that shooting concerts is just tuff.The music in DTS 5.1 is beyond words- but I will use amazing for a sum. Music starts out nicely and they extended specific sections of the songs just where you would want them to do, just making that pleasure even longer. The band is balanced and with both Charlie (SAX) and T-bone (guitar) they just complement each other. As one poster noted, they really tried to give a great performance, and did they here.

I, on the other hand, find this holiday offering refreshing among your average, run-of-the-mill Christmas fare. It is easy to listen to, full of beautiful new material from composers who are actually alive and deserving of some exposure, and is presented simply and cleanly, without the over-production that accompanies most solo albums released by theatre people.And for those of you who prefer traditional holiday music, it's in there. But the beauty is that the new music fits in so seamlessly that you quickly wonder how you haven't been listening to them your whole life.I highly recommend giving it a try.

My window to return the product expired in July."},{"rating":"2","title":"keeps bugs away","review":"This Burgess 1443 is the best investment I spent,this year the bugs have been really bad and couldn't sit out in my backyard after dark ,know with my new Fogger I can sit in the yard without being eaten,much better then using bug sprays and after using the bug sprays always had to take shower before bed felt grimey but with the fogger just smoke around the area that you are going to sit in and you are bug free,great unit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally one that works !!","review":"This is my second fogger. The first was a Black Flag unit. I have used this thing quite a lot (about 20 bottles of juice and 4 cans of propane). It has never failed, clogged, or missed it's bug! I live in the country on 5 acres surrounded by woods. At night you will get carried off. A few minutes of spraying around the outside deck and we are bug and mosquito free for at least two hours. That is HUGE for Central Florida. I highly recommend this unit to my friends, and recommend the Black Flag unit to my enemies."},{"rating":"2","title":"It kills them.... It kills them all!!!","review":"This product works great and is easy to use. I have had it for about 1 1/2 months with no problems. Part of having no problems is doing your research and finding out how to clean it and doing preventative maintenance. The 40 ounce tank will go a long ways in fogging. Also, the fuel cost about 3-4 bucks a tank. It says the fuel tank will last about 2-3 hrs. I really like using the fogger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Mosquitoes were bad this year and this really helped. I found using it at least every three days was optimal to keeping the bites to a minimum. You can fog your backyard in a few minutes however there needs to be very little wind as the fog is extremely lightweight. Dusk works best, keeps the fog in the area or low longer. Takes about two minutes to get hot to start and then about a minute to cool off and stop spraying fog when you turn it off. I used it pretty regular over the summer and still on original propane can and I even did the front yard a few times when the bugs were really bad. I am not good about using a mask but one night I sprayed going in wrong direction of the wind and ended up getting surrounded in fog so I inhaled a decent amount for a few seconds. I did not feel great the rest of the night so I now wear a mask every time. Just remember to start spraying downwind and work way towards the direction of the wind, even if the wind is light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate","review":"Product works well until the fluid level gets to about 1/3 full. Once at that point the sump is not able to pick up the fluid well and generate the fog as required. It's OK, but not great. I would not buy this product again or recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I got this for use in the back yard and also for camping. It's very portable and seems to work well for getting a good cloud of fog going to knock out those pesky mosquitos. It definitely takes a couple uses to get the hang of the pumping rhythm."},{"rating":"2","title":"seems to work great!","review":"Just used it for the first time and it seems to work great! I have a decent size yard and I went thru the whole pint, so it may get a little costly to run for the whole summer, but I'd rather do that than coat bugspray on or get eatin alive! I'm hoping between this and my new skeetervac i can enjoy my backyard again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent....then bad then Excellent!!!","review":"...for 2 months. It stopped fogging the way it used to. I am now unable to return it.Basically, it seems as though it clogged up and hardly any fog comes out if any at all.UPDATE: I was able to remove the little nut from the tip of the fogger and stick a long paper clip and then a thin flat head screwdriver to clean it out. A lot of burned deposits came out. Now it's back to working like a champ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible!","review":"I bought this in june and its n ot august.

After researching it appeared that the Burgess would be better so I purchased it. However, I was disappointed by its performance. Compared to the Black Flag fogger it did not have an ignitor so you need a separate flame source. It consumed much more liquid for the area you are fogging and it did not put out the volume of fog either. It also does not shut off as easily. On the plus side it does appear to be better made with its own reservoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked three times and died","review":"Worked like a charm the first time; not as well the second time; not at all the third time (just a faint puff of smoke and nothing more). I followed all of the instructions to the letter, but the device is now fit for the garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"Exact Fit\\"","review":"When I was in the automotive business, I used Trico wipers regularly, and as I recall, they were good quality. These seemed to be decent quality, but not nearly the quality of the original equipment wipers on my Chevy Lumina.They definitely were NOT an exact fit for my car. They were close and probably would have worked ok. However, when I installed them, part of the retaining clip that secures the wiper blade on the arm broke. It seemed like it might hold on ok with part of the retaining clip secure, but then I thought about the wiper flying off my car at 65 MPH in a rain storm. So I returned both of them and went to the dealer, yes the dreaded dealer, to buy an original set, which turned out to be only $1.00 (one dollar) more expensive than the Tricos.So, my recommendation is to check with the dealer on price before ordering these and then make a decision on which to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"so easy, but flimsy","review":"Look very much like the OEM ones I took off of my Honda, easy to put on! I got them on in about 5 minutes and it was getting dark out side! Trico does not make bold claims, they just make a decent wiper and the one thing I really like is it comes just with the adapter for your car's mount instead of a mess of adapters for a lot of different vehicles. For this reason alone, I will keep buying these. Also, easy to get into the package and nicely packed.update January 2013, do not buy these, I hd to replace them in less than 3 months, the mechanism that holds them to the main wiper is flimsy and driver side one broke this morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for 2006","review":"I wish I had spent time in the reviews section and noticed the commentary about the horrible graphics in this book!!For the price, I would have thought that even though it was written over a decade ago (multiplied by Internet time, that is a long time ago), they could have spent the time to create colored illustrations. It is painful to try to read about interfaces in such a poorly presented book. Talk about a broken mental model.It's worth $20, but not $60 --until they spend the time to update it into this century."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"They eat their own food...\\"","review":"Excellent book. I have been shopping around for all books related to \\"Information Design\\" and this one is mandatory.

It shows examples of good and bad design and provides very readable theoretical background of cognition topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"This book does a great job of covering fundamentals. Many real world examples make it a great reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete Guide to Interface Designs","review":"This book has received apparently rave reviews, if you look at the stars. But it is simply obsolete. A black and white book, with low resolution images, is no longer appropriate to interface design. Notice that you cannot look inside this book - why is this? The publisher has a good reason for not wanting you to see a preview: you would see the greyscale content, and would probably not purchase it - especially at the asking price of almost $60.Color is such an indispensable (do I really need to say that? Apparently so...) component to ANY interface design, it is hard to see how a black and white newsprint-quality booklet can do the job. Far better, and up-to-date, is O'Reilly's \\"Designing Interfaces\\" by Jenifer Tidwell, or even \\"User Interface Design and Evaluation\\" by Debbie Stone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pros and cons","review":"True, this is one of the best Design and Visual Interface books available. However, at times, the \\"Sun Micro and Apple Mac\\" bias became repetitive and old. It's not that I don't agree that Mac has always had the best interface and that MS Windows is an inferior take-off, it's that the authors failed to comprehensively address the 3.x Windows interface, pro or con. Maybe that was not their goal. Or, perhaps they just need to write a second edition. Also noted is that the authors state, at the end of the book, that Chapter 4 is most critical to the reader, yet the Table of Contents doesn't even have chapter numbers. Oh well, perhaps a minor flaw in a very good book that itself, is visual to the eye and even nice to the touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I have had the chance to meet Hobo Jim several times and everytime he has remembered me, even though here have be years between the meetings.

This should have been a good magazine article, not a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, confusing, repetitive, lively...","review":"I found the writing and information in this book to be worth reading and interesting and lively enough to keep me reading. However some information was a bit repetitive (i.e. the favorite of the count) while other information seemed lacking (i.e. refering to places in frace that i know not).It is worth reading because: 1. It has good information that is based on actual records but isn't so dry you can't wade through it. 2. The story is a good one to think about in terms of implications on our own justice systems in the current world. 3. It reshapes how you think about people of the knightly era.It isn't worth buying because: 1. The story isn't written to contain facets that you enjoy reading over and over. 2. It is neither dumbed down quite enough for a person who has no knowledge of that history (outside of inaccurate movies and books) nor a good compilation of really academic information. 3. There are no really pretty pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping tale of Medieval Europe","review":"Eric Jager does a marvelous job bringing the late middle ages to life. He uses the story of the infamous duel between Carrouges and Le Gris as a backdrop for an in-depth look at civil life during the period, which is surprisingly similar to our own. In addition, Jager masterfully builds the suspense and makes you care about the outcome like any good crime writer should. This book is a lot of fun and you'll learn something too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and good looking","review":"Everything looks better on a square plate.

I am so glad I did!!The box was delivered earlier today, less than a week after I placed the order. Each and every piece in the set was wrapped in a layer of cardboard with more cardboard around that, so I'm happy to report that there is not a scratch, chip, or crack to be found.Each piece has a very nice weight and I love the shapes of the plates, bowls, and mugs. The simplicity of the white color will be fun to dress up for various occasions. Very nice set!

I was thrilled to find it on Amazon 2 years ago, and bought it. It has held up in the dishwasher, and it looks great with on the table. I love the square plates, the coffee mugs are the perfect size.

Personally I wouldn't buy or watch again"},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been better","review":"I cannot fault the locale, sets, costumes and most of the cast, but the background music is abominable. It sounds like something from a trite 60s action series. I keep expecting Peter Gunn or one of his ilk to appear. Just when you are finally able to get involved in the story line along comes background music so jarring that it totally destroys the mood the actors and director worked so hard to evoke. You are suddently, and all too abruptly aware that they are merely playing at recreating one of the most dramatic periods of the last century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, but flags halfway through","review":"Nice idea, highlighting the work of undercover women in WW II. The series starts out with string characters and decent writing. But it loses its way about halfway through. Characters keep doing inexplicable things. The dialog becomes trite, and the acting follows it. Really...a priest ranting at God on a hillside? Anyway, a good idea poorly executed, all in all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What luck?","review":"The promo for the DVD sounded good. I usually like UK stories about WWII esp Foyle's War. This started out to be intriguing then it became boring and totally lost me in trying to understand why these women joined this force. Although some glimmer into their lives offered some clue. The story moved very slowly. Scenes were trite & cliche. Reduntent? I was not able to relate to or connect with the characters in the story. I returned unopened the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"an unfortunate purchase","review":"I normally love the British dramas having to do with WWII. Especially loved Foyle's War, and pine for new episodes. (There aren't any more planned.) Wish Me Luck is a real dog. It was made in the 80s and shows its age. Cheesy looking, with inauthentic hairstyles, etc. I watched it for about half an hour, was bored, and turned it off. Will likely end up as a donation to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"production (value) frozen in time","review":"the movie has a so-la-la script, not thrilling or exciting, but transports somehow the story. acting is doable. the director's work is just awful - stiff, wooden, two dimensional and so is the entire production. most of it filmed in a studio, or probably on a stage. it looks like a tele(stage)play from the early sixties. i was surprised that such low production value still exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"dated","review":"It had all the right stuff---WW2, intrigue, spies, BUT it is just too dated with weak characterization and script.

Parents have plenty of resources for teaching the biology of sex, but talking to kids about sex is much more complicated, especially with the influence of a media that promotes casual sex. The detrimental impact of current culture on our children's sexuality is more apparent with each passing year, making it critical for parents to be effective teachers of values. Ms. Stark's book has given me great encouragement. There is also very good material on how to bullet-proof our children from sexual abuse and generally how to be the kind of parents that kids listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"Product seems to be of reasonable quality, but sizing seems to be pretty conservative.

I am to believe this woman with the emotional age of 14 and problem solving skills of about the same graduated from a well regarded university? Her friends are equally ridulous, two demential annoying stereotypes. And who would refer to themselves and their friends as \\"Spa Girls\\"? Often. It is painful for me still to remember all of these details. I am putting this book behind me and hope that Amazon readers will spare themselves the torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's All That","review":"I didnt really care much for this book. It was boring to me and it seemed liked it was drawn out far too long. I absolutely loved her other book titled. \\"Split Ends\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick Lit at it's Best!","review":"I loved Billerbeck's Ashley Stockingdale Series, so I was eager to see if her new Spa Girls Series had the same sass and flair. I was not disappointed! In this series, there are three friends who meet regularly at a day spa to re-connect and work out their problems. All three characters are well-drawn and interesting--which only makes you long for the next book in the series. The star of this one, Lilly, is a flawed, quirky, and completely lovable financial guru turned fashion designer. I enjoyed getting a peak into the fashion industry. As with all of Billerbeck's books, there is a romantic thread that has you guessing til the end which guy will be The One. It's a rare book that can make me laugh out loud, but this one had me cackling several times. I can't wait to see what happens in the next installments of Spa Girls!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow read","review":"This author is writing way below her abilities. You can tell that she is a very witty and clever writer but her content leaves SO much to be desired. The main female character's main obsession is her HAIR, believing that it is the cause of all of her problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I have to say that this book gives a history of magic and some vague answers to the art of magic and illusion. It was basic information with some simple tricks. You could probably find the same stuff on the internet for free. If you are looking for answers about bigger illusions than making two matches pass through each other then this is not your book. He implies that the reader is not ready for some of the larger tricks in a tone that could be considered arrogant. Also, there is a lot of him tooting his own horn or telling you how great he is and how great his dad was, like we did not already know. He makes several references in the book as to how his dad was better than Houdini and how Houdini stole ideas and property from his dad. Maybe true, but thats not what I bought the book for. All in all, dont waste your money. It would be better spent elsewhere....you could learn more on YouTube and not have to read through all the fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"I good book for learning the history of magic.","review":"If you are looking for a book to learn magic tricks, try something else (like the Mark Wilson Course in Magic.) But if you would like a general book about magic history, especially the careers of the Blackstone Family, this is a good book to get. It covers all aspects of magic starting with ancient China, going through medieval times and heavily emphasizing from 1850 - 1980. Lots of photos and descriptions of a variety of magicians but only gets in depth with the Blackstones. It does have a few basic tricks but they are covered much better in other books.Overall I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pilates","review":"This is so far removed from anything like true Pilates that I believe it should not be listed when \\"Pilates\\" is used to search for videos. This is an American-style, Aerobic-type workout video which is fine if that's what you want. The only relationship it has to Pilates is a few of the postures you hit for about 10 seconds each, but not in any way can you say that they are done the way that a trained Pilates instructor would do them. A grave disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't feel very effective to me....","review":"Having used 'The Firm' tapes regularly for more than a year, I decided to give Pilates a try for a change in workout. I tried this tape for the first time this morning and was for the most part, unsatisfied. The way the instructor chants with the beat of the drums in the backround is thoroughly annoying, and the workout left no part of my body feeling...well...worked. Maybe the focus on the upper body was OK, but I didn't have any trouble with the ab or total body sections. It felt like a very long stretching session which should have lead to some hard work!Maybe that's the point? Am I missing something here? Maybe I'll try some different tapes...I just don't see what's so fantastic about Pilates!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy in every way","review":"In terms of ease to use and follow this tape is fantastic. The instructor is really easy to follow and doesn't go to quickly. Unfortunately, that's also the routines biggest flaw. This routine would be great for when you first wake up in the morning and are too groggy to jump right into a workout but the whole thing felt like a really dragged out warm up. There are definitely not enough exercises or repetitions to do very much good, especially not in the abs section. The upper body section was the most difficult but even that was pretty simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me on my way","review":"When I started exercising for the first time, the first 20 minute full body yoga/pilates workout changed my attitude towards working out. It didn't hurt, I just felt better. Taller and stronger in my back. My vcr ate my vhs tape so I am finally looking for a replacement since I have been out of the fitness loop for a few years. My thoughts on this workout is, if you are already in excellent shape it's not going to help lose weight. If you are out of shape or new to a \\"stretching\\" type workout it is a great beginning. Honestly, I love all of the Method workouts. When my boyfriend tried this style of working out he didn't think it was very hard or challenging until he corrected his form. You really have to concentrate on pulling your belly in, which they do an excellent job of reminding you of. Eventually, you add this form to your everyday life and what a difference it made for me! Now I have a different job and am looking forward to starting out all over again with this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I had very high hopes when I first got this DVD that it would be an easy introduction to yoga and pilates, which I have seen highly recommened. However, the instructions are not very clear, making it easy to fall behind. In addition, most of the exercises require you to take your eyes off the television, leaving you puzzled as to what moves you should be doing and when. Overall, this video is not one I would recommend unless you are already highly conversant in yoga and pilates."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guide to Understanding and Practice of Spiritual Healing","review":"Despite ordered from overseas,it's arrived within a week and a very good condition (Signed).

They work very well even into the teens in the typical cement bird baths with about 4-5 inch depth. In the REALLY cold weather they only keep a hole open about the size of the heater but that still gives the birds a place to get a drink! They hold up well. The only thing I would like to see is a longer cord (1- 1 1/2 foot?). This would allow the cord to hang over the side of the bird bath a bit more and still leave the heater well submerged. They do work quite well despite this \\"shortcoming\\" (sorry about the pun). They are very well made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"Rugged item and more than sufficient for a large bird bath even under zero temperature.

Simmons, writes a very nice tale about strange encounters, coping with anxiety, and the best way to start off your day. The author grabs you from the beginning as the lead character is reflecting on his life, on the train home, and at that moment, I easily could see this as a John Hughes motion picture. A few good points that I notice about the book, is it's ability to describe delicate issues with very gentle telling, as well as the type of expressing that a grandmother could read and not faint, as well the type that a vivid survivor-esque teenager could like. His descriptions of the character, Sammie, are beautiful, and you can tell that he has put time and emotion into every one of the characters in the book. Overall, I suggest this book to as many people as I can, and I feel as though it presents an excellent lesson as to dealing with the differences in people that we encounter in our every day life. This is not self absorbing banter, this is entertaining literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only contains two episodes","review":"My kindergartner loves the Jumanji movie starring Robin Williams, and when I saw that there was an animated show based on the movie, I checked several different sites to see if there was a DVD of the entire show, seasons 1-3.

They explain the male and female steps, show foot prints on the screen, demo in half time and normal time (really good for latin/salsa steps which are usually quick), plus show it from different angles. I recommend any of his videos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tape","review":"This video is really informative. It is for the basic learner who has a concept of the up and back steps, and nothing more. Really good for a first timer or beginner-level dancer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very basic beginner's video","review":"This video is the most basic of the 56 Salsa/Mambo video's that I know of. It is a gentle introduction to Salsa,Mambo, Merengue. Best suited for people with no dance experience or two left feet.

It was not only fustrating for myself but for my son trying to play with it. You just touch it and it came apart and it was not damaged. What a horrible design. Shame on whom ever appoved this item for Disney. Not durable at all. Any piece that is supposed to be snapped in will soon just pop right out. The sail poles constantly fell down it is designed like a 3D puzzle if one piece is touched it comes apart and we made sure it was put together properly.

The ship has parts that constantly fall, pull-apart, or pop-off...all of which make play impossible and frustrating for our grandson.

Our ship has orange, foamy trails of Gorilla Glue that failed to hold pieces in place.Look at the Pirates action figures--poor quality and detail too.

It is microwave safe and near impossible to break even when you drop it. I've used Corelle for over 40 years, replacing a few items as they have broken over the years. It is getting a little hard to find in the stores because not only is it is very reasonably priced, but you practically never have to replace it (so I guess the stores' profit is too low and they don't want to carry it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corelle dinnerware","review":"I am a long time Corelle user, and want an updated pattern for our everyday use.

Are they marked at the inlets/outlets?I also got a Flojet bladder tank to mount the pump on top. But wait. The connections on the pump base do not match any holes on the tank. You can make them fit with the pump feet hanging over the tank base. I am sure the pump will work fine once I get all the irregular, regular fittings to go in the places they need to be.

Since I set it up inside, I have not had the wild life problems outside I normally experience.Animal droppings on the porches, deer eating shrubbery against house, I had something to break into my attic and do $2000 in damages to my duct work , etc. This appears to make that less attractive to the raccoon or whatever it was/is.SO FAR.....10/04/2010Well this thing died a couple months ago.

The reason is, I believe, that paper is used for cones in the speakers. Plastic would not change characteristics and cease to vibrate. Pressure on the speaker cones makes them vibrate again while it is maintained. Attempts to maintain the correct pressure for continued operation are fruitless.Do not pay the high price for this unit. It is not worth it and I suspect the same is true of other Transonic, BirdX branded products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well made","review":"I bought this product a few days back. I plugged it in to drive the squirrels away from my driveway. I left it on on loud for one night and the squirrels were gone! I was a very happy camper.But that lasted only for a day! The next evening I turned it on and it started chirping as usual. Then at bedtime I went back to check on it and lower the volume and found that unit was not working and I could see a red lamp in the back lighted. It seems the unit is dead after one night use.So I have mixed review of this product. If it is operating normally, it works but the electronics quality is not reliable so there is no guarantee how long it will last. And at $35, I can't afford to replace it every week! I have a 90 day warranty from HFT so I may exchange it before 90 days, but I may return it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Loud","review":"I am not happy with this product.

I received it on the evening of February 6th, set it up and it appeared to be working well. A loud audible noise was being broadcast by the pest repeller. I shut the garage door and could still slightly hear the unit in operation. This morning my wife called me at work to see if I had turned the device off as there was no noise coming from the garage. I told her I would check out the unit when I returned home in the late afternoon. I went to the garage and found the repeller with the red power light on - but no audible sound coming from it. I tried changing the settings to see if I could coax the unit back to life, but it was DOA.For now I have rated the repeller one star.

Not being an expert, I cannot 100% contribute the pest absence to this product. Our house was 1400sqft and built in 1953. We experienced a sudden rat invasion leading to the purchase of this product. We placed it in the attic, and the sound was barely detectable in our normally bustling household. We did have the rats return in the two years following.

None of the settings is actually inaudible to me - I'm 62 - as the \\"Youth\\" setting is on the Mosquito.

The characters are memorable, the story is excellent, and Barbara Michaels is an excellent author. Since I enjoyed it so much back then, I decided to purchase it for my Kindle.Bad idea. Whoever turned it to Kindle format did a very lousy job of it. Lack of punctuation, missing words... It makes for annoying run-on and/or nonsensical sentences that distracted me during my re-read.

I give it marks for the history and mythology. Otherwise I was bored. I didn't really like any of the characters. There are 4 older adults and 2 young adults that are on this island. The 4 older folks had been there representing various perspectives during WWII. There was not enough foreshadowing to spark my interest as to why they all happened to be back together. The young woman kept having dreams and/or memories of a past life; take your pick. That sounds like it should be interesting, but it wasn't. Who-ever edited the Kindle addition was asleep at the switch, probably out of boredom.

It is a huge book (with huge type, and yawning white spaces) so it's useless as a portable dictionary. But say you want to sit down and do translation with it: the cheap and stiff binding forces you have to hold the book open with both hands...and then let it flop closed while you turn back to the book you were reading or the paper you were writing...then turn away from that and prize open the dictionary again... *OR* you can cut this Gordian knot by breaking the spine in as many places as possible and, in the time between this and when all the pages fall out, special order the Gyldendal or Hippocrene dictionaries.

Its story line, major underlying themes, and the illustrations are incredible. It is a modern day work of art.About the only thing good about the anime is that it has decent visuals. Other than that I just don't understand how someone can mess up something like Blade of the Immortal when everything (visuals, pacing, dialog, plot, ... ) is already handed to them on a silver platter from the books. The anime has a rushed, confusing story that will make most people (who haven't read the books) have a hard time understanding (or even wanting to understand) what is going on.Whoever directed or wrote the scripts for this crappy anime series just doesn't seem to understand that you can't fit a whole Blade of Immortal book inside 30 minutes.

I would caution though, that the print is rather small, and the footnotes are hard to read sometimes. The other feature I don't personally like is that the explanations for each book are altogether at the end of the Old Testament and at the end of the New Testament.

As always, the cast, including Helen Mirren, gives strong, believable performances; and the writing and dialogue are intelligent, realistic, and emotionally charged.Without giving away the plot, I'll say this much: this PRIME SUSPECT film is less about who did it than it is about HOW and WHY. This time, The Detective Superintendent and her team investigate a murder in the upper-class and they close in on an angry, evil woman who is desperate to keep her dirty secrets hidden. It's a suspenseful, thrilling story of evil, deceit, and familial dysfunction, well-written and convincingly acted. Don't miss it.On a side note, if Aaron Spelling ever wants another actress to play a villainess on any of his night-time soaps, then he must hire Jill Baker. Although she is not well-known, she is a formidable talent and she is ready for prime time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I threw my copy out.

This is not something I want to give my great-granddaughter, and I feel I have been lied to and conned.

And it's definitely durable because he runs into walls and furniture non-stop and the thing still works perfectly. The only thing that could possibly make it better is to have some lights/sounds.

DO NOT BUY THIS!!! its not meant to work as a walker... when the kid tries to stand up the toys falls over, the kid falls over, and he or she gets hurt. again - its very light weight and cheap... you are better off getting something heavy and durable... my son tries to stand up with this toy to practice and he falls over... the toy cant hold the childs weight... and my son is not over weight or fat... just a normal 11 month old baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sturdy","review":"This toy is NOT sturdy at all. If my child puts any weight on it while pulling up it flips. He has been pulling up and cruising around, even standing unaided a bit for a while. When he uses this it either tips and smacks into him... or starts rolling ahead of him to fast. If I wasn't always right there when we have it out he would probably fall on his face. The activities aren't that fabulous either. When he was a young baby I had it flat so he could play with it. He liked flipping the little flaps back and forth for a few minutes a few different occasions and that was about it. Overall, a waste of money.

He was around 10 months when we bought it. After about a month of using it while crawling on his knees and pushing it, he finally was stable enough on his feet, to stay standing/walking while pushing it. Now the moment we set him down on the floor, this is the toy he goes for. He will spend hours, going back and forth between practicing walking by himself and then pushing this while he walks. He loves to ram it into things, including the dog, but since its so lightweight, nobody gets hurt.This is definitely great for when your little one gets more stable on their feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth every penny!","review":"Bought this for my 10month old son.... he LOVES it.

You have to be with your child while they use this because it will just keep rolling, no way to brake the toy. The walker looks much more sturdy and well made on the box.

He focuses on the interesting events and conversations, so the book is far from being a boring diary.In addition to miracle healing, there are accounts of out of body experiences (\\"exomatosis\\"), exorcism, extra-sensory perception, memories of past lives, and turning a plant into copper (and sending the plant to a chemistry Professor, and getting an interesting reaction out of him). Markides witnesses only a little of it though, most of it being recounted by Daskalos (the healer) after the fact, but even that little is eye-opening stuff. Unlike Rudolf Steiner, Daskalos never says anything dumb or hopelessly unbelievable, which enhances the reader's interest in everything he says."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written and interesting","review":"This book deals with a lot of spiritual ideas that may be too far out there for most people.

And the \\"Magus of Strovolos\\", which is about \\"Stylianos Atteshlis\\", a Greek Cypriot healer who lived until the early 1990's, did what no single book has done that I've read so far. It tied everything together and proposed a truly complete view of things, from reincarnation and Karma, to healing, astral projection, to philosophy, to ethics necessary to move into the work. And, it was absolutely hilarious at times...But before you decide that \\"funny\\" isn't a good thing in a book that covers this topic, let me tell you that it's not funny through and through.

This movie didn't have that, but it had the best story in the trilogy. It had some genuinely-tearful sentimental moments and a very nice ending, all of which makes it highly recommended.The storyline is simple but well-told.

I wasn't too surprised that this was the last Hammer movie made. There have been better movies using the whole reincarnation mummy /egyptian thing but this one doesn't quite pull it off.There is a lot of style though, a nice musical score, and a beautiful lead by Valerie Leon, but style doesn't mean much without content. Like someone said in a previous review, there is no real terror and no physical threat.The director also died before the film was finished, so there were a few problems with the production of the film.It's an ok horror movie if you like movies with a lot of style, but if you're really looking to get scared and seeking a bit more from this genre, you might seek another title."},{"rating":"2","title":"EDucators should by this...","review":"if You are just starting your ED career you should buy this book!!!

I'm planning to buy a himidifier from another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment for Riftwar Fans","review":"While the other books in the Legends of the Riftwar Series are quite good, this one was very disappointing!!! I guess if you're into court politics and intrigue it may hold some merit, but talk about BORING for the Riftwar and Feist fan. Too many names, titles, etc made this very confusing to read. There was also, virtually no action! I've been reading Feist since the 70's and have anxiously awaited each and every book, but this one falls way short of expectations!!! Your $$$ is much better spent on Honoured Enemy or Jimmy the Hand in the Legends of the Riftwar Series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Poor Book!","review":"I have been re-reading some of the older Feist books in my library and decided to add the rest of his books. I have been reading them in series order according to the recommendation of Feist's site www.crydee.comAll I can say is that you will not miss anything by NOT reading this book.All I can figure is that Feist decided to get a piece of the action off what this guy Rosenberg wrote by adding his name since it takes places in Midkemia that he created. It was slow to the point of dragging so bad that I fell asleep! I had the murderer picked out chapters before the murder was commmitted. There was so much analyzing of what characters were thinking that you could skip ahead and not miss a beat. Of all the Feist books the only other ones that have given me so much plot struggle were the machinations of the Great Game on Kelewan, but at least in that series there were great plot twists and story lines to help hook you back in to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting side trip...","review":"Wasn't sure what to expect but this turned out to be a quick, fun book to read with a hint - unfortunately only a hint - of the original Feist books. If you are looking for a direct link to the Rift War story line, you won't find it here. If you are looking for a fun story set in the same frame then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice read but not Feist","review":"Not a bad story and adds to the world of Midkemia, but this is definitely not Feist. Ties into the legend by having guest appearance of Fantus, Kulgan's Firedrake. So, if you want a break from Feist, I'd recommend, but if you are expecting Feist, you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is a let down","review":"I have read nearly all of Feist's books and this series was the only one I had to really work at to try and get through. In the end I was very disappointed in this book. It was really really boring throughout and only got ok towards the end. Don't let this review stop you from reading his other work. I have really enjoyed most of his books up to this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I love Feist's books. I have read almost everyone so far. But this book was an extreme let down. There is almost no action, too many characters that you don't know anything about prior to this (and have no desire to learn more about), and doesn't get into the story until half way through the book. I haven't even finished reading it and don't think I will. If you enjoy Feist stories, do not stupe to the level required to enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious","review":"I must say that this book is a MAJOR disappointment. I've read every other book that Feist has written and this is by far the worst. First the murder doesn't happen until near the end of the book. Second, the majority of the novel deals with the weather conditions of LaMut when the blizzard hit. I know it was probably cold but do we really need endless pages describing people not wanting to go out in the cold and standing around giving everyone the \\"evil eye\\" . Speaking of standing around that's all about what everyone does, stand around and try to figure out who's friends and who the next big shot is going to be. Finally of the main three characters talk about stereotypes...let's see we have the smart one, the big one , and and average guy who tries to be nice. If you are a Feist fan and want to read it all, go ahead but be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but ...","review":"\\"Honoured Enemy\\" set the bar really high for this series.

This book will scare any parent out of even considering giving their children any vaccines, and isn't that just as bad as blindly agreeing without knowing more? In order to make an informed decision, whatever decision a parent makes, one needs to know both sides of the argument, not be frightened into making one choice or another.

The sad thing is that overprotective parents use books like this as a way of confirming their fears without looking at the facts.The charts that mention the deadliness of diseases have nothing to do with the number of people who are carrying the disease or the number of people who are damaged from having the disease.I could go into detail about it but I have to write a paper on this. Search for Steve Novella and James Randi, they are knowledgeable in this field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another anti-vaccine nonsense book","review":"One wonders why there seems to be an industry that picks on the single most effective public health measure in human history, vaccines. Vaccination ranks up there with good nutrition and flush toilets as the main reasons we are alive and healthy today. Mr. Miller plays with our collective amnesia for what it was actually like before widespread vaccination was adopted in the 20th Century. I guess it will actually take a series of epidemics before people realize that everyone should be vaccinated.This book is filled with pseudo-science, blatant falsehood, and limited understanding of what these diseases are actually like. It would be almost laughable it it wasn't so dangerous by discouraging people to vaccinate their children."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star, because I can't give it 0","review":"Congratulations, folks. Don't get your child vaccinated.

BLAME ONLY YOURSELF."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading for any prospective parent.","review":"In spite of being only a rather slim paperback , this little book contains enough clearly written and essentially accurate information to make it an excellent introduction to the problem facing young parents : do we vaccinate our children or not? Written in a very understandable manner and with very compelling evidence , I found myself wishing that this book had been available when my own children were young.This book quickly reviews many of the common childhood diseases , the complications possible , and then proceeds to discuss the effectivness of the vaccines and their associated risks. Evidence is presented that the vaccines , although highly touted for disease prevention , are mostly ineffective and risky. The only reason I rated this book 4 stars instead of five is the book is TOO concise and some of the subject matter requires additional treatment. The evidence presented , however ,is very compelling , and I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL information with REAL facts","review":"This is a great book and a MUST for every parent. This shows the truth that doctors don't want you to know, because then they wouldn't get those lovely bonuses from the makers of the vaccines. Of course this ISN'T a conspiracy theory book but actually scientific medical facts and references. This book is more double sided then any other vaccine book out there viewing information from both sides with points and counter-points on all that you've heard about. This book informs and educates, if you are a parent this is the book for you because it helps decipher all the information so you can weigh the pro's and con's. If you read any other book your still uneducated on the subject. Top of the line!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very poorly researched","review":"Don't be fooled- with lots of references and graphs it looks well-researched. It is not. I have checked references and they are cited incorrectly and do not back up the author's claims. Many are not current and the author cherry-picks the ones that appear to back up his point of view.

Mifune had been around years before, this was my first encounter with him. He plays a good counter personality to Charles Bronson. As I was saying, this is a pushy movie. Each character pushes the other to the brink. Gauche pushes Link who pushes Kuroda Jubie who pushes back and some where in there, among the Indians and others Cristina just gets pushed around.I always think of this movie when I am watching \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" (1941); The conversation between Sam Spade and Kasper Gutman where Sam insists that he can not be influence by the threat of death. If they killed him then they would not get the bird. Kasper says it takes a fine balance and not to push too hard, as there is no telling what a man may do in the heat of the moment and forget where his interests lie.Well this film has a lot of heated moments and a lot of funny moments when the different cultures clash.

It looks like quatlity from the outside and says it has been remastered and that format is letterbox. Not true. It is a poor transfer form a video and is cropped, not even close to letterbox and the sound is poorly mastered. Even the menu mispells words. Amazon has really confounded reviews that try to protect other buyers of DVDs and CDs by combining the reviews for all prints of movies and CDs. Good luck in sifting through the offerings now.

It is cheaply made and if you read the discriptions of the instrument on their website- notice how much they talk about how pretty the case is. All that glitters is not gold!!! This is just very shiny junk in a flashy case.No band directors recommend these instruments, and repair shops refuse to work on them because you'd have to replace all the keys to fix it..You get what you pay for... a beginner clarinet should be about $600... getting this for $200 will wind up costing you a total of $800 when you have to buy another one after it breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a well-built clarinet","review":"We bought this for my daughter for her first year band.

It had a distinctive aroma that i could smell for close to an hour (others I suspect longer) but I think it was cologne, rather than \\"after shave cologne\\". In any event, the aroma of this stuff is so weak to my olfactory apparatus that I asked my wife what she thought of it. Her reply was \\"barely detectable\\". I think I'll stick to Tiffany for Men, Paloma Picasso's Minotaur, and Caron's Pour Homme in the future. To me, this stuff is no better than water.

Without tools like bottle brushes it is impossible to get some areas cleaned of fat/meat residue. It's a Listeria time-bomb. The internal areas behind the blade have ridges, edges and corners that build up debris. The meat holder slide is a tube around a tube and cannot be cleaned. The last time I used it I spent a bit less than two hours cleaning it before reassembling it and putting it away (surfactant, quaternary ammonia, sodium hypochlorite). Before Christmas I got it out to conquer a salami but decided to unscrew the blade just to check. It went in the trash so someone at the recycle center wouldn't pull it out for Goodwill. The salami was sliced with a knife. I should have swabbed it first for plate counts, but didn't think of it at the time. Seriously, look at how easily the slicer can be cleaned before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF JUNK","review":"I have bought several brands of slices and this has to be the biggest piece of junk I ever used.

There is no finger protection on the top right end of the machine.Put those three elements together and you now have a recipe for slippery, bloody slicing experience.

Sure, go there as a tourist and you will be shown what remains of the Greek, Roman and Byzantine treasures. But you will not be able to see the traesures that were wasted over the centuries and the Byzantine mossaics that were covered up with stucco (wasted) in the great church of Haghia Sophia (Divine Wisdom)in Istanbul.

I like the combination of site description, anecdote, and history, but I often find the lyricizing a tad too much. Much of Turkey is pure poetry, and does not need a lyrical veil."},{"rating":"2","title":"not just another travel book","review":"This book was recommended by our tour company (not a Turkish one!) to read before visiting Istanbul and some of Turkey on the Aegean coast. Initially, it didn't really engage me, and I only read about half of it before I left on my trip. However, once I returned home, I picked it up again and found it much more interesting because I began to recognize some of the things and places the author wrote about. What amazed me during my trip was the realization that I knew next to nothing about Turkey, its history or its people. Some of this is reflected in the book, but in a very personal way. The author has a very keen eye for detail and a very expressive writing style that conveys more than just details. It's definitely not a travel book, but colored by the authors personal experiences which include living and traveling in Turkey for more than three years."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Spud you are looking for!","review":"Hasbro has done it yet again. After the success of the hard to find Darth Tater earlier this year, they have now given to us the equally elusive Spud Trooper. Made up to look like a Stormtrooper from the Original Star Wars Trilogy, this is an excellent addition to the Star Wars and Mr. Potato Head line. This looks great standing next to Darth Tater and as someone said previously, I am now in need of a second one to go on the other side of Darth Tater. I love how the weapon is a potato masher. This is a very clever toy and a great conversation piece. I am glad I got the one I did because these seem to have disappeared rather quickly. So if you have any interest in picking one of these up and see it in stock here or anywhere else buy it right away or you will be sorry. I have no doubt that this will be just as popular and hard to find as the Darth Tater figures were."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Aren't You a Little Short for a Stormtrooper?\\"","review":"Not *quite* as fun(ny) as Darth Tater and not nearly menacing enough to pull off the stormtrooper.

They'll work nicely together.Availability doesn't seem to be an issue....yet. Whereas just this week I got an email notice from Amazon that Darth Taters are now available (I asked for notification in April!), I received my Spudtrooper three days after ordering here. Either the thrill has gone or no one yet knows these are out on the market (I saw no signs of these in the brick and mortar in the past few weeks)."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun then adults should be allowed with vegetables....","review":"Got this as a fun birthday present for my husband who adores anything Star Wars.

This version also has the Spanish day of the week along with the English which i was not aware of and really dislike and wish I could have turned off or not had at all.Don't recommend purchasing this watch at all. I should have spent the extra cash and gotten a citizen Eco drive instead as I was searching for a watch that did not use batteries.

Much better than spreading with butter/margarine. Cooked garlic does not give you garlic breath! It took less than 30 minutes and I did not have to turn on the oven.

Over time it has lost suction and now barely has the suction to pick up anything. I despise the thing. I have cleaned all the filters, done research and dismantled it and cleaned out the inside and it still doesn't work well. I have read consumer complaints on the web and apparently this is a chronic problem with the Dysons. At first it works amazingly well but it soon loses its suction and becomes a worthless overpriced piece of junk.

Also the dogs hair would get swirled around the suction area of the cup and no way could you just push the button over a trash can for the dirt cup to empty. Everytime I emptied it I had to reach up into it and pull the dog hair wrapped around the cylinder. It was not as well made as I had expected either.

After about three hours of comparing the Dyson to the Kirby, the Kirby blew the Dyson out of the water. It was so frustrating to believe so much in a vacuum, only to have it thrown in my face. My husband was very unhappy that the promises I made didn't come through.I'm not here to sell you on a Kirby (which I did end up buying to replace my Dyson), but please compare before you buy.

I moved into a house in which the previous owner had cats and dogs. Since my allergies are very sensitive, I needed a vacuum that picked up all the hair. My home was two years old, and this vacuum is still picking up all the \\"new carpet fiber,\\" plus all the pet hair that the carpet cleaners left behind. It picks up everything!

It was apparent that the author has never seen German written, and evidently the publishing company did not see fit to hire an editor who had. At first I thought that she was trying to represent possible linguistic shifts in Texas German, but since one of the main characters was a student of German Language and Literature, it was not believable for her to be unable to spell in German, and this was not the only problem she displayed with the German language.I did love the character development, and I hope Powell continues to write; she is obviously quite talented.

I was excited that it had lesson plans in the back. (After viewing them, they were not too exciting though.) I read the ratings before purchasing it and it sounded like I found the perfect book. However, after receiving it, there was one review in particular that came to mind and I must agree with that person who stated that in a nutshell, the book was too technical and not user friendly. I was intending to use this book with my students in a HS observational drawing class. That isn't going to happen. The key with high school kids is to provide as much information as possible within a reasonable amount of text so that they may get to work. The longer the text portion of the projects, the faster you lose them. I am interested in suggestions for a HS level text on observational drawing if anyone has any. I am glad I bought this book used!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very clear perception","review":"I recently bought this book at a book store near me to try and teach myself how to draw. I must say I was very disapointed with the text. There is more content in this \\"drawing\\" book, it seems, concerning ancient histories and theories than about drawing. If I wanted a history lesson I would buy a book by a qualified historian! Do yourself a favor and buy another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great textbook.","review":"As a teacher of drawing, I have read many books on the subject. This book is the only one I would use as a textbook. I would agree with all the previous reviews but would only comment on the one review from the budding artist who felt the book is confusing and has too much art history for someone who only wants to learn to draw. I come to this book with over two decades of art experience so maybe that is why I find it so interesting, but even if the history is skipped and you read only the practical explanations and do the lessons in the back of the book, you will learn to draw from observation, as this book promises. The book is not meant to be read in two weeks. Learning to draw takes hard work and invested time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Drawing Basics Available","review":"As an art teacher at major universities, I have found that this book gives students the much needed principles that form the basis of an ability to draw from life. Many feel that drawing should be strictly intuitive and therefore no knowledge is needed. This is wrong. Without the ability to put what you see down on paper correctly, it is usually impossible to draw intuitively. This book gives students the needed basics to free up their imaginations to draw intuitively. I would recommend it to all beginning drawing classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally - an intelligent drawing textbook!","review":"I knew from the beginning pages of this text where Curtis emphasizes the importance of developing sensitivity to the quality of the mark on the page, that this book should be in the collection of all student and visual arts professionals.

It is packed full with instructive information and additional reference material that sets this book apart from any other drawing text that I have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large Durapet stainless dog food bowl","review":"Excellent product..I bought 2 of these bowls four years ago for my 80lb dog.

I found the concept intriguing--the story told from several different points of view--but the author, I think, is self-indulgent and makes too many demands on the readers with the rapid shifts in tone and its dense and muddled tone. And I did not come away from the book with a very good idea of any of the characters. I hardly ever do this, but I gave up on the book about three-quarters of the way through.

Start to scroll through the readers' reviews and you quickly see that each reader either loved it or hated it. My suggestion is borrow a copy or check it out from your local library and read the first four chapters. It should be apparent to you by then as to which camp you will belong.The author states that his purpose with this historical fiction was to fill in the gaps about the L&C; expedition and people involved; at this there is mostly failure. He succeeds in breathing some life into the characters, if previously they were two-dimensional history book names to you. But the more you know about these men and the expedition, the more you can make sense of the book; the reverse is not true.I read the book as quickly as I could just to finish it and get on with more enjoyable, worthwhile reading.

Such a wonderful premise--filling in the blanks of history with fictional, hopefully plausible, details. But to reduce Charbonneau to essentially nothing more than a sex-crazed, blathering idiot, Sacajawea to a mute, ineffectual slave and Lewis to a bipolar, social misfit narrows the scope of possibilities rather than increases them.Add that to a nearly impossible-to-read narrative with hackneyed writing, very little action with regard to the actual exploration, and voila!

This was confusing at best and often left me with no idea who or what he was talking about and how it all tied into the expedition. He may be an expert on all the various names which applied to each tribe. But most readers are not. It would have been helpful if he had used the commonly known tribal and individual names.In addition his use of profanity was unnecessary and got in the way of the story he was trying to tell.There are several really good books out there on the history and persons who made this journey. This one isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid commentary on the relationship between Lewis and Clark","review":"Hall had the opportunity to create a major work of the relationship between Lewis and Clark, had it not been for his over-use of 4-letter 20th-century vulgarities that had no bearing on the era.

It has the worst furniture varnish consist of thick uneven coat of poorly applied polyurethane. Finger board is painted black and it is not even straight. Chin rest and peg are made out of plastic, not ebony. There were no ebony parts. They are either painted black or plastic. The bridge is not even maple. It is cut poorly and won't fit correctly.

I guess I got what I paid for. My daughter did not like the sound and went back to old Suzuki violin until we bought a decent Eastman violin. Paid lot more, but sounds lot better too. Difficulty in buying violin over the internet is that you do not get to try it out. Since these are factory made from China, you will get lucky once in a while. My son also plays and he got lucky with CVN-400 3/4 size, which sounded wonderful. So, you might get lucky, but if you pay just a bit more, you can get a violin that will sound better.

I wonder why the movie never got any Oscars. In any case, none of Eastwood's other movies ever matched his performance in this one. Leone, an Italian, captured the wild nature of the late 19th centure better than any other American director ever did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome blu ray","review":"This is an amazing movie that is extremely clear and and fun to watch on blu ray. This is a must buy for blu ray aficionados. You can see Eli Wallach's excellent facial expressions even clearer than before. People have said that the picture is too soft, but from my own experience the picture is perfect from an average viewing distance. The image does seem a little soft if you sit inches away from the screen, but it is crystal clear otherwise. The sound is also very nice and makes good use of the 5.1 setup. Don't let the negative reviews sway you, this is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SUPERB CLASSIC","review":"I watched this again for the DVD commentary. Turns out that Clint and the director were at odds in several areas. Clint actually got some residuals from this movie. He didn't like that the explosives were real and was surprised no one got hurt. I didn't realize Eli Wallach was The Ugly (he was the old guy in THE HOLIDAY) and his army doctor background helped with the torture scene. MY GRADE: A minus to A."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spaghetti Western as Greek Tragedy","review":"Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly from 1966 is the final movie in The Man With No Name trilogy featuring Clint Eastwood. This spaghetti western filmed in Spain with mostly Italian actors is so spare that it is almost a silent film. In fact, it plays like a Greek tragedy. The 2005 special edition runs three hours. IMDb rates it as 9.0 and #4 of the 250 best movies of all time.It is easy to spot the flaws in the movie from the very beginning. The scenery and buildings do not look at all like the American West. Most of the actors' voices are dubbed. The highly praised soundtrack by Ennio Morricone is incredibly repetitive.This film is all skin and bones and no meat. The Greatest Western Of All Time has to be Judge Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid from 1969. It has great acting, humor, an excellent score and beautiful scenery. Hey, it even goes to Bolivia."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti western. This is the one everyone remembers. It's shot in Spain, where the terrain looks similar to the American west, but gives it its special feel. The cinematography is a beautiful job. Ennio Morricone's score takes on the aspects of another character in the film, and it has become synonymous with the american west. this is an all time classic. great film, i love the fact that there is no dialogue for the first 10 minutes of the film. really shows what movies are meant to be. the dvd also contains about 15 minutes of footage deleted from the u.s. version (it's in italian).this is just one of those movies everyone loves and everyone should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with Gift","review":"This item was a gift for my father. He was very pleased with the quick shipment and just loves the movie! Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, extras reviewed","review":"I'm sure people have spent much time reviewing how great this movie is, and it is. So I'll keep it very short, and just comment on a couple of extras. It was cool that the extra footge was added in, but having Eli and Clint do the lines so recently was very distracting and obvious (as in, you could tell they were very old). For integrity purposes, it was cool, but for movie consistency, I almost would have liked to have had an impersonation closer to the original younger voices. It would have made these added scenes seem less obvious as added/restored scenes. Secondly, I've heard some people complain about the commentary being dry and boring. Personally, I liked it. Either way, who cares, these are just the extras... the film itself is phenomenal. You don't have to like westerns... if you like Quentin Tarantino, you'll love this. Probably, you'll love it for what it is, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite ;)","review":"I love This Extended Version Collector's Set Thats why I bought 2 Copies heh,yeah You Should get it too,'tis a MASTERPIECE :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this substandard Blu-ray.","review":"A sharper, brighter, cleaner transfer with FAR more detail and more information on all sides of the frame has been released in Italy (without English options, I'm afraid). MGM is just trying to squeeze a few more bucks out of their (now) old SE DVD transfer, and it is likely that a SE Blu-ray will appear some time in the future, making this turkey obsolete.They have further mucked up this release with excessive Digital Noise Reduction, resulting in the loss of a considerable amount of picture detail.AVOID!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Of The Three!","review":"The best out of the \\"man with no name\\" trilogy, Clint gave his best performance up to the time.

Grade:B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best western movie ever!!!","review":"No kidding, this movie is the best western ever. Every other western movie should be compared against the good, the bad, and the ugly. The performances of the all three main actors are stunning. If you haven't seen this movie and claim you are a western fan, you should be ashamed. DVD version is also very satisfying and original scenes that were cut out of the Hollywood version are pretty interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my favorite western","review":"I love westerns, and I love none more than the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. This version is also the easiest to love. The remastered soundtrack and improved digital transfer make it a joy to watch in a modern living room. The added scenes are all worthwhile additions. There is even a bittersweet inclusion of an extended version of Tuco's beating on disc two that couldn't be restored to the same quality as the rest of the film. This is arguably Leone's masterpiece, and Eastwood's best western, at least until Unforgiven. If I had to search for one thing to complain about, it couldn't be the movie but the packaging. The box is a tad hard to open and could use a little thumb slot in the side to make it easier. If you have ever enjoyed any wild west movie you will no doubt love this one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a can't miss.","review":"The haunting music, the great one liners, the three way showdown at the end ...... this film has everything but the smell of the old west.Clint Eastwood will be remembered for a variety of roles but his performance as 'the blonde' or 'blondie' stands out. Certainly Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach never matched 'Angel Eyes' and 'Tuco' respectively.My favorite part of this movie occurs after the Union Prison scene, when Eastwood and Wallach re-unite to take out 'Angel Eyes' gang and resume their quest for the Confederate gold.Throughout the movie Tuco and the blonde alternate from trying to kill eachother to saving eachother's lives, according to what circumstances dictate.In the end their worldly priorities triumph over Angel Eyes and the civil war that is being fought all around them. A bizarre buddy movie if there ever was one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST WESTERN OF ALL TIME","review":"THE GOOD,THE BAD AND THE UGLY IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE GREATEST WESTERN OF ALL TIME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cowboy movie","review":"I only bought this movie because it is one the of the best Cowbowys movies ever. The first 15 minutes are just amazing, without any dialogue but only defiant looks. I would recommend it to old movies lovers and classic collectors. Take a careful look to the direction and the outstanding casting. And of course, the unmistakable music composed by Ennio Morricone, in my opinion one of the best music composers. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best western ever made?","review":"Forget about the over rated John Wayne, this is what the Western is all about...man's greedy nature unleased in a savage land! The italian actors are not always realistic,given the setting of the film, but the interplay between Eastwood and Wallach is astounding! Watching these two weather beaten character's leathery faces made me want to beg for a glass of cool water!The film has many comedic touches and has a feel of Odysseus wandering in America, with gold is the object of the qwest. Fantastic setting and music, with relevant commentary about life that resonates even today. It will send chills down your spine."},{"rating":"1","title":"at least check what what you are sellIing ! pay attention","review":"Amazon should make itself sure of what it offers. As French is my first language recently ordered A Carstreet Named Desire and lately The Good, the Bad and the Ugly because in the advertising and on each boxe I received it is writen that French is between the languages you can select - and it is why I ordered the dvds : for the first it is only English spoken - of course - on the dvd and for the other English or Italian in the second. Once is much twice too much. At least it is not fair, and I may say dishonest.Sure I can sent them back but you imagine the waste of time and the disappointment, especially as I am not not a current resident in the Sates.

From Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach's superb acting to the brilliant directing of Sergio Leone, the film is a masterpiece. The dvd allows the viewer to watch in awe of the amazing work done on this film. The composition of every shot is breathtaking and the plot is gripping. Plus, Clint Eastwood is the man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Words: Digital Noise Reduction","review":"Let me get this out of the way first, the movie is a 5 star film.Now that thats out of the way, let me continue on to this Bluray.For some reason, the studio has found it necessary to infuse this film with DNR. In fact after reading several reviews of the U.S. release, and seeing several screenshots of the U.S. release, I was floored by how awful this Bluray looks.The faces look as smoothed over as a wax figurine in many many scenes. In fact, if you've ever seen the Patton Bluray, this pretty much mimics it completely.If you have the 2 Disc Special Edition DVD, just pull it off the shelf and watch it again, but don't support the studio on this awful cartoonish release of such a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the most important Western ever made","review":"\\"You see, there are two kinds of people in this world. Those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You, dig!\\"I love the near ending of this film. Starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach.This final standoff is awesome. The music adds abrasiveness to the tension. This three hour movie requires a little patience. Something today's 'anxious immediate gratification hungry' audiences may not be able to embrace, but there is a lesson to be learned here about why some movies are legendary classics, where today \\"let's quickly get this over with\\" type films are forgotten nearly as quickly as its last day in the public theatre. Wouldn't you agree?This is one of those movies that made Clint Eastwood a legend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies of the saga","review":"This Clint Eastwood movie is my favorite of the 'saga' of spaghetti westerns starring Clint Eastwood. Everything from the engaging music, to the intense almost agonizing suspenseful long moments before a fight scene. The overacting of Eli to the sublime acting of Clint. Every element combined makes this movie one of a kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Good","review":"I had gotten this DVD version from the local library.

I ordered the Italian version, but it doesn't have any of these scenes. Does anyone know? I'm sure we would all enjoy the extra footage.Original review from November 1999***The DVD is great but does not feature all scenes which originally belong to the movie but were cut because of the film length. Missing are: The 'Tuco in a cave sequence' (where he hires the 3 banditos), a longer 'Tuco torturing scene', the 'Eastwood in bed with a mexican woman' sequence and a short scene which explains how Angel Eyes got the job in the prison camp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture Quality lacking due to Techniscope!!","review":"Well, The poor picture quality of this release can be that it was shot in Techniscope, which is a early version of Super-35 that uses a smaller amount of the full 35mm aperture for economy during shooting. You will notice that the first three of Leone's films will always be of slightly lower picture quality due to the fact they were all Techniscope releases. Now, Once a Upon A Time was shot in Panavision which is full 35 mm scope quality. It should look great on BLU-RAY. Don't always blame the studio, It can only look as good as the original negitive. Peckinpah."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","review":"Widely considered the best of Leone's western trilogy, \\"Good\\" has also been re-mastered to pristine glory, some footage re-inserted, and lines re-dubbed by Eastwood and Wallach. Yes, the film is long, but the three stars, Leone's magic camera, and that Morricone score will hold you hostage throughout. Wallach steals it as Tuco. A spaghetti western worth its weight in gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are two kinds of people in this world my friends...","review":"Those who love \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" with all their hearts and those who think less of it.Those who think less of it have their reasons and I'm sure they are good, but when push comes to shove this movie is exilirating escapist movie making at its peak. It does defy common sense at times but that's part of the charm. Leone is truly one of the most underated filmmakers of all time. Underappreciated I would say. But that's just me.I recommend you rent before you buy - you can't take chances with this movie because of its strange style, but I don't think you'll be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best western ever made","review":"What can I possibly say about this movie, that hasn't already been said?This is quite possibly one of the best westerns ever made, even if it's not entirely accurate. It's a great romp, and the movie sucks you in almost from the first scene.Typical Leone style, if you've never seen any other of Leone's work. Big, wide views, switching to intense closeups. Dialog never seems to be a real issue in any of Leone's movies, as the images can tell the story.Morricone's soundtrack is just as big. The famous musical catchphrase has long since turned into a cultural icon, and has been used in just about every possible genre you can imagine.You need to see this movie. You need to own it. And while you are adding this to your shopping cart, find the CD for the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware What is Missing!","review":"I was pretty surprised to find out there is no option to watch the original theatrical release! Shocking actually. To each his own and if you like the new scenes you will like this version but the added scenes do nothing for me and the voices are not the same (Lee Van Cleef's part is dubbed by somebody else). I would like to continue to watch the original. Also, the new soundtrack is noticeably different having been modified with new special effects to create the 5.1 Dolby. Again there is no option to play the original soundtrack! Just plain STUPID! I'll go back to watching my DVD! I consider this a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Western Ever Made","review":"Clint Eastwood is awesome in this movie. If you like movies that aren't associated with Disney, National Lampoon or Vincent Gallo, you should love this movie. The cinamatography is great, the acting is superb, and the climax and finale are perfect. The only complaint anyone should have about this movie is that it is a little long and does seem to drag its feet a little. Even if you don't like Eastwood, you really should check this out the pairing of him, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef make this one of the best movies in recent memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film and nice package but flawed by anti-theft tag!","review":"This has to be one of the classic \\"Spaghetti Westerns\\" and I chuckled to see that it's supposedly Quentin Tarantino's favorite film.It's really too bad, though, that M-G-M felt compelled to ruin an otherwise really nice package by placing one of those cursed anti-theft devices under the transparent disc tray, where it wrecks the cosmetics of the box and cannot be removed.

It's long, but it's fun or at least interesting all the way through. If you like trains, the sight of the European rolling stock done up to look American may strike you as kind of corny. But it sort of adds to the appeal and the sense of the overblown story.

Leone proves why he is a genius. Monumental epic centering around three men and their quest for gold should not be missed by any man. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach are all in top form as rivals for the gold. Morricone's score is just pure genius. Long, violent, and funny, this film revolutionized the Western as well as other genre's and is still being imitated today. The showdown in the cemetary is the greatest ever filmed. Don't miss this picture if you love \\" man against man \\" struggles."},{"rating":"1","title":"The appeal of this film is lost on me","review":"Especially in lieu of the many other Clint Eastwood/Sergio Leonne collaborations that far outdistance this predictable and utterly ridiculous story.Clint as always is great.

No plot, a pathetic hero, about a hundred fifty lucky and irrational escapes. A little fun, but mostly just aimless until the predictable ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Good?","review":"Sergio Leone plumbed his greatest depths of nitwittedness when he essayed the script for this travesty. Still, people are watching it 35 years later, so his financiers got something out of it. It would take the film's full running time to detail how bad it is but one scene captures some of the flavor. Prisoner Eli Wallach the Ugly is being transported to the gallows by Union troop train when he throws himself and his guard out the door of a crowded boxcar. Nobody says hey, train never stops, and neither does another express coming the other way when Wallach uses it to cut the cuffs between him and his dead captor, despite the fact that the deceased is laying in the middle of the tracks. Leone knew exactly nothing about the American West and neither do the people who enjoy his ludicrously mismanaged fantasies about the time and place."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Top 5 ever!!!","review":"This movie is simply amazing.

The sound and picture quality on the DVD are as fine as could possibly be expected from a 35 year-old movie. The extras are mildly entertaining, but the real cool thing is watching the film with the extra 20+ minutes of edited material re-inserted. In this case, editing was a GOOD move. The added footage does very little to expand the storyline and it's very obvious why the footage was deleted in the first place. For all you GBU trivia junkies: Check out the full text of the conversation between Blondie and the 'Half Soldier'. This is the only scene I found where the re-inserted material really adds to the movie. But let's be honest - the reason The Good, the Bad & the Ugly is so great is the fact that it's three pages of dialogue spaced over a three hour movie. Ya really don't NEED the chitchat to be blown away by the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best western, worse blu-ray.","review":"Unfortunately the best western ever is not the best blu-ray ever. The blu-ray version is the extended cut which is a huge downgrade from the original theatrical cut. The 17 or so minutes that are added to the 161 minute theatrical cut really ruin the pacing of the film. There is a reason they didn't make the theatrical cut. The blu-ray ONLY CONTAINS THE EXTENDED CUT while the dvd that comes with it has the theatrical cut. Why they couldn't have both on the blu-ray I don't understand but it is really to bad.I give the Theatrical cut 5 stars, the extended 4 stars, and the blu-ray 2 for being so stupid and not including both."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD still uncomplete","review":"The DVD is great but does not feature all scenes which originally belong to the movie but were cut because of the film length.

This is the reason I bought it, I wanted to hear it croak! I know it sounds stupid but I bought these to hand out at a Christmas party because I thought it would be fun but have decided that these would be dangerous and would hurt someone or something.

It was also very difficult to understand why I had controlling parents and why, even as an adult, I feel so hurt inside and still don't seem to know myself. This book taught me a lot and filled in a lot of empty gaps.It explains the various types of control parents have, reasons behind their control, how their control has such negative effects on you even as an adult (which includes examples of case studies about real people) and what you can do to help you to emotionally separate from parental control and why, and how to re-gain control of your own life.This book is easy to understand and very well written with both informative explanations and broken down summaries presented in tables.I highly recommend people to read this book, everyone will take something useful away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"After 35 years of being controlled in subtle and manipulative ways (but never verbally or physically abused), I finally broke free from my controlling parent.

My floor actually FEELS clean to walk on and there isn't a bunch of dust that has been kicked up into the air as a result of the vacuum blowing it around. The thing really does suck! It's incredible!

The noise level is far less than a traditional vac - you can actually talk over it without having to shout at the top of your lungs. If does an excellent job on hard surfaces as well. I purchased the refurb modeal for a total of 274.99 (price seems to fluctuate) and it was well worth it so far. You could tell that it had been used before, but only signs of slight use were present.

There is not much character development and thus it is difficult to feel for the main character and then be invested in the book. I did not even bother finishing the last fifteen pages I had left b/c I did not care for Arjie very much. Being as the book presents itself to be about a homosexual boy growing up in a society that sees him as bringing shame to his family name the book hardly deals with this issue.

Basically, the stories display that the characters have no free will because they can not get married with the different ethnicity person. Radha,a secondary character in the novel, a Tamil girl, has a strong desire to be in love with Anil, a Sinhalese boy, but they can not fly out of the rope of family tradition and ethnic struggle. At the end, her family is forced to immigrate to Canada to avoid the punishment of ethnicity difference.

No it doesn't get soapy, but many other acne cleansers don't get soapy either, so I don't see why that's an issue for some people.I'm 39 and have been dealing with acne since I was 13, I'm really tired of it. I've tried Proactive and most other otc products with little to no success in helping to clear my skin, which is also sensitive, so some products seem to cause more harm than good. I usually avoid using any kind of moisturizer on my face because they always make me break out. So, I'm giving this entire 3 piece system a try and I'm in the middle of a very bad acne breakout.

The cleanser and the toner were alright but the face cream was way, way too greasy for my skin! My face practically shimmered from all of the grease. Once I switched back to my Clinique oil free lotion I was much happier. Overall, I didn't really notice much of a difference after a few weeks of using just the cleanser and toner so I stopped using it. After doing some reasearch, I found that glycolic acid isn't really that effective against acne since it can't exfoliate inside the pores. Salycilic acid is what you need for that. I'm now using Paula's choice products and my acne is practically nonexistent. This might be useful if you have alot of sun damage (that's what glycolic acid is good for) and I would definitely only recommend the cream for very dry skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not the changes I was hoping for.","review":"I used the product trio (cleanser, toner and lotion) twice daily for a month.

My skin might have been a little smoother, but not so noticeable that I could tell for sure. The breakout issue might have been a little better, not a lot better. I could not tell any difference in the size of the pores as the other reviewers say they can. The one big difference I could really see was that this product really \\"bleached\\" my skin - not an effect I wanted to happen.Those of you who want to lighten your skin / fade your tan - go for it.

It is very strong and even if dropped, is unlikely to open. It has storage on 2 levels which is very handy for small items in the top compartment and larger fittings in the lower ( larger ) compartments. If you have a need for versatile storage of a dozen or more different types of small items, this works great. Incidentially, Amazon's price is almost 1/2 of what I have seen this unit selling for in hardware stores. I like the storage concept and it's durability. Buy One."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy plastic case","review":"I am a fan of Akro-Mils, however this case (Akro-Mils 6215) isn't quite like some of their clear cases. I much prefer the Akro-Mils #5805 and #5905.With that said, this case is a sturdy, larger case with a handle and strong latches. It comes with the same great removable dividers. The bottom of the case is \\"more curved/rounded\\", so it's not as good for flat/square items. I wish the height of the case was a little higher (maybe 3.5 inches). The current height includes the separate top compartment, which takes away from the size of the main compartment. This top compartment has a \\"dual lid\\" for tiny items seems, but it's too small to be useful.Overall, the Akro-Mils 6215 Organizer Case is a large, solid case. But try checking out the Akro-Mils 5805 (medium) or 5905 (large) Plastic Parts Storage Cases because they are sturdy and easy to store in a box or on a shelf. I have used these cases for everything from nails & screws to lego bricks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Beauty","review":"This is a lovely Christmas CD.

Simply great stuff from Hiatt. This record sounds like something that you'd hear some cover band play at some small roadside bar. The fact that it is Hiatt's 16th album and yet sounds as fresh as can be is what makes it such a great recording. Personal standout favorite track is \\"My Old Friend\\" which, while sounding like a straight-ahead rocker, has lyrics that only an aged-veteran like Hiatt can write and perform with true feeling behind it.

Changing the position horizontally ends up with a picture of your guest profile.There is no option to change the volume of the doorbell or to disable it.To make it worse, when you turn on the camera, it makes a sound on the outside unit, making sure the person know that you are looking at him...It is so bad that I've decided to put it aside until some other use arise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well over regular doorbell wires","review":"The product works well over the standard doorbell wires.

Not for the extra clumsy as I have drawn blood twice with very light pressure (once with the point and once with the edge).I think I payed around $10 and am almost thinking of grabbing a few more encase I forget to put this in my carry on when I go on my next airline flight. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lock Back Not.","review":"I always purchased Buck knives for their quality and safety.

It is a good quality knife. It takes and holds a razor edge very well. It is very light to carry but still has a good feel in the hand. Really, the only thing that I don't like about the knife is the \\"China\\" imprint on the blade. Buck is an american company and it bothers me to see iconic american companies move manufacturing overseas. Had it not been for this, I would have definately given the knife five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small and hard to hold","review":"The image of the knife looks very impressive but this knife is much smaller than it appears. The biggest complaint I had was the handle was made of hard plastic and I never felt like I had a solid grip on the thing.

Other than that the blade is quality and sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for day-to-day use","review":"Opens easy and is nice and sharp.

It is a great knife for the price. The locking blade is a must in my mind for someone his age. I was a little disappointed with the weight. It feels too light. The blade is fine, but the handle is very light and the knife does seem to feel very balanced in my hand. The handle is plenty sturdy and I don't expect any issues with the handle. I do like the groove for the forefinger. It makes the grip very secure and I expect it'll be difficult to accidentally mishandle the knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"small but works fine","review":"i like this knife the girlfriend keeps this on her. its not to small but does not have pocket/belt clip."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHARP LITTLE KNIFE","review":"I bought this knife looking to replace my beat down and well used EDC knife. My old knife was about 12 bucks at a flea market. It held an edge and i got old and suffered from hinge slop. I bought this knife not knowing what to expect. Well out of the box it is a razor. It shaved my arm hair clean. It is actually sharper than a set of ceramic kitchen knifes i just bought. It is made in USA with foreign and domestic parts. Some reviews said made in China, it is not. It is covered by Buck's \\"forever guarantee\\" So for 17 bucks you get a razor sharp knife, made in USA, with a life time warranty from a real manufacturer. Sounds like a great deal to me. The polymer frame is light, it has good traction on the fingers. Has molded in stippling like a Glock. Im very happy with my purchase. Might consider getting the large size next for my hunting knife. But the medium size is a great EDC. Only miss is the lack of a belt clip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs some improvement,","review":"I got this knife because of the look, it has nice lines and nice looking blade, but that is about all that it has got going for it. It does not stay sharp, it has play side to side, the handle wont take much abuse. This is a nice office knife good for opening letters, cutting some string, carving a desk. Its a good starter knife but its not a solid built. I have an older buck lite 442 and its way better than this knife.

One such example would be his questioning of the Book of Mormon containing the fullness of the gospel, notwithstanding it not containing all aspects of Mormon theology (e.g., apotheosis). Notwithstanding, such is a non sequitur. The Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and other scriptures define it as Christ coming into this world, his ministry, his atonement, and resurrection (e.g., 3 nephi 27:13-21). As the Book of Mormon contains the most lucid explanations of the atonement (see, especially 2 Nephi 2, 9; Mosiah 15; Alma 34, 42), it therefore clearly qualifies as containing the fullness of the gospel, the protestations of critics notwithstanding.In addition, many aspects of Latter-day Saint theology IS contained in the Book of Mormon, such as pre-moral existance (Alma 13) and theosis (AKA deificatoin, apothesosis, divinisaton) (see 3 Nephi 28).I welcome questions and feedback at [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the fodder","review":"Walter Martin undercuts his agenda greatly with this book.

Well I bought this awful cd on the strength of the favourable review. BIG mistake. The first Rhinocerous album was great, but oh how they lost it big time. Satin Chickens is the sound of a band in the studio with no idea what to do. Most songs start off with the drummer or guitarist tapping out a basic beat and the others joining in, sometimes you get a jam, others a mess. There is no structure, just messing around. Obviously the band was virtually done, they didnt want to be there and were just going through the motions. Better times is even worse. Awful funk type shout alongs desperately trying to raise some enthusiasm, but it is all in vain.These should have stayed in the vault, they really are as bad as you can imagine.

Their second alb (Satin Chickens) was a very weak rehash of their debut; their third alb (Better Times Are Coming) featured a stripped-down band with only a few of the original members left and bears almost no resemblence to the original group's music.

They offer a download option for some missing information, which is great, so we know it's possible. Why not offer up the missing (and there are many) topics. Topics like complex numbers, financial calculations, logs and natural logs.

The live concert is longer than I thought it would be. The sound quality is good. Matisyahu has incredible stage presence.

The old-style formal English in which he writes takes a bit getting used to but that is the only down side of this book. The author takes one verse per day from the Bible and writes about it. His commentary is very deep and very inspirational.I would not recommend this book for new Christians but rather for those who are well read and looking for something to really sink their teeth into. William Jay is not only inspirational but he drives home important messages from Scripture that the reader may have overlooked in the past.

Even though the knife is a US made knife the quality is way below that of the same model produce in the 1980s and 1990s. I have many knives and this rates as probably the poorest quality control I have seen in a knife allowed to leave the factory. I will continue purchasing knives through Amazon, but you can bet it will not be a Buck 300 series. Even the 500 series knives have gone down in quality.

It was the first of its kind, a full five-season story. It's not a monster-of-the-week show like we are used to. This show is intended to make the first season matter to what is happening in season five. And in Season Two, the show continues to build up towards one of the most satisfying climaxes in television history. There are a few episodes in here that feel slow, like many in the first season. But there are plenty to make up for the few slower ones. The Narn world is conquered by the Centari. The Shadows make more appearances. More and more gets built up.Buy this. You'll enjoy the resolution this season builds up when you get to Season Three. But Season Three will have no meaning or relevance without the first two seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great SF saga","review":"Babylon 5 is just outstanding: the story, the actors, the lines, I like everything about it. The only disappointment with the second season is the change in the leading role. As much as I like Bruce Boxleitner, Michael O'Hare is so much a better actor and you can realize it from the very beginning, in the opening narration, after the one read by O'Hare this one read by Boxleitner is a bad shock!Anyway B5 remains a great saga!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Season Two Review","review":"I gave this season a low rating, not because of the show, which I give 5 stars, but the fact that the last two disks would not play in my DVD player!

The new Captain works perfectly, a bit kirk, a bit of picard. The multiple WWII references, and the development of an overall story ark. I will say, this season started slow, but about half way through, the episode where the Narn war is declared, sold me on the show. I don't want to write too many spoilers (as I'm still just getting into the show too). I will say it was worth getting into. If you can get past the very lame first season, there is much greatness to be seen, especialy toward the end.

Season 1 was indeed merely a foundation but a necessary one, the main arc of which centered around the hole in Commander Sinclairs mind. With season 2 the story builds and moves, especially in the later half. This is the season that created the addicts who became evermore dependent with the even better seasons 3 and 4.Having viewed the entire series in it's entirety thrice I guarantee you that once you finish the series you can go back to the first season and go \\"ah\\" with appreciation and admiration for what it was and, surprisingly, what clever devices were placed there that you may not have realised. Of course that again leads to season 2 and the addictive cycle repeats itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Sci-Fi, So Much Better Than The First Season! Recommended","review":"Babylon 5 really hits it's stride in Season 2, with much better acting, great story lines, and seriously strong character development. The biggest improvement was in the casting change, replacing Commander Jeffery Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) with Captain John Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) in the first episode of this season.I really like the way the way the show runs sub-plots through multiple episodes and, like real life, events in past episodes effect events in future episodes. We also see the groundwork being laid for the upcoming Shadow War and for several side plot lines.The special effects are still somewhat weak, but considering that this show was made in the '90s, they are passable.Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by O'Hare's absense","review":"The first season of Babylon 5 (which I have only recently seen for the first time on DVD) was truly dramatic, and the possibilities for the future were exciting.Now the second season has come out. Amazingly, for someone with so much television experience, Bruce Boxleitner has no presense at all. Michael O'Hare, whom he replaced after season 1, was truly a \\"commanding\\" officer. Boxleitner simply yells all the time like a boy demanding to be listened to.I'm sure the show will still be dramatically satisfying as future season are released, but I am not interested in a show without Cmdr. Jeffrey Sinclair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure to buy the \\"repackage\\" version.","review":"The packaging on this version is terrible.

The performance to date is as advertised and impressive for a camera mounted flash unit. However, the mounting arrangement incorporates a metal spring loaded 'lock pin' which fits into a receptor hole in the camera hot-shoe. The metal pin is pushed into the flash base by a cam on the tightening ring acting on a very small diameter plastic pin. If this plastic plunger pin breaks off, and it did, the flash unit stays locked to the camera hot-shoe. A very flimsy arrangement that can cause a lot of grief, inconvenience and possible hot-shoe damage.

But I might have made a wrong decision anyway. This flash might produce beneficial results and be great in use (I haven't yet tested it or used it). BUT the quality of the build itself has a great flaw.When you insert batteries the battery compartment door won't close. When it's not closed the batteries are not fully pressed in there and, consequently, the flash won't start. You have to either always keep your fingers tightly pressing the door, or use lots of adhesive material to keep it shut, otherwise the flash is totally inoperable.What do I do now? Even if I send it back and they take it, by the moment anything is repaired or exchanged I might be out of country for good.

To call this argument preposterous is to be kind. Out of a white population of nine million the South lost a quarter of a million dead and many times that number in wounded. The South kept fighting until every Southern city was controlled by the Union. A small agrarian nation, the South fought a large, industrialized nascent world power. Unbelievably the South came close to winning this unequal contest. To contend that the South failed because of lack of will is ahistoric and a contemptible insult to the brave rebels who fell under the stars and bars.

Several times, and the hero talked to the heroine as if she was a loose woman, when she was obviously a gentlewoman.Here's a crazy idea-if you want your characters to act this way-set your book in modern times!To be fair-I have read another book by this author that I enjoyed-A Phantom Affair, but Daughter's Destiny is the second book by her that was not good, so I would definitely categorize her as a \\"hit or miss\\" author.not recommend-no stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent condition","review":"I received the item in excellent condition and sooner than expected.

You could completely feel the bond between Simon and Alys and the way they connect, even when they are fighting or refusing to touch each other. This was a wonderful fun romance, out of the ordinary. And you will find fun in the other scenarios going on around Alys and Simon, the people in the castle, her sister, thier loyalties.

I saw it on someone's recommended list and then I saw the high reviews it had on Amazon, so I looked forward to reading it. However, like another reviewer who couldn't get into it, I couldn't either. It started out well enough, but it never took off. I didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them. The plot got tedious. I was just bored. I literally had to force myself to keep reading and I was praying for the end of it.The premise is a good one, but it just wasn't properly executed. I love novels where the heroine is plain, but smart and fiesty and the hero is tortured and misunderstood. I love novels where people marry reluctantly but grow to love each other. This book had all that, but it just wasn't enough. For a romance novel, it wasn't very romantic and the love between the hero and heroine wasn't believable at all. Like I said, I really wanted to like this book, but I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light","review":"I bought this light about 2 years ago and I love it. It is great for lying in bed and reading. It doesn't disturb my husband at all. The only problem I have is that the clip is breaking at the point it connects to the battery compartment.

Most examples are not even about image processing. It is really a general, little-bit of everything software engineering book, including some distasteful engineer propaganda.So if you are looking about a book to help you design imaging systems, this book barely talk about it at all.

The book was very exciting to read, and I felt as if I was there with Barbara and Larry experiencing their highs and lows. These were real people living a real adventure. In this day of Hollywood personalities, TV lala-land, phony celebrities, flaky sporting events -- Barbara and Larry showed what common, unknown, down-to-earth REAL people can accomplish with average physical strengths, but a determination that celebrates the human spirit.

I made a lot of mental notes as a result of their lessons learned, and wish I had the courage to go where they have gone, now 20 years later.

And it made me cry nearly as often for her tragic death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must reading for any cyclist","review":"I've read other touring books and most of them put me to sleep. This one somehow became personal. I rooted and cheered for them each step of the way and really cared about them.

It's an easy read, and exceptionally inspirational as Barbara Savage recounts she and her husband's journey on bikes around the world in the late '70s.

Von Daniken was also in the video, giving his appologies. The video also shows an experiment where humans easily replicated a Nazca-like design in the same area without any tools.

Beautiful eroticism, though.","review":"Read it as you would an erotic novel. Not as a typical drama or the suspense thriller that Mishima was trying to make. The ending was not a surprise. The build-up to the suspense was not enough. It lacked on various situations in between. The psychological mumbo jumbo that's usually involved in this genre of literature was way too indirect. If you're going to commit the crime, put more thought and brawn into it. I guess Mishima may have done that to show how naive and arrogant the boys in the story really were. Still, it needed more substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing and a good work by ATB","review":"I love this song called the \\"fields of love\\" and the mixes in this CD are faboulous.

The 2nd and the 6th track are almost the same except that the 2nd one has the vocals and the 3rd one does not has the vocals and its like the first one but an extended mis of it. Then comes the 3rd track which is mixed by darude and it is a faboulos mix which has the sandstorm kinda beat at the end and is a real dance track. York(4th track) has also done a good job of it but the york dubb mix(5th track) is the better one of it and its really hard to explain how it goes but its not bad at all and is very nice. a MUST BUY for all ATB fans....like me but it goes to 4 starts cuz i think that there is somethin missing....i mean i wanted an ATB mix of the song then it would have been an awsome CD-single but i think all of you ATB fans should but it..........its awsome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for getting biology students excited","review":"I used this book, and the related IMAX video, as part of a cave biology experience for undergraduate biology majors this year. Both the book and the video are fantastic; I challenge anyone to consider biology boring after reading/viewing them. To prepare for a spring break \\"wild cave tour,\\" our students read Taylor's book, watched the video, then had a presentation on caving by Taylor. He also accompanied us on the caving trip. (It doesn't hurt that both of us teach at the same university....) The students loved it all. They asked for, and received, permission to sample for microbes in the cave, and have grown up their bugs. We don't expect to find anything earthshaking, as human contamination even in lightly used caves is apparently ubiquitous, but this really got students excited. I enthusiastically recommend the book and the video combined, and following it up even with a trip to a developed cave would be a great experience for students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but not brilliant.","review":"For what you get, this IS a good book. However, there are a few things about it that I think detract just enough to only give the book 4/5.1. The caves are all North American - no mention of the rest of the world. That said, the caves featured are abot the best in North America.2. The other articles on cave geology and biology are good, but there are better ones. If you really want to know more,Cave Geologyby Arthur Palmer andThe Biology of Caves and Other Subterranean Habitats (Biology of Habitats)by David Culver are the ones to get.So yes, this is a great \\"coffee table\\" book with some good generalist info. Though I think that the old Time Life bookUnderground Worlds (Planet Earth)is better all round, even if the photos aren't as good as this new one.Well worth having if you get a good deal on the price, bt it's not the absolute best general book on caves around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong smell!","review":"We had been using a lightly scented wipe solution when I decided to try this \\"potion\\".

Unfortunately, it seemed to disrupt my daughter's normal skin chemistry and within one day of using it her bum started to stink! After a few days I stopped using it and her bottom stopped stinking. I wonder if the strong \\"disinfectant\\" strength essential oils are a bit much for use on skin.

Unfortunately for the late Mr. Tucker, his account of Chickamauga is far from accurate. The western theater's largest battle was a very complicated affair but one would not get that from Tucker's account. From his flawed view of the fatal order to many outright mistakes in units and responsibilities of the commanders, this story just doesn't stand up to years of historical research, mainly out of Leavenworth, Kansas, that have shattered most of the myths perpetuated by this monograph. Skip the superficial rehashes of Woodworth and get Glenn Robertson's monograph. For a deeper analysis, get Cozzen's study that is quite massive or wait for a new book on Chickamauga by a noted Civil War author that is in the works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mythology and Mistakes abound","review":"Glenn Tucker's work may make a good story, but unfortunately it doesnt make for accurate history. Chickamauga: Bloody Battle in the West presents a very flawed history of events that occured in that Battle of Chickamauga, from Claiming a courier Missed seeing a whole Divison in the Woods to laying too much blame on Bragg for mistakes that were shared with other commanders.

These feel exactly like the ones from the 1960s but the pattern is much nicer. The blue and yellow looks much better then in the picture. I had originally purchased the Corelle Pro which is thicker and heavier. Very nice set but because the dinner plates are so large we decided to get a set with the smaller standard size plates. (The larger the plate the more food you put on the plate, the more food on the plate the more you eat and the more you eat the fatter you get.) So we opted for this Casa Flora and are very pleased. Even picked up two sets. Great for every day use. You'll probably want something better for when you have guests over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful set, but with some flaws","review":"I loved how this set looked online, and the price was irresistible. But when it actually arrived, it had some flaws. The colors weren't as vibrant as they look online, and there are places where you can see the yellow line wavering and bubbling up. And this was before washing. That said, it's lightweight, pretty much break-proof, dishwasher-safe and an excellent option if you have kids but don't want to give in to the tide of plastic dinnerware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dishes, cups a disappointment","review":"This Corelle set is lovely, almost Italian in style. It's also very inexpensive. The only thing that truly disappointed me upon opening the box was that the cups are stoneware, not traditional \\"Livingware.\\" As a result, I'm already short one cup, which shattered after hitting the floor.

However, I did read the comments from others BEFORE reading the book and while I agree with most, someone did write that the writing in this novel was not good. I disagree. Unfortunately, reading comments first, I was biased but then got upset by the incorrect comment from a reader who must not be poised enough to enjoy the writing stylings as well a the content. The content was also good but the ending left something to be desired. Overall, I would recommend this entertaining book for a quick read.

Steady behind the scenes support of the Roch Bros. and a batch of hard songs combine to make this a murderous disc. Highly recommended. Not for the timid."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last and the best","review":"Unfortunately this is the last album from the undisputed king of Worldbeat. Yes it is tragic when any great performer passes. Dan Del Santo left us with a great album. What is worldbeat? Well if you like reggae mix in jazz,soul,african rhythems, and more and you have worldbeat. Del Santos voice has got to be the deepest i've ever heard. And after seeing him a few times at local reggae clubs i was hooked. His music is about the downtroden,the hungry, and oppressed people around the world.

Even the sea was new. The book carves out details of shipbuilding and coastal navigation not often dealt with. Mariners will grasp the details more easily than the rest of us, but the details add a feeling of authenticity, a quintessence of coastal life. \\"As 'Polly' swung to face the wind, jib, staysail, and mainsail rippled, flapped and slatted according to their size.\\" The book is a remarkable chance to live for a little while in a world where there were different verbs for oscillations of the various sails. It would be a wonderful classroom introduction to the American Revolution or a fun read for history buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact, self-contained, user friendly","review":"This is my most-used item in my quick action toolbox.

The sizes and configurations are more than adequate for most small to medium jobs. Larger screws require more length and torque than this one can supply, but for larger jobs I get out the toolbox anyway.

This liquid golden-voiced Italian tenor from Tuscany, tells of his blindness & how music soothed him; of his struggles as a boy to live a normal life; his studies to become a lawyer & how he found his world-class voice.Andrea Bocelli is a refreshingly simple, humble fellow imbued with love, humor & a sense of the Grand Adventure.Andrea Bocelli wrote this memoir himself on a special Braille computer, without a ghostwriter & Stanislav Pugliese translated it into English.This is the angel who sang for Mayor Juiliani during a Memorial for those who perished in the September 11 attacks & I only wish there had been a CD of his favorite songs attached to this memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book","review":"The autobiography of Andrea Bocelli has everything. His joy as a youngster, ready to experience all, his sense of humor, his courage at the loss of his sight, his loyalty to friends, and his dedication to music. I have read this book four times and have enjoyed it each time.Some of his boyhood pranks will bring a smile. Not all of these pranks ended well. When he holds his first born son for the first time was a very tender moment which brought a tear or two to my eye.He is just what he seems to be, a humble man with a deep faith in God, and a great love for his family and friends. He has a remarkable talents in his voice as well as his writing. Hopefully, there will be more writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very wonderful book!","review":"I really enjoyed reading Andrea Bocelli's biography.I would highly recommend it to anyone, and would give it more stars if I could.

Each day they walk, to the factory about 2 miles away in the blistering heat to the freezing cold. Do they survive? Do they get reunited with their father? Read it and find out!Torn Thread was one of the best books I've ever read. I love books about World War 2 and knowing what went on with the Nazi's and Jews. I especially like them when they're true. This book is non-fiction, but it reads like a story. If you've ever read Anne Frank, you'll enjoy this book too. I would highly recommend this book to all who enjoy learning about what went on in World War 2, or a good non-ficiton book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent book","review":"Eva and Rachel both live in a ghetto in Bedzin, Poland during WWII. One day, Rachel goes outside. Eva sees her getting snatched by German soldiers along with other Jews. Papa finds out she was taken to a labor camp in Parschnitz, Czechoslovakia. For Eva's safety, he sends Eva there too. At the camp, Rachel and Eva reunite. They have to work for most of the day and barely get fed. The camp is overflowing with people. Because of this, diseases like typhus and influenza spread quickly. Rachel and Eva both have to be extremely careful of what they do. Not only could they get a disease, but they could seriously hurt themselves with the machinery that they have to work with everyday.I didn't give this book 5 stars because we never really learned much about the characters such as what they liked.

The binding disintegrates quickly, which makes it hard to use for learning-on-the-go. The book appears to be an abridged version of a longer text - and thus many of the practice questions and answers are out of sync and/or missing, due to sloppy cut-and-paste work. Even worse, there are outright mistakes in the text - for example, on p. 72, \\"arimasu\\" is asserted to be the verb for \\"wash\\" in a practice sentence (it's actually \\"araimasu\\"; \\"arimasu\\" is a different verb which doesn't even make sense in context). Berlitz's lack of quality control is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discover country music as you've never heard it before","review":"What a great album this is. A lovely languid piece that sounds like Kurt Wagner got happy. Gentle electronics mingle with soft but piercing guitar movements, an appropriate phrase especially for the beautiful track 5 \\"Movements\\". Lyrically and conceptually the album is lush, great outdoorsish but brought back indoors by the professional marksmanship of the guitar and keyboards sounds. The 80's style vocal delivery, almost English, think, Echo & the Bunnymen incorporates, Black humour and whimsey in equal measure. Then suddenly up a gear with a hint of B52 guitar work. If you like the strange orchestoral country sounds of Lambchop or your country laced with strange, then check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I watched this movie because Hoyt Axton was in it, listed third in the beginning credits. He was on-screen for about 60 seconds and never performed, which was an unforgiveable lapse on the part of the movie makers - he was far superior to any of the performers in the film. As a movie, it lagged, contained shallow dialog, and had a weak and predictable plot. Some of the songs were good, but overall it was an extremely disappointing film."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect hot sauce","review":"I use this on everything from tacos to enchiladas and its got the perfect taste spice wise and has garlic in there for added flavor.

Plus it comes in a fun squeeze bottle!Its medium heat, slightly less hot than the original Tobasco Sauce. There is a strong garlic flavor and a little sweetness. Its called an Asian sauce and is wildly popular in the American-Asian community but it truly can go on anything. Its strong flavor and heat tends to overcome other flavors in food but sometimes that is exactly what you want. College students love it to pep up the food they eat. This brand contains preservatives so it doesnt need to be refrigerated. If you like some heat in your food but am tired of Tobasco Sauce give this a try.

Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches. Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I do not consider to be a favorite. Even though it is not terrible--I used two bottles of it--it is not something that I would use on a regular basis. As for the sauce's flavor, it is distinctive yet peculiar. It has a nice heat to it, also--not too mild and not too hot. I have used it on multiple kinds of food.

There are sentences that are in past tense and present tense and first and third person in the same sentence. Every sentence ends in an explanation point! The few scenes of action are completely unbelievable and far fetched. The subject matter is what drew me to the book, and I read the whole thing because I am interested in it, but, and I feel I must say this, it is one of the worst written books I have ever read (in its entirety).

He is, after all, a lawyer .... clearly, legal writing is not his strong suit. The book is riddled with puntuation errors and incorrect capitalization.Secondly, the author could not decide whether to write an autobiography or a piece of fiction and finally produced a hybrid. The result is disapppointing and leaves the reader, familiar with the country and history, with more questions than answers.In some cases it is far-fetched. I cannot believe that Rhodesia's prosecutors ever took part in clandestine operations. I was there and, from my experience, they rarely left the cities.All in all, disappointing and I was left with a feeling of disatisfaction with the whole book.

Whitacre's \\"October,\\" which normally leaves one's spine tingling with bitter-sweet emotion, is presented by the RCC group as a flat-lined, ill-paced story that sadly misses the point of being melancholy in the October of one's life.This very young two-year community college group is simply not up to snuff with such ensembles as Eastman, University of Northern Texas, or the New England Conservatory, to name a few.

The plot is far from original (see Dale Brown), the characters little more than sand-up cutouts (see Al Gore), and based on his descriptions I have to wonder if the only thing he flew was desks. His \\"hero\\" makes the near instantaneous jump from fighter jets to B-1 bombers without even blinking.This is really a shame since the basis was there for a good story about a location and problem that seems rarely touched (see also Larry Bond's Cauldron). I was really looking forward to this - but in the end it was one big mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the war?","review":"This book had an interesting plot....but it was plagued by many grammatical and spelling errors. There were also other types of errors, such as saying that the U.S. has Typhoon-class subs, which are actually Russian SSBNs. Or the mispelling of 'Kadena' Air Base as 'Kadina' Air Base (I lived on Kadena). Another big thing....what happened to the war between Russia and Ukraine? Did it end after 'certain events at the end of the book' (don't want to give it away to those who haven't read it) or is it still going on? The B-1B is certainly a very capable weapons platform, but I believe you slightly over exaggerated it's capabilities, by stressing again and again how great the Bone is. But I guess that's because you're a Bone jock, ha ha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough whomp...","review":"I personally dont think this book is worth the money spent on it. While the premise and general idea was good, the Stewart failed to develop the storyline to its true potential. It could have been SO MUCH MORE!Characters were not well fleshed out, and ended up as mere skeletons. While Stewart does make an attempt to give his lead character Richard Ammon a personality and to try and make the reader feel for him, somehow he falls short. The result is a rather loosely pieced together character ensemble.Plot-wise, the book went rather slowly in my opinion. Again, Stewart does try to give us different angles from different POV's but to no avail.If you HAVE to read this book, get it from the library. Spend you money on something else, like Ken Follett's \\"Jackdaws\\" for example."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book","review":"Not bad for an authors first novel.

It is a great book if you know/care nothing about the military, it's assets, reading excitement, or intrigue. I was a B-1 Aircraft Commander and was looking forward to some interesting reading. Unfortunately, like a poor video-rental selection, I kept trying to trudge through the boredom, hoping it'd get better. The dog-eared 70-ish page is when I gave the hardcopy away...along with the warning about why I gave it away. Nothing like Flight of the Intruder, this book is not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed, a great story and an awesome ending!","review":"I loved the book and couldn't put it down! Great job by Stewart. As a current Air Force Instructor Pilot with over 2,500 hours I can see the vivid realism and exciting details in the storyline (except for the F-16 intercept - but hey, there has to be a little bit of fantasy in everything). The other two books were awesome too (Kill Box and Third Consequence). I hope there are more to come. To the other reviewers of this book, you obviously haven't spent any time in a military jet and don't know what you are talking about. As for his writing style, it was perfectly in harmony with how pilots work, think and FLY!

Harding by John Plunket or Confederacy of Dunces by Robert Kennedy Toole. But I liked the cover blurbs, and the real Boonville casts a bizarre shadow, even for Northern California. Some parts of the story did keep their promise. A baseball game with in-fielders who could have wandered into the plot from a Bruce Willis movie. A Florida live-in girlfriend who takes up with a neighbor practically before our antihero can find a California pay phone. But most parts are forced. Our hero has ingested too much. The satirical targets don't matter, and the plot past the midpoint becomes a swim in molasses even after Anderson introduces a free sex commune. My advice: Re-read Plunket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great book","review":"This book is not very well written. It feels like it should either be a longer book or a collection of short stories.

What it all boils down to is contempt for hippies, rednecks, feminists, the obese, and whoever else doesn't meet with the author's approval.

As the father of an autistic child, I was brought to quiet tears many times.

I certainly did. Yet even if Irving Stone did take a bit of artistic license when filling in the blanks of Michelangelo's life, he did it very well indeed. This story works well as both biography and fiction.As an artist and sculptor, I felt a deep empathy with the tale of The Florentine Master. Though my talents are puny compared to the furious grandeur of his David or the sublime tranquility of the Pieta, I felt a kinship with Michelangelo. Irving Stone's book speaks to the artist in us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better The Second Time Around","review":"I read this book in the spring of 1961 when I was ready to turn 15. I enjoyed it then for the sense of light and joy it gave me, and I get the same feeling now, only better, from the vantage point of someone who's lived an interesting life. I'm of Italian descent on my father's side, so the frequent use of the Italian language in names and phrases entertains me. Stone makes me feel like I'm on an actual trip to Italy during the Renaissance, seeing the creation of the grand works of art tourists now visit hurriedly on their \\"whirlwind tours\\". This book gives one more than just a fast run-through -- it sinks in to your psyche, as it did mine almost 50 years ago.

Michelangelo was constantly under pressure to comply with the whims of others, Medici or Pope, and even the works he had no interest in, his creative ability shone through. His fear of being caught in his forbidden studies of cadavers, suffering through those terrible winter months, dealing with the arbitray whims of his patrons, his genius shone through despite himself. This book was a page turner, which is not what one often finds in a biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and Weap...literally","review":"I purchased this book at a used book store in Florence, and found it to be the highlight of my 3 month stay in this city. The Renaissance up to that time always seemed so remote, but Stone builds such a convincing sense of time and place with this book, that the legendary artistic genius of Michaelangelo finally becomes real. The book actually brought me to tears as Stone portrays the loneliness of the obsessed artist.The Agony and the Ectasy is one of those books that is difficult to put down...reminds me of the narrative writing style of Aynn Rand in the Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged. This is one of the few historic novels that I would read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent,Superb,Great","review":"The book is so beautifully written that it will make you read it again and again.It takes you back to the renaissance.It talks about Michelangelo's agonies & ecstasies.His troubled times with the popes.His life under the patronage of Lorenzo de Medici.The troubles he had making his masterpieces,such as,the Sistine ceiling,David,the dome of St.Peters.It also talks about his life love,the plagues,the wars,the arts and the artists of his time.Over all this book Fanstastic & out of this world.After reading this you would want to read Stone's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Of course not everything is this book is going to be completely true as it is a biographical novel.

Irving Stone is one of our best contemporary writers, in my opinion. His Lust for Life, another great artistic biography. Just so much timeless humanity on every page. I'm in awe of his research and distillation abilities. He brings history - and art and culture and politics and philosophy - TO LIFE! This should be required reading in schools.

When -after three years!- she really wanted it back, I could not help but buying it. You can read it over and over again, also as a text book of Italian Art, with an encyclopaedia at hand.

This book has been on my \\"Must Read\\" list for years, and, prompted by a trip to Italy, I finally read it. It's such an incredible story! What an amazing life this talented artist lived! While I realize that the conversations and inner thoughts of Michelangelo are ficionalized, I know that Stone did so many painstaking years of research that essentially the story is true, and this allows the spirit of the artist to come alive.I wish I had read the book before my trip to Italy, so as to gain some history of the time period and personal inspiration of Michelangelo before seeing his magnificent works of art. That being said, I am so glad at having read the book during and after my trip, because it allowed me to reflect and ponder and \\"live in Michelangelo's head\\" for a while!!I will definitely read it again before I go to Italy in the future.

I don't want to bash this book because I am sure that if i was older and more mature or was planning a trip to Italy i would enjoy this book much more than i have. However I am writing this review in protest to schools forcing us to read this kind of book. It really is sad that a book with as much historical value as this is being given a bad rap because people like me are being forced to read it. I'm sorry to Irving Stone becuase I believe his book should only be read by those who want to read it and will enjoy it. To me, this book was a pure agony and not much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST","review":"I personally like historical fiction, but this was horrible, I have to agree with the pensacolians above that the names were amazingly hard to learn because they all started with M or G and each person had multiple names!

Let me stress again it is BORING!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating study of obsession and desire","review":"This book about Michaelangelo is in reality a study of what drives a great artist - obsession, desire, hunger, and in his case, family loyalty. It is a magnificent book, a true achievement, but I would caution anyone who reads it to have a glossy book of the actual works on hand for reference. Nothing more frustrating than not knowing what they all look like! At the end of the novel Michaelangelo, David, the Pieta and the Sistine are like friends, and you will be all the richer for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art History and story","review":"Be sure to read this if you missed it.

Gripping and revealing storyline, and the best part is that it's true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read if going to Italy.","review":"I read this book many years ago before travelling to Europe. What a great idea that was! As I walked the streets of Florence and passed through the doors of the Duomo I could almost hear the voices and footsteps of Michaelangelo and his peers. This is a book rich in Italian history & is presented in a storyline that is both entertaining and enthralling! A must read for anyone travelling to Florence & Rome. It brings the Italian streets, its art and history to life. Or if you just appreciate the mastery and beauty of the works of art created by Michaelangelo and other contemporaries of his day this is a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Passionate but Meandering","review":"This book was awesome, don't get me wrong, but the only things keeping me from absolutely loving it were the parts where Stone strayed from the most interesting areas (to me). The most interesting areas of this book were the inner workings of Michelangelo himself, the artist and the spurned son and lover and citizen of the magnificent Florence. I wish it had more of what went on inside his head instead of just colorful accounts of the wars of the Renaissance. I loved looking into his mind and his obsession with art.Being an aspiring art history buff, I was taking a sculpture class while reading this book, which is both a curse and a blessing, wanting to love it as much as he did but finding it difficult as a beginner.Another side I enjoyed was the love affair he had with the Medici family, most importantly Lorenzo and Contessina. Heartbreaking to say the least!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is an incredible book. I enjoyed every page of it. I visited Italy last summer and plan to return in 2001 armed with new insight into the mind of one of the greatest artists in history. I only wish I had read this before my last trip. Don't watch the film that was made in the 60's. It doesn't do the book justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Italian Guide Book!","review":"We read \\"The Agony and the Ecstasy\\" on a trip through Italy following someone else's recommendation and found it to be the best guide book we could have picked up, especially as artists! We felt as though we were following in the footsteps of Michelangelo from Florence through Tuscany, Rome, Venice, and on, amazed at the vast body of his awe-inspiring work spread all over the country, hidden in small nooks and crannies everywhere. What an incredible history lesson! A must read for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a life .... his art work is for the world to enjoy!!!","review":"I enjoyed this book on Michelangelo. He was very interesting. My only regret was not reading it before I went to Italy in November of 2001. Some things I did not like were, it was hard trying to remember what year you were in, I kept having to turn back to figure out the year. It got a bit wordy and at times it seemed like all his friends and associates had the same names -- I would never figure out who was who accept for Granacci.Michel...'s father was very annoying to me, for someone who was so against his son being a sculpture, he sure got after him for ducats and gold florins. I would recommend this book especially if you are going to Italy. I did feel like I could transport back in time because of my trip there and also because some of the same areas that are mentioned are still there in Florence.Even though the paperback version was almost 800 pages, a lot for a paperback, it held my interest to the very end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sissy Survives!!!","review":"keep me confused with all the plot meanderings and maybe I will think this is a phenom action/adventure genre... nice try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT FOR SENIOR GROUPS (SMALL CAST MALE/FEMALE)","review":"ENTERTAINING, SIMPLE SETS, COMEDIC AND SERIOUS TOPICS.

Some of the other reviews said this item is listed wrong, but that was not the case for me. I recieved the camoflauge 390cm with drop point blade just like in the listing. This knife is razor sharp right out of the box; it is the perfect size for me(though the handle could just be a smidge bigger for my large hands). It may be listed a little generously a 7 3/4\\" because it is a bit smaller than i had envisioned. If you have larger hands you may opt for the 392 model which is slightly larger, but for most this knife will work for about any use you can throw at it. It would be hard to find a better knife for under $30, and buck knives are guaranteed for life unlike most other manufacturers.

It's a typical political/military thriller that requires a reasonable amount of latitude regarding believability, but his characterizations of Scot and Meg are enjoyable. There is nothing earth shatteringly creative here, but I did find myself engaged in the pursuit of the 'steel-eyed' assassin. I'm a fan of this genre, and I enjoyed this book. It's not Tolstoy, but if I wanted War and Peace, I'd read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brad Thor surpasses Clancy with this one IMHO","review":"Brad Thor and his character Scott Harvath caught my attention a couple of years ago, and I have been working my way through the entire series. Path Of The Assassin is, in my opinion, the best yet. Harvath, former Naval SEAL and Secret Service agent, is pretty much on his own this time as he chases down a terrorist leader through North Africa, Europe and the United States. Author Dan Brown likes Thor's writing; so do Nelson DeMille, Vince Flynn, Newt Gingrich and Glenn Beck. He's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun ride","review":"Path of the Assassin is the first book by Brad Thor that I read. It's fiction, so just like Hollywood, there are a lot of improbable scenarios and circumstances that occur in the book. But hey, I accept that, cuz it's fiction. This book is one fun ride that kept me tossed and turned around curves. I enjoyed it thoroughly and finished it in a couple of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought we have come to expect more","review":"If you like, the Bruce Willis type movie with preposterous and over the top events then you will like the book. If you prefer the more serious type thriller then you will be disappointed. I was disappointed.It should not be too much to ask for an author to do a little research to get some basic facts right. Like how the Secret Service really works. If he purposely writes incorrect facts then he must be writing for teenagers. Either way the book was not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book lots of action","review":"The book is a classic thriller. It's well written and researched. That being said it does get somewhat predictable. Good guys always win and get the girl.

Fast paced and a well laid out story. Love Horvath sarcasm and general attitude"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller","review":"GREAT YARN. FAST PACED THRILLER WITH A GOOD PLOT. Lead character is appealing and so is the female lead. Thor is a great author of action novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five hours of my life I can never get back.","review":"First let me say that I did not pay for this book. I had an advance readers copy so I cannot be angry about spending money for this book. This book was horrible. I found the characters, the situations and the dialogue to be unbelievable. If these people were in charge of the war on terrorism then we all better reserve a copy of the Koran and get ready to praise Allah. There were times when I actually laughed out loud and then had to reread passages to be certain about what I had read. Unfortunately my reread was no better. I actually took to highlighting passages so that I could laugh at them sometime in the future. This was a \\"James Bond\\" character with no style. Austin Powers and Dr. Evil would have been welcome additions to the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal Sophomore Effort for Mr. Thor","review":"While Brad Thor's first book, the Lions of Lucrene was a fun intro into Scot Harvath's life (ex-Navy SEAL/Secret Service agent), the Path of the Assassin is a much more sophisticated and intense read.Scot Harvath is back to get the terrorists who killed members of a SEAL team that were killed in trying to get back the president from the first book. In the process however, he essentially uncovers a plot to ignite a very real war in the Middle East.This book is superior to its predecessor in every way imaginable. From readability, to pacing, to seriousness, to gunplay, to complexity, to sheer excitement, this book is really a wonderful step forward for Brad Thor.Midway through the book I came back onto Amazon to purchase the third book in the series and I cannot wait! From what I understand, Brad Thor's Scot Harvath series is similar to the TV show 24 in that it simply gets better as it goes...He's sure hoping!This book is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Path of the Assassin","review":"I do not wish to write a review is like an opinion and everyone has one.

The main character Scott Harvath is so arrogant, over the top and annoying by mid way through the book I was hoping he'd get killed!!! To me this book is like reading a LONG comic book or watching a cartoon. I couldn't recommend it to anyone, read a Dan Silva, Alex Bereson, John Grisham, or Harlan Coben; those are enjoyable talented writers. Brad here just got drunk and started typing!!

CIA and FBI characters acted like twelve year old boys in summer camp. Stealing air conditioners and short-sheeting each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the Genre","review":"As a reader, I have grown up on the \\"military techno-thriller\\" genre for over 20 years, and enjoy most of the writers. This novel, however, proves to be a disappointment. Very predictable, very comic book, and not the grit that makes the genre readable. It was almost written like a Mack Bolan shoot 'em up, with less emphasis on the technology. I finished the novel, and was a little surprised by the ending. For all the build up, it ended with little suspense. Thor's first novel in the series, \\"Lions of Lucerne\\" was better written and had a better plot, but I will not read any more in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick easy and fun read","review":"Scot Harvath, ex-navy SEAL and current Secret Service agent, is seeking the head of a terrorist organization, the one responsible for the kidnapping of the President in the last book. He finds himself up against Hashim Nidal, son of the dead terrorist Abu Nidal. The son, apparently a highly skilled operative and assassin, is involved in a plot to threaten both Israel and the US. It is up to Scot to follow, capture and kill this terrorist before he can bring his plan into reality. The chase takes him all over the world.Brad Thor in his second endeavor shows he has what it takes to write the penultimate international thriller. The military trained larger than life hero, a love interest, the history of the free world at stake, exotic settings well described, and the latest military gadgets. It is all great fun. This is a quick easy read and one that doesn't require too many brain cells. It is perfect for the upcoming summer months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither credible nor interesting","review":"I chose this book, based on a friend's recommendation, as a follow-on to Vince Flynn's series; but I found it to be a much less credible plot and the writing much less interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric at best.","review":"Scot's attempts at humor were so painful and the plot was so plain and predictable that I had to grab my copy of the Lions of Lucerne to make sure Thor really wrote that.He must have been under-pressure to write his second book. The problem with that is, readers like me will absolutely not invest future money/time the next time he and his publishers have a new release. I somewhat felt embarrassed reading this book.I will read the 3rd Thor book (I bought it at the same time I bought his 2nd book.. right after reading his 1st book) and I hope the author returns to form (I highly doubt it.)This book makes the (early) Vince Flynn books seem like bonafide classics... not an easy thing to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have paid attention to the 1 star reviews","review":"thankfully, I got the book cheap because otherwise I would be furious. I'm already upset that I wasted some of my life trying to read this book. Finally, after 200 pages, I had to stop. The dialogue is juvenile.Harvath is the only one who can do things correctly; he's the only one among trained agents who can think; he's the only one who can shoot straight (oh, except for the convenient beautiful woman who just happens to take on armed terrorists). Please, don't make the mistake I made: pay attention to those 1 star reviews. Save your money for something that is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"I can't believe this book made it out of a publishing house. I was in dire need of a quick airplane read, but this is truly disappointing nonsense. Full of cliche statements--\\"mark my words\\", \\"That's all well and good\\", \\"She was thrown in at the deep end and proved she could swim\\".There are only two women in the book and both are \\"the most beautiful women he had ever seen\\". Thor egomanially has his own website. If you find your way to it make sure to check out Thor photographed with his toy guns and a cool helicopter. Ego far exceeds talent with this terrible read..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame writing, totally ripping off Vince Flynn","review":"The writing is absolutely terrible. The dialogue is fit for a children's novel. I found myself almost ashamed to be reading something so juvenile. However, the story was pretty good and that is the ONLY thing that kept me going. My biggest disapointment is that his characters are a complete copy of the Vince Flynn characters. Scot Harvath is a very annoying and juvenile version of Flynn's Mitch Rapp character. So much so that even his love interest is a physically violated, daughter of an ex-cop, beautiful woman from Chicago. Come on! This is a total rip off on Ana Riley in the Flynn novels.Even the character's professional progression follows the Flynn story line. The main difference, of course, is that Vince Flynn can actually write believeable, semi-mature dialogue. If you want a thriller of this genre then get a Vince Flynn novel. Only pick one of Thor's books if you are REALLY bored and have LOTS of discretionary time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slight Misfire","review":"My favorite scene in all the Harvath books is in \\"Path of the Assassin.\\" It involves a beautifully written chase through Chicago that was one of the most exciting things in the series. Like \\"Lions of Lucerne,\\" I felt let down by the ending as the way the identity of the assassin was discovered came across as downright ludicrous. It is still written in the breakneck style that is Thor's trademark and if there's only one book that isn't excellent, that's still a good record."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb Second Effort","review":"The second book in the Scot Harvath series was no letdown after \\"The Lions of Lucerne\\". With imaginative plot twists, exotic locations, and a new unlikely heroine, this second effort by Brad Thor is every bit as engaging as his first was. And as far as the cold-hearted assassin is concerned, the identity is surprising. Against the backdrop of current events, Brad Thor recognizes that politically incorrect fact, that we are at war with elements of a group of religious extremists; radical Islam. As fantastic as the action in this book was, I found it to be plausible, if not realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in details.","review":"For an author who traveled the world and actually visited many of the places in his novel, his details regarding places are so flawed they completely ruin the ability to \\"suspend belief\\" required in many novels of this kind. The liberties he takes describing events on the Island of Capri are so far beyond what actually exists on Capri, I almost quit reading. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone, especially those who like Clancy who does tend to get details correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy writing...","review":"Horrible book. Unreadable. Bunch of poorly-written macho BS. The Lions of Lucerne was okay, but this follow up is literally unreadable. Should have saved my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is WAY too generous","review":"I tossed this book away 1/3 of the way through, and the only reason I stayed with it that long is because I'm stubborn. I wanted to like this book. Thank goodness I didn't pay for it.Besides a thin plot with cliche characters, the interaction between the main character (FBI) and those from other government agencies (CIA) is sophomoric at best, moronic at worst.If this is what Brad Thor has to offer, I'll look elsewhere. May I suggest instead...Joel Rosenberg, Vince Flynn and Oliver North. They actually know their subject material and write engaging stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I cannot believe I got past page 10 without just tossing it in the dumpster.I don't think I've ever read a worse ending.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifying!","review":"By horrifying, I mean that it is a horrifying experience to read this complete piece of junk! The male, egomaniacal, wisecracking prose (which it barely is)reads like an incredibly terrible Hollywood movie. If I didn't borrow it from someone, I would definitely through it away.Now, I admit I don't normally read this kind of thing, but I have and I have enjoyed it. The only joy I could possibly get out of this would be if the main character, Scot Horvath, was on the receiving end of one of the many missiles launched in the first 50 pages.I can't believe this was even published. Whoever did so should be fired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello from the world","review":"While the plight of the rail-line adventurers is certainly compelling, the way the book is laid out on the whole leaves much to be desired. I would much rather there been a focus on a few of the characters and their experiences in their entirety.The practice of submitting dozens of snippets from dozens of people makes for dull reading and dilutes the overall power of the experiences shared by these people. After reading scores of two-paragraph statements on the great depression, we are left with no feeling for the characters other than, \\"Boy the depression must have really sucked!\\"I'm unsure as to whether this work falls into the \\"publish or perish\\" school of literature but it certainly seems that way. Too often the reader is left \\"wondering\\" and wanting to know more about some compelling characters.Alert publishers everywhere - A collection of short essays does not a book make!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stars for the product itself","review":"I love the ease of use, it is a thick gel and the big jar makes it easy to dip the color brush in...It stains the hair well and lasts a long time.

I own 4 of these and just ordered 2 more. I keep two of them running non-stop and almost never turn them off except to occasionally move them to a different computer. One of them has been running for over a year straight. It's true that they do get a little warm, but this hasn't translated into any actual problems. I used to use EZQuest drives but had one fail on me which is why I switched and tried LaCie. I also have a LaCie big disk (500GB D2), but that has given me problems and I've had to wipe that disk clean and reformat it - a big pain so I can't say all LaCie disks are great. But the FA Porsche one (firewire version) has never failed me.

Why? Because the case design - while nice-looking - does not allow for proper air circulation or ventilation of the drive, so that it runs much hotter internally than it ought to. I replaced the drive twice - each one lasted 6-9 months before it failed. I can't think of any reason for this other than heat.

But so far, about a year after the warranty expired, two drives have crashed, i.e., they became unreadable, inaccessable, so that they did not even connect to my Mac via Firewire. As a result, I had to spend $1500 each time to have another company retrieve the data.These drives sat still, on a shelf, for two years, so there was no issue with them being mishandled or jostled. The internal mechanics simply stopped working.I am now looking for a new company. Never again will I purchase anything from LaCie.

There are no episode selection icons, to pick which episode that you wanted to watch. There are no opening titles listed before each individual show, to say what episode it is, that you are going to watch. It looks like a copy, of a copy, of a copy.

Their rising and floating melodies; their trade-off of punch and grace; their immaculate production values; every player plying his craft with imagination and care -- there's not a wasted second on this disc. Though only half the length of their masterful \\"Subterranea,\\" there's something more wonderful about this one; a more interesting atmosphere. The opening chord progression, an eerie and elegant synth cry (very reminiscent of \\"Eleventh Earl of Mar\\" by Genesis) will hook you instantly, and you won't be able to move until the closing notes of the final track. One lyric in particular caught me: \\"Whenever heaven calls us there's regret and compromise, and in another distance lies a past unrealized.\\" Utterly, utterly lovely. I wish the enitre world would sit down and give this an undivided listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"It isn't their best, but who cares?","review":"This may not be Subterranea, or Ever, but it sure shines as an individual album.

Overall, this gets a 4/5 stars..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for the prog collector","review":"It is hard to pick the best CD from IQ. They have so many great ones- Ever, The Wake, Dark Matter.

I have two of them going almost constantly in the winter months. It refills easily and has no filter. It is quiet and has no annoying light to keep me awake. It goes for many hours. The only drawback might be if you wanted to add something to the water. You use plain tap water. Excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a MINI-humidifier","review":"Maybe it's my own fault, but I didn't get that from the product description. It's a weensy little thing for using on your desk at work or taking with you on business trips; in my apartment it barely lasts through one night. It's also really noisy. I am probably comparing to my last (normal sized) humidifier ( a vicks something or other, no longer available) which was great and lasted 3 years, until hard water built up too much limescale... I would have cleaned more if I'd have realized how hard it is to find one to replace it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Considering........?!?!?!?","review":"This machine is very small/light; that, together with it's excellent performance, is its virtue. It is easy to carry about, to fill at an ordinary sink, and to place in the immediate vicinity of the persons/furniture needing a reasonable humidity level. It has two rates of operation which provide a wide range & are quite adequate to put plenty of water into the air quickly or to extend the life of the cycle at lesser rates. Advisory lights & the highly desirable auto-shutoff are well designed. The actual rates of dissemination (in cc's/hour) are not spelled out as they should be for this and any other humidifiers, but informally I'd judge this unit to be reasonably powerful considering - (thought I'd never get around to it, didn't you?)- it's modest and convenient size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate Info on amazon; puposeful misrepresentation","review":"Received the product and was greatly disappointed even without using it. The amazon description was purposely inadequate. Smaller than expected. The statements like 2.0 gallons output make one think that the reference is to tank capacity which is only 0.5 Gallons.

It does put out a little steam-like cloud of moisture but more importantly it puts out a pretty loud grinding noise when we first turn it on. Sounds like the fan isn't seated well in there and is wobbling against the casing or something. The noise usually stops after 5 minutes or so, but it shouldn't be there at all. Agreed?

I did keep this and use it sometimes on my desk. If you are only a couple of feet away from it, it is o.k.; but, if you get up, forget it.

It's money well spent.The size is perfect, the shape is cute, and of course, the price is reasonable. I've never used any fancy humidifier before, but I think this one does all what I need for a humidifier.The only problem is that it makes a little noise (you can hear the water running). But I love the sound of water, so it is not a problem for me at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for RV's","review":"We travel in an RV 8 months a year and stay in very dry climates most of the time. This humidifier is just the right size to raise the hummidty to keep the wood in the RV from shrinking too much. It also helps keep our skin from drying out. Sometimes the unit is hard to get started and sometimes makes noise. Both are not big issues but just the same it you should know this prior to purchase. Good unit and will keep going throughout the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much maintenance involved....","review":"It puts out a cloud of water vapor and it's not all that noisy but I had no idea I'd be spending so much time each day taking the humidifier apart, wiping it down, trying to insert my hand inside the tank to wipe that down, refilling the tank twice a day, and wondering why this humidifier doesn't have an automatic shuftoff in case I forget to turn it off. At least the filters and cleaning cartidges are easy to find. However, this is too much like an unwanted hobby so I'll be looking for another way to raise the relative humidity in my room."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product, needs more mist","review":"I like this product.

This is a nifty little humidifier. Just needed something to keep my eyes moist at night -- so they don't weld shut. (Don't you just love dry eye?) I almost DIDN'T buy it because it is so inexpensive, but it makes mist, it's easy to maintain, and it's quiet. Better, yet, after the dog figured out I had a new humidifier running, he circled around a few times under the mist spray and settled down for a long nap --- without snoring all night. He's a lot bigger than the humidifier. What a deal! Started out this new humidifier using distilled water from the Megahome distiller I bought here at Amazon.

I'm very dissatisfied with the unit.I am returning this humidifier."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"We just got this humidifier two days ago from amazon, and so far we loved it. We live in a very dry area, and every night was close to miserable before buying this product.It's exceptionally quiet, and it worked perfectly so far. Since that is the first humidifier we ever owned, I cannot compare with anything else, but before we would wake up several times during night time to drink water, or because of discomfort. Many times I had my nose bleeding because of the dryness. And that is not happening anymore.A great buy for the price.UPDATE: The product is still working fine, but now everytime we turn it on, it makes a loud noise that lasts for a while and than stops.

The surfaces get damp, and in some cases downright soaking (wood, carpet, counter tops).

I followed the cleaning instructions, but it just never seemed to work like I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried, does not work","review":"I've had the bigger model of this ultrasonic for over a year, and we're very happy with that.I've run the product for a few nights. There is a lot of mist, however, the blower does not send mist up high enough to allow it to circulate the room. Next to my son's mattress, which sits on the floor, it gets the bed wet.

In my eyes, this isn't a humidifier at all. It shoots water up in the air which proceeds to fall on the ground. In my case, the water landed on hardwood floors and my bed.

This was an Amazon recommendation that hits the mark! I have read all the other \\"Burglar\\" books and enjoyed them all. Although I saw alot of the plot coming, Block surprised me with who the killer was...I never guessed this one. This is an enjoyable book with Block's loveable burglar: Bernie Rhodenbarr, friend Carolyn the dog groomer & Ray, the cop. He even brings back Marty from ---Ted Williams. Bernie once, again, brings the suspects together at the scene of the crime (a la Agatha Christies Poirot & Miss Marple) and explains \\"whodunit\\" and how. As usual, Bernie makes out like a bandit. Lawrence Block always satisfies with every novel and never misses a beat. Buy, read it, loan it to someone else. If you haven't read Block before, read this one.

The plot was way too convoluted for my tastes, and, like other reviewers here, I thought the author worked too hard to make the dialogue \\"cute.\\"This is the first Bernie Rhodenbarr Mystery I've read.

I was very disappointed; I expected more depth and/or information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rolicking Fantasy","review":"This book picks up where Upland Outlaws left off. We see Garth's progression, as well as Rap's now essentially mudane plotting against Zinixo coming to a head. Duncan's writing is, as usual, superb; the way that he ties in his plots with classical literary quotes brings a delightful sense of continuity to each chapter. Only the fact that this book set owes so much to the first keeps it from being five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't read this book!","review":"If you read this book, which is part three of Dave Duncan's \\"A Handful of Men\\" 4-book series, then you may be tempted to read book four. That would be an utter waste on your part. I really enjoyed Mr. Duncan's \\"A Man of His Word\\" series, which is the prequel series to this one, so I picked up this series expecting more of the same or better. Boy, was I wrong! This book itself may deserve 2-3 stars, but book four, The Living God\\", is SO bad, that it lowers all of the first three books' levels. It is not just bad. It is attrocious! Only read this series if you really enjoy being disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BOOK. TEACHES A LOT","review":"The reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is cause it teaches extremely formal Korean which in most settings outside of business would sound really weird and out of place to a native speaker but the high vocabulary and the advanced grammar that it teaches is awesome! The grammar it teaches is invaluable. You will learn a lot from this book! I recommend it for beginners and even intermediate learners"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can see this is not up to date by just reading the table of contents....","review":"I did not read this book. I am living in Korea and have been studying Korean for more than a year. I once embarassed myself by refering to a coffee shop as a '��. These days, regular coffee shops are known as a work very similar to the english \\"Coffee Shop\\". Dabang have a different connotation. That of the kind of \\"coffee shop\\" that is actually a cover for company that sells sex. Noone refers to regular coffee shops as Dabang. The back cover of the book says \\"completely up to date\\". Yet in the table of contents of this books it says \\"Meeting friends at the Dabang\\". There are so many great new Korean books coming out these days. Why buy something that was published in 1996? Korean culture has changed drastically since then."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books out there","review":"It is really hard to find good books on Korean in the States. Two books I have found that are excellent are Korean Through English 1 and Speaking Korean 1. KTE1 has cassettes and is really good for the absolute beginner. It teaches how to read and write Hangul using the cassettes for pronunciation, then it teaches a lot of useful vocabulary and sentence structures. It is a little weak on grammar. Speaking Korean has no cassettes so learning to read or write Hangul from it is almost impossible unless you have a Phd in linguistics. It does explain grammar very well and it has lots of drills. After finishing this book you should be able to speak Korean quite well. Both of these books are printed by Hollym International Corp of Elizabeth, New Jersey but they are very difficult to find in the States."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO DIFFICULT FOR BEGINNERS OR EVEN INTERMEDIATE STUDENTS","review":"This book simply has too much information that tries to be packed into the limited number of dialogues and chapters. It might be a good quick review for people with very solid Korean language background, but it's certainly not a book that someone would use to start learning Korean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for those who know Korean","review":"I ordered this book (which was more expensive than most) in hopes of learning the Korean language. It is more of a resource for someone who already has a working knowledge of Korean, and does not seem to be aimed at the non-Korean-speaking student. It may be a 5-star book for someone, but it was not useful at all for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly organised and not really for beginners","review":"I agree with another reviewer who have difficulty doing the exercises. They demand vocabulary that is not yet introduced in that particular chapter. Grammar is also not well explained. For example, the so-called Rules of honorific and non honorific verbs on page 70 of Chapter 5 is confusing. What are bright and dark verbs anyway?The book is too ambitious and attempts to cramp too much into an introductory course."},{"rating":"1","title":"agreement","review":"Look at Emyr Pugh's review.

Fabarez focuses on the application of God's Word to the lives of the listener. \\"Please don't read this book in search of a homiletics text,\\" says Fabarez, \\"or as a guide to exegesis and sermon construction,\\" (xiv).If it's a how-to book on sermon preparation you're after, this is not the book you want. However, if you want to read an extremely helpful work that offers practical, useful information to assist you in preaching sermons that seeks to effect change in the lives of the listeners, as opposed to merely presenting sermons that offer only factual information, then this book is highly recommended. Preaching that Changes Lives will prove to be a valuable resource for any preacher to have on his shelf, and is well worth the money.Preaching That Changes Lives"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has to be the weakest volume in the series","review":"Unless you're looking to complete a set, or you just happen to like one of these episodes on the disc, this volume has to be the worst one.

The stories, arranged in chronological order, gives the reader a unique (albeit potted) insight into the history of Japanese fiction and reveals a side of the Japanese people that we in the West are often unfamiliar with. The stories range widely in style and subject, some very simple and reflective, others semi-autobiographical, some humourous, some shocking and risque. All in all I felt the collection was a wonderful reflection of the Japanese culture and people; full of depth and insight, warmth and intrigue. A gem of a book that I've recommended and bought as a gift for countless friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Harmonies","review":"I have owned this CD for at least 10 years now and I am still not tired of hearing it.

I was immediately drawn into this young midwife's story of her experiences in the poor areas of London during the 1950s. Since she wrote her memoir years later, the insight of an older woman adds a deeper layer to the book that really makes it a treasure. I lent this to my mother upon returning from our trip and haven't seen it since-- it's one of those rare books that will be passed around until it's well worn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call the Midwife.

Couldn't put it down.","review":"To say I absolutely enjoyed this book is an understatement. Rarely do I get a book that has everything in a book that I want. This is funny, sad, historical, poignant, thought provoking, cultural and brilliant. This book is so much more than just a story of women delivering babies in the East End of London in the 50's. It gives us insight into what life was like at the time. What conditions people lived in. How people were coping after world war 2. Immigration. What the social values were and how through all the ups and down people were still grateful for what they have. It also deals with the history of childbirth and while things are so much more different today from the 1950's, you can appreciate how midwives dedicated their lives to helping women give birth in a safer environment with more medical and emotional assistance than in previous times.

I fixed most of the problem by taking off the break away connections from the stays and now i'm thinking of just cutting off the little bit thats still sticking out. I put these on a Boss cruiser that has straight forks. If you have a different style fork you might not have this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fit perfectly","review":"These were exactly what I expected, attached without a problem, and have served me well for an entire year.

However, after buying some longer screws (and a couple shorter ones) some lock tight nuts and a whole lot of zip ties at the hardware store I made it work.I bought the yellow version so it wouldn't fade in the sun as bad (plus you can't beat \\"free\\" shipping). Once I got them on they did their job perfectly, that is keeping all the mud and rain from spraying my face and back. They're nice and light and seem to be sturdy enough. No complaints so far. Just keep in mind that the install might take a bit of elbow grease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so universal","review":"I've heard some good things about Planet Bike, but they appear to be letting their accountants run the show. The fenders themselves are of good quality, but they skimped on the hardware necessary to attach the fender to the bike. I don't know the particular model they had in mind when they provided a bare minimum of nuts and bolts, but they probably won't fit your bike. You will have to supplement their meager offerings with a trip to the hardware store. Interestingly, of the 8 bolts they included, only 2 had nuts. It would probably have only cost them an extra 25 cents to include some additional ties, and hardware. For what is ostensibly a universal fender, the inadequate attachment hardware is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Universal Fit","review":"I used it for my Hybrid bike.

And the fenders fit well on the bike. First of all dont think you going to take them out of the box and in 5 minutes your riding. NO.

I'm not a photoshop guru, with fairly limited photoshop skills, but I would recommend Kelby's books instead. This book did have a good description of correcting skin tones using color picker and RGB to CMYK values and choosing black/white points in the image, but this can be easily found elsewhere and doesn't necessitate a full purchase.

It's interesting, how this play is connected with true facts, which you only understand knowing a bit of the real history of Mozart.We really liked the play, because it's thrilling and shows some important psychological aspects.

Great writing, wit, charm, characterization, humor, and tragic. I could go on with this play; I love it and the movie( which I have watched over five times)! The descpritions of the music and sets are lush and just seem to suit the subject. The character of Salieri is so developed and complex: you feel sorry for him one minute and you despise him the next. Amadeus is so much like a child in being so obilivious to Salieri's intents/jealousy that it makes the character of Amadeus so endearing and the play all the more tragic.I strongly recommend this to any lover of music,Mozart, or reading. In the(even more) bluntest of terms: it's one of the best plays ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"One thing to note about this printed edition of the play","review":"I'm surprised no one mentioned this, but at the back of the book, there is the score for the transformation of Salieri's welcome march to Mozart's \\"Non Piu Andrai\\".

This is where he did actually get sick ( or try to re negotiate his contract). I got this collection because it featured a story combining Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney Jr. And that story was awful. Disc 3 has a missing Maharis and also features a defect casuing it to roar in the player like a jet about to take off until you select the Episode menu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Route 66 best of","review":"According to TV on DVD website, this Feb release is not Season 3...just a best of set of episodes.Buyer beware if you want Season 3 like I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic CD!","review":"I heard some of their songs on the radio and began reminiscing, it's so fortunate to be able to find the CD on amazon so I can hear their songs whenever I feel like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"One of the best I have read that shows the way to the future of space exploration, and technology of the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of the best","review":"Since I'm a woman I don't need to be macho and have the normal type of tape measure!

Apparently they aren't selling it anywhere at the moment so for now this one suits me fine. I'm not quite sure what is in it that makes it a \\"7\\" because it all sounds natural to me!

I especially like the deconvolution of the different latin names which in many other books are quite a jumble and sometimes can be very confusing when looking something up or trying to compare between books. However, I do have to say that this book has one major flaw that stops it from being 5 stars: not all descriptions come with a photograph, so this book is great when you know the name of the cactus you are looking up, but if you know generally what you have but not the specifics, you can easily get stuck as the descriptions are not always enough to make the distinction."},{"rating":"2","title":"We needed this book","review":"Most people like cacti in some way, this is a book that was need not only for those who work in sience, but to general people, it is full with interesting infromation, it has great pictures, and I thik the most important part is that deals with the whole cactus family no book have ever did this before, this is a must have book for experts and beginers.

In fact it parted company with the rest of the chain cleaner, tearing out a hunk of resivoir wall on the way. Now it no longer holds fluid, and so is useless.

Buy a standard Ethernet cable in the length that you need (or just use the Wi-Fi connection on the Playstation 3)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain Ethernet cable","review":"I bought this item because I wasn't sure if I needed some special type of Ethernet cable in order to hook my PS3 to our modem. It's just like any other Ethernet cable available. It works perfectly, and I'm glad that I got it. However, I'm sure you could find a cheaper Ethernet cable that wasn't listed under Playstation 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"good product but not necessary","review":"you dont need dis, you just need a wireless uplink which is super easy to create"},{"rating":"1","title":"My revire","review":"It's A GOOD ITEM.But it turns out that I really didn't need it after all.I wish some one would have told me that all I needed to go online with my PS3 was a wireless connection.That would have saved me some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best of these megapack releases , but some good ones here","review":"i own most of these megapacks collections and like them but this set just didn't grab me the way some did.some of the shows were good but most were in poor shape picture wise and some of the shows were not very good quality(meaning writing and acting). some may like it but this collection just left me cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad","review":"I wonder who would give this 'movie' anything above 1 star--- teenage boys pulling a prank??

Humor abounds, but it is painful humor.The gore people did a fairly good job. It had plenty of gore.If you rent it and watch it, you may be too proud to admit it.Enjoy, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad, its, well, Bad!","review":"Not funny. There is no aesthetic to this movie at all. Some of the gore is okay, but so what? This is one hell of a lame movie. I like camp, but this thing is so self-conscious, so sophomoric, so amatuer, it will have you cringing and then just drifting. It sounds like it was written by a fifth grader. The \\"acting\\" is moronic. Once again, not funny. I'm sorry, but the people that said this movie is funny were extremely messed up when they saw this.If you want to see a good troma release, try Terror Firmer, Tromeo and Juliet, Toxic Avenger, Killer Condom, Cannibal the Musical, or even Kabuki Man. Don't waste your time with this. You'll be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"i dont get it","review":"I heard a lot of good things about this movie, but i thought it s u c k e d ! it was way too corny, and boring. for horror comedy seek movies like evil dead 2, and dead alive"},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Quality Direct To Video Gem!","review":"While the quality of this film may scare some viewers off at first, rest assured it gets pretty good throughout the film.The film is at it's best when it is following their stereotypical characters and becomes outright hilarious!I was in tears laughing during the autopsy scene in this film. I though I was going to die laughing!If you keep your eyes open for specific things each character does throughout the film, if makes it all the more funny! For example, there is one character who never talks, but always has a bottle of alcohol to drink from in every single scene of the movie.Released by Troma, but not made by the Troma team, Redneck Zombie is a pretty funny gore-comedy. Don't take it as anything else and you'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Redneck...","review":"This movie is the sorriest thing I have ever seen.

Total cr*p.","review":"I'm a major movie buff, and the movies I enjoy most are cheesy comedies and stuff... but this is the worst movie I've ever tried to watch. I had to turn it off in the middle, it was complete sh!te. It is shot on video in incredibly poor quality, the makeup effects are incredibly primitive, the directing is awful, the acting is abysmal, and the writing is some of the worst, most obvious and most stupidly stereotypical I have ever run across. Don't even try to watch this movie, much less waste money buying it. If I could give it zero stars or negative stars, I would. Heed my warning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zombie Flick","review":"Troma handles this lame zombie flick about when hillbilies turn chemical waste into a whisky still they turn into zombies.

Seriously don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movies reeks of putrefaction.","review":"I love ridiculously gore-filled movies e.g. Toxic Avenger, Evil Dead 2 and the unholy grail of gore movies Dead Alive.

I have seen quite a few movies and this is the absolute worst. Now I do admit I like cheesy movies to get a laugh from but this is no cheese, this is straight up junk. I'm surprised anyone would want to associate themselves with this movie. Actually this is so bad it qualifies as a bookend or a coaster NOT a movie. Hmm if I had the choice I would give it negative 1000 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining for Many Reasons","review":"Having grown up around Maryland, I heard about this locally lensed vid and finally got a chance to see it. Personally I think horror movies that \\"play it serious\\" end up providing more inadvertant comedy. This video goes for the jokes themselves, hitting sometimes, missing others...For the true horror/zombie fan, the last 20 minutes are excellent and make up for any groans the earlier light patter of the video caused. Gore effects in this part of video are very decent for the budget and the set up of scenes, editing and pace are superb...This video is proof that highly entertaining fair can be made cheaply.My only regret is that the DVD doesn't feature directors commentary, I'd like to know how it was all pulled off."},{"rating":"1","title":"ag","review":"This movie just seemed like a bucnh of guys got together and were like HEY LOOK WHAT WE CAN DO DUDES and put together a movie and released it. What they should have done was finetune the skills THEN release the movie. We DO NOT need minutes upon minutes of psychadelic effects. Ow. We DO NOT need endless CHEAP jokes. No. This film is bad. It's so boring. They keep trying to be funny, but never pull it off very well. The gore was decent, yeah, but not worth sitting through all of the other garbage. The black guy trying to be funny tripping out was annoying, as was pretty much every other gimmick.Sigh. Don't buy this. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not watch this movie.

I have an interest in informatics; nevertheless, I found the book repetitive and uninteresting. Almost every chapter waxes on about the merits of forming committees to investigate choices, involving the end-point users etc. This only needs to be said once, not in every single chapter.

She wrote this book with months of tears, and sleepness nights. Sometimes calling me at 5a.m. because she was so upset that she needed someone else to talk with. It took alot of soul searching for her to put this book together. It was a difficult project. But! She needed to speak for Jon Benet, and others like her. Nobody could have told the story better than Eleanor ,herself. Please applaud my friend It took courage for her to come forth with damaging informationaboutthe pagent systems,and to write about her own exploitations in her life.

I agree with the Burke theory but mostly was appauled to read about the Kiddie Pageants. My heart went out to the Director in the story..such a hard life and still sees a life ahead of her. She needs to travel the circuit to tell her story. Like Marilyn Vandenberg, she has a most interesting story to tell and to hopefully save other children like JonBenet Ramsey...I believe that someone in that house knew that JonBenet was being molested....and were afraid to tell. I can see how the director in the book and JonBenet could be related..they were both show pieces...This book needs to get into the public domain...the real world and truths are what you are going to read here...."},{"rating":"1","title":"pornographic claptrap","review":"I found this book to be pornographic trash and I was disgusted to see it peddled as some kind of \\"informative\\" document related to the JonBen��t Ramsey case.Clearly this woman has had some problems in her life, but she should have been working it out on some therapist's couch, not writing it out to cause pain for yet another innocent child.Burke didn't deserve to be part of her nightmare."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(B,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-f808bbdb"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/12.md","filePath":"sponsor/12.md"}'),R={name:"sponsor/12.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
