Sure it was a little kiddish, but they will age with the film just like the rest of us did with the origional trilogy, think about it. A new hope looked like a one time shot, so he couldn't take the kid route. It's a trilogy, this was only Part I.

Now he's trying re-release this movie, what's new about it, widescreen format and a few new documentaries with the same footage used in other documentaries about the movie that you could probably see on cable tv.In my opinion just another attempt to make money, is this really worth another $20 dollars to you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"POStar Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Meaningless\\"","review":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen is \\"Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.\\" Forget the story of politics, nobody cares about that.

Darth Maul (not scary) wants to eliminate the child for he is the chosen one. What a bunch of bull. Jar Jar Binks is the absolute worst thing ever created.

Much more could have been done with the movie. The special effects are cool and all but w/o a solid script and core cast of characters that draw you into the story in a manner that is independent of the previous movies...ahem...works of art, long time fans are left with a bit of a sinking feeling. In short, those who saw the previous films will enjoy Phantom menace on a totally different level than the moviegoer who has not.

The movie is in no way on the same level as the 3 others. This movie is a children\`s movie. That big rabbit look-a-like (whose name I have merciful forgotten) can only very small children find funny. He was stupid to watch for older viewers. The movie lacked a purpose. It seems like the movie is made only so there could be 3 new Star Wars movies.The movie starts on the Queen\`s planet and ends there as well. It is a circle going nowhere. Even in a galaxy far,far away there should be some kind of realism and I fear this film lacks that. A Queen of 14 years seems a bit young even for Star Wars. And that whole Anakin is Jesus was too much for me.

Of course the movie, technically speaking, is marvellous. But there's no substance. Lucas transformed the \\"series\\" into a show for all the family, totally inofensive, almost \\"Disney-like\\".The boy-actor that plays Anakin was a bad, real bad choice. The poor boy simply can't act.Jar-Jar binks was a bad comic relief.And now we learn that Lucas even intended to put NSYNC in the sequence (ATTACK OF THE CLONES), due to a request from his daughter!!!!The series is now nothing more than just a merchandising enterprise, and Lucas really lost his touch for direction. I hope the new sequence is better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not a good movie","review":"This movie is nothing like the original series.

Listen folks, all you need to know is this: George Lucas has NO CONCEPT of what makes a movie good. All he cares about is filling the screen with unneeded special effects, many of which are hard to look at because they stand out so much. I will not comment on \\"Jar-Jar\\" specifically because it's no more ridiculous than the hundreds of other things in this movie. Save you money. If you want to buy your kids a nice \\"kids movie\\" I'd suggest \\"Toy Story(1 or 2)\\" or \\"Shrek\\". Heck, I've seen Saturday morning cartoons that had tighter stories than \\"Phantom Menace\\".

How anyone could love it is beyond me...much less watch extras about the hideous making of a cinematic atrocity. George Lucas has directed the dullest film ever. EVER. I wanted to shut this thing off twenty minutes into it and forced myself to watch it. It is even more boring than 2001: A Space Odyssey...and that is next to impossible. But of course what can you expect from the man who brought the world such trash as Willow and Howard the Duck. I HATE this film and am so glad that SHREK is outselling it on DVD. I would rather watch Chesty Morgan movies ad naseum than to ever sit through this void on celluloid again. Anyone who likes it is welcome to it but don't ever try to go on a date with me.

I love the fact that it connected with the other episodes quite effectively. Even though I disliked the performance of Jake Lloyd, Anakin Skywalker, the rest of the cast was on par. This movie has a basic plotline spiced with spectacular special effects and impressive action sequences. Like many fans of the Star Wars saga, I can hardly wait for the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtually Unwatchable","review":"This movie is so unbelievably bad, it is almost unwatchable. The characters were forgettable, the plot ridiculous, and I *hate* movies where some Whiz Kid is the hero. My friend brought his 2 children, aged 4 and 5, which was good, since the entire movie was aimed toward them. Almost all of the special effects money went to creating aliens who were virtually unconnected to the plot. When the Jedi was killed near the end I thought, \\"who cares\\" since I couldn't even remember his NAME at that point. On the drive home, I realized that I couldn't name the alien with the big ears, or the Queen or Princess or whoever she was. And I had just seen the movie! If all of them had been killed, I would have just shrugged. The plot, along with the ridiculously bad writing and acting, made it impossible to care about them. A truly pathetic successor to the brilliant original trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless until Jar Jar can be COMPLETELY deleted","review":"In short, this DVD will not be worth owning until there is the option to totally delete Jar Jar Binks from the movie. There was nothing wrong with the Gungans - in fact, I rather liked them (the normal ones that you could understand when they spoke, and who weren't shuffling, stumbling, mumbling idiots).As a point of reference - I've seen Episodes 4, 5, & 6 together more than 100 times, and have over 50 sci-fi movies in my DVD collection, but I'll never own or watch Episode 1 again until Jar Jar can be erased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, horrible BAD movie!!","review":"Star Wars 1 is a movie about two idiots who try to rescue a queen from a palace in a far-off land.

I think this film is actually depressing, I am not a Star Wars fan at all but the film is so cheesy and corny and HORRIBLY written (I'm 15 and I could write a better script) that it makes you want to puke. After I saw this film, I tried to think of a scene that was entertaining or interesting, and you know what? I couldn't think of one.

Jackson, Natalie Portman, etc.)I was really excited to share this movie with My five year old daughter who had really enjoyed the tapes of the first three, I think she got alot more enjoyment out of Toy Story 2. The special effects were so-so (especially being that it came out the same year as The Matrix) Save Your money or buy the first three.

Shame on You Mr. Lucas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the DVD","review":"I find it absurd that this movie is not being released on DVD.

Most annoyingly of all little Anakin Skywalker was a good actor. The film would have got 4 stars out of 5 but because of Jar Jar it gets 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Redeeming Grace","review":"It's interesting. Star Wars, a series that Mark Hamill's acting couldn't kill, was laid low by it's own creator. The Phantom Menace took a formerly great series and disolved it into a stream of slapstick, pod racing, and Jar-Jar Binks. Some thoughts: why are the battle robots given weapons that are seperate from themselves? Why aren't the built into the hardware? Also, why do these death robots use normal speach to talk to each other, and why do they look like people instead of a form that kills more efficently?However, it does warrant a second star. Why? For one part: the Duel of the Fates, a John Williams-underscored fight sequence on par with the better moments of Star Wars. If the rest of the film had been on that level, The Phantom Menace might have been the best of the series. Instead, it is regared, by and large, as the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I have a bad feeling about this\\"","review":"The most famous phase in a Star Wars movie is \\"I have a bad feeling about this\\" and its made by Obi-Wan (Ewan McGreggor) and i can't decide if he's talking about the movie itself, or the annoying Jar Jar Binks.Great DVD, so-so movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a bad feeling about this . . .","review":"A mediocre begining to the Star Wars saga. It seems like it is aimed at children too much for adults to care about it. Also missing is the sharp irreverance that the first films had. Lucas' dialogue reads like it is to be acted with the same importance of Shakespears. Even more offensive is the Steppin'-Fetchit Jar-Jar Binks. A character that is so annoying you hope that he gets killed off. Soon. Please. What the film really lacks is a strong, menacing evil figure (similar to Darth Vader) to contrast the good. The evil in the film is almost amibigously dull. Overall, nice special effects but a cardboard story."},{"rating":"1","title":"ahhh, can't hate lucas","review":"...rely on the extensive documentaries/featurettes (disc 2) to help convince yourself that this film has 'some' redeeming value...the excessive quantity of dvd extras (actually more entertaining/intriguing than the movie itself) tries to dazzle/numb you into forgeting/rationalizing your profound disappointment in the movie...so maybe it's a rough start, but bringing star wars up to speed with 'contemporary action/sci-fi movie standards' and 'expectation pressures' (especially from the SW over-intellectualizers) is a pretty formidable task.be wary tho and try to ignore the sickeningly profuse lucas kow-tow-ing by his legion of payroll sycophants/workhorse zombies.tho Quantity over quality is the essence of this dvd, how can i turn my back completely on someone responsible for so much of my childhood joy?all starwars fans are forever indebted to lucas for the cherished memories... it's his story, after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"People claim that it would have been impossible for this Star Wars to live up to the expectations from the previous movies. I believe that they are just looking for excuses for why this movie is as bad as it is. Lucas' main flaw was trying to target the movie towards eight year olds (ie \\"humor\\" used, Jar Jar, etc.) Another disappointment was the acting. Liam Neeson is about the only actor pulling his weight in this movie, and that simply isn't enough to cut it. The performances of Anakin and his mother feel totally unbelievable and Queen Amidala continually has a \\"pained to take the effort to say these lines\\" expression. This DVD is barely worth renting, simply for the extras and the fact that this is an episode in the Star Wars series.

Set to the wonderful atmosphere conjured by John Williams' Duel of the Fates, I found it engaging to a whole new level.While some people may find the romantic overtones between young Skywalker and Amidala to be unnerving, it is necessary to set the stage for that plot line to be further develop in Episode II and III.

(3)The pod race that people seem to think is so great is straight out of Ben Hur. (4)That Jar-Jar Binks annoyed me throughout the movie and apparently will be around for the next one.

There are too many CGI things flying around on the screen it became quite irritating, this is the quintessential blueprint film for people with ADD(crisis every 5 min) and is a nightmare for anyone with an IQ over 80. Lets not forget the racism; Mexicans, Blacks, Asians play all the shady/weird characters in the film. I'm white and I noticed this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Supplements!","review":"We already know the movie.So, I won't say much about the movie.Great special effects, but in general I found the movie not so captivating either.Anyway, the DVD is excellent.Especially the documentary was great. It made me to like the movie more. As I am a huge Ewan McGregor fan, I was so happy to see him behind the scenes.For those who already like the Star Wars Episode 1, the DVD will be a great pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been called \\"Muppets in Space\\"","review":"No, I take it back...that would be an insult to the real \\"Muppets in Space\\". I have no idea what George Lucas was thinking when he made this movie, but the result is an embarrassment to the Star Wars franchise. At least the DVD version is packed with some decent extras...hopefully the original Star Wars will be released on DVD in a similar package and in the process of putting it together Lucas will be reminded of what made Star Wars so popular in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointing Movie","review":"After seeing the first Star Wars, then the next two installments I must say I was really let down by this movie. Lots of special effects but no clear plot really left me wondering why I even bothered. Plus there were so many things going on, I felt overloaded with information but couldn't figure out what it applied to. This is only for the die hard Star Wars fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, but still worth owning.","review":"Although this DVD is packed with goodies, looks great, and I am a Star Wars fan, the movie itself is disappointing. If you are expecting the same caliber storytelling from George Lucas as before, you are in for quite a surprise! Jar-Jar Binks is the most annoying character, and some of the storyline is a bit hard to swallow. Yes, one should suspend their beliefs when watching science fiction, but this was too much! The future Lord Vader as a kid yelping \\"Whoopie\\" was just plain silly! Granted he IS only a kid, but let's face it, the Ewoks were more appealing!!!On the other hand, the sets, costumes, pod race, and Darth Maul make it tolerable and still worth owning. Too bad he had to die off, Darth Maul is one of Lucas' best bad guys! Hopefully the next episode will be better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally the wait is over, and it's worth it....","review":"Thank you George Lucas for finally putting a Star Wars movie onto the DVD format. This DVD is a must have for every Star Wars fan who owns a DVD player. The movie images are razor sharp and the sound is so good, it's like watching the movie the first time, everytime.Even the documentary DVD is worth watching with alot of features.Thanks again Mr. Lucas from a life long Star Wars fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Finally a disc that lives up to the hype. My big-screen TV and surround sound system love this movie. A must have for any DVD fan.One complaint though...the English Subtitles can't be turned off. If they can, I sure as heck can't figure it out. The options menu seems to be worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backlash","review":"The backlash against this heavily hyped movie and DVD is unwarranted. Episode I was an entertaining fantastic film for the entire family. All the naysayers are people who fail to realize that these films were born out of B-Movie Saturday Matinee Serials and are treating them (inappropriately) as high art."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Legend Lives On","review":"Okay, so George Lucas is dialogue-challenged. It ain't \\"War and Peace\\"--but you've got to give credit where it's due. He does epic better than anybody, and he's kept generations of fans hanging in there for over twenty years. I will be sorely disappointed if Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan doesn't inherit the mantle of Harrison Ford from the original trilogy. Give Obi-Wan a girl, for crying out loud! C'mon, George--he exudes sex appeal. Make use of it--not all of your fans are prepubescent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No DVD, don't buy it.","review":"A major disappointment for all movie lovers and Star Wars fans. Granted, the movie it self is 3 stars or more, but the VHS tape is not worth buying at all and disgraces the movie even further (having Jar-Jar contribute the most to it's shame). George Lucas, why are you wasting everyone's time with such substandard media? Trying to sell us the VHS tape of SW:PM makes yourself and all of LUCAS INDUSTRIES look like penny pinchers. Money isn't everything, especially when you've got fans that have lasted 20 and more years with you.

When I saw it the second time, I understood it more.The movie is a good start for the next movies of the series. I think the visual effects were great. I can tell a lot of imagination and creativity went into the scenary.Jar Jar wasn't that bad either.The actors were o.k.The light saber fight at the end was really hype. I like the movie overall. I just don't agree with the discrimination of people of different backrounds in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's sooooo bad!!","review":"I really wanted to love this movie, but 5 minutes into it, I found myself checking my watch. I think George Lucas should apologize for making this movie, like he did for the second Raiders movie (I think it was him). Anyway, it was embarrasing to watch. The DVD? Forget it. I'd rather watch a commercial for doritos."},{"rating":"1","title":"2001's Worst Video Transfer?","review":"The only purpose to buy this DVD is to showcase just how poor video quality gets on DVD.This movie was showcased as a beautiful digital video experience in \\"Electronic Cinema\\" presentations.

This is not a good example of the potential for picture quality with DVD production capabilities.JS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only John Woo could be worse","review":"Aside from movies directed by John Woo this is the worst film I've ever seen. It's not like it's any one thing, either. It just falls so completely short of everything that it could be. Jar-Jar, awful cue-card reading by Jake Lloyd, a terribly over-the-top Darth Maul... I don't harbor any ill-will to anyone over this movie, I just wonder what the hell happened since the first trilogy. Oh well, I've still got the original trilogy, pre-special edition, so that's what I'll keep watching. CGI effects just look too much like a cartoon for me to take anything but PIXAR movies seriously. I wish I liked this movie, I really do, but as it stands I'm not even going to bother watching Episode 2 now. Beside, will missing a \\"performance\\" by Christopher Lee really be that bad?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No DVD, No Stars!","review":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. That being said, I enjoyed the theatrical presentation of this film. While the story line had some slow/superficial spots, the sound, imaging, and cutting edge effects more than compensated. UNFORTUNATELY, Lucasfilms, in all their brilliant arrogance and stupidity, opted against DVD release. Bad move Georgy boy! Why should us common folk be made to suffer just because you're still miffed at the fact that you would not support a technology that proved successful even without your support? Come on, put your pride on the shelf, along with some DVD star wars triolgies/ prequels/ Indiana Jones flicks/ etc...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Godzilla","review":"This is the worst hyped movie I have ever seen. There is none of the Star Wars magic in this film. None of the characters in the film are sympathetic and Jar Jar is the worst creation in the history of film. Buying this movie is like telling George Lucas that it is okay to make a billion dollar movie with an awful script. The worst thing about this movie is that the computer special effects are the real star and there is no humanity or soul in the film. Star Wars was a great movie because it had characters people could relate to, but this movie has none. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS WORTHLESS MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? Why? Why?","review":"The fact that the first three films were a overly simplistic is understandable because Lucas was new to film making and had a limited budget. They had potential but ultimately Lucas didn't expand the Star Wars Universe to satisfy people who want some depth in their movie experience.So what's his excuse now? Rather than grow up with his audience and create a prequel that would stimulate some brain cells he simply created a movie as an excuse to sell more toys. I mean come on, doesn't he have enough money to get some real writers and pay for some special effects that don't look like special effects?When I saw all the Star Wars fans getting so excited over the coming of this movie, (many of them going so far as to actually buy tickets for Meet Joe Black just to see the coming attractions for the Phantom Menace and then walk out) I was almost certain that Lucas wouldn't let them down.At this point if the next two movies are even remotely interesting I'll be very surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish this movie had never been made. It's the terrible truth: Star Wars has jumped the shark.","review":"This was a bad movie. Too much CGI, too much stiff acting, too much ridiculous stuff (Anakin almost accidentally destroying a federation trade ship), many unwelcome revelations about the force (the metachlorides), and featuring THE most annoying character in the star wars universe (yousa know who I mean).Star Wars jumped the shark with this movie and it never truly recovered. Though I liked RoTS and thought AoTC was okay, I could not truly take them seriously like the original trilogy partly because this crappy movie sucked all credibility out of the franchise. This gets my vote for the WORST Star Wars movie ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"Why bother to see this movie, when there are so many good Disney pictures around?? This movie goes on the same category as Shrek, Monsters Inc, and Final Fantasy, and is much worse than all those... want to see a big, computer animated movie? go see Shrek... this has nothing to do with Star Wars as we knew it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"I was a little kid when the first trilogy was released. I always liked those movies. This one I didnt. I tried to. I did. It just wasnt there for me. Maybe it was the way Anikin was played by that Lloyd kid, or the WAY OVERDONE special effects, or the lame jokes and even lamer Jar Jar.(Lucas, what the hell were you thinking with him?) Some characters in movies have been annoying, but NOTHING like that waste of space!! Yousa [bad]Jar Jar!!! Even the saber fight wasnt special. Sure it was fun to watch, but there was no drama to it. They didnt even know who DM was!! I hope part 2 is more interesting with an older Anikin."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Film Ruins The Legact of Star Wars","review":"Any Star Wars fan who has not seen this disaster need to avoid viewing it at all costs in order to maintain respect for the series. This film is somewhere between the Teletubbies and Muppets in Space. So be warned: This film is marketed towards 6-10 year olds ala Harry Potter. If you need a Star Wars fix, keep watching your VHS tapes of the real movies in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more than worthy beginning for the SW saga","review":"Boy, do people hate this movie. I must admit I wasn't crazy about it myself when I first saw it. But upon a second viewing, I realized how good it was. I don't understand why people complain about it having no plot. Indeed, it does have a plot, and a good, intricate one, at that. As for the acting, that is unjustly maligned too. One does not go into a Star Wars movie expecting Oscar-calber thespianism, and the acting here is far from horrible. Even Jake Lloyd is not as bad as people say. He's a nine-year-old boy playing a nine-year-old boy.I wish the people who hate this movie and spend so much time trashing it would just give it another chance, and put aside all the negativity that has been directed at this very fine installment. I think those people might be surprised at how much they like it.\\"The Phantom Menace\\" is flawed, to be sure, but overall it is one of the most graceful, seamless, and visually astounding movies George Lucas has ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abandon all hope...","review":"If you liked the characters and relatively good story from the first three Star Wars movies, than DO NOT watch this one. The shallow story goes right along with characters of the same. A fun sci-fi style movies with decent action, but a not too good story. Then ther is the real killer Jar Jar Binks. Star Wars albatross. Rent this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible thing to think of when you think of Star Wars","review":"Star Wars: GreatEmpire Strikes Back: AmazingReturn Of The Jedi: GreatThe Phantom Menace: Vomit InducingStar Wars Episode 1 is one of the worst films of made. George Lucas should really be ashamed because of this pile of puke. It is mainly about Ankain Skywalker as a pod racer. The battles are nothing spectacular and are better done in movies Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or The Seven Samurai. The Special FX are nothing compared to The Matrix. I wanted Episode 1 to be about The Sith Wars, not about Pod Racing. WHO CARES?!?! And anyone who think that this is better than Empire Strikes Back needs to rewatch the original Trilogy. I am not looking forward to Attack Of The Clones (sounds like an Ed Wood movie, doesn't it?). I suggest waiting for the MEGA BOX SET to come out if you want Star Wars. Because if you have seen the original trilogy and haven't seen this, you will be disapointed from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money. The VHS version is LOW quality.","review":"George Lucas -You won't release Episode 1 on DVD. Why not? You are dictating to millions of people your preference of them watching Star Wars: The Phantom Menace on VHS. The VHS quality is very poor, compared to DVD. I purchased the widescreen version, expecting a much higher quality of recording on the videocassette. It is of such low quality (and the sound is severely limited by VHS - no 5.1 on a videocassette. The best you'll hope for is Pro Logic) that I am ashamed to play it for people. My home theater system is of the quality that it makes this low quality piece of trash show how low quality it is.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"...I sense a disturbance in the Force...\\"","review":"This movie blows. The story is buried under needless sub-plots. The dialog is cheesy. The characters are written without emotion. Most of the acting is stiff. Lucas directs with a clumsy hand, ending key scenes too quickly. The biggest suprise of the movie is the frequency and impunity with which racial sterotypes are employed.\\"Episode I...\\" possesses all the telltale signs of a marketing excercise. It lacks the creativity, wit, and adventurous spirit of the first three films. Not convinced? Just tool on down to ANY store and bear witness to all the junk bearing the title \\"Episode I.\\" Notice the big discount stickers plastered everwhere. What a shame Lucas spent more time and effort on merchandising the product than he did on producing a quailty movie. Why didn't George release it on DVD? Simple- there's a greater market for the VHS format.Lucas sold out.The fans deserved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is that!","review":"Im sorry but I really think that is the flop of the year.

It has been watched, literally, over 70 times. The picture quality of this 20-year-old pre-THX video, looks better than this $29.95 brand new video. I have to back up the other reviews about how bad the transfer was to VHS. It looked like a bootleg in most parts of the movie. It is stamped with the THX logo, but you sure wouldn't know it by watching it. Oh well, maybe Lucas will improve it on The Phantom Menace Special Edition VHS in 2021."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Phantom Disappointment","review":"Do NOT waste your money on this video! The video quality is terrible! The picture did not seem to be up to usual VHS standards, and was so far beneath DVD standards as to be laughable. The only redeeming virtue of this tape was the sound quality, which was surprisingly good considering it was not digital. The best sound effects in the universe could not make up for the grainy, blurred picture. I love this movie despite its faults, but I wish I had held out for the DVD, however many years that takes!

No development of character, fights without reason or logic. You know when you come down to it - the actors looked pretty bored.

The special effects were wonderful and so were the sets and many*** of the creatures who inhabited this world. But the characterizations were dull and the acting was wooden. The plot was darn near incomprehensible.But when I saw Episode I for the second time, on PPV, I noticed the music and sound effects were overwhelming the dialogue, so I turned on closed-captioning and voila! I could understand both dialogue and plot. Unfortunately the newly decipherable story was pretty lame - way too 'talky' and far too long. I think Lucas could have cut this by 30 minutes without hurting it a bit, but then where would he have had a place to hang all the effects and new species?***[Except for Jar-Jar Binks, who drove me nuts with that phony-Caribbean lingo and other affectations that would have been racist if this had been a human creature]"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Phantom Garbage","review":"I can't believe I actually paid money to see this in the theaters.

Watching this, one would think that Lucas had never seen the original three movies. He literally took everything that made the first movies great and threw them out the window. I don't know how any director could have a movie with such top-notch actors and wind up with such a lack of feeling, but I guess a control freak like George was able to do it. To top it all off, we learn that that the ability to use the Force, which we previously thought was mystical and spiritual, is really due to things called midichlorians in the blood. What?!? And forget about Haley Joel Osment, the boy who played the Spoon Kid from the Matrix should have played Anakin. This movie is a poor successor to one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. It plays more like a parody than a prequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grave and Utter disapointment","review":"This movie was the worst! Yeah sure, it had special effects and that is important, but special effects are worthless unless their is acting, good acting. This movie has NO ACTING! I could hardly tell what the... was going on!

Liem Nieson is a great actor but odviously his talant was wasted in this, not good directing as far as acting goes.

Admittedly, it's not the greatest Star Wars film and a lot of the criticisms are valid. However, I recently rewatched it with my wife and started to see some value in it. It is an adventure movie with some pretty cool scenes (the Darth Maul duel in particular). But more importantly, it isn't supposed to focus on character and plot development - that's for Episodes II and III. Rather, TPM is just an adventure story to introduce the world of Star Wars (think the Hobbit before the Lord of the Rings). It isn't a great movie, but it's also not so horrible as to cast it out of the Star Wars saga. Overall, a 3.75 star movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH NO!

Besides the exciting pod race scene, Liam Neeson as Qui-Gonn Jinn and the all-too-short jedi battle at the film's ending(isn't it very un-Jedi-like to tag up on an opponent?), 'Menace' is boring, hokey and extremely frustrating to watch. And I am praying to every single saint that I can think of that Lucas DOES NOT tackle the roles of screenwriter and director for the next two films. Maybe hand those chores over to the likes of Lawrence Kasden(screenwriter of 'Empire')to write it or Frank Darabont to direct. Maybe this way, we won't have to watch ANOTHER big space battle finale or ANOTHER villain falling down a bottomless chasm, and we'll get something done with a little bit more style and originality instead of self-repetition and uninspired storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop being so critical","review":"StarWars Episode I, in my opinion excellent movie.

The SFX were impressive at times, but even that failed to save a film that I would consider a chore to rewatch. There is nothing of the liveliness and gung-ho sense of adventure of the original.

This was a film of no substance whatsoever. There was nothing of the fun, the mythos, the joy of the first film. What we got instead was a marketing ploy, nothing more. There ought to be a cosmic law in which Mr. Lucas would be obligated to pay back the time wasted by those who watched this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy.","review":"This would have been great if it had been formatted for viewing in the US!

Needless to say I was mad, I should have been more careful and spent the extra money and bought the more expensive DVD.

It is an empty, soulless film that lacks the spirit, adventure and human element that made the previous trilogy so memorable. George Lucas was so caught up in the digital technology and special effects that he thought little about story construction and character development. (If you blink, you'll miss Samuel L. Jackson - whose role is incredibly miniscule.) To make matters worse, Lucas sabotaged his own film with the obnoxious creation of Jar Jar Binks. The only memorable sequence in \\"Phantom Menace\\" is the pod race, which was ripped off from \\"Ben Hur\\" and \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" (I kid you not). For all the money it has made, this alleged film doesn't have an original, imaginative bone in its body.

Jar-Jar Binks and poop jokes abound, it only proves to show that Star Wars has no idea who they're target audiance is. Two movies later, the main character will be killing children, will lose all of his limbs and have the flesh burnt from his body.It's a non-stop parade of characters from the original trilogy because this movie simply cannot stand on it's own. The acting, dialogue, editing, and plot are terrible beyond words. The movie is filler, and nothing else. They wanted to show Anakin joining the Jedi Order and he didn't do anything important until he was a Jedi Knight. Rather than skip ahead ten years he decided to waste our time with trade routes, a half-baked droid army scheme, \\"slap stick\\" antics and a constant barrage of puns."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a shame","review":"man, what a letdown, a truly terrible movie, it seemed to cater to little kids. someone tell george lucas that with a computer you can type up a good story as well as make all these crazy worlds and flying things. jar jar was a terrible idea, the whole thing was and is a complete disaster!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Beginning","review":"I have always enjoyed the Star Wars universe, and The Phantom Menace is no exception.

The computer graphics used in this film looked really phony, and I think the special effects from the old Star Wars films are far better.

The worse of course, was Jar Jar Binks and all it's tribes... simply annoying, stupid and disturbing. The pod racer has great effects but i felt on a children movie with the two head creature narrator making jokes all the time, Java getting sleep and all sort of silly jokes.Don't know what Lucas had in mind, but the history was the last anyway; is like the ending of the Return of the Jedi, too much idiot creatures (the ewoks) doing silly jokes and less smart and interesting dialogs.

Most critics didn't understand when reviewing this that Star Wars is space FANTASY, not true science fiction; it is not supposed to be hip, self-conscious, or noirish. The story glides along at a fairly relaxing pace--although there are still good action sequences, I was more entranced by the stunning artistic visions of new planets, creatures, costumes, etc. As eye candy with an undercurrent of political intrigue, the film is near-perfect. And of course John Williams' music is excellent.Small complaints: Trade Federation creatures should have their own language, not an East Asian accent, and the boy who plays Anakin was not the best choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time..","review":"If I could've given it a zero I would've.. I loved the first 3 Star Wars flicks but this one has none of the suspense, charm and fun of the others. I wish they would've spent more time developing the storyline and characters rather than the special effects. Sometimes more is just more, not better..That's the problem with hollywood these days, they feel that they have push the envelope with explosions, chase scenes and graphics in order to keep us interested and to spend our hard earned money at the theaters. Then again, like everything else, it's supply and demand.... Maybe it says more about society today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like Disney \\"done it\\"","review":"Well like others who miss the orignal star wars I can finally pronounce this one DOV (dead on viewing) it seems like Disney got hold of this one and made it \\"cuter\\" sure it trys to appeal to everyone cute aliens,mystical message and all that but nothing about this could really hold my attention.

The plot is nearly non-existent, and the character development is even worse (for instance, Darth Maul is a central character, but there is no explanation of who he is; rather, he just shows up every once in a while for a fight scene or to simply look mean, imposing, and powerful).I prefer streetbrawls.com that has the real action.

In fact, I hadn't even seen the other 3 movies before I saw this one. I LOVED IT. Natalie Portman did a wonderful job. All the other actors were also good, I thought, except Anakin. He was really cheesy in places. Personally, I don't even find Jar-Jar as annoying as the rest of the world. He wasn't my favorite character, but I don't want to gun him down either.

I will say that I was slightly disapointed. Two days later, I went back and bought the collectors widescreen edition. This format is the way the movie should be seen. The standard format, cuts out a lot of the action that takes place on the sides of the screen. The widescreen is exactly the way it appeared in the theater, so you see all the action that is on the sides of the screen, and better than the standard format. Plus with the collectors edition you get a book and film strip which are not in the standard edition. So if you have the extra fifteen dollars, get the collectors edition. If not, the standard edition is still a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as the critics say","review":"I looked in the newspapers when this came out and out of about ten reviews I saw, two gave it an average mark, one of those giving it a pretty good mark, four out of five stars. I think though the newspapers have got it all wrong, this movie is ok, there is a lot of action and the plot is fine, nothing special but far from bad. George Lucas made this movie so you would look at Darth Vader in the 'classic' trilogy and say 'he isn't really so bad after all.' He made this movie so you could see what Anakin was like before the Dark Side of the Force swallowed him. The movie achieves this and is a lot of fun to watch as well, so in my view this is a good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie... not great, but still good.","review":"I liked the movie.

I remember seeing this in the theater, everyone was all into it until Jar Jar showed up, then he never left, then nobody cared anymore except for the very few scenes with Darth Maul.

George... how much money can you possibly make for a single film? Star Wars (on video), Star Wars Wide Screen Edition, Star Wars (on Laser disc), Star Wars the special edition, ALL the sequels and in all formats.

There was some funny dialogue, and while the scenic graphics were best seen in the theater, I thought the computer-generated characters actually translated better to the small screen.

We got to see the future connection between Palpatine and young Skywalker. Did anyone catch the fact the Skywalker was caring and kind as a child? We all know what he becomes later on. This alone will make me anticipate the next two movies to see how he becomes so \\"twisted and evil\\".

I think he'll consider it too immature for him by the time he turns 3. The comic-relief buffoon Jar Jar Binks is so annoying, he completely overrides whatever is good about this overlong, very boring film. Unfortunately, if you are a Star Wars fan, it's pretty hard to avoid this movie and just jump straight ahead to the next episode.

I would have preffered to give this movie a negative score, but I can't find a way to make this stupid thing do that!In the original Star Wars, there is suspence and drama because we are given a chance to know and care about the characters. Special effects are tools of the trade, used to aid in the telling of the story. It seems that the new trend is to come up with some really \\"cool\\" special effects, then string them together with bad dialogue and call it a movie. Maybe we (the movie-going public) should petition George Lucas (and the Wachowski brothers too, while we're at it) to just stop. Star Wars: Episodes I and II both SUCK.

Movie making is surpose to be about acting, man made special effects that show talent and hard work and real settings all make up a real movie. But this piece... with it's computer generated effects is the ultimate of low class and i'm sorry to say should be totally beneath you. Where was the acting? Was it the special effects or the actors that you wanted to see? We as humans are beginning to look more at special effects than actors that have acting ability. Is this all part of the dumbing down of America? This film is worthless and has no artistic value what so ever.

OK, the queen had potential, but she's supposed to be two years apart from that seven year old and they're going to be getting married? I don't think so! The plot is non-existent, the acting pitiful and really the whole thing is just set up for the next movie. There are no strong actors and no human actors period of note. Hans Solo, Luke, Darth Vadar...we get the point, were what made first movie and you'll be sorely let down if that's what you watch this for.

That is all that it has going for it. The only character worth developing was Darth Maul whose limited screen time made me pine for more.

It was totally directed to the way younger audience that could still laugh at characters like Jar Jar. The fx were amazing but the movie itself stunk. Infact, the only reason I'm giving this movie 2 stars is because of the special effects. I'm sure many star wars fans have clouded their minds to think that this was a great movie so that all that waiting and money spending didn't go to waste.

Lucas expected his dazzling special effects to save this piece of garbage. Sorry, George, you'll have to do better. This so-called \\"great movie\\" is nothing more than a disgrace to the original trilogy. I loved the first three parts-why did Lucas have to ruin it with this? In the trilogy, the acting, storyline, and characters were much more appealing. In Episode 1, the characters where annoying and mediocre at best. Most of the people on this page who are posting 5-star reviews are just some Star Wars nerds-the kind who camp out by the entrance of the movie theater in Star Wars costumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"But for the special features, Just Plain Bad","review":"This movie had one moment that I loved: the lightsaber duel... which is why this rates more than one star.I was mightily dissapointed with this movie, and I could go on and on about contrived plots and love stories, purile dialogue, and gungans who could insult the intelligence of a horsefly... but I wont.The DVD in itself was very well made, worthy of the LucasArts logo.But (and maybe I was expecting too much), I found the movie uninteresting, the stakes not high enough, and I didnt care if any character lived or died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Bad, actually...","review":"Star Wars fans waited 16 years for this film, but unfortunately it was not worth the wait. The old Star Wars films were by no means masterpieces of modern cinema, but they were still fairly good and very entertaining. This film, however, is just plain bad. The story is boring and the characters are for the most part weak and one-dimensional (I'll not even begin to discuss Jar Jar Binks). Furthermore, the script is perhaps one of the worst ever written for a major blockbuster. It has been said that the purpose of this film was to set up episodes 2 & 3, but that does not justify making something this poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas should leave screenwriting to someone else","review":"The visual of this movie is so meticulously constructed the it made me twice as sad to see the story and screenwriting skill is only third graded. Where is the tension in plot? Do we care about the characters and what is happening? I remember watching the underwater scene and was quite fascinated by the beauty of the transparent palace or whatever you called it...then I fell asleep. Watching this movie is like staring at a beautiful piece of oil painting for more than 2 hours straight; one can't been blamed for falling asleep once or more along the way. This film should be cut into a 3 minute trailer, because lets admit that a trailer is what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Episode I \\"The Phantom Menace\\"","review":"The wait is over. I thought we would have to wait until Episode III was released to get all of these great films on DVD. Even though Episode I is the only title being released, it's still better than none at all. Bravo to George Lucas. The Star Wars release party is already in early planning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally on DVD!!!!","review":"Its good to see the Phantom Menace on DVD. This disc is worth its cheap price for the extras alone. Mr. Lucas finally delivered and did he ever to the tune of a few hours of extra stuff. He even went back and re-did special effects and sequences he cut-out for the theatrical release.I know everyone slammed this movie, but its not all that bad. Actually, its a fun ride in familiar territory. Here's looking forward to Ep. 2 come May 2002."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every saga has a beginning . . .","review":"This movie is great. A wonderful introduction to the Skywalker family and the Star Wars Saga. It was fun and made you cringe when you remembered this cute boy who saves the day becomes Darth Vader. Here's the deal though: much like A New Hope was told from the point-of-view of a naive farm boy, Episode I is told from the point-of-view of a 9 year old ex-slave. It is about a 9 year old boy. It contains a lot of stuff 9 year old boys would enjoy. Embrace this and you will love the movie. I know I did, and I am not a 9 year old boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than I'd except!!!","review":"I'm suprised at this movie. I was realy cheesed off. I thought this would be some great scifi drama like the last 3. You could call this a kids movie practicly. In the movie the good guys will only nuetrilise threats if they our non living. Naboo all they talk about is we must realy on negotioations. Even when the power is out. There was no siege at all they didn't even go down figting on there own. It reminds reminds me of the halacust. They dont't even pick up a laser until the Jedis come."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarassment to what was once a great trilogy","review":"What was originally a brilliantly all-inclusive sci-fi epic has become just another vehicle for selling toys and posters to teenagers. Did this series really need poop jokes, or an hour-long go-kart-on-spped race scene? Though visually stunning at times, this movie is a sad disappointment, destroying what could have been an amazing opportunity to continue a powerful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The future is clouded...","review":"Phantom Menace makes no sense if one looks at the surface. The film has virtually nothing to do at all with the Trade Federation or the invasion of Naboo. But when one realizes that the conniving and evil Senator Palpatine is orchestrating the whole thing (including a full-scale invasion of his own planet) in order to become Chancellor, destroy the Jedi, and form the first Galactic Empire, then the film becomes a somewhat horrifying and very interesting introduction to the Star Wars saga. If one looks at the surface, disappointment and confusion ensues. If one reads between the lines, the story becomes clear (and quite entertaining). It is no accident that this least-understood of all Star Wars films is entitled \\"The PHANTOM Menace.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's not be too critical...","review":"One of the biggest complaints against this movie has been its \\"terrible script\\" and predictable plot. Because the other three Star Wars movies have been accepted into the canon of classic pictures, we have a tendency to judge this movie a little more harshly than we should.The first three movies produced, in my opinion, were, at times, corny and predictable as well, but I still liked them a lot. The music in this movie was amazing (I don't know where John Williams continues to get ideas from after all these years), the casting was excellent, and the story was somewhat intriguing. I'm eagerly awaiting the releases of the next two, just to see how everything worked out between Episode I and Episode IV.There was, however, one huge mistake in this movie: Jar Jar Binks."},{"rating":"1","title":"utter junk","review":"i could hardly make it past 10 minutes of this movie. the original 3 star wars were bad enough, but this one now adds the fact that they can be pompous because it's 25 years later and they're all rich. steer clear at all coststhe only thing of note are some of the all CGI battle sequences. everything else is for waste"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE!","review":"This is the GREATEST MOVIE EVER! Man you all need to go and see it or buy it on tape. Most people love it but some don't but you know what! Forget the people who have bad reviews on it. This movie has a GREAT plot! It is loaded with dramatic, fast past, fantastic CGI, and so on. WOW is all I have to say. I have been a Star Wars fan my entire life and the movies keep on getting better. Admit it (the people that put it down) you all know you loved it. I think that these people didn't like the hip and hated the movie for that. Oh well at least I liked it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now we are getting mad!","review":"Star Wars is one of the most lamest, overrated films in history much like Lord of the Good 'Ol Ringos. Same goes for this.What is it with trilogies? They are pointless, usless things to make people anticipate the next film and trick you into believing in something that is not there.First off, let me say, if a human being can comprehend the storywithin this movie, kudos to them. On the otherhand, kill themoff so a movie like this will never exist again.To boot, every actor in here is annyoing as can be. I never like Liam, and I think it would take a lot to make me. Ewan is ugly,and that goes for the Portman chick as well. I don't mean to be shallow, but hey, if you can't stand to look at the actors what is the point?The film never ceases. End already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Star Wars yet!","review":"This movie is truely amazing. It got bad reviews but this is only the beginning, the first 1/6 of a 12 hour saga! The effects were absolutely breath-taking and the story was awesome, add that to the amazing lightsabre duel at the end and you've got a very special movie.P.S. - To all of you who hated TPM:Lucus will redeem himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching paint dry...","review":"With the exception of some exciting scenes (pod race, light saber fight), this movie was a disappointment. The potential was there, but it turned out to be a real snoozer. The special effects are first rate, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"Okay, there are those of us who hate this movie (me included). Then there are the people who tell us it wasn't that bad (usually not Star Wars fans). I understand that expectations were high. Basically what it boils down to is that if this was the first movie released instead of Star Wars (Yes, that's the name. NOT A New Hope), would people really think it was any good? Probably not. Would it spawn any sequels? Probably not. I really tried to like this movie for months, but when I ask myself those questions, I realize that this was a really bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Jar Jar gets deleted, I'll buy a copy","review":"My title says it all - If Jar Jar gets deleted, I'll buy a copy.I've seen the original 3 Star Wars movies multiple dozens of times each, and saw Phantom Menace twice (once on opening day, because I used to believe in George Lucas, and again several days later just in case I had hallucinated how bad Jar Jar stunk up the entire movie).Jar Jar wasn't the only bad part of the movie, but with him it is totally un-watchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Upgraded","review":"A Prequel must move us from a trilogy that I watched from start to finish over 30 times and fit into the sequence as smoothly as possible. The Phantom Menace did that for me. Yes, there was some lack of a specific villian but it had to tie back into the trilogy and get us back to Darth Vader. We're there and ready for the next action packed movie. I intend to buy this on DVD and suggest that you consider the same action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantastic film","review":"This was the movie of 1999. Im glad to see that we ended the millenium with one of the greatest prequels of all time(one of the only prequels of all time). I expected a movie which did not encapsulate the mood and feeling of the previous Lucas masterpieces. Not only did it exceed these expectations but it went one stage further, it had the force. Being the author of many books and journals on Star Wars and Lucas's previous works i feel that he has opened up the Star Wars epic to a new generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace","review":"Don't get the 'regular' cropped screen version. Other reviews you may have read warn of this tragic viewing experience. Only the wide-screen version will do. I was very upset at the cropped version which I viewed the other night. Don't waist your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Rules!","review":"This movie deserves even 6 stars. This first episode set up everything for the upcoming 2 movies. The special effects were awesome, and also it makes you wonder how this sweet Anakin boy turns to be one of the galaxy's worst nightmare. The final battle between the Jedis and the Sith is one of the best battle scenes ever filmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring mess","review":"I for one was very dissapointed with this first in the prequel trilogy in the Star Wars saga.To me, \\"Phantom Menace\\" is just a mess of bad script writing, weak acting by the cast, and just mediocre dialog. The storyline was weak and sadly, \\"Phantom Menace\\" damaged my faith in the Star Wars prequel trilogy until \\"Attack Of The Clones\\" came along.The Pod Race scene though in my opinion was extremely awesome and saved \\"Phantom Menace\\" from hitting the bottom of the garbage can.Still though, overall, \\"Phantom Menace\\" in my opinion, adds nothing to the legendary Star Wars saga.Things though got back on track with the vastly superior \\"Attack Of The Clones\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice effects, terrible script and acting","review":"After 16 years, Star Wars fans finally got the first episode proper of the popular film franchise. Sadly, it failed to deliver on nearly every front. While Lucas' special effects are once again top-notch(although many other movies nowadays have equal or better effects), the screenplay and acting performances are insultingly bad. Okay, so the only Star wars actor/actress to ever be above DUD is Alec Guinness(and Jar Jar Binks gives the most convincing performance in this movie), but the script here is offensive. We have stereotypical charcters representing Asians, Jews, etc. and the whole thing is rather offensive. I'll give it two stars for great effects, but it really detracts rather than adds to the Star Wars legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, so so DVD","review":"The movie I'd already owned, in VHS format. I liked the movie. I think this trilogy is less about the characters and more about the world that they live in, and thus the movies focus on that. Also, it's about an 8 year old boy - so it's written that way. It's not nessisarily an adult movie. And when I look at these facts, it becomes a better one for me. I was vaguely dissapointed that there wern't more cool features that came with the DVD, but just getting it was enough for me. I figure when he releases all 6 in 2015 (my safe estimate!) it will be a vast improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember - It's Just A Movie","review":"Let's remember what Lucas said in an interview shortly after the release of Phantom Menance - \\"it's just a movie\\". Do I miss Luke and Han? Yes, of course. Remember though that this film is set forty years before \\"A New Hope\\". Lucas is trying to lay down the events that led to the other films and is building a groundwork for the next two installments. If you have to think a little and mentally \\"connect the dots\\" well, I think that makes for a better story (like a good book) - not everything is laid out for you and you are forced to read between the lines (kind of like watching office politics). I'd see the film again. The special effects and the soundtrack were fantastic. I'm buying the video in widescreen (I wish it was on DVD). I can't wait to see how the rest of the story unfolds. Please, no more Jar Jar, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad there is not a negetive five star rating.","review":"Boy did that stink!I agree with one of the previous reviews,it should be terminated,with extreme prejudice (killed). This should get negetive five star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does anyone remember when Star Wars was cool","review":"Truely, What the heck happen here. You've all seen it so I don't have to go into great detail. I'm just bitter is all. It's like some evil version of George Lucas came out of his twenty year hibernation with the soul intention of destroying all that was good from our childhoods. For those of you who were born after Star Wars maybe you don't understand, they were not just movies. They were myths and legends and they helped form our imaginations. Good versus evil, adventure and excitement, we sought these through these movie even if jedi should not. Now, we get Jar Jar, Metaclorians and a childrens book plot. George, I know you are rich and powerful in this life but, for what you have done, I hope there is a power greater than us that will make you suffer in the next life."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE","review":"Where to start. I cannot imagine this movie being worse. Did a monkey write the script? Could the acting be more amatuerish? The Jar-Jar Binks character is an absolute abomination, and the perfect descendant of those ridiculous creatures from \\"Return of the Jedi,\\" which looks like \\"Citizen Kane\\" compared to this joke of a movie. An utter travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best STAR WARS movie yet!","review":"That is all I have to say.

It's a \\"comic\\" without the \\"relief\\" in it. Because this movie is nothing but a comic horror, and a boring one at that. Thank God for Star Wars: Clone Wars, because this pile of junk wasn't the force worthy. Horrible acting, horrible plot, horrible computer graphics, horrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD as a DVD","review":"As others have pointed out, the DVD itself is spectacular. The menus are animated with movie sequences, it's loaded with extras that are actually interesting (though a lot of them were taken from the starwars.com website). The transfer is beautiful, the sound is the kind that makes you want to run out to your local stereo store with someone else's credit card.As for the movie itself... what needs to be said? It has some serious flaws, but I have to say that the first few minutes had me feeling like a seven year old again, watching with awe. Then Jar-Jar showed up and the awe vanished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jar-Jar Binks leads the dissapointment","review":"I love Star Wars, saw the Phantom Menace at Universal Studious Cinemas, California, when it was release on the first day. The supposedly great computer generated special effects made the film look like a cheesy computer game. Worst of all, Jar-Jar Binks was so annoying and I certainly feel that Darth Mau would have immediately increase the rating on the film if he would have cut Jar-Jar into pieces in the first scene. They no longer do things like they used to, in terms of quality. The first 3 Starwars film will always be great, however, Episod 1 is certainly a Menace for the Star Wars collection. Hopefully Episod 2 is a lot better, I am certainly not looking forward to seeing Jar-Jar, unless of course it involves the new Darth Mau doing us a favour, sending him back to where he came from, below ground level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drinking Problem Meets Star Wars.","review":"Jar Jar Binks. A fine idea: introduce a character who is so aggravating and without purpose that only a terrible case of amnesia would alleviate our pain. Clearly a cheap sequel, why did we expect otherwise? We Foolish Fans. George, I want my money back. On second thought, if this lightweight excuse for a movie is evidence of a drinking problem you may have developed, perhaps you can use my $7.50 along with everyone elses to pay for a quality treatment center. Let's just hope their treatment of you is better than your treatment of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Padme Needs a new Hairdresser!","review":"Padme really needs a new hairdresser. In certain scenes, her hair looks like a paint brush. Obi-Wan has problems, and a really heavy Scottish accent... \\"Blast us into oblivion\\", if anyone who has seen the movie remembers that scene, they'll know what I'm talking about. The boy who plays Anakin can't act at all. He is a really annoying brat! They should have used Hayley Joel Osmond from 'The Sixth Sense'. There is no blood in this movie like in the original trilogy...and almost no concept to the story. It is not developed fully.~White BirdP.S. What did they do to Obi-Wan in Episode II? He looks 45 years old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"I thought this movie was better than the other prequels because alot of real environments were used (such as Mos Espa) rather than green screens.Although using computer graphics for the droids may have been cool in 1999; today the computer models look worse than in some video games I've played.I think everyone agrees this movie could have been better, and more could have been done with Darth Maul, however I still think its a pretty cool movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of 1999!","review":"The most anticipated movie of the year or should I say the past twenty years, was nothing more than a spectacle of computer imagery (even though the Matrix got the Oscar for special effects). Jar Jar Binks was nothing more than an annoying stereotype. I couldn't stand the fact that they made Anakin Skywalker a \\"Christ-like\\" figure, and the fact that they called him Annie was just outright appolling. And the fact that the Force isn't a spiritual enlightment, but rather micro-organisms swimming in the bloodstream makes it seem like you'd need a vaccine rather than see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"technical brilliance, terrible script","review":"Despite incredible CG and the definitive example of how audio post is DONE in the pod-race scene, this movie was the worst I'd seen since Godzilla. I suppose we should have seen it coming after Lucas emasculated episode IV in his \\"special edition\\" fiasco: Greeto shoots first? Lucas is an excellent movie producer, his company defines the state of the art in effects and sound, but he should leave the writing to Kasdan, et al. \\"Yippee!\\" - enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a galaxy far far away things got lame!","review":"Well now, I've given this movie 4 chances now.

Jar-Jar, 2 lines of dialogue from Darth Maul, Anakin accidently blowing up almost all the bad guys, and THE FORCE actually being little bugs that control things. Add that to the astounding coincidences. Anakin built C3P0, who will apparently forget about Anakin and Obi-Wan by Episode IV. Obi-Wan will also forget about R2-D2, who saved him and others by repairing the ship. I won't go on lest I annoy myself more.It was the most complete and total shattering of everything about the previous movies that I held dear. As for this being for the kids, bollocks to that. The first three movies, particularly Empire, were dark, witty, lively, and just plain fun. I can still watch them today without ever wincing in pain at a line of dialogue like \\"Exsqueeze me!\\" Thank you Jar Jar."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment...","review":"I went expecting a continuation of the gritty, flawed, \\"deep\\" star wars we all grew up on.Instead we got a wise cracking, THING that did nothing but distract from the other characters.

Only good thing I have to say is maybe now Lucas will release the original 3 episodes on DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"more then a decade of waiting for this ?!","review":"This movie has it all : ACTION , BIG stars , EXPENSIVE & STUNNING special effects and somehow it doesn't come to be this great movie I've expected it to be .. maybe it is the somewhat childish script and acting ( of Jar-Jar and other CG carachters ) which isn't convincing . While I enjoy watching the 1st trilogy over and over I wouldn't watch this one again ."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I am a huge Star Wars fan, but I found this movie very disappointing. The movie didn't make any sense to me, until I read some of the preliminary writing for the movie (which I read after seeing it).

I prefer watching DVD & Laser Discs on my Mitsubishi 16:9 home theater with my 151 lb Rotweiller by my side. Both Dusty & I were very disappointed in the Phantom Menace in VHS letterbox. Aside from the weak plot, the unrealistic special effects were the biggest let down. Many of the computer generated scenes were inferior to those of the average computer game & reminded me of bad comic book art. The sound was also not up to par. Dusty slept through the entire show without stiring. He usually interacts with most DVD releases, i.e., trying to look behind the screen, perking his ears at the surround sound, & sometimes charging outside to repell imagined trespassers. George Lucas was right not to release on DVD. The flaws in \\"The Phantom Menace\\" are apalling enough on VHS! In my opinion, this is the worst \\"Star Wars\\" installment to date!

I find it offensive that someone could actually think that this piece of over-hyped, 100% special effects, worthless piece of trash could EVER come close to the original trilogy. There was no story, no development of plot and horrible acting. Character development (ESPECIALLY that of Darth Maul) was nonexistent. Jar-Jar was an unnecessary addition. It seems like the whole movie was made on a computer. When other movies not carrying the Star Wars name are made like this, they are laughed at. Count me out from the people in line to see Episode 2: The Garbage Continues. Lucas peaked when he made Return of the Jedi, which is in my opinion the best and only great Star Wars movie. I give one star for the mere fact that Lucas was brave enough to send this piece of trash into the world. The Star Wars saga as we know it ended in 1982. No SW movie will EVER come close to ROTJ."},{"rating":"1","title":"The thrill is gone...","review":"The Phantom Menace, which carried the hopes of so many Star Wars fans, was a dissappointing on many levels. The acting is merely mediocre, with the exception of Liam Neeson who is the films only redeeming feature. The overload of digital material also destroys the magic that was present in the other films. So what if the characters in the older films were people in rubber suits? At least there was something real about them. This film gives you the feeling that you are watching a computer game, therefore there is no attachment to any character. All of the grandiose ideas of what the Jedi order may have been like are also shattered in this story. This film may be appealing to the up and coming generation with its glossy images and lack of intellect, however, the fans of the original trilogy, like myself will not experience the old \\"magic\\" with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie","review":"This movie was good and very entertaining.

Sure, we may have missed some of the jokes and misunderstood the characters when we were younger but understanding it now makes the movies worth watching over and over again. Episode 1 on the other hand is a feel good kids movie with about as much depth and intellegence as a McDonalds kiddie soda. McD's should come up with their own marketable character rather than making Star Wars enthusiasts suffer through the idiotic ramblings of JarJar Binks. This movie is a short sighted sell out. I hope the chocolate shakes and stuffed animals George Lucas sold on this one made him a fat profit because this movie has no place in an adult's movie collection. Hold onto your money, rent this one if you must see it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Disappointment","review":"I was waiting in anticipation for this movie to come out and was one of the first in the world to see it. But sadly within 10 minutes into the film I was horribly saddened to see that Lucas has turned this film into a childrens movie. Something that should be seen on Disney. Horrible characters, just plain horrible. Ruined the film completely. Jar-Jar Binks was the worst. Just to hear the name sends me into a state of depression. I sure hope for his next film he rethinks how he is going to display his characters.There was no sence of deepness to this film. A five year old child could tell me what everything meant and what the end result would be. Bad. Bad. Bad. I would have rated this film zero stars but I must admit the effects were rather nice.

However, the movie is a huge disapointment. Granted, the special effects and ship and creature designs are excellent, but there are just too many things wrong with the film. Can you explain to me how every single character can act as bad as they did? The young Vader couldn't act out of a paper bag, Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character in the entire Star Wars universe, and Ben Kenobi tried too hard to live up to his name. Its too bad that Darth Maul didn't have a bigger role. His fight scenes were amazing, but we knew next to nothing about him. Maybe Lucas will take note and try a little harder on Episode II. This movie proved that he is not the absolute genius that some people think he is. How will he screw up next? Stay tuned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is its own story. Get over it.","review":"I agree with Timothy below. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Darth Maul is outstanding, and I'm sure Lucas has many equally sinister characters yet to come in this series. Jar-Jar Binks has been taking a lot of understandable flack, but I saw this film 5 times in the theater, and I grew to understand his ways and speech better with every viewing. Yikes, do I dare say I even liked him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no turning back from Jar-Jar.","review":"Can special effects be the entire movie? The actual stars (Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, and Natalie Portman) definately weren't selling the picture. And that is a big part of the problem as to why \\"Star Wars: Epiosde 1\\" wasn't good, the other three Star Wars movies didn't use big film stars and they were great successes. The casting, storyline, and over use of visual effects made this film such a dissapointment. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if it didn't have so much to live up to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! Love it! Love it!","review":"I have to be honest I was not to keen on this movie at first but after watch it two times it was fantastic sure it had it problems but that only leaves room for imporvment I must have seen seen it 5 times when I got It. I think to many people act like crtics when it comes to this movie I think they should just sit back and enjoy it for what it is not what it can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it ought to be","review":"Coming after (well, actually before...) 3 more or less great episodes in the saga, my expectation were very high. And were sadly disappointed. Episode 1 complitely miss the point. Star Wars is an objet of cult, is a mithology. Used to have humour style and class. Non e of which can be found here. It's hollow. Empty, no soul. And finally we are explained what the force is. The result of I don't want to know what process happening in tiny organism inside our blood. I though you needed a jedi master to control the force. I was obvously wrong. Better resort to an emathologist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This was truly bad. Unlike the early Star Wars, where the various characters provided background information, the special effects (which were really good) seem designed to make a coherent story line superfluous. Liam Neeson was the biggest disappointment for me. He wasn't acting, he was just letting the Force handle it for him. I hope the next two (promised?) Star Wars are better, but I won't hold my breath. Since (and counting) Return of the Jedi, they seem like an expensive advertisement for some new doll, game or accessory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars is back!","review":"Well, what can I say? Storyline wise this is an inventive and origonal peice of cinematic brilliance. The special effects were great, with the Pod-Racing scene being the most absorbing. The acting by Liam Neeson and Ray Park was convincing and realistic, and it finished with a cliff-hanger! If you haven't seen it, WHY? One of last years best films. Brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Jedi Battle.....","review":"If you like special effects and want to see THE best Jedi fight of all the Star Wars movies , then I recommend buying the movie.Otherwise, just wait until it comes out on HBO and they give it 50 times a week.It's not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIME WELL SPENT","review":"I'TS A GOOD MOVIE, YOU HAVE THE CLASSIC ELEMENTS OF GOOD AND EVIL, AND WE ALL READY KNOW HOW THE STORY ENDS, GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS AND A GOOD STORY, HOW MANY MOVIES CAN YOU SAY THAT ABOUT? WORTH EVERY PENNY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop these, why do you insist on it??","review":"just a message to Goerge Lucas asking him, why do you insist on continuing these story..!???, YES star wars was marveleous, (at its time of production) and it is still so good now to watch, and the following two parts \\"the Empire strikes back\\" and \\"Return of the Jedi\\" was compatible with the First version and were suitable to be produced, but now, \\"the phantom menace\\" is so so ordinary, these kind of movies is not suitable at all for our time, the movie production technology is very high now, we dont need more space movies, the star wars triology is spectacular, it was unique and ...stop... any thing more will be so poor in comparison with the first one, pleeeeeaase, stop it Mr. Lucas, dont ruin what you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS FILM IS A LETDOWN","review":"The main problem with the movie is Jar Jar Binks. There is no getting around it. Millions of people hate his rubber guts. He was given so much unfunny screen time that I won't be satisfied with Episode 2 unless those ...clones roast him alive on a spit....P>While EP1 isn't a terrible movie, its inferiority to the original trilogy is apparent if you watch this, then watch the originals. Sure, there is a certain amount of Geroge Lucas goofiness that is part and parcel with the Star Wars universe. Put in simple terms, the first three films were consistently fun, exciting and action-packed entertainment. EP1 is even flashier but is nowhere near as consistently fun... most of the movie seems to be either the plot exposition and set-up for the NEXT movie, or soul-robbing screen time for Jar Jar."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this...","review":"I can't believe that the most eagerly awaited movie of all time is such a waste of your time, everyone thought that it was going to be almost a religious experience, something close to what the first three movies (ROTJ weakest but it had it's high points). This is the movie that had the potential to beat Titanic from the #1 position, this was going to be something historical, something to be remembered, but nope, Lucas probably gave his old ideas from the 70s to someone to write the script for him, he filmed it and later sent it to his team at ILM, and guess what something mutated with muppets movies, star wars and Roger Rabbit came out, dissapointed millions of fans and made little kids crazy for stupid characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is definetely the most dissapointing movie of all time. The storyline is dull and not enjoyable to follow. The characters arnt great and help to add to the overall corney feeling of the movie. Theres a half hour pod racing sequence that just slows down the movie and you may fall asleep during. I realize that since this is a \\"star wars\\" I probably rate it more harshly then other movies but still, this movie was in the works for years and it would of been better left on the drawing board. I will never go to see episode 2 or 3 as this is a clear indication of the direction of these prequels. Stick to the original Star Wars movies, \\"Episode I\\" does absolutely nothing possitive for the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is for children.","review":"'The Phantom Menace' was BAD movie. I saw it in the theaters when it first came out and I almost fell asleep. That's how pathetic it was. This movie is really for children. If you think otherwise, you should have your head examined."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Lucas hath blown his reputation on this one","review":"George Lucas, Inc. has just showed how farhe will go to make a few extra million for his empire (yes, kids, George Lucas is on the Dark Side). This was the most garbage pulled together into 2 and 1/2 hours since B-movies were in theirhaydey. A cast devoid of any character and personality, unconvincing computer generated special effects, and a trite science fiction plot leave this movie with few redeeming qualities.This is an excellent case study for business school school students interested in marketing: A prime example of brilliant marketing of a mediochre product. Therein lies the talent of George Lucas ,et al. Only Disney could compete with George Lucas for such sheer marketing gimickry.Yes. we have every right to be bitter with George Lucas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"May the force be a load of junk","review":"I hate this film more than any other film I have ever seen. The dialog is some of the worst I've ever heard, I have never known any kids to ever say \\"yippee\\" at all, yet Jake Lloyd say it twice in less than two hours. I think every one knows that Ewan McGregor is a good actor, you would only have to see Trainspotting to confirm that, but he looks lost in this film, the same as I felt when I was watching this...Lucas has tried to defend this film by saying \\"its for kids\\" well that still doesn't get rid of the bad acting, weak script, flat direction and special fx which are far from special - it just makes it [bad] kids film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it looks like cow dung, smells like cow dung...","review":"A horrible, unnecessary waste of time, talent, and money. All of the special feature books and DVD extra features are not worth the price of having to sit through this painful exercise in patience. This is a mess -- period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest dissapointment in History","review":"When I first saw Episode 1 in the theaters back in '99 I was dissapointed. When I first saw the Star Wars Trilogy in the special edition, it was my favorite set of sci-fi movies (with the exception of episode VI). Every character in Episode 1 cannot act. Ewan Mcgregor and Liam Neeson seem like they're bored. Shouldn't they be excited that they're starring in STAR WARS???? The worst performances in the film would have to go to that little boy playing Anakin. By far the worst performance EVER in a star wars film. Hell, I CAN even act better. Episode 1 has lots of special effects and CGI, WAY TOO MUCH OF THEM. It's like watching a very beautiful playstation game. The script was also poorly written. It's like Lucas wrote it in his spare time. The only decent performance probably goes to Darth Maul, who doesn't even have any lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I am a huge Star Wars fan, and I can tell you this one was as good as Return of the Jedi! nuff said"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good special effect's, bad movie.","review":"The acting in this movie was very bad. My favorit charictor in the movie was Jar Jar Binks, but even his ears went through people because the acter's never even stoped to look at how to do this. A discrase to Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"star bores 1","review":"where's the plot? prequels don't make since as far as story development. we alreay know the important stuff, so why take us backwards and force us to watch it. i'll tell you why... easy money. it is obvious luca$ doesn't have anywhere to go with this storyline. i will admit that the special effects were good and john williams still has it but, i would only buy this if it were on dvd. sorry george, not interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment for the whole family","review":"The Star Wars movies are made so that the whole family can watch and enjoy and Episode 1 carries on that tradition. It proably could have been alot more if there was more action and violence but that was and is not the point to these movies. The story is an excellent precursor to the setting up of the rest of the series and the action is very well balanced against the rest of the storyline. Darth Maul made an excellent villian, even though it was a rather short career. Overall the movie has an excellent blend of action, humor, and plot to keep the whole family entertained and the special effects are top notch. This is a great family movie, there is a good lesson within the story, and I would recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible shame","review":"I think Lucas was just too big a man in Hollywood. Rather than a collaboration of talent as in the original trilogy, you get Lucas doing what he alone wanted, with nothing but yes-men and admirers to get advice from. A terrible shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the original trilogy, but still Star Wars","review":"If not for Jar Jar Binks, i would have given this a 5, but the only let down for this movie was Jar Jar, it is nice that George Lucas decided to go back and start from the begining since he has actually planed it this way when he sat down and started creating Star Wars, but come on George what's up with Jar Jar. Overall good addition to the Star Wars movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie!","review":"As a loyal Star Wars fan, I eagerly awaited the release of Episode I. George Lucas did not disappoint me. The effects were out-of-this-world. The scene in the planet's core was awesome. Obi-Wan was hot, and Anakin Skywalker was a doll."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was boring and I couldn't follow the story","review":"This was a terrible movie. Technologically, it was kind of cool - and I liked the princess's costumes - but the story line was awful. The ultimate postmodern experience - all form and glitz, with no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great graphics - flat sound","review":"I never thought that I would find myself giving a Star Wars film only two stars. I bought this movie at Amazon in the UK. Unless you have THX for the sound (and I don't know anyone here who does) the sound is a big disappointment. My Dolby Surround Sound sat silently twiddling its thumbs, making the whole experience flat. With the effects removed the movie has nothing, and relies entirely on the hype from the first three. I'm a BIG Star wars fan and was very disappointed. The Jar Jar Binks character needs to be ditched quickly, in order to retrieve the respect that the original triology has. Lucas could have done a better job with Big Bird. I hope that George Lucas tries to go for story quality, rather than easy bucks with the next episode. He can only try to fool the fans once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Is Missing!","review":"Let me start off by saying that The Phantom Menace is an OK movie. Sure the graphics are amazing in this movie, but doesn't it seem that it might get a little boring if the special effects swallow the almost the WHOLE MOVIE?! There were not those suspenseful, dramatic, romantic parts in this movie. Take The Empire Strikes Back for instance. It was made in 1980 when there wasn't near the technology for special effects then, and STILL it was one of the most popular movies OF ALL TIME! So does there have to be that many computerized stuff in a movie to make it great? To me, there were too many annoying characters (Jar Jar Binks). If you are in to the special effects of the movie this IS the movie for you. If you are like me and actually want to have a good story in a movie, watch the original trilogy. They need to spend more time thinking of the story rather than finding effects that would impress the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Force, or the Flop?","review":"This is going to be short and sweet. The only good character was Darth Maul (Ray Park), he definitely had the best onscreen prescence and menace. KILL JAR-JAR! Liam Neeson's performance was flat, and Jake Lloyd was just plain unbelievable. Ewan McGregor was little better, all the acting was very boring, and there was no emotion! What attracted people to the original trilogy wasn't so much the special effects, but the great original acting and emotion that the actors poured out. I felt Episode I was basically a 2-hour commercial for Star Wars toys and to line Lucas' pockets, rather than remain true to the Star Wars ideal. Sorely dissappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating on PRESENTATION!","review":"If you have a DVD player, DO NOT BUY THIS VHS. Rent it. Trust me. It's a waste of money. I did not remember how blurry VHS is. It is so blurry you can NOT read the credits! This is supposed to be Dolby Pro-logic? There are better effects on TV X-files. Lets all wait 10 years for Star Wars to come on DVD (for digital picture and sound). This VHS is a complete waste of money. This rating has nothing to do with the content, just the presentation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"Against my own better judgement I bought a video copy of this film. The quality of the VHS format just doesn't do justice to the film which was amazing in theaters. The transfer to video was visually poor and anyone used to DVD quality sound is bound to be dissapointed. I would hope that eventually this film and the origional trilogy will come out on DVD. If you want to see The Phantom Menace, rent it or borrow it, then join the masses of us who are camping out waiting for Lucas to decide he wants to honor us with the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great way to start the first part of the prequels","review":"I must say that I absolutely loved this movie and that unlike most people I trust George Lucas to show me the way that Anakin Skywalker fell from grace. I can't wait for the next parts of the series and can't wait to own them all on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tha mutha of all mutha's","review":"Basically, tha mutha of all mutha's. Finally on DVD.

Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dialog Was just AWFUL. Dissapointed but still Enjoyed","review":"I was very dissapointed by the UNATURALNESS AND FLAT ACTING. Felt way too MR RODGER'S NEIGHBORHOOD'ISH. The Dialog and interaction between Young Darth Vader and his mother was just APPALING. Way too 'see spot run'. I'm just dissapointed with LUCAS and his attempt to 'clean-up' all his films. Let's just shoot for a G-rating next time Mr. Lucas?I love Star Wars 4-6 but this was the biggest dissapointment yet. I'm sick of the rated G mentality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas had all these years and he still got it wrong","review":"I waited years and years to see the prequel, and this movie sure isn't what I expected.Get rid of Jar Jar and the Gungans, get rid of Watto, get rid of Anarkin, get rid of the pod race, and you have a decent 1 hour movie.This book was such a disappointent I probably won't waste my money on the other episodes. ;-(Wah doh Ogedoda"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a bunch of over-hyped eye candy","review":"I really cannot appreciate this movie in more areas than visual special effects. The plot was weak, the acting wasn't exactly top notch, and it just felt so... cliche. Granted, I'm not much of a Star Wars fan, but I know people who stayed in line eight hours to catch the first night who felt disappointed. Aside from some really awesome graphics, I can't give any credit to this over-hyped fluke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start","review":"A lot of people hated this movie. What is there to hate, besides Jar Jar? Actually, I didn't think Jar Jar was that bad. He was kind of annoying for the first ten minutes, but then he grew on me. I just hope in Episode 2 he goes through puberty and his voice changes and gets hooked on phonics, because that did bug me. Everything else was great. Everytime there was a lightsabre on screen, the movie ruled. I've heard people say it was boring. If you think this movie is boring, you are not allowed to watch a movie ever again. To a non Star Wars buff, the movie won't have the full impact, being that certain clues to the other trilogy won't make any sense. The pod racing sequence is truly amazing and I just love the sound that Sebulba's pod makes. Anyhow, this movie is a lot of fun, and remember it's supposed to be a children's movie, as were the first three and don't judge this until Episode 2 and 3 are out so you can watch all 6 on tape (hopefully on DVD by then). May the Force be with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny","review":"What a really expensive yet completely awful film. Talk about a waste of celluloid.

It is sooo terrible George Lucas ruined it with his casting jake lloyd, who couldn't convincingly say anything in this movie. He can't act to save his life and Natalie Portman is pretty bad too.

Even then consider sticking with just the original trilogy. Now that's Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE GARBAGE","review":"Seriously the best critique is on youtube - check out Redlettermedia 's 70 minute review - George Lucas is a hack, this movie is just a lame attempt to show how much CGI he could generate, and the hilarious part was he was outdone by other that year. These movies were made to showcase ILM and make money from merchandise - the story was probably cooked up two days before filming with triple space action to make it look better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much To See Here....Move Along","review":"The sad truth dawned on all of us watching Phantom Menace that this movie made Return of the Jedi look like Taxi Driver. With nothing but emotionless dialogue, bad acting from star Jake Lloyd and LONG gaps without any action Phantom pushes your patience. Add to that the tornado of annoyance that is Jar Jar Binks, and you have the weakest Star Wars movie in the saga. The menacing presence of Darth Maul is the only saving grace here, and the lightsaber duel is pretty impressive in it's own right. But the rest of the films flaws are just to much to suffer through. Kids will love it and it's great for introducing real young ones to the franchise, but otherwise just stick with the SW movies with Darth Vader on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"this movie is realy woopen tushy","review":"this movie was very very very good darth mall i like sha sha binks i like and itwas very funny to"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a videogame not a movie.","review":"This is a terrible movie.

There would have been a cheer and applause errupt throughout the cinema as many fans celebrate the killing off of one of the most annoying characters ever put on the screen.And to think despite the worldwide hate towards this character he again is shown in Episode 2.If Jarr Jarr had never been created my view of this movie would be completely different.George Lucas, please listen to your fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"my pick for the *least enjoyable* film ever made","review":"I have seen thousands and thousands of movies and this is the worst. Even bad movies have something redeemable about them: perhaps a plot line, or a character, or a performance by an actor. But not in this one. There is NOTHING of any value in this flick.Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker gives probably the worst performance of any actor in the history of motion pictures. It's unbelievable how he was cast.The Phantom Menace does not have any recognizable plot. The special effects are laughable. The computer-generated characters are terrible. The Phantom Menace just drags on and on and on . . ....This movie better than the previous Star Wars films? Please, see the originals.

Looked like your in a game, and Mr. Lucas even admitted himself that this movie was made for the children!! Too bad, I think it was Jar Jar who ruined this movie, for the most part, it's too bad!! Hopefully the 3rd will be more like the 2nd one than the 1st, cause this one wasn't good at all! Especially all those dumb looking aircrafts, looked like they were made of really cheap wood or metal.

I better get out of the way for all of you dense and brain washed Star Wars fans out there to pick it up for him. I remember the first making of Star Wars video that came out after Return of the Jedi hit the streets. I remember him saying that special effects is just a tool. Special effects without a plot is a pretty boring thing. My god, I think he just dropped the ball once again.

Jar Jar Binks was the stupidest part of the whole film. Reminds me of some whacked out,ganja smoking jamacian. Not to mention that they win a war with basically sticks and stones.

There is no way in hell anyone with a light saber and the ability to use it wouldn't have decapitated that annoying piece of dung within ten minutes of meeting \\"it\\". In the end this movie goes down as one of the biggest disappointments ever, boring, pointless and worst of all ANNOYING, you couldn't pay me to sit through another viewing of that film, I'd cover myself in honey and dive in an anthill first.

This is not only not a fun movie, but a disgrace for the film industry itself. In spite of all those special effects, the overabuse of computer animation is worse that those seen in Jurassick Park (sequelae II and III), and the lack of inteligent and coherent plot is discouraging. It might be fun for people without filmic pretensions, but is so heartbreaking for us Star Wars lovers. Please Mr. Lucas, can you change the title of the next movies and separate them from the marterpieces we saw 20 years ago?, don't ruin our memories.Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"The menace is right.","review":"I have never been so disappointed in a film in all my life. It makes me wish that there were an ability to give negative stars. The reason it gets even one positive star however is the opening few minutes. It actually looked like it would be a great film. NO...IT REALLY WASN'T. After that one brief shining moment this film tanks into a CG nightmare of effects without substance. It looked like the entire thing was developed to as an excuse to create that racing scene which was in turn developed just to sell a stupid video game. That racing SCENE...what was it...half an hour? And the \\"comical\\" announcer. A CURSE ON YOUR RANCH GEORGE LUCAS!!!

That's kind of like what goes on with Lucas' creation. First, if you're going to believe the events took place before the others, you don't use 2-dimensional (and extremely \\"computerized\\") computer-generated characters, spaceships, etc. You use physical, tangible, 3-dimensional models and do not surpass the effects - which are STILL spectacular - of the first three. Nothing new here. Same types of characters, same action sequences, and an extremely overdone score by John Williams. What it boils down to is that everybody has a prime.

(and preferably the original versions of those, too)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jar Jar ruined it for me","review":"This would have been an average movie for me if it hadn't been for Jar Jar Binks, the CGI reggae-talkin' muppet that doesn't shut up. I couldn't imagine what lucas was thinking when he gave as many lines to Jar Jar as he did. And now, according to starwars.com we get to enjoy yet another installment of Jar Jar in Episode 2! Help us please.Overall I think that Lucas focused entirely to hard upon the under-12 age catagory when he made this film - i.e. Jar Jar's idiotic lines and young Anakin the hero. If he wants to redeem himself for the next 2 movies, Lucas really needs to refocus and stop thinking about how he is going to market the next version of the Darth Maul action figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of all time","review":"This movie is by no doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. I didn't especially like the first 3, but they were still a lot better then this one. This movie was boring, stupid, and a waste of money. The thing that makes me the most upset is that the fans of this movie complain that it didn't make more than Titanic. They can't settle for having the 2nd highest grossing movie worldwide. It's not funny, or dramatical.The humor consists of a computer generated creature saying Doodie. The special effects are all computer generated. It's unexciting and seems to have no sense of purpose. Other then to sell merchandise and give George Lucas enough money for liposuction. Jake Loyd is a horrible actor. This film made 900 million dollars worldwide and it's basically just a bunch of posters moving really quickly. Halfway through the movie I left the theatre and went to the bathroom for about 20 minutes. I found the automatic flush to be more interesting then the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissapointed not on DVD","review":"While the movie was great, I would've liked the home version better if it was on DVD. Unfortunately, Lucas sunk so much capital into the Laserdisc, I'm sure he still holds a grudge against DVD. Nevertheless, the film is fun to watch if for no other reason than the effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful and sad","review":"This movie captures none of the mythical story that was star wars.

It was excellent. Seeing new heroes, new villains, and lots of new advantures. I have to say it's way better than the Star Wars that we know today. Everyone, give this 5 stars everytime you see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well..........","review":"There isn't much to be said. So what if it wasn't relesed on DVD? The point is that this move lacked what the others had. The plot and characters (especially the Jar-Jar tibe) were more than a bit shalow, the acting wasn't great, and the script was terible. \\"I'm so proud of you Anne\\" Annican's mother sqeaks in an unnaturally high voise after he wins the pod race. \\"you have given strength to those who have none.\\" Oh please! If Lucas works more on the plot, script and characters next time, they might live up to the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn. Cough. Yawn. \\"What time is it?\\"","review":"Perhaps giving this movie two stars was a bit harsh. But, I couldn't bring myself to give it three. No way. It's just too boring. This is a movie that is truly sleep-inducing. The plot is a muddle--trade federations, knights fighting on behalf of commerce, a race here, a race there, muddle, muddle, seven large, indisinguishable underwater monsters, etc. Even my 11-year old couldn't stay up through it when we saw for the second time (the pain, the pain) on pay-per-view. I truly love the original Star Wars trilogy. But those films were good in all the ways this film isn't. A true fairy tale story form, great acting turns by the entire cast, energy and enthusiasm, and a great set of villains. The worst thing about this film? The AWFUL kid who plays the young Darth Vader. You'd think after an hour of filming they'd have dumped him. Hmmm. He must be related to George Lucas. Rent it if you must, but no need to buy the darn thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what it could have been","review":"when i first saw this film i loved it,and i always remember thelight-saber duel beetwen darth mual and the jedi's. but nowafter wacthing it a few times i have seen that it really wasn'twhat it could of been. the film was made up of crummy diolugesome action and an ending that wasn't wprth the watch. also the film should have focused less time on jar-jar binks! he is a completly stupid charecter. the film although bad did have it's good parts and such.this movie is rated PG for sci-fi action\\\\violence. the film deserved the rating,[like any other star wars] and the violence was kept mild. there was no languge kissing or any thing of that sort. it was not a scary film at all but it might not be the perfect film to take youre 4 year olds to.overall the film was not what it could have been and totally worse than the old trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"the start of it all","review":"this movie shows 3 firsts: the beginning of a friendship between Anakin and Padme, R2-D2 and C-3PO becoming friends, and Senator Palpatine/Emporer looking younger. of course, like 2 through 6, you will see humans and aliens hanging out together. there were only two lightsaber battles in this movie, which are the hallmark of the Star Wars films. I recommend this film to all Star Wars fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"The film deffinately exceeded my expectations. And though, yes, it did have some overblown CGI, the actors did a fantastic job working with it.It probably wasn't *QUITE* as outstanding as the others but it sure came awfully close. The movie was a deffinate better-than-average film. My theory is; the movie was a bit dissapointing to some because it came after the other Star Wars movies. But imagine it coming out of nowhere without a reputation. It would blow everybody's mind! (It was also amazing that it could have so much intense action and exhileration and still keep a PG rating! ) I am a bit dissapointed, however, that Lucasfilm is so stubborn about not releasing the series on DVD as God intended them to be seen (next to the theaters, of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent me a scratched dvd","review":"They sent me a movie that constantly skips. this was not stated that the movie was scratched. im very unpleased with the quality and truthfulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly an awful movie. Only wanted to complete the trilogy.","review":"This is by far the worst of the Star Wars movies (all of I-VI). Jar-Jar is torturous to watch as are young Anakin Skywalker, Watto, Sebulba, and the other cartoon creatures of this film. Only worth having in order to complete the set. This is the movie that makes it impossible to watch all six in a row, in a day. Plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Resutls","review":"This could have been one of the better Star Wars movies. It certainly had excellent special effects and a superb duel between two Jedi and the Sith. However, it was marred by two characters. Jar Jar Binks turned out to be one of the most annoying characters ever conceived, whose every utterance was like hearing fingernails raked across a blackboard (one prominent critic wrote in anticipation of the next Star Wars movie, \\"Jar Jar Binks must die!\\" Unfortunately, he did not). The other was the child Anakin. I think, however, that this was primarily due to the dialogue given him; there were many instances where he just should have been silent and Lucas had him talking his head off with inane comments, but in truth his inflection left a lot to be desired during the exciting parts)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Episode I, good!","review":"Although many critics and die hard SW fan complained about the first episode, I enjoyed it a lot. The pod-racer scene is one of my all-time favourites and obviously the special effects are brilliant!

Say no to VHS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"phantom mess","review":"The 'Star Wars' series is quickly evolving into 'Muppets In Space.' Jar Jar Binks - need I say more? 'Star Wars' and 'Empire' were both aimed at general audiences, while 'Return' and 'Menace' were clearly aimed at 5-year-olds. We can only hope that George Lucas remembers his post-elementary-school demographic and restores some adulthood to the next two prequels. Otherwise, he might as well just make more Ewok Adventures for TV and forget about finishing the 'Star Wars' cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad but Good","review":"A prequel is usually never even close to being a good movie because it usually assumes that the audience has already seen the previous films and know what's going on. This movie is no acception. In this movie all we find is the beginnings of character development and at the height of the movie we are made to watch a race in which everyone knows who's going to win. How entertaining is that suppose to be? The storyline is barely there. The only saving grace of this movie is that the acting is done decently by everyone that is involved on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker.","review":"This movie will never be good while the title Star Wars is attached to it. The characters were boring; Qui-Gon Jinn died before we could get to know him, Obi-Wan was bland and expressionless and Darth Maul? Come on, horns? Yeah, right. Plus, we get the stupendous Queen Amidala was just about as exciting as a stuffed frog. The only exciting person in the whole wretched flick was Anakin, but we know his fate so it's not too exciting. And where the heck was Han Solo's father? That would have been sweet.As for plot, it wasn't intriguing because they introduce you to the problem, think it out and solve it all in the same movie. The only thing that saves this movie from the dump is that it has decent special effects and it is part of the Star Wars saga. Just watch Episode 2, it's alot better.@lex"},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been good","review":"I won't take credit for this statement, but I think the guy who said it hit the nail on the head. The thing lacking from Phantom Menace was a human moment. Such as Luke staring off into the setting suns in \\"Star Wars\\" while the orchestra played behind him. This simple ten second moment captured the essence of his character. The characters in Phantom Menace had no depth, and that is why it was disappointing.I've read a lot of the \\"5 Star\\" reviews that say people who don't like this movie are not \\"True Fans\\". I disagree. I've loved Star Wars since I was a child. That means that I want to see the best come from the world that I love, rather than blindly accepting what is fed to them without thinking about it. I can admit that, Phantom Menace is a bad film, that gets worse each time I watch it. (The effects are nice...so what? Give me some interesting characters!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"anakin","review":"my only real problem with this movie was anakin skywalker. i know he's only a kid, but he really was an awful actor. episode 1 would have been greatly improved had they gotten Haley Joel Osment to play anakin"},{"rating":"2","title":"There willbe more","review":"I thought this movie as a whole was not well. The acting was not all it needed to be, exeptions: Natalie Portman, & Darth Maul. I feel that this movie was just to set the weels spinning, the filler will come in the next two. Just like the original series. I've been a fan since 1977 and may be jaded but I feel that this was a film that had to exist to set up the rest. Effects, of course, were amazing as was the background. The plot was not where it should have been. The sotry as a whole not bad, not great either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie, um, nice DVD extras","review":"Alright I'll cut out all the negative Star Wars vibes for all the geeks out there, this film was just plain boring, pure and simple.Boring, boring, boring. It was really boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait, but too cute","review":"Most people are familiar with Star Wars. Those that aren't, should be. Taking advantage of the letterbox edition here allows a viewer to see all of the screen picture, not waht was edited to fit your screen. Obviously, the movie was amazing in its production, but at the same time, it had more cuteness in it than Ewoks could ever hope to offer. Between Jar-Jar Binks and Anakin Skywalker, I really hope future episodes are more dark and on-the-edge than this was. Still, for no Star Wars film in 20 years, seeing this movie at midnight opening day was one of my favorite memories. (And lest you think I am a sci-fi nut, just think of all the folks at 7am driving to work, hearing the whole plot ruined for them by some DJ who finally was allowed to discuss the movie...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this move.","review":"But unfortunately, this film was not very involving.George Lucas once said that special effects without a story can be a pretty boring thing. I'd wish he take heath to his own statement.While the movie does have some good effects, it's overuse of CGI was like watching a video game on a giant screen. It really became tedious after a certain point.I'm probably in the minority on this, but perhaps it was wise that Lucas NOT do these first three movies. In \\"Star Wars\\" we hear old Obi-Wan talk about the past. All of us had our own images on how that past must have looked like. Of course, all of that is now ruined. We now have Jar Jar Binks and bad acting by Jake Lloyd to visualize!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-release, re-release!","review":"Please Mr. Lucas, please re-release this movie. Take into thought what the fans are saying. That's why Star Wars is as big, the fans. I've been a fan since the 80's and I collect Star Wars. I love the originals (ANH, ESB, ROTJ) and watched them regularly, I couldn't get sick of them. Then when I heard that there was going to be prequals, I was so excited. I can't believe that is the result. It's more of a joke to Star Wars than a part of the Star Wars Trilogy. Just cut some of the podrace, take out \\"Wizards\\" and \\"Yipeee\\" and Anakin's accidental blow up of the Droid Control Ship. The future Darth Vader couldn't do it on purpose. He's so strong with the force. And please take out Jar Jar's stupid antics and dumb jokes and sayings. \\"Ex-squeeze me\\" It would be a much better film and I think the fans would love it more. It would seem more like Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie is Horrible","review":"This is absolutely one of the biggest, overblown movies ever made. The marketing was brilliant, but the film was severely lacking in substance. Nothing really happened. They found anakin, and the senator (emporer) created a conflict. This could have been achieved in 15 minutes. Darth Maul was only in it for about 5 minutes, and the character of Jar Jar Binks seriously needed to be on the cutting room floor.

They market them.\\" This bland, childish film overwhelms with special effects to hide the lack of an intelligent script. Toy-tie ins and over-kill marketing showed that Lucas didn't care about entertaining people as much as he wanted to make money!

Anyone who can find a plot in this monstrosity deserves the Nobel Prize for his feat. If you thought the ending of \\"2001\\" was incomprehensible, just wait 'til you see the beginning of \\"Phantom Menace\\". From the opening words,\\"...the taxation on trade routes is in dispute...\\" [who wrote this script - Pat Buchanan?] to an end featuring the least convincing fight scene since \\"Rocky IV\\", you'll be treated to dialogue and acting which would embarass first-graders putting on a school play. In the interests of self-preservation try not to see this film on an airplane since you'll experience an overwhelming desire to walk out on it. But shouldn't I be fair enough to mention its redeeming qualities? Okay. To properly enjoy Phantom Menace take these three steps: 1.Fast forward to the pod race scene. 2.Watch the pod race scene. 3.Rewind.

Granted, the other three movies did't exactly have poetic dialog (especially Return of the Jedi), but each movie had character development. This movie gives you only some superficial knowledge of the main players before whisking you off on a thoughtless, flashy journey. Along the way you get some really bad acting, a limp story, and worst of all, Jar Jar.Even the special effects were lacking. ILM's composeting looks rather thin, especially at the beginning and end when actors are inside metallic rooms. Another summer movie, the Matrix, had far better looking, sharper and more inventive special effects that put the Phantom Menace to shame.George Lucas has once again shown that he can not direct actors, and his storytelling skills are very rusty. I hope someone else directs the next one.

Darth Vader was menacing, but you didn't hate him. A lit. teacher once told me for a movie to work the bad guy has to be likeable & interesting. Well in this movie they're not. Instead the villains have no depth or background. That's why Lucas had to make Darth Maul look like Satan. It's probably also why he had to add that crazy side kick Jar Jar Binks.

Perhaps Lucas shouldn't be allowed to run with this ball by himself.While most of the ILM computer graphics were impressive, the inane characters like Jar-Jar and the young Darth made the 4th movie nauseating. Not to mention that Jar-Jar is an offensive, thinly veiled Rasta step-n-fetch stereotype. And where did Lucas get off turning the FORCE into some internal parasites.

Since when is jedi power controlled by microscopic organizms--well, I guess that is more PC than it being a eastern-like religion. I have to say, the computer animation was great, but you have to use it in moderation! The whole damn movie was cgi, as well as the most annoying character ever created, Jar Jar Binks. I pray to god that he dies early in episode 2. And what was with all the hype over Darth Maul? He was in the movie for all of five minutes, with just as many lines. How is it that a retarded cgi character gets second billing where a sith lord only gets five lines.

Star Wars has continued its downward slide that started with the Ewoks in \\"Return of the Jedi\\". It's really a shame that Lucas can't come up with a better plot and script. There has been alot of good material written for Star Wars, the Zahn novels and Dark Horse Comics series to name a few.I think Mr Lucas has lost his ability to be an artist and is more the businessman.

It's a contender for the Annual Golden Raspberry Awards. \\"Independence Day\\" was FAR better! Please do better next time Mr Lucas.

Hence, when I was working at my video store and they gave us the exciting news that \\"Episode I\\" was finally to make it's long-awaited arrival to DVD, my response was an overwhelming \\"So?\\"Extra-features, commentaries, making-of's, all that jazz doesn't make up for the fact that this movie is a sure sign that somewhere between Jedi and Phantom, Lucas got a little too caught up in the business of keeping track of his royalties than keeping track of his imagination.Sure, standing alone, it's a decent picture (I still say Galaxy Quest was that year's best sci-fi release), but when held up next to it's three big brothers...well it's kinda like holding a Pokemon Pikachu wristwatch won from a crane game next to Big Ben."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leave It Alone!","review":"Sure, \\"The Phantom Menace\\" isn't as good as the other movies, but it has its moments. The pod race, the three-way lightsaber duel, etc. I do believe that this is a great film, yet the weakest of the Star Wars films (don't get me wrong, there all great).

It seemed to me that George Lucas was trying to recreate his trilogy, and failing. However, there are some strong points: Ewan and Liam were wonderful, Darth Maul was a highly effective baddie, and Natalie Portman wasn't nearly as annoying as I thought she would be. Of course, there are some bad points as well: Jar Jar, Anakin, etc. I wouldn't recommend getting the DVD unless you REALLY love the movie or just want the ability to get the the good parts faster (why do you think I'm actually buying this thing?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD #1","review":"Possible one of the greatest movies to come out in the past five years.

We see Anakin Skywalker as a young boy - almost hard to think that this is a prelude to the big, bad Darth Vader. I really liked Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala, and most of her costumes were awesome (though there were a couple of really awful ones) This first movie sets up the events in the second and third films."},{"rating":"2","title":"the child, Anakin Skywalker","review":"This is a decent movie. it could have been better on a lot of levels but it is definitely a good movie to check out. If you're looking for A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, or Return of the Jedi, this ain't it.It's a different movie. Not as action packed as those but definitely worth a look. I actually prefer this to Attack of the Clones, mostly because of Hayden Christensen, Jar Jar Binks is an annoyance but you'll learn to live with it. If he didn't talk as much it'd be a very good movie.Alas, I still recommend this movie. The DVD is great. A commentary from George and others and a few features on the second disc make it all the worthwhile. The deleted scenes are a must watch. Definitely for the fans. If you aren't a fan, you won't appreciate it as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"If not for the lightsabers and Natalie Portman","review":"If not for the two above this movie would be a total waste of time and Portman is so so. Our good friend Lucas decide to flush the whole thing. The actor are so wooden i'd rather watch a kids play with the action figures. Hell, Frank Oz as yoda gives a better performance than all save darth maul. Speaking of which he is the only character that i would care to learn more about. Obi-wans okay, but to jaded to be so young.fortunately the final lightsaber battle rocks. however, it is short and lacks the whole feel of luke Vs. vader.bum it from a friend if possible.i'll go see the others just to see what they are like.don't waste money to rent or buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was George Lucas thinking??","review":"I love all the Star Wars movies, I can watch them over and over.

If Jar Jar Binks gets knocked off, I'll give it two thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie never should have been made.","review":"I was very surprised and dissapointed to see George Lucas single handedly destroy everything I loved about episodes 4 and 5. The storyline (not that spectacular in the other Star Wars films, but these two had a lot of other things that made them great films) is irrelevant and the Star Trek like technobabble is awfull (midichlorians, very very bad idea George, it takes everything magical out of the Force thus destroying the concept), the actors spout their lines on command without feeling and the characters are forgettable at best. Anyway I saw it a couple of times and stick with what I thought the first time I left the theater: \\"This movie should never have been made\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"They blew it","review":"For anyone who has seen the other star wars movies, this movie was a huge disappointment. It felt more like a made for tv movie than the most anticipated Movie ever.I lost a lot of respect for George Lucas for using [poor] computer generated special effects instead of using miniatures as they had done in the past. He probably saw 'the matrix' and said, yea I can do that. But he could not.The plot was thin, the characters not even close to being engaging. Darth Maul (only exciting character) did not have enough presence to be anything close to Darth Vader.George please let someone else direct the next episodes. Don't let your ego destroy this legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best of the series","review":"This film has a great cast, but suffers from a weak story. The origin of the Star Wars saga should have been a strong story. This film failed to entertain me in the way that I had expected it too. I like the whole idea about the invasion and war on Naboo. The origin of young Skywalker, and Paopatin were pretty interesting. I also liked the character, Darth Maul. The part of this movie that bored me to tears was the silly pod race on the desert planet. It was very unnecessary and boring. The rest of the story is okay though. It's possibly the weakest of the Star Wars movies, but it's a must see for any fan of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lucas Menace","review":"Oh, man, this movie has no substance. It's a fest of special effects spread amongst a group of actors that has no material to work upon (including the poor Jake Lloyd...).Ok, we have something similar to a plot, but it's so derivative and inocuous when compared with the classic trilogy, that you just can't stand it.The atmosphere of the movie has no suspense, no lurking danger, no sense of imminent disaster like the others. IT's all about trying hard to create a new phenomenal franchise in the style of Star Trek. But all the Star Trek movies at least had a soul of their own.The PHANTOM MENACE simply has no soul, no matter how hard Lucas and the army of special effects guys must have worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"a featureless flop, don't waste your money...","review":"This movie was so void of substance as to be insulting. All of the characters were featureless. The main characters left nothing to be desired. The rediculously overcredited Anakin progeny proved incredibly annoying as I optimistically strained to suspend my disbelief in vain. That Mall creature did nothing to impress me. The battle scenes were just stupid. Basically, this was a complete letdown that doesn't deserve to be on the same shelf as Empire Strikes Back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars: Episode I","review":"I bought this as a replacement for my Star Wars DVD Set which was lost in a house fire.

That's amazing, but even more amazing was how uninspiring this film was. The city planet was a strange place, and it reminded of all the trips to Boston on Rte 128 or Rte 495. I can't imagine a planet that reminds me of New York City. That was a truly disturbing vision. Then there were the Jedi's. Not too inspiring, either. The villains were preposterous, as was the alleged UN of the planets. Just the same kind of stuff as in the year 2002. Boring, boring, and politically boring. Ja-Ja Binks was the real winner, here, and I'm not getting into the racist dialogue. He had nothing to do with being a Jamaican, no matter what anyone says. He was a unique character, and his city under the sea was truly inspiring. The rest of the movie was a set-up for the next. Typical Lucas fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"AverageGuy","review":"I'm just an average guy watching a movie. And this is my opinion: I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!The story wasn't interesting (or fulfilling). There was no attachment or connection with any characters. In some cases, they were just annoying: Jar Jar Binks. They should have just cut this guy out completely. The special effects were great but, again, this film relied too much on it. I liked the older FX: animatronics and models. The characters seemed more appealing and believable. I hope they do a better job with the next film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best star wars movie ever!","review":"This is my favorite star wars movie ever.I like Jake Lloyd as Anakin.Jar Jar Binks is hilarious.I always wondered why people hate this movie.It is a really good movie.But stay away from episodeII. That movie is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Lucas wasn't planning this prequel all along!","review":"In A Time Magazaine article dated March 6, 1978 on page 82 he discussed his plans for more than ten SEQUELS.

The Empire Strikes Back was supposed to be Star Wars 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"steaming pile of feces","review":"I can't believe how Lucas has ruined what started out as a great series of movies. What a waste of time this one was. Instead of this I'd recommend Lord of the Rings (books or dvds), Frank Herbert's Dune (book or dvd) or Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress (dvd) since all of these were the major inspiration for Star Wars and much better than Episode I. Hold out for the original trilogy on dvd, at the very least."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD and MORE BAD","review":"Just flat out bad, bad bad. I've been waiting for the next set of movies since 1983 and boy did this fall on its' face.

If you want it, wait for the dvd boxed set that will eventually be released after the EP III is released. Bad....bad....bad....."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as I thought it would be","review":"Too much kidstuff. Lucas lost his edge with this one.

Episodes 4-6 were excellent, especially 4 & 5. If you really liked Episode 1, and there are no other DVD's that you would rather spend your money on, this DVD has some nice extra's. (Got it as a gift.) I have seen it twice, which is more than enough times for me. My six year old nephew does not even like it. He would rather watch Spy Kids or see Harry Potter."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"The visual effects are outstanding. The duel at the end is spectacular. Now that the \\"good\\" is out of the way, the story is awful! It seems that Lucas tried to fit too much into this movie. Everything happened too fast as though the Jedi started in the morning and defeated Darth Maul by lunch. The characters were rediculous. You can't help but hope Jar-Jar gets shot in the head, or hope that you do. At least one of you has some relief! And the Vice-roy. These guys sound like Japanese being stereotyped with that \\"bad english\\" accent.The acting in this movie was pathetic. What was Lucas thinking when he cast Anakin? This kid CAN NOT act. Any kid could act as good as that. There are many child actors who would have done well in that movie. It wasn't just him, no one in this movie did a good job. This is definately a rental, don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Right after when I saw this movie I wish it would never been made. This is the worst Star Wars film I've ever seen. It seemed more like a kids movie to me. The other Star Wars trilogy is much more better than this and I wish that Episode IV would be Episode I, Episode V would be Episode II, and Episode VI would be Episode III (the last episode). What's the point of starting it as Star Wars - Episode IV that is ridiculous. I didn't really like the way that they did that and I hope when I see Episode II next year it would be a lot more better than Phantom Menace. If not I would really be disappointed at George Lucas. Anyways if you hadn't seen The Phantom Menace don't you will not like it stick with the original trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"EP1 [is bad] no matter how much stuff they put on the DVD","review":"I watched the first time in absolute horror. Then I went back to see it, a second time, and give it a fair shake, sorry. I couldn't stand it the 2nd time either (digitally projected no less)There is nothing remotely satifying in The Phantom Menace. Everyone talks about the stupid pod race like it the greatest thing since sliced bread. It's ok, but let's not get crazy about it.I tried to watch it a 3rd time but shut it off. The acting is terrible!! Jake Lloyd is awful, awful, awful. I see fair attempts with Natalie Portman's character and the Emperor, but the performances are somewhat shallow feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big, long and uncut.","review":"I can honestly say that SW episodes IV and V are good movies. I can honestly say that episode I is not. I'm not a fan, I just like good movies. Past glamour is not all, but a fine movie will live forever. You feel it in your heart when you watch one.

Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Lucas = Fat Elvis","review":"When Elvis got fat nobody cared because he used to be ELVIS.

And Jar-Jar Binks was just crap. But this is the only Episode I we're gonna see. Your whines will not get us anywhere. The breath-taking art direction and those bad-ass light saber duels (particularly the climactic one) is enough for this easily amused Star Wars nerd to rush to purchase the $40 widescreen edition (which I just came back from doing). I not ashamed to say that I enjoyed this movie at the theatre as much as I loved taking part in the anticipation. The whole thing was an experience I was glad to be a part of. It was also a wonderful exercise of the joy of immaturity.

They are all still great movies. Yes, some of the best..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Ending to a Long Wait","review":"I, like many others waited long and hard for Star Wars 1 to come out. I was extremely disappointed. In the first trilogy released, while there were three movies that were separate movies but tied together, Star Wars 1 just seemed like the first installment in a miniseries.The inclusion of Jar-Jar Binks as a main character was, at best, a travesty. He has neither the warmth of R2D2 or the bumbling antics of C3P0.I can only conclude that, should George Lucas insist upon making the rest of the trilogy in this vein, he'll lose more and more fans. And should he continue to make the last trilogy in the line, there'll be no one left to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Your Base Are Belong To Us","review":"Although it's been a long time in coming, Epsiode I has finally made it onto DVD and we can only hope that originial triology will follow soon.The quality (sound, picture, etc) is simply amazing. It makes the experience of watching such a fine film even more enjoyable.If you haven't had the chance, watch the DVD on a complete surround sound system and see if you can hear the difference. Its quite spectacular.Anyone who has anything truly negative to say about this film isn't a true Star Wars fan, and probably wouldn't be bothered to buy the VHS in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible DVD for a fantastic movie!","review":"I absolutly love this DVD and this movie. The extras are amazing. If you are a hardcore Star Wars fan or even a small child you will enjoy this. And of corse the movie itself is top notch. One of the best movies since the classic trilogy. If you buy it watch everything. I did and even after 6 hours of extras I was left wanting more. I cannot wait untill Attack of the Clones comes out.

Peace, and may the force be with you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE","review":"I don't even know where to start. What a joke. Did a monkey write the horrid script? Could the acting have been more amatuerish? Lucas lost it after the Empire Strikes Back.

This mistake can only be erased, well it can never be erased, but hopefully he will redeem himself in the 2nd episode.

I thought it was excellent. The plot was well developed, and fascinating. Star Wars fans have been waiting for this for years, have been, in my opinion, rewarded with a wonderful film. It was so neat, experiencing Star Wars the way our parents must have, seeing it for the very first time. I especially loved learning about the Jedi Temple. There are whole new worlds to learn about. Even Tatooine, which we know from the first trilogy gains a new depth. My favorite was Naboo, with it's fabulous cities and wldlife. Congratulations to whoever thought up and created the costumes and hairdos for Amidala. They deserve a standing ovation. I hope you get a chance to see this movie. Don't let the bad reputation of Jar Jar Binks keeep you from enjoying this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than meets the eye. . .","review":"The first time is saw The Phantom Menace, I was honestly disappointed.

Star Wars Episode One has a lot of action, answers a lot of questions, and the special effects are fabulous. You have to view this movie with an open mind however. Anyone who is a Star Wars fan and speaks negatively about it can't accept the fact that there is no Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, etc. You have to remember that this is the beggining, and you have to accept it the way it is. Most important of all, you can't compare it to the first three movies. It's completely different with a lot of different angles and chracters that certainly have their own merrit. Not to mention the technology used to make this movie is a 100 times better and more advanced that it was in the mid-70's and early 80's, so it looks different than the origional 3 which I will admit took me a time or two to adjust to. I love this movie, although I think Jar-Jar Binks was a bit much to say the least. I would recomend this movie to anyone, Star Wars fan or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"someone please kill off JarJar Binks!","review":"Episode 1 is the \\"best\\" of the three prequel movies - but they totally ruined an otherwise decent movie with JarJar Binks.

Take the money you would spend on this and give it to charity or buy a homeless man a sandwich, you will feel better. This movie has nothing to offer and after watching this I have no interest whatsoever of watching Episode 2 or 3. Which is too bad cuz I love Star Wars, but this is not Star Wars. It's just a way to make money, and just because this movie made alot of money at the box office doesn't mean it's any good, the script decides that, and it's not wise to assume that everyone who paid to see it even liked it. That is just silly. It was hyped up alot and fans of the real Star Wars movies expected this to be as good as the others, sadly it is very much below par.

This was not a good movie by any standards other than special effects. I can't even bring myself to like those, because they created Jar-Jar Binks. I own this DVD, and it gets worse every time I watch it.The main problem with this movie is Anikin. Not only was he a bad actor, but his lines were a hideous attempt at trying to simulate a kid talking. Thus, for several scenes he stays in his really serious \\"I want to be a Jedi and free all the slaves\\" additude, and then the lucasarts people realize \\"Hey! he's supposed to be a child!\\" And then he suddenly starts bouncing around saying \\"yipeee!\\" Anikin is what finally ruined the pod-race scene.Bad movie aside, the DVD is poorly designed.

Jackson, didnt live up.He didnt have a big role, and i was disapointed.I'm a very big Star Wars fan, but i didnt enjoy this one.Im praying that Star Wars:Episode 2 Attack of the Clones is much better, or I wont be seeing the other films that are coming.Yet again, to all of you die hard fans, i say i'm sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIGH EXPECTATIONS NOT CAUSE FOR DISAPPOINTMENT.........","review":"I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and even though I give THE PHANTOM MENACE only two stars....I do it for good reason.My opinion of PHANTOM MENACE is quite simply explained. The original Star Wars looked real!!! It looked real because it was real!! Models and sets. That was the beauty of it!PHANTOM MENANCE, it seemed, was written in a manner to suit the computer effects they could do. Many of the scenes served absolutely zero purpose, other than to show off the computer CGI JUNK. Which, quite frankly, didn't transport the audience to a GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY, but instead into George Lucas' computer.The other thing that ruined the movie for me, was the way they chopped up the final battle. Cutting back and forth between the battle in the field and the lightsabre battle sucked the intensity, suspense and excitement right out of it.

What Happned!!","review":"I love the StarWars movies. I can watch them again and again and never tire of them. But Phantom Menance is a film I don't plan on watching any time soon. The only parts of Phantom I liked were when Annakin Skywalker's mom reveals that Annakin had no father, and the last battle scene with Darth Maul--the rest of the movie left me bored and restless. I wanted the movie to take me on an emotional journey where I cared about the characters I watched and felt their feelings as they displayed them, but watching Phantom Menance I felt nothing. I felt like an outsider watching a film without meaning, watching battles that I didn't even care who wins. I hope Lucas stops production on Star Wars II. I have a feeling that it's going to be a bad film because he'll focus on visual effects rather than human emotions, and it will tell a story through artifical beings who lack substance rather than multi-layered characters (see Hans Solo) who create emotions at will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spectacular Snooze","review":"The DVD is the first time I've seen this movie. Honestly, I fell asleep. This is not the sign of a good film. I keep hearing about how great the extras on the 2nd disk are but, who cares when the movie was this dull? Why would I want to see them?

But does this save the movie? Hell no. The original movies like 4,5, and 6 had some great dialouge. While the Phantom Menace has some really interesting characters, its painful to listen to them speak.

Luke Skywalker took his little ol' X-Wing and dropped two bombs into an exhaust port. OK that worked in 1977.Return of the Jedi sees Lando attack yet another Death Star. This time flying into it and blowing it up. OK well see my review for that movie.Now in 1999 Anakin Skywalker flys a fighter into a mother ship, this time lands, and starts shooting the place up and flies out?How will Star Wars II end?

A little ship will fly into a big ship and blow it up.Biggest disappointment since the Star Wars Holiday special."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of 1999","review":"Episode I has my vote as one of the worst, if not the worst major hyped release of 1999. It makes a mockery of Star Wars and gives a bad name to every actor in it. Where does one begin? Wooden, leaden acting from start to finish. No emotional content anywhere. Incredibly pointless special effects. Extremely loud soundtrack. Pointless fight scenes. Stereotyped aliens (note the slights to Asians and Semites, among others). The only redeeming aspects of this bomb are the incredible eye-popping special effects. And yes, the costuming was very creative. \\"So What.\\" I certainly hope this dog is only released as a pan-and-scan on VHS so others will avoid it (oh well).

(Although the second trilogy does get better from here!) I know Lucas was trying to draw in pre-schoolers who had never seen the first trilogy, but did he need to thumb his nose at his older fan base?If Lucas really cared for his fans he would come out with his own re-edit of this one (sort of like the newer version of the original series) giving us a movie that is watchable for \\"over pre-school\\" fans.

What most people have forgotten about Lucas is that he is a genius. He is flexible...and has not changed as a director. The same comical, creative, dark atmospheres that he created in the original trilogy do occur in the Menace.The Menace is a plant creator. It sets the story for the second trilogy and is necessary. It contains the Gungans, an underwater tribe not unlike the Ewoks. It contains Tatooine, a city captured by beauty and originally unscarred by evil that sets the tone for what will be a much darker galaxy.

The whole thing felt forced and disjointed with the known Star Wars universe... just a flashy showing of digital effects. But worst of all is the child actor - and I use the term loosely - playing Anakin. His utter inability to emote even a quasi-convincing whoop of joyous victory overshadows any annoyance I may have felt at the infamous Jar-Jar or the cheap army of Binks clones for the last battle scene.All that being said, this DVD has some great extras that makes it worth getting even if you're a Star Wars fan that wants to smack George Lucas with a newspaper for disappointing you with this bewilderingly shallow-even-for-a-Star-Wars-flick movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing Priorities Puts Script in a Galaxy Far, Far Away","review":"This is a lame excuse for a film, be it a Star Wars film or another film.

Enough about Jar Jar, we all hated him, end of story. The real problem with this movie is that Lucas has forgotten what gives a movie value and entrances the watcher. There simply was nothing to pull you in, to make you feel like you are watching some great epic struggle. This is what the first two movies had (and somewhat the third movie). Nobody cares about CGI generated tadpoles fighting CGI generated robots! \\"Gee wiz the special effects are great, but do I really care what happens to either side being depicted?\\" Um, no. Please, Mr. Lucas, go back and watch the first two movies of your own series and try to recreate the magic.Now, as for whether you should purchase this DVD or not?

Why didn't Darth Malue screm when Obi-Wan sliced in half. Even though he was instantly dead he would have felt something. 4. Why didn't Qui-Gon die instanly. 5. Why don't more Jedi members speak. 6.

I'm still going to buy it on tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Version","review":"A film worthy of the 'Star Wars' name, but alas, it will not find its way in to this movie lovers library. To ignore the DVD consumer with this film is nothing short of a slap in the face.With Mr Lucas' crusade to make movies their most enjoyable in both sight and sound, it is inconceivable that he would choose to ignore DVD and opt rather for the inferior platform of VHS.It is for these reasons that I refuse to purchase this film on VHS and strongly encourage all other DVD owners to do the same. We are a growing (the fastest growing in media history! ) segment of the home video population. Please do not forsake us.In parting, I say to Mr Lucas, congratulations on another science fiction masterpiece, I look forward to watching it the way it was meant to be seen and heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Historic piece of JUNK!","review":"Wow this movie was bad.

Neither the Pan and Scannor the Widescreen is very good. The sound isn't too bad surprisingly enough, but the picture is terrible. The special effects are totally wasted on VHS as the colors are so washed out and the picture is fuzzy. Being a recent convert to DVD this is even more painful to watch. If you LOVE the movie and can tolerate its flaws at least buy the unbutchered Widescreen version. George Lucas is pushing off low quality on the consumer, what about those that just want a basic Widescreen VHS and have to pay for some cheap book and film strip? Don't waste your money if possible, wait for a DVD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"No.","review":"Ok, this movie isn't TERRIBLE, but it sure as hell isn't good. The actors come across as manequins reading from a teleprompter, and the story doesn't move along well at all (Lucas better jam a LOT of information into Episode II). And just to add salt to the wounds, this video has the poorest visual quality I've seen in a long time - the effects are ok, but the way they come across on VHS are just terrible.

The entire movie is based on special effects. No story, nothing really interesting, and the movie doesn't even look like Star Wars. The sword fight is really the only good scene with maybe the podrace, which is quite weird. I frankly miss the fun I had watching the first movies. Where's Han, Chewie, and C3PO looks really dumb. And that ugly frog guy, Jar Jar Binks, seems to take C3PO's part. He is the funny guy(?). He's funny but after a while he gets reaaaally boring. It seems that the movie and its story went back to some modern dark ages. If you have to take a movie tonight skip this one for the next century. It might look something like this boring movie. Small kids would like that, not grown-ups!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS DVD IS AWESOME!","review":"Forget the VHS version! The THX, Dolby Digital DVD is the best! My only complaint is that this DVD is not in DTS. I'm hoping a DTS version will be released later.This DVD is a two disc set. Disc two has TONS of special features. Some of these special features include: Deleted scenes, extended Podrace scenes, An hour-long documentary inside Lucasfilm and ILM during production, Multi-angle storyboard-to-animatic-to-film segment featuring the Submarine and Podrace Lap 1 sequences and MANY more.The music is by John Williams....Nobody does it better, Period!I can't wait for the other Star Wars films to be released on DVD!Hopefully in DTS.

I thought this would be some great scifi drama like the last 3. You could call this a kids movie practicly. In the movie the good guys will only nuetrilise threats if they our non living. Naboo all they talk about is we must realy on negotioations. Even when the power is out. There was no siege at all they didn't even go down figting on there own. It reminds reminds me of the halacust. They dont't even pick up a laser until the Jedis come."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only way to watch this movie","review":"The only way to watch this movie.

The effects were excellent, the lightsaber action was mind blowing, and the story was great. I have friends that didn't care for it as much as the original trilogy, but I thought it was just as good.

It was sad to see this movie made into nothing but a money making cash cow for George Lucas. The movie wasn't made to be a great movie, it was made to sell merchandise.

It's become apparent that Lucas cares only about the technical aspects of moviemaking, and not the need for good storytelling.The dialogue is pretentious and awful. Jar Jar Binks is insulting, even to a child's intelligence. Jake Lloyd is the worst child actor in history. Gary Coleman could have played a better Anakin Skywalker!Some of the plot elements don't even jive with what Lucas filmed years ago. Anakin created 3PO? The Force is a bunch of microbial entities in your bloodstream? Anakin was an immaculate conception?I suppose the writing was on the wall when Lucas ruined his own masterpieces in the forms of the Epidode 4,5,6 \\"Special Editions.\\" Greedo shoots at Han first? I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent summer movie , just where is the DVD!","review":"This movie is the first of the star wars movies.

The great cinematic event of the 20th century I waited over a decade for this? What a dissapointment... As the film slowly wound its way to the final unoriginal, predictable ending, all I could think was \\"when will this movie end...when will this movie end\\" The most frustrating aspect of the movie was that the dialogue between Darth Maul and Sidious refered to an unexplained event between themselves and the Jedi forces; at one point Sidious states \\"...and then we'll have our revenge..\\" Revenge? Revenge for what? Boring, unintelligent, a huge let down from the \\"original three\\" George better clean up his act before Star Bores Episode II: The Return of Jar Jar"},{"rating":"1","title":"What drug was George Lucas on?","review":"I love Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. I think that George Lucas should have stopped there. The two movies: The Phantom Menace and the Attack of the Clones....SUCK! What was George Lucas thinking? Jar Jar Binks needs to tossed off the face of the earth, and Hayden Christansen (while hot), needs to take some acting lessons. Not enough special effects in the world could make me want to see the third release. Poor acting and writing have made me want to run for cover! Where's the FORCE when you need it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Star Wars\\" in name only; what a disappointment...","review":"Episode One, with its stunning visuals, is a thrill to look at. Parts of it would have worked great as an IMAX show about visions of other planets.As a movie, and particularly as a Star Wars movie, though, it falls far short. This film, unlike its predecessors, falls into the sci-fi trap of putting spectacle over story, special effects over character development. Yes, it had a lot of hype and expectations to live up to, but storytelling is still storytelling no matter what the medium and genre.It pains me to say it, but this particular Lucas installment is all flash and no Force."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This was one of the most disappointing movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching. The plot wasn't even worth paying attention to, the acting was horrible, and the most interesting character, Darth Maul, is see for about three total minutes. When two talented actors like Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are made out to look like cardboard figures it's easy to figure out that the blame rests on Lucas' shoulders. This movie proves he may be a master of visiual effects (which are great), but he needs some directing and writing lessons. And please kill that stupid Jar Jar Binks thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I got this movie just to see what all the fuss was about.I am still wondering.This movie isn't just bad, it's horrible. The special effets are cheesey. I mean they defy description. The muppests on Sesame Street look more realistic than the characters populated in this movie.The story is icomprehesable. There is absolutely no suspense.

I thought it was going to be much better than it was. The special effects were good, but overly flashy. The presence of the annoying Jar Jar Binks wasn't needed and just took away from the development of the other characters.

This is the first film I saw in over a decade, literally, emerging from a self-imposed culture fast. My techno, pop culture, modern movie-making technics lack allowed me to see this film, not only as a connector to the original Star Wars (which blew my socks off seeing it in a first run theater so many eons ago) but as an incredible advance in movie making. Since this film I've had the pleasure of seeing a few more incredible movies that draw on the Marin people and Pixar.As for the story, it dragged in places and I wanted to see Liam Neelson do more acting.Who was the masked bad guy? Incredible technic. I would like to see him in action.Finally, Obiwan - it becomes clear from this snap shot that the faults of the teacher propagate and intensify as they pass through to the pupil. Fringe teacher (Gauwan) to rebellious student (Obiwan) to a break with law (Anakin).Thanks for a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why...

Some day I will meet you and tell you this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Beginning","review":"I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, the minuses being Jar Jar Binks and the acting of Jake Loyd. Otherwise, this was a terrific start to the saga. Perhaps the most exciting movie of all time, Lucas did a very good job in introducting us to the major players and where they came from. He didn't stoop to cheap sex, graphic violence, or shocking language to entertain. The pod race and the final duel stood out particularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jar-Jar Binks rules","review":"I first saw this movie on my tv. My first reaction was : what ?, why so much fuss about nothing ? The special-effects are very weak, you can see tranparencies on the screen ! The best actor in the movie is Jar-Jar, he could earn an oscar. There is no plot, the movie is dull and i fall asleep 30 minutes after the beginning. The movie looks like very old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor job, Lucas.","review":"Episode 1 is a MAJOR disappointment from the get go. It's not even worth 1 star, but I could not figure out how to give it a poorer rating. It lacks none of the depth and vision that the the 3 earlier movies did, and the story line is WEAK! The best part of the movie, and the sole reason why I bought it, is because of Jar Jar Bink's humourous antics. The robots with their stupid \\"roger, roger\\" are arsinine! And it is ludicrous for the technology to be \\"better\\" in the prequel, and worse in the supposedly subsequent movies. Episode 1 is more of a comedy than anything else. George: this movie is nothing more than a greedy attempt on your part to rip the die-hard Star Wars fans off. Aren't you rich enough already? Why don't you get with the programme and make the next movie a little more sensible? And please, take those stupid robots out of there."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beginning of the Destruction of the Franchise","review":"George Lucas really cannot write or direct.

But even the special effects are wasted on a weak plot and some mediocre acting (mainly the kid who plays Anakin Skywalker). The pod race scene was nice as well as the underwater world, but overall, something just seems to be missing. The movie doesn't really go anywhere in the end. The other Star Wars films were much more focused and exciting. The Phantom Menace was good on the big screen, but after watching it on video, I grew sick of the film immediately. The film is average and if you didn't see it in the theater, then don't bother with the video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film, Greedy Lucas","review":"George Lucas knew very well that making VHS edition is much cheaper then the DVD. So he made 1.5 million of these he knows will sell like hotcakes. Then he will make the DVD and everyone will buy that too(rightfully so).

The only thing that kept me from giving the movie 5 stars was some of the silly humor. Also, I thought John Williams' score was exceptional - a highlight of the movie for me - I would highly recommend the CD. Speaking of the music - for those of you with keen hearing, listen carefully to the very end when the last of the credits are rolling - you'll hear an ominous yet familiar sound. . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"But no DVD?","review":"The sole purpose of my DVD purchase was to buy the P.M. when it came out, and to eagerly await the original trilogy's jump to DVD. Apparently, I may be a long time waiting, as Lucas has no plans for it to be released on DVD...Or is this perhaps another ploy to sell the video, then re-release it six months later with deleted scenes, and then re-re-release it again on DVD 5 years from now?People can kick and scream and complain about PM, but the fact is, it was brilliantly cast, directed and produced with some of the most incredible CG work in the world.

Example: When Naboo is invaded, Droid fighters fly past the palace (in the movie). On video, you hear but do not see and the focus on the queen looking out the window is a little jerky.Most reactions from actors on the side are missing as the action unfolds, etc.AVOID THIS VERSION LIKE THE PLAQUE.Lucas couldn't be bothered to put the time into the DVD version that he must have fallen asleep at the wheel on this version.

I rushed to see it and after the movie was over I sat there wondering \\"What the heck was that?\\" It was terrible. The whole story was ment to run on effects instead of a story line. Though it did follow the story I feel as though much of it was thrown together just around the computers and what they can do. The guy with the long ears (sorry don't know his name) was compleatly anoying and though he was there to be funny he was FAR from funny. Why does he need to be there? In the original Star Wars, there were no chars. added just for comic relief. They were funny on their own. I am not even sure if I will waste my time on the next one. It will probably be a waste of my time and 6 buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone please slap George Lucas","review":"We've all been hoodwinked! The movie was terrible in the theatres and it's even worse on DVD. Why? Because in addition to the insult to our collective intelligence that is the film, we are also treated to a pontificating George Lucas yapping about making movies on the extra features disc. The much ballyhooed 'deleted scenes' are nothing more than elaborations on the already terrible acting and \\"look what we can do\\" special effects in the movie. Worse though, George Lucas drones on about how 'difficult it was to cut these scenes'. Please, let me at it, I have no such compunctions.

It was as anothe reviewer said \\"tedious and boring\\", that was at it's best. As far as I am concerned this movie ruined the spirit of the original trilogy for me, and destroyed the Star Wars mystique in my mind. When you compare Liam Neeson's role in \\"Rob Roy\\" to this disaster, you can see it Liams eyes, he appeared almost embarassed to be there. I was at first miffed that this was not released on DVD. After seeing it on VHS ( it was hideous ) I say to Lucas: \\"don't bother\\". This is the space version of \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" I usually at least finish a movie when I see it, but this was an exception, I was bored silly about midway.

I thought the way the movie gave clues to Anakin's future was well done. Darth Maul was by far in my opinion the best part of this film. Where have you see Episode 1 merchandice without his menacing face plastered on it? The effects were specatuclar as usual. The fight scenes were very complex and well done. My only complaint is the too much may happen in the last 1/4 of the movie. It's a bit overwhelming.

The interplay of the Leroi Moore on the sax and Boyd Tinsley on violin over Dave's amazing guitar melodies simply are amazing with Carter Beauford laying down some sick drum beats.

You listen because you want to hear where the music is going to take you. That's the beauty of this album. No boring parts, nothing to a pattern save the Bands high standards of musicianship.

The fresh, sophisticated sounds are easy to fall in love with, and the album manages to hold onto its irresistable sound without experiencing any of the dull immaturity of most contemporary popular music.

All true fans have got to buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave & Company \\"rock\\" the Alternative world!","review":"Out of all of the albums that I own, \\"Under The Table And Dreaming\\" has got to be the absolute best. \\"Ants Marching\\" is a totally addicting tune; you hear it once, and you'll want to hear it again and again. And out of all the love songs I've heard before, the opening track, \\"The Best Of What's Around\\", is the greatest song that all non-DMB fans have never heard. All in all, its mix of catchy, radio-friendly tunes (What Would You Say?) and more alternative-like songs (Jimi Thing), along with Dave's unique singing voice, make for an awesome album.P.S. Carter Beauford rocks the free world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"I don't like most of what DMB has put out in recent years, but his early work is quite good. Ants Marching is simply a masterpiece. A good album to have for any music fan, even if you don't care much for most of DMB's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes me melt!","review":"I've had this CD for a number of years, and am just getting to reading some of the reviews now. I have to say that this is my favorite CD of all times. As many of the other reviews mention, it has a strong mix of eclectic \\"sing-along\\" type songs, and then songs like \\"Lover Lay Down\\" that makes you want to kick back and absorb the song. My personal favorite is Typical Situation...and who cannot include Dancing Nancies. What a pick-me-up song that is! This is one of those timeless albums that I love, my mother would love, and even my baby son loves, and will hopefully enjoy, once he has a chance to pick his own music! One word of advice...do not judge this CD by \\"Best of What's Around.\\" While this is a great song, it's my least favorite on the entire album. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Love","review":"This was the first DMB \\"album\\" I bought many years ago and it's still my all time fav. This one has so many of my fav DMB songs, I never get tired of listening to it! Getting such a good deal on the mp3 version from Amazon was an added bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best of what's around (in music that is)","review":"If there's only one space left in your CD rack, don't pass up this CD. The style of music is hard to define but if you like a jazzy feel to your music, with an added acoustic sound, any DMB CD WOULD SUFFICE. But this CD is a great starter to what I know will become a collection.(I also recommend Live @ Redrocks too! )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Matthews Band, you can't go wrong","review":"This Cd is excellent. From \\"The best of what's around\\" to the \\" # 36 \\" this cd will make you feel good and experince the fun to listing a band with great melodies and lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare CD","review":"I love DMB. I have this CD and \\"Crash\\", but I definitly prefer this one. It's one of those rare CD's (Like \\"Zoot Suit Riot: The Swinging Hits of the Cherry Poppin Daddies\\") that you can listen to all the way through, enjoy every song just as much as the last one, and sing along with all of them-since it's so addictive you have to memorize all the lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful easy-listening album...DMB at their best by far...","review":"I bought this gem of an album nearly two years ago and I still give it a listen almost every day. It is the perfect blend of lyrics and awesome instrumentals that will keep you in a positve attitude. Tracks like \\"The Best of What's Around\\" and \\"Satellite\\" are truly uplifting. I have not yet met someone who does not like this-just about everyone can enjoy these guys. \\"What Would You Say?\\" and my favorite \\"Ants Marching\\" also appear. Give it a listen and you will agree, its worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Awsome","review":"Dave Matthews Band's under the table and dreaming is a winner through and through. From the up beat meaningless learics of \\"What would you say\\" to the slow mealodious sound of \\"Satelite,\\" this CD rocks. Buy it now; you'll love it I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"best dave studio","review":"although i believe that LIVE AT LUTHER is his best album, this is dave's best studio work. it seems that the two releases since this (CRASH, AND BEFORE THESE CROWDED STREETS) fail to grasp the freshness of UNDER THE TABLE... i am now eagerly awaiting his next studio album, with the high hopes that dmb can make another gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"oh yeah","review":".Dave took me a while to get used to, but this cd kicks tail. The awesome instrumentals hopefully will inspire today's popculture to higher hights.Catch a ride on a Satellite!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Sooo good","review":"Well I'd like to first start by saying this is my first DMB album. I had difficulty choosing between this album and crash, but there both excellent choices, you can't go wrong. Anyway, this is an amazing. Every song is hypnotic and and just puts you in a trance you don't want to get of. My personal favorites are jimi thing, dancing nancies, and rhyme and reason. Trust me and everyone else who reviewed this album correctly, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Dave","review":"This is by far the best Dave Matthews Band cd ever. I love every single song on this cd (usually on the other ones there is 1 or 2 songs that i think are okay) this cd is a must have if you are a fan of DMB. Some of the better songs on this cd are: satellite, best of what's around, jimi thing, and ants marching."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Man, I just got this album and it's so amazing! I don't know why I had never bought it before! Every song is great! I own Red Rocks,Crash, and Everyday and so far this one is the best!(Well more like a tie with live at red rocks) Some of the best songs on this are Ant's Marching, Dancing Nancies, Jimi Thing, What Would You Say, and Best Of What's Around....as you can see this album has many great tracks and it's well worth your money! I was kind of worried that it wouldn't be as good as \\"crash\\" and it isn't! It's better! The sound and the attitude of the dmb was just great on this album and so far this is the best dmb(studio)album ever. No fan of the dmb should be without this one. It's simply a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overrated by fans, underrated by critics","review":"Yes, Dave Matthews is so bandwagon that it makes me sick sometimes, but as much as I'd love to dislike his band, they keep winning me over. Unlike some other jam bands, they have excellent chemistry and know how to write decent melodies. As for this CD, there are really no weak points. Every song is solid and without the saccharine overproduction that plagues Crash and Before These Crowded Streets. I can't even provide any standouts because the album has such a nice flow. You can just turn it on and let it play without worrying about having to skip over an annoying track (with the possible exception of \\"Rhyme and Reason\\" which IS a bit overdramatic). I've been listening to Dave for about ten years now, and though I've gone through several music listening phases in that time frame, I have always enjoyed the songs on this CD. Also very good and is the often-overlooked \\"Remember Two Things.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Matthews Band-One of the most innovative new sounds","review":"Don't let anyone fool you-this is the best cd available by Dave. It beats Crash and Before These Crowded Streets any day of the week. Along with the radio staples: What Would You Say, Ants Marching, and Satellite, there are also many other songs that you will enjoy. My personal favorite is Rhyme and Reason, which is one of the most intense songs ever by this band. You can almost feel the driving insanity of this tune. This cd is well worth your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very talented","review":"when dave matthews came out with this album, he knew what he was doing. he has put out one of the best albums in the 90's. dmb and pearl jam are two of the most under rated bands of this eraboth are creative and talented. if you don't have this album go buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag me with a violin.","review":"Original?

I was working at a venue that hosted DMB and there were cars flipped over and then set on fire in the parking lot. The ironic thing was a few weeks previously we had Marilyn Manson and the riot police and protesters were in full force and the worst incident was a teen getting busted with some drug or another.But the more I think of it the less it shocks me that there are riots and fires and chaos at DMB shows... it's basically Woodstock for frat boys, and what better way to celebrate the band you love after a couple rounds of flip cup than to go out and flip cars? Oh I know a better way! Light them on fire afterwards! ALL RIGHT, DMB ROCKS!!!!!! WOOOO!!!!!!!!One thing I REALLY don't understand is the \\"WOOOOO!\\" Why is it every time you show a crowd of these people on camera the only thing they can do is shout \\"WOOOO?\\"Anyway, enjoy the CD. This band has enough albums to make a complete set of coasters."},{"rating":"1","title":"i know, your busy...","review":"I understand that most people don't have the time to really listen to music. You've got a family, mortgage payments, and a career. Who has the time for music? So one day you turn on the radio and there he is, Dave Matthews. You think 'wow this is catchy' and buy the album. Enjoy it but please, I emplore you, do not refer to this music important or meaningful. It is low-key pop for the masses. Reminiscent of Hootie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not half-behinded!","review":"This CD isn't just a half-behinded attempt at being annoying--this is FULLY, 100% STUPID! The lyrics stumble over each other like blind kittens and the music slithers out your speakers like sewage polluting a river. Someone should horsewhip whatever record company that signed these morons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How refreshing to know other people see through DMB","review":"I was curious to see what people had to say about DMB and so read some of the reviews on this page. How refreshing to know that a few other discerning listeners see how vacuous this band's music is. All of the jazzy instrumental stuff is a straight lift from early 1970s fusion. Add to that Dave's laughable attempts to appear sensitive and soulful. I saw them play on PBS and it seemed like all the blond co-eds in attendance knew the lyrics and were marveling about how well DM wrote about women. The poor things.....DMB is one of those groups whose widespread appeal is really annoying to anyone who knows anything about music. Is it possible to give negative stars as a rating?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Under the table and sleeping","review":"This album is a snooze. I had it for like three months when it came out. I no longer have it. What does that tell you? That the songs on this CD are forgettable tripe that deserves to sit in used and cut-out bins for the rest of eternity. If all the squawking horns on this album don't give you headaches, then Dave Matthew's donkey-with-pinched-nose vocals will. I've heard better music by street performers. In a word: atrocious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't compare to their new stuff.","review":"If you want to see how the DMB developed into the great band they are today, go ahead. But I was very disappointed with this album. I hate to say anything bad about them because I love their music so much, but I really hate this album. I own it, but in all honesty I never listen to it. That's why the rating is a little harsh. It's not that I haven't tried. Even the other day I gave it another listen, but I simply don't like it and don't see why everyone else does. The new stuff is so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIE YUPPIE SCUM","review":"Dave Matthews Band is easily the worst band in existence. The vocals make me shudder to think that my eardrums will soon heal after I stabbed them out after hearing this. It is awful, and every suburban teenage yuppie is singing along to this album in their Ford Explorer, proclaiming \\"YEAH MAN DAVE IS LIKE SOOOO RAD!\\". 0 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album to get to know this band by.","review":"This was the first cd by this band I had purchased. There are no bad songs to be found here. \\"Dancing Nancies\\" is a great pick me up song. Each song has wonerful groove power. You can not help but sing and dance along. If you would like to get to know this band this is the cd to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"blissful","review":"I think a lot of people will agree with me that 'blissful' is the perfect word for this album, and really for the DMB in general. I don't know how they manage to make us fall in love with them, but it's there somehow. Just run the whole CD through, it's all good. Especially 'jimi thing'. That song makes me feel high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Music","review":"Hands down the best album the Dave Matthew's Band has ever released. From my personal favorite, Dancing Nancies, to the common Ants Marching, this album has it all. The band's style of music is unlike any other, and get's you dancing. The jazzy, alternate rock is so unique, it's hard not to like this album. I highly recommend this style of music, friendly to all ages, with the exception of some drug relations, to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair","review":"State Fair.

It was also interesting to read how hard Peters tried to find a name that couldn't be linked to anyone else.

Biewald's characters have to scrape and struggle for every scrap of luck. They dangle love in front of each other and then snatch it away.But don't worry: this isn't just a portrait of dysfunctional behavior.

This includes such things as whipping, spanking, caning, hot wax, electrodes, clothes pins, body piercings, etc. It only results in her \\"pleasure\\". They don't have a physical relationship. The only relationship they have is him inflicting pain and humiliating her. Bottomline, if you are into S & M like this, you'll probably like it.

The other thing, is that our crib has curved edges and the mobile hangs at an angle because of this so we had to cut a piece of styrofoam to keep it standing straight.

While the Vikings are certainly remembered, few histories that mention them go into much details about the actual culture. Wolf gives a broad sweep through what is known to specialist historians. We see the cultural affinities between the Vikings in Scandinavia and the societies in Germany and eastern Europe.The book also describes the visual art. Most of which appears on functional items as decorative emblems. Very applied, as Wolf puts it. The book has several photos of Viking artifacts. Nice, but perhaps some of these should have been in colour. And more of them.The role of slavery is also examined. Not race-based, as it was in America. But the thrall or chattel slavery practised by the Vikings was arguably just as brutal. The book also points out much that still remains unknown, like their legal system. Little has survived in writing to attest to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a very biased book.","review":"While I enjoyed reading this book for my research, I was disgusted by the author's constant references to Christianity as a better religon than the pagan traditions of the Vikings.

The author constantly makes comments such as, \\"The viking raids were caused by the poor resources of the region, but eventually ceased when Christianity was introduced and the Vikings became more satisfied with their lot in life.\\"I intend to write a long letter to the publisher about the editor's inability to remove religious commentary from a book concerning the history of a people.

Most of the songs on this album are catchy, and makes you wanna dance and sing along. If you liked her hit \\"I wanna be with you\\" then you'll surely love the other great ballads and dance hits on this cd. My favorites are #2, 3, 7, 9, and 13. The best songs would have to be #6 and 11. She has matured so much and it shows in this album. She'll be standing out from those soon to be tiring out pop Britney and Christina. So please check out her cd, you won't regret it. A wonderful addition for a summer road trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No words can possibly describe how much Mandy has improved","review":"Mandy Moore's improvement on this CD is incredible. She doesn't sound like a little kid belting out somebody else's tunes anymore, she sounds like someone who really knows how to sing. She has a remarkably gentle touch on a couple of the songs (notably \\"You Remind Me\\") which I've never heard on either of her previous albums (I have both of them). As a matter of fact, if I didn't know it was Mandy Moore, I would've never guessed it. It's amazing, you really have to hear it to believe it. Good job Mandy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but not going with her strength","review":"There's no question. Mandy Moore has a great voice. Her most powerful piece on this CD is \\"Cry.\\" This is because it focuses on her voice. She has some great tunes on this CD, and enjoy most of the songs on it. But, she needs to step up more. Several of her songs, she is drowned out by background vocals and music. She's kind of like Celine Dion, in that she does some good rock stuff, but her strength is in the ballads and where she is the primary vocal. Hopefully, she will go with this. \\"Only Hope\\" (not on this CD) and \\"Cry\\" are by far her two best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing up, slowly and surely","review":"After purchsing Mandy's last 2 albums, I was sure that I'd hear her next single all over the radio. Nope. I think I heard it once, and after listening to the album a few times I say it's a shame that radio hasn't embraced it more. \\"Hand in my Pocket\\" sounds nothing like anything else out there, and that's a good thing.So, Mandy may not do vocal acrobatics, but she still has a very pretty, silky voice. It doesn't matter that she's not reaching for a high c, she can sing. And, she seems to still be having fun, unlike some of her counterparts.As for the restof the album, I really enjoy a lot of the songs, but the one that I'm unsure about so far is \\"Split Chick.\\" The rest are good quality pop music. Fun, easy to dance to, and they bring a smile to your face. It also helps that you can \\"hear\\" her smile!So, fave songs? \\"Pocket,\\" \\"17,\\" \\"It Only Took a Minute\\" and \\"Crush.\\" I'm sure I'll end up loving the whole album, as I did her other two.Nice job Mandy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM!","review":"This is the best out of all 3 of her albums.in my pocket-a nice south eastern sound great productionyou remind me-not like usher's it's a good song not to fast not to slow just rightsaturate me-kinda like in my pocket it has a south eastern sound it's a cathcy songone sided love-good but not great17-interesting balladcry-pretty love songcrush-we all have gone through that about loving someone but not being able to tell them this is a good songit only took a minute-this has a catchy tune and chorus the best song on the albumturn the clock around-this is a nice up-tempo songyo-yo-good but not the bestfrom loving you-wrriten by diane warren this is a nice balladsplit chick-this is a good fast songwhen i talk to you-a beautiful ballad co-wrriten by mandy it is better than the song co-wrriten by britney spears \\"Dear diary\\"get this cd it is worth the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandy strikes a chord--a middleeastern one!","review":"As a pop conneseur, I do know good pop from a one-hit-wonder. Mandy here has a thing going--and her new CD is a testament to it. Every track is delicious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better luck next time","review":"There is no doubt she got talent but unforunately most of the songs she's been making are very dull. It's more of less Pop even though some songs are a little diffrent. \\"In my pocket\\" is a good and catchy up tempo song. Many songs are ballads(not so good one's though) and the rest are more or less typical pop. \\"Cry\\" is a decent ballad however. Emilio Estefan Jr has been writing many songs we also got yet another ballad by Diane Warren \\"From Loving you\\", perhaps Mandy Moore should have called Max Martin cause atleast with his stuff she sould have got a few hits or maybe she should get more into soul-pop like Christina Aguilera did, her voice is good enough for a try. She got the talent but she's not into the right kind of music yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"This is such a great CD. Mandy's voice has greatly improved and the use of Middle-eastern vibes sounds so great with her voice. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandy sounds great live!","review":"While I haven't heard the album, I'm basing the review on two live television performances Mandy gave in Melbourne, Australia, in the last couple of days.I'm an unashamed fan of pop and 'In My Pocket' happens to be one of my current favourites. However, Mandy's voice in the live performance was sometimes lost due to the heavy middle-eastern sounds.It was the live 'unplugged' performance of 'Crush' where her voice really shone through. I'm no expert but she sounded incredibly sincere.Mandy was interviewed before performing 'Crush' and showed a level of maturity, intelligence and 'realness' which coming from a teenage pop star was really refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Artist","review":"I'm not going to waste my time or yours by reviewing songs individually. The bottom line is this: in a sea of blonde hair and fairly indistinguishable pop divas, Mandy Moore stands out? Why, because she sounds different, looks different and with this album proves she IS different. This is so much more than your run-of-the-mill pop record. Moore has picked interesting songs and infused them with exotic beats. While everyone else is still pushing the Latin beats, Moore has moved on to Arabic influence and the result is a surprisingly refreshing CD. Moore shows she's continually evolving as an artist in her music choice, vocal stylings, and range of mastery. She excels at layered harmony, often sings on the downbeat which is harder and more engaging, and in general shows what a 17 year old with talent and VISION can accomplish. Check this one out. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sooooo goooood!","review":"Mandy Moore is such an amazing singer!After her song,Only Hope,from A walk to remember,I think its obvious how talented she is.I didn't start listeing to her til recently,because til 2002 (about)all I listened to was country.So now I am in love with all bubblegum pop,but especially Mandy Moores music.17 and From Loving you are my favorites on this album.I know a lot of people thought she was a Britney Spears wanna be,but Mandy Moore has a much much much better voice,and her music is much more catchy and sweet.I LOVE \\"I wanna be with you\\" on her 2000 album.Its innocent but still sultry,and its so fun to sing lol.I really just wish she would come out with a new album.I don't like her Coverage songs too much.Kinda boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a pop fan - but love this cd!!","review":"I normally don't like pop music --never have-- but I did find myself with this cd as a holiday gift when it came out, and I loved almost all the songs. They're upbeat and easy to sing to. And, as much as I do love Mandy Moore's movies, I've never been a fan of her music besides this album. I still have the words stuck in my head all these years later, so am about to re-purchase the cd :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"MANDY RULZ!","review":"I Love this CD it makes me so happy when I'm sad. My fav songs are In My Pocket, Saturate Me, Crush and Split Chick. I met Mandy at the Mall Of America in Bloomington, MN. she was so cool! I think she is a way better role-model for little girls rather than Britney Spears who dresses kinda (bad)(don't get me wrong I still like her!, Hey I'm going to her concert!) well anyway I totally reccomend this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"That's Mandy Moore Singing? O.o","review":"I've never been a Mandy Moore fan, in fact I thought she would be one of the last pop divas to successfully make it into the market because she had the least vocal talent and was one of the youngest. The only song of hers I ever remotely liked was 'I wanna be with you' from the movie Center Stage. Then I listened to this CD-- it took a listen or two, but pretty soon I had to admit that her singing was pretty good and the songs quite enjoyable and not as annoying as I would have expected from her. The songs are well balanced and everything on the CD in general is listenable. After going though a lot of albums lately that are disappointing aside from the singles they hold this CD was a welcomed treat. I give it 4 stars out of 5 only because Mandy can still improve vocally and perhaps as she matures further, her music will get better too. If you like pop you should definitely check out this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandy rocks!!!!","review":"I can't really tell that I was a Mandy fan before but when I heard In My Pocket and Crush on the radio I decided to buy the album.To my amazement the album turned out to be best album out there.The songs like n My Pocket and One Sided Love are sure to make you dance.Also Cry and Crush are guarenteed to make you melt.The cd also comes with the ASTONSHNG vid of n My Pocket.n my opinion mandy is better than any of the pop princesses out there both in voice and look .All in all I recommend this album to the ones who like pop music and also eastern sounds.."},{"rating":"1","title":"great voice","review":"I have to say, I was a little disappointed as I first listened to this CD, because the first Songs I knew from Mandy were those from the Soundtrack \\"a walk to remember\\", which -in my oppinion- are much more powerful and whith much more feeling.She has a fantastic voice!!!I was wondering if this is her stile, some of the Songs on this Album have a oriental touch somehow.I like the Song 17 though, it has something very melodic.Another thing I didn't liked that much is, how they show her on the pictures in the booklet.She is just a girl!!!I believe that there are a lot of sexy clothes, wich do not show so much skin and still look good on her, since she has a perfekt figure.I have a lot of respect for the work she does and I love her movie\\"a walk to remember\\".You go, girl!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mandy Moore","review":"As a fan of pop music, I really didn't like this cd. It is very different than her usual style. I think that she will loose a lot of fans that liked her hit song \\"Candy.\\" On this cd her voice was kinda annoying and the songs are all basically slow, sappy, and the few fast ones are middle eastern styled. It seems that she is trying too hard to get away from the \\"pop\\" section. What is wrong with pop music anyway? She liked it though when she was selling her records and making lots of money. I can give her credit for trying on this cd, but is seems like she is trying too hard to be Nelly Furtado- but with songs like \\"Yo-Yo\\" it just wasn't working. I guess if you are a big fan of her music you'll buy it anyway. But if you liked Mandy's old sound I'd say check out Jessica Simpson's new cd. It is really great and she has got an awesome voice!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing!","review":"I got this album two summers ago, and loved it. Then, now, two summers later, I have matured a lot, and am over this kind of music in general. I recently listened to this, and I couldn't make it all the way through the songs (I would listen to each song halfway through). They got really repetitive, and it was just some pop fluff. No depth whatsoever as far as I can tell. When I was a big fan, it never occured to me that Mandy didn't write any of the songs (one of you said she wrote \\"Split Chick,\\" no wonder it sucks). So what's the point if she didn't even write it? Hell knows. Don't bother. Try Fefe Dobson instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too annoying","review":"i would prefer if she found a new word to rhyme with mandy besides candy. how can you compare someone like mandy moore to the greats like celine, whitney and faith?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Different isn't always better","review":"The first time I heard this album I said to myself that it was a little different, and I guess I kinda liked it because of that. But to be perfectly honest this album never found its way back into my CD player after that. Her voice is far from incredible, and the songs are all pre-fabricated to suit her breathy, sugary voice and that got really old. Although the traditional teen-pop songs may finally be getting old, the material on this album will not be able to carry Mandy into the next generation as hard as she may try. At this point in her career, she is more of and actress and a personality than a musician. Already there are signs that this album will be a flop, and just because it is different doesn't mean it will be successful. I admire Mandy's attempt to be different (or rather her song-writers attempt to be different), but that doens't mean I have to like the album, cuz it is already in my CD pile that I will rarely play again."},{"rating":"1","title":"ah another one","review":"there isn't much wrong with this cd but then again there isn't much right with this cd as well.What Mandy Moore really needs is a breakthrough hit,like the brilliant 'one more time' that song established Britney as a star and made sure that whatever she did after didn't have to be very good(and it isn't).What makes this album so unlistenable isn't that its awful(pink) or that there are too many ballads(aguilera) or even the fact that it is soulless R'n'B(brandy,keys etc etc) no its the mediocrity,the fact that she tries everything and falls just way short."},{"rating":"1","title":"2-1/2 stars -- Here's the problem...","review":"When Mandy Moore first came out, her lyrics were okay but the singing wasn't so good (remember \\"Candy\\"?). I didn't hear her second album I Wanna Be With You - or maybe I did, because some of the songs from her first album are on it. On her self-titled album her singing has definitely improved, but as for the lyrics...The only song where Mandy's singing and the lyrics go hand in hand is the very last one, \\"When I Talk To You\\". \\"Cry\\" is okay too, and \\"Crush\\" is tolerable, but nothing else really impresses. Diane Warren's \\"From Loving You\\" isn't all it's cracked up to be, and to this day I don't know what \\"In My Pocket\\" is about. \\"Split Chick\\" is ridiculous, while \\"Yo-Yo\\" and \\"Saturate Me\\" are metaphoric mistakes.Maybe Mandy should get some better writers if she wants to stand out in the crowd. Because if she keeps going at this rate, people will probably just dismiss her and her albums as disposable pop mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"An artist...","review":"Finaly we have a woman (only 17) who has a beautiful voice and has great songs... It has a great oriental touch all through the album. You can really tell that Mandy has matured. Her first 2 cd's are great. But nothing can compare to this. This is not the best cd I bought this year.... But it sure is second best. Way to go Mandy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her new stuff is much better! Don't waste your money.","review":"Her new stuff is so much better than her old stuff, this cd does not show her talent much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its alright.","review":"This CD I woudlent recommend for everyone. Expecially those who just cants tand Pop Queen Brittney Spears. There are some good songs like \\"Crush\\" and \\"In My Pocket\\" With a nice flashy beat. But songs like \\"One sided love\\" Just really make no sence! 'One sided love is never gonna work, lemme show a way that Im sure it'll never hurt' something like that but its not right. I wouldent really recommend it for most people though"},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks anything special.","review":"Over The Years, there have been many teen girl singers.

She went totally downhill with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time....","review":"I'm really sorry I let my friend talk me into buying this C.D.So, now she can have it! I can't even begin to describe how poor I thought this CD was. There were no redeeming qualities too it.Until Mandy can develop her voice and get some quality material, she should stick to modeling and spare us having to listen her any Moore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"is all i have to say. There are so many songs on here that are just simply incredible. It's a shame that 'Mandy Moore' hasn't done that great on the charts. It debuted at number 35 and soon started to fall. BUT! It has already gone GOLD (500,000 copies).Some of the stand out songs on the album are In My Pocket, which was the first single, 17 which I can see as prom song next year, When I Talk To you which Mandy wrote, and One Sided Love which has a rock feel to it. I'm not sure Mandy can top this one. But she has already guaranteed she would on her official website. Trust me, if you don't want to buy it just because it's \\"MANDY MOORE,\\" you're missing out on something. Mandy should receive a grammy for this wonderful album. Just buy it and see for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mandy takes it to a new level","review":"Mandy Moore's third album, \\"mandy moore,\\" is great. her style pays off with songs like \\"one-sided love\\" and \\"yo-yo\\"; \\"yo-yo\\" is a much better song than the title makes it sound to be. the stand-out tracks are \\"in my pocket,\\" \\"saturate me,\\" and \\"one-sided love.\\" but MY favorite songs are \\"cry,\\" \\"crush,\\" \\"it only took a minute,\\" \\"you remind me,\\" \\"turn the clock around,\\" \\"split chick,\\" \\"17,\\" AND \\"in my pocket,\\" \\"saturate me,\\" and \\"one-sided love.\\" the other two songs i left out are \\"from loving you,\\" and \\"when i talk to you.\\" They're okay, but i don't think diane warren is such of a great songwriter and \\"when i talk to you\\" is long and draggy. so that's what i think and see ya!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandy's Best","review":"I think this was Mandy's best album. I can't wait for her knew one \\"Coverage\\". I see how bad she wants to break away from that bubble gum pop image. I dont even know why people still catagorize her as that because that music genre has just faded out.My least favorite song on the album was From Loving You, i still liked it and it was really beautiful though. The Best songs i thought were Saturate Me and Yo-Yo. Its a tough decidion to pick my fav bcuz there are many good songs(Crush, Cry, 17...)If i were in a plane crash and only 3 CDs remained, id want Mandy Moore's to be of themI absolutely love Mandy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good water pump!","review":"I've been using it within the frame of a week now and so far it's doing great.

The little filter has plenty power,circulates the water very well, runs pretty quietly and does a decent job with keeping the water clear. One problem is that that part of the filter is clear and you can always see all the filth that's inside and algae has started to grow in mine and seems impossible to clean out; it just doesn't look good.The next problem is that the way its made it has an opening in the front that my feeder minnows can swim into. I lose more fish by them swimming into the filter getting stuck inside and dying than I am by the turtle eating them. Luckily my turtle has gotten larger and it's now time to upgrade. If it wasn't for this problem this filter wouldn't be too shabby for a small turtle or amphibian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 1 week","review":"This filter does not do very well with smaller substrates. My cascade filter died after about 1 week of use, and the motor was totally shot. The filter circulated the water well with a good flow rate, but this probably contributed to its substrate intake and demise.

The display failed after about two years. This happened while the clock was sitting on my night table and was not the result of mechanical impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything it promises","review":"I have owned this clock for a few months now, and have found it remarkable. I recently turned it on while in the Berkshire Mountains. I was not expecting it to receive information from the atomic clock, and was pleased with the easy manual-set option. But, sure enough, 36 hours later it had synchronized and has been 100% on time ever since.One pleasant surprise: when the clock is in its standing position (folded, not flat), a light tap to the top of the clock turns on the backlight for a few seconds. This is due to the clever placement of the backlight button. I love this feature because I can roll over, swing for the clock, and head back to sleep without having to fumble for a button.The clock is lightweight and folds into a flat position; it comes with a soft travel case to protect the screen.In a product such as this, all one can ask is that it works as it claims; Oregon Scientific delivers tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"I purchased this item to replace a very tiny and easy to use travel alarm clock I have used for many years. I travel more than 100,000 miles a year, and began looking for something both relatively small but especially something easy to use. I didn't need a lot of bells, buzzers, and whistles. I received the clock and it appeared relatively straight forward. Trying it at home before traveling the clock re-adjusted time zones repeatedly. I seriously doubt my night stand is moving time zones, so this appeared to be the first glitch. After traveling to a near by city by air (within the same time zone) the clock simply died. It is less than a month old. I would suggest you look elsewhere and not consider something that has multiple issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice battery-powered alarm clock","review":"The Oregon Scientific RM8328 is a nice advance in technology and design over their previous versions. It's an alarm clock that will still work after an power failure, and always has the correct time. This model is easier to use than their older RM116E, with the time zone button moved to the back so you won't hit it accidentally. It is far easier to use than the SkyScan 31269 which has buttons that are too easy to hit accidentally, and requires too many button presses in a complex sequence for settings. The radio receiver seems to be more sensitive than previous models, and picks up the time signal quickly. This is a small \\"travel\\" model, but OK for everyday use. I wish they had this same design with an even larger screen with bigger numbers for easier viewing without glasses. It's well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"fragile","review":"In the dark I nudged it off my 2ft high night stand onto a carpeted floor.

If you want accuracy and convenience, spend more money and get a more complex and reliable monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"This device is useless for monitoring pulse during activity.

When I first purchased it I thought I had a defective unit so I returned it for a new one. The new one has not worked any better. The readings are not at all accurate, either very low or very high. Much of the time it doesn't give a reading at all. I purchase this to use at the gym while doing my cardio workout.

Unfortunately, once the dislodgement occurs, it will happen again. I do not know if this is a coincidence, but I previously owned a cheap hoya 72mm circular polarizer on my 28-125 canon lens and the front element just fell down the second day and the glass broke into pieces!

When rotated for most saturation in skies etc, 'flat' tones become uneven and blotchy and there is huge vignetting when zooming anywhere around 18 to 24mm -- even stopped down to f22. My guess if that the vignetting wouldn't happen on a telephoto lens (with a narrower angle of view); however, my other guess is that the uneven and blotchy tones would still happen. Grrr. Lesson learned. There's no point AT ALL having a high quality (-ish in the case of the Tokina) lens if you're then going to hobble it with a less than top-notch filter, and this really is a less than top-notch filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will laugh so hard!!!","review":"The Year of Yes is true to life because it captures all of the craziness of dating without getting bogged down by it.

Not only was it fun, it was well-written, hilarious, and utterly personal. I also found that the author's plight (a life filled with negativity and a tendency toward 'no' a la Nora Joyce) hit close to home: Who hasn't found herself sick to death of rejecting all that life has to offer?

Half the time, I had no idea what the heck she was referring to, or what it had to do with dating.When I initially heard of the book, I thought it was a great premise. For some reason, I had assumed that the author was older during her experiment, because (in my opinion) a 20-year-old in college sleeping around for a year and experimenting with dating (including women) is normal.

The unit is very handy for monitoring high and low temperatures and has high and low alarms to let you know when limits are exceeded. I am disappointed in the quality. The hygrometer in the main unit always reads 9-10% humidity from the day I started using it. (I know this is not the case as I live in a very humid area.) The remote units began to fail after 2 years of use. For some reason their signal is no longer received by the main unit even within a foot of each other and both with new batteries.

Unfortunately there is no provision to calibrate these units. A simple variable resistor would have made that possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to base unit!","review":"We already have the base unit for this product and have previously added another sensor which worked so well, that we have now added a third sensor.

I didn't watch the last three seasons of Buffy so I don't know if he was like this on the show but in the book he acted like Buffy's lovesick puppy dog, following her everywhere and begging to be loved. It was pathetic. Spike was best as a bad guy. The minute they put that damn chip in his brain, it seems like the character became truly pathetic.If you don't mind a wimpy Spike then buy this book. Its good."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ain't Buffy, and it SURE ain't Spike!!!","review":"I don't know what restrictions the various authors work under in cranking out these tales, but they must have been created by someone who neither saw the show nor has any idea just who the majority of the fans are. Most of us are ADULTS, and we would really like to have our age group recognised. Look at the origonal episodes and the subject material they contained. These were stories written for and enjoyed by an audience considerably more mature than the \\"young adult\\" market the books cater to. Many of us have passed our fifth decade, for cryng out loud.

So I ordered this one so I could easily see what time it was by just looking up at the ceiling. This model just wasn't the same. I couldn't get the projection to enlarge well enough for me to see the time on the ceiling. I also didn't like that I couldn't see the time without hitting snooze so it would light up long enough to see the time. I'm going to research and see if they still sale the older model and order it. I also ordered one for my 80 year old parents for a Christmas gift and they had the same complaint. But the return process was wonderful and I quickly got credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Useless","review":"The projection on the ceiling is much to small.

In addition, it is built like a piece of junk. Speaking of ambient, the vendor I bought it from, Ambient Weather, falsely advertised it as providing a bright clear projection, and when I complained they said I would have to pay the shipping both ways, and they would take 2-6 weeks to refund the purchase price. NOT a customer-oriented vendor. I don't advise buying anything from them.Again, don't bother buying the clock. It only encourages marketing of junk products."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pleasant blue glow","review":"For the amount you are paying, I'm not sure it is worth it. You might as well shell out a little more for a clock you can really be happy with. I have 2 gripes about this clock. The backlit is not a pleasant blue glow but a sickly greenish-yellow; since there is no setting to keep the backlight on, you need to press the snooze button to get it to light up. Second of all, if you are lying down with the clock facing you the projection on the ceiling is perpendicular to you so you either have to get used to it or turn your head sideways to read the time. The atomic clock does its thing, mine set itself after 5 min. I could also read the display on the ceiling well enough. No problems with clarity there just wish it was right side up. Now that I have done more looking around you can actually just pay 20 something dollars for basically the same product with LaCrosse, therefore I would say this product is overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oregon Scientific Projection Clock","review":"The clock's LCD display can not be read from across the room during daytime or even with an overhead light on in the evening.This could be corrected if the light that illuminates the clock face had an option to remain on. Currently, one hits the bar on the top of the clock and the clock face is illuminated for 5 seconds and then the light turns off. The second option would be to replace the LCD with an LED readout.Also, when using the projection feature the display is clearly visible, but it is reversed/upside down.

So if you set it up next to your bed to project on the ceiling, the numbers are sideways!-the projected numbers are half the size of the old model, and hard to read-the atomic radio is very weak, it couldn't find a signal after 30 minutes.

No matter where the clock was you could rotate the time on the ceiling so it could be read in bed.

The close layout of buttons is hard to use and the small base allows the clock to tip over when trying to adjust the settings or alarm. It keeps accurate time just fine through the atomic link, but sometimes the clock will reset itself to 12:00 and then take several hours to correct itself to the proper local time. Unfortunately, the red projection display has a short life expectancy as it will go out after about a year and there is no way to replace the bulb, LED, or laser (not sure what is used) that emits the light source. This is the second OS projection clock that I have owned, and both had projection lights that \\"died\\" after about a year. Due to these flaws, I can't recommend this product. Oregon Scientific commands relatively high prices for their products, but just doesn't deliver the quality you would expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read","review":"The projected image from this clock is too dim and too small to be comfortably read.

I was so mistaken for not taking heed! This is a terrible product. First, the project effect is minimal and impossible to see because there is ZERO magnification. Also, the clock and alarm settings are not intuitive at all and it makes using them frustrating.

The housing is cheap, thin plastic and the unit has no substantial weight or balance to it; so it falls over with the slightest knock or vibration to whatever it's sitting on. The first thing to go on all of these units was obviously the projection component. When it worked, it was pretty nice and easy to read. But as I said, the whole unit is so cheap you can almost hear rattling pieces inside the housing.Anyway, paying almost $300 for the three clocks and then getting a cheap product turned me off from buying anything more from Oregon Scientific.

All this does is to turn of the video. Also, putting Apple TV in standby mode requires pressing a button for 5 secods!!- The device in its current form is VERY VERY restricted. It is impossible to play anything that is not in iTunes and not MP4. Both cases do not really work for me since I have all my movies on a RAID - that includes family movies in Divx and MP4 and so Apple TV would force me to add all this to iTunes and convert it to MP4.But Apple being Apple, I don't think I'm in their taget market.

I highly reccomend this warmer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"I had one of these products when my baby was first born and it's just not worth the effort. The amount of water you are told to use seems to vary. Sometimes it warmed the bottle perfectly, sometimes got it way too hot, and sometimes didn't warm it at all and then I had to wait for the crazy thing to cool completely before trying again. Not to mention that very quickly, the numbers on the tube used to measure the water wore away and I had to guess. Finally, I quickly discovered that, when my baby gets hungry, I can mix a fresh bottle in about a minute, instead of waiting for this thing to take 4 or 5 minutes. There's no sense making a crying, hungry baby wait any longer than it has to."},{"rating":"1","title":"warming not reliable!","review":"I am quite disappointed w/this bottle warmer. First of all if you have Dr Brown's bottles this is not the warmer for you.... formula leaks out of the bottles during warming especially if you are warming them with the inner device (gas reducing unit) in the bottle... must be removed for warming or formula rises up the chamber & out of the bottle.

I try to set it so that I can turn it on, go change the baby then it would be ready. This method works occasionally but I get inconsistent results. Whenever the light turns off, the milk is still cold and I have to let it sit for another few minutes to finish warming. If I wait too long it's too hot, so I have to stand there and wait for it. Occasionally when I warm a bottle it somehow seems to boil the milk out if it. Don't know if the top of the bottle was loose or what but I'm finding it easier to just go back to sitting bottles in hot water from the tap. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess I didn't know any better","review":"When my wife and I first received and used this warmer we thought that this was a great product. Over time we soon realized that boiling the water to cause steam that heats the bottle is not optimal. It leaves a water residue on the bottle and more so on the warmer itself.

It was not until we tried the Avent warmer that we realized how the two are very different."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - Safety Concern for potential burning","review":"We used this product for one week.

My husband ended up scratching lines into the glass with a file."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why even bother?","review":"This bottle warmer was horrible. If you are formula-feeding, just use the microwave. Really. It takes so much less time, and all you have to do is shake the bottle really well to eliminate hotspots.This bottle warmer never heated bottles evenly. Sometimes they would be scalding hot, sometimes ice cold (and then you have to wait until it's completely cooled down before it will allow you to heat it again!). Not only that, but it always took a minimum of 5 minutes to heat the bottle. Meanwhile, my baby is screaming because he's hungry and wants that bottle!! The microwave only takes 30 seconds and it's the same temperature EVERY time.If you're heating expressed breastmilk I can see why someone would need a bottle warmer.Otherwise, what is the point??"},{"rating":"1","title":"not very effective","review":"I was looking forward to using this, but it did not function as I had hoped.

Also, I am breastfeeding, so I didn't need anything too elaborate for the occasional bottle. You do have to play around with the water amount and how long you leave the bottle in the warmer after it's done, but once you get this down, it's very quick and convenient. I agree that it was a little annoying not to be able to use it again right away if the bottle wasn't warm enough, but now that I am used to it, I can almost always get it right the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will fall in love with this life saver!","review":"Well, all I have to say is awesome! After 3 weeks of running the hot water over the bottle at 7 minutes each over 12 times a day for my newborn, I realized that running hot water for more than 1 full hour a day...my hot water bill was going to be outrageous. So I decided we needed a solution. I went to the store and bought this amazing product afer reading the reviews here online. Well of course you have to stand by it while it works. You have to do that if it is running under hot water or on the stove anyway!!! It is great! You fill it to the appropriate water level, put the bottle in, and press the button. When it is done it shuts off. You take it out, shake it up, test it, and you are ready to go in less than 3 minutes. I also noticed that some of these reviews that gave bad ratings are from 2002? The current model is much more advanced and improved than the last model."},{"rating":"2","title":"serves its purpose","review":"This bottle warmer serves its purpose just as well as the other more expensive warmers with bells and whistles. My baby sleeps through the night, so there was no need to have an insulated unit to keep bottles cooled overnight. Besides, I just pull bottles out of the refrigerator. The temperature doesn't come out exactly the same each time, but it does take the chill off the milk enough to satisfy my baby. It works great with all sizes of bottles, including Avent 9 oz bottles. Furthermore, this unit is smaller than other bottle warmers, therefore it doesn't take up too much countertop space. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is very good but it has it's drawbacks!","review":"I received this product as a gift from my Mother. It is great because it heats up the bottles within a reasonable time and it has an automatic shut-off system that ensures nothing will get over-heated. It is very portable, I move mine from the kitchen to the bathroom upstairs. Plus, it is wonderful for baby food jars. The only problems that I have encountered are that since it uses steam, it takes 10 minutes before you can use it again. When you have a really hungry baby, 10 minutes is just too much time to wait. Also, I have had it for 5 months now and have yet to master how much water to put in, either the milk and food jars stay pretty cool or they get too hot. Overall though, it is worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not warm enough","review":"I have this warmer and don't like it. The recommended amount of water (in the directions) isn't enough to heat the bottle. Secondly, if you want to heat a second bottle or a jar of baby food immediately following the first bottle or to further warm the original bottle, you can't. You have to wait 10 minutes before the heater resets itself. A crying child isn't patient enough to wait that 10 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and good price","review":"worked out great with our 4month old daughter, just follow the instruction and within minutes you'll have the milk at the right temp for your little one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Products works as advertised!","review":"This does exactly what is says it will do, it heats baby bottles. It's also great for melting frozen formula/milk. My wife prepares (by pumping) ice cube sized portions of frozen breast milk for easy portion control.

It takes 2-3 cycles, because the milk is frozen, but tt works perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Well I thought this would save me time with my second child - warming up breastmilk in a hurry. It has been inconsistent and not trustworthy so far. Out of the 6 times I've tried it - 2x it was WAY too hot and I didn't have time to cool it off. And the rest of the times it wasn't hot enough.

Its not even worth giving to goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Use with Disposable Bottles","review":"This bottle warmer requires EXACT amounts of water for use. That means that you need to add exactly 2 oz of water to warm up a 4 oz disposable bottle. The amount of water I added did not produce the same results two times in a row. Most of the time the milk/formula was still cold. If I added more water next time, it would result in overheating. If the milk/formula was still cold, you cannot just add more water because the machine needs 10 minutes to cool between warmings. Unfortunately, a hungry baby cannot wait 10 minutes! After many tries, I stopped using this machine and now place the bottles in warm water instead. I don't know how it performs with other bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pain","review":"I bought this bottle warmer while I was pregnant because it was the cheapest one Babies R Us had and it has all of the safety features. After trying to get this thing to work for about a month, I finally splurged on the Avent bottle warmer. This warmer is impossible to use! Everytime you want to use it, you have to fill up this tiny measuring thing that clips onto the side of the warmer which is impossible when you have a crying baby in your arms. If you leave the bottle in the warmer until it automatically shuts off the bottle will be scortching hot! You also have to take the bottle out of the warmer with a towel because the it will be covered in boiling water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't warm well","review":"This warmer does a fantastic job of warming about two ounces of liquid if you use the maximum amount of water. If you're trying to heat up anything more than a snack for your baby, you're going to have to either run it through several cycles in a row, or just find another way to warm it up. This warmer emits a lot of steam and barely accomplishes a thing. I wish I had kept the receipt from my purchase at Target so I could get my $20 back."},{"rating":"1","title":"never the right temp","review":"Sure, it comes with specific directions and a handy tool to use to add just the right amount of water to heat a specific size bottle, but it's never right.

Add more water, and it is too hot--and baby is still hungry!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassle","review":"This product is #1 on my \\"waste of money\\" list of baby products. The instructions for use are complicated and use a table based on the size of the bottle, rather than the amount of liquid in the bottle that you are trying to warm. This leads to confusion -- for example, how much heating water do you use to warm a wide-mouthed 9 ounce bottle with only 4 ounces of milk in it? The instructions provide no guidance for this common situation. Consequently, I have never felt that the bottles were warmed to the right temperature -- they either felt too cold or got way too hot.I recommend to anyone needing to warm a bottle to sit it in a mug of hot water from the tap for a couple minutes and avoid the hassle and guesswork of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heats inconsistently...very frustrating.","review":"As others have said this bottle warmer is very inconsistent.

This is not great when you are trying to get the bottle to your screaming baby as quickly as possible at 3AM. Steer clear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Point???","review":"I got this bottle warmer as a shower gift. It is impossible to determine the correct amount of water so that the bottle is heated properly. The main problem I've had with it is that it over heats the bottle itself making it difficult to pick up and hold. However, the formula inside the bottle would still be cold. Once the warmer finishs, it must sit for AT LEAST 10 minutes before you can use it again. Not convenient considering it doesn't heat the bottle fully the first time. I've found it easier to keep a pot of water on the stove and just turn on the burner when I need to heat a bottle"},{"rating":"2","title":"first time mom","review":"I like the bottle warmer very much. I have no problem with it. Some review said that the bottle warms different everytime. i don't find it true. I think the reason the bottle is warmer or cooler depends on how long you keep it in there. If you want to make the bottle a little warmer. You could either leave the bottle when the lights off and put a little less water. Or you could put more water and take the bottle out right the way. It's depends on your perference. If you do it consistently, you should have no problem. By the way, this product is a life saver especially at night when your hungry baby can't wait. It takes only 1-2 minutes to warm.

I left it unattended and it never turned off so the formula started boiling and I wasted 5 ounces of formula. Also, I don't know if it's the bottles we are using or the warmer but something is causing our bottles to leak all over the warmer and we have this terrible soy formula burning smell throughout our house. I think it's the warmer doing it because when we warm the bottles in a pan on the stove we don't have a problem with the bottles leaking. It has become much easier just to warm bottles the old fashioned way on the stove since this warmer is so unreliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works for us","review":"I got this soon after my daughter was born but I didn't start using it until last week. Our daughter who is otherwise a very good sleeper, just couldn't get out of her 4am bottle routine so I decided to start trying out giving her a warm bottle right before bed. It worked like a charm. She was pretty happy with her room temperature milk for a while but nothing beats a warm bottle.This bottle warmner works to a T. It heats the bottle to just the right temperature and is pretty easy to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Years? Didn't even last 9 months...","review":"We were generally happy with this product, until it stopped working. You have to use it with distilled water, not tap, otherwise you have to clean it daily with vinegar because of the mineral build-up. This morning, it just stopped working. After just 8 months of use, a few months before we would have otherwise retired it. We are frustrated as we are so close to weaning off the bottle that we don't want to buy another bottle warmer & certainly wouldn't buy this one again. It is very compact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This products mechanism is so disappointing and poor. It is basically an electric water heater and when the water boils and lets of steam, the steam warms the milk, whicch is an okay idea, if the quality of the heater was better and it didn't take so long. The heating is uneven and did I mentions takes a very long. Easier to fill a bowl with warm water fronm the tap and put the bottle in it...easier and faster"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, best baby shower gift.","review":"I brought this gift for my son and his wife; their daughter was born on 2/21/07. when I questioned them as to why they had not used the bottle warmer, they just didn't get around to using it. I insisted they read the directions and start using it. the next day, my son stated. wow mom this is the best baby shower gift. they could not believe how fast the bottle warmer worked. how much timed it saved them as new parents, and the milk was heated at just the right temperature each time. my son was so thankful, that I insisted he use the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Better One","review":"I bought this warmer because it was the better priced one. However, it only worked a few times. When it did work, it wasn't very well at that. I returned it for a more expensive warmer and and it works great! Spend the few extra $$$ for the better warmer.

I will be tring the Avent warmer instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"We purchased this warmer to reheat breastmilk and ready to feed formula. The temperature was very inconsistent, sometimes too warm, sometimes barely warm at all. It also continues to heat even after the warmer shuts off.

Of all my many purchases for our first baby I was most dissapointed in this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"This bottle warmer broke after the first week.

Also, the opening is too small for the newer bottles (TippeTommy, comotomo, etc)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this poor product","review":"This is a waste of money. It worked for the first week my newborn came home...and not again. It heats QUICKLY enough when it works, but you have to heat it a second time because it doesn't heat it WARM enough. You have to wait for it to cool down, though, in order to heat it again, and by this time your baby is blue in the face from screaming for its bottle! We've found it much faster and easier to just fill a bottle with warm water, add the powdered formula, and feed the baby. (Jar food and what not can be heated on the stove or in the microwave.) We tossed this in the trash -- didn't see the need to bother returning it and getting our money back or another in its place."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to get a perfect bottle every time and clear your cold!","review":"This is a great product in comparison to a microwave (dangerous) or a pot full of hot water (time consuming). It takes some patience to get the correct amount of water to succesfully heat the bottle to a proper temperature. I found that adding a bit too much water, checking the bottle bag periodically during heating and removing the bottle before it gets too hot will result in a perfect bottle every time...plus, it is a great source of humidity for a dry house or a head cold!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To hard to get the bottle warmed just right!","review":"If you don't get the water level right you end up with a to cold or warm of a bottle. If it's to cold you can't reheat it for at least 5-10 minutes, and at 3am it[s] really [bad]. It is nice cause it shuts off automatically , but if you don't have evrything just right it won't work right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"I actually returned my bottle warmer. I too used the Playtex Disposables with my warmer, but found that the warmer was not consistent. Sometimes the milk would be too warm (almost hot), other times not warm enough. What drove me to return the warmer were the times when the bottles were not warm enough. There's a delay (approximately 2 minutes) which requires you to wait and allow the unit to cool before turning it on again. This wait was miserable for both me and the baby. Not sure if I had a defective warmer or what. Now I use traditional methods of warming bottles and it's actually not so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"We quit using this bottle warmer","review":"After about 2 weeks, we quit using this bottle warmer. Either the bottle was still ice cold, or it was too hot. I found it easier and faster to warm a cup of water in the microwave and set the bottle in it while I changed the baby. I wish we had used the $18 for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd say it's okay for the price","review":"I got this warmer as a shower gift. It does warm the bottle to the perfect temperature. It has drawbacks, though. I took us 6 minutes to heat up a bottle that we had in the fridge. It also developed some brown crusty looking stuff in the bottom of it, and all the numbers rubbed off the measuring tube. We barely even use it anymore because it it not too convenient when you have a hungry baby waiting for her bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistant!!!","review":"My review would read exactly as H.G. from Westland, MI -- very inconsistant for who knows what reason when you are heating the same size bottle each time!

Then everytime time there after the bottle was either ice cold or scalding hot. By the time we got the bottle to the temp. needed it would have been faster to warm it up with hot water. That is what we have been doing ever since.I would not advise anyone to register or purchase this warmer as I did. It is just a waste of space."},{"rating":"1","title":"boiled formula!","review":"I have been through two of these. The first one seemed okay for a few weeks, until I discovered that with Dr. Browns bottles, the upper half of the formula was warm, but formula in the bottom half of the bottle was cold. One day I put a bottle and turned around to make cereal. I noticed it was taking longer than usual so I checked it and found that all the formula had leaked out into the unit, and it was burned. I had to throw it out, since the indicator light never went off after that. I got a second one, and was using Avent bottles. Same thing. It was in there for so long that it pretty much exploded and our kitchen smelled like burned formula for days. THis just does not heat evenly and is dangerous, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I read the reviews for this and was excited to use it - I've read the instructions many times, tried adjusting per their specifications, and after approximately 20 attempts I have given up.

If you do purchase this warmer, don't throw away the box until you are sure it works.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melts Plastic Bottles","review":"When searching for bottle warmers, my wife and I were aware we would need a product that would not destroy plastic.

Needles to say, we are hugely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boils Bottles","review":"This bottle warmer is going right back.Instructions are careless, not detailed and left us wondering if we're using the product correctly and safely. Just goes to show that not a lot of thought was put into the creation of this product.Tried it first with \\"7 units\\" of water as the instructions suggested, that resulted in boiled milk within a few minutes. Tried it again after waiting for cool down with 4 units of water, once again boiled an equivalent amount of milk... The amount of water doesn't seem to make a difference, and the warmer heats up the milk way too much to the point of boiling it. So what is this thing good for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unpredictable!","review":"Like other reviewers, I have had nothing but problems with this thing! The instructions for how much water to add are not right at all. You have to figure out on your own how much water to use, and then, you can do the exact same thing twice and one time will still be ice cold and the other time burning hot. There is a little ring piece, which is not attached, and if you lose it, the thing does not work AT ALL since all the steam just escapes! Ours stopped heating consistently after two months of use. It gets a brown build-up in the bottom, and you can not fit your hand in there to clean it out. The instructions say to wipe with vinegar periodically, which I have found you actually have to do every day or else you will never get the build up out. We are switching to Munchkin brand bottle warmer now that this one has quit working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok.","review":"I got it for a road trip. I have a port as an outlet in my car. It doesn't heat that fast I had to put in an extra bottle to heat up the water to heat up the bottle. I did this after 10 minutes of trying it the way the directions said to. My way still took another 10 minutes. It will get you threw what you need to do... But its not as great as everyone say... maybe I just got a defective one. But its not something I would buy again...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"The warmer is perfect when you are short on space or would like a 2nd warmer to leave with grandma or the babysitter, instead of carrying around the larger version.

We wanted a reliable warmer for the transition from breast to bottle for our son. Well, it warms the bottle great, just not the milk! I use this multiple times a day, and I still don't have it down. I have tried everything from smaller bottles to more water to warming the bottle twice. I almost always end up with a bottle that is hot and milk that is not. Of course, by the time I get the temperature right, my poor son is sobbing and thinks I have deserted him.... I have learned to avoid this awful feeling by setting up the warmer just before he wakes from his naps (he is still breastfeeding at night) and adjusted it accordingly. I have to say, this takes all of the convenience out of the warmer. I am sure there is a better warmer out there, I just haven't brought myself to purchasing one for fear of the same results..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't usually work","review":"This warmer works when it wants to which means only when i'm testing it and never when I need to warm a bottle at 3 am!

Don't waste your money on this product whether you'll be using it frequently or just sometimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"I am a breastfeeder. But, every now and again, my husband gives our baby a bottle of breastmilk. We are past the point of sleep deprivation, so I don't blame the use of this product on not enough sleep - it really is very confusing to use.The directions are quite unclear and the chart used to tell you how much water to put in is even more unclear. Several times, we have put too much water in, and the bottle gets way too hot, which is dangerous!This is only my opinion and I do not believe has anything to do with lack of intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Product","review":"This bottle warmer does not always shut off on its own. Usually I set the bottle in the warmer and then change our son's diaper and when I am finished it is done.

HOWEVER, after 2 weeks of using it, the numbers on the measuring tube wore completely off!!!! It also developed some brown crust in the bottom. It did come off, but who wants to clean one more thing when you have a brand new baby at home. It did warm bottles nicely though and fairly quickly. However, a plain old pot of hot water works wonderfully and doesn't cost a thing, and you don't have to measure!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!!","review":"I hate this bottle warmer. I had it on my registry because I read such great reviews on it. It is horrible! It automatically shuts off when you remove the bottle, then it takes 10 min before you can turn it on again.

We had to exchange the first one because it would work only sometimes. The second one, never heated consistantly. We would exactly measure the water and follow the directions perfectly each time, but it never heated the bottles the same. Sometimes the bottle would come out scalding and other times it would still be cold. I would not recommend this at all!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The quality is going downhill","review":"I purchased my first botther warmer in 2011, the color was dark gray.. have no complain at all. perfect!! stupid me, bring this overseas and forgot to use the volt converter so it blew up hence i have to purchase a new one. However i cannot find the dark gray anymore, go to W supermarket and purchase from Amazon, and end up getting this new version - the light blue and white version.I practically have to heat up twice in order to be warm. sometimes only heat it once and it burning hot.Seems cannot get it right.

LESS IS NOT ALWAYS BEST!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a great gift!","review":"We received this bottle warmer as a gift, and my husband and I absolutely love it! It is so much better than the microwave. It takes anywhere from 3 - 5 minutes to heat the bottle, depending on the size of your bottle. My only complaint is that you do have to wait until the heating element cools before heating another bottle, but other than that it is great! I cannot praise it enough. We have not used it to warm the baby food yet, but I'm sure I will be just as pleased. This makes a wonderful gift as it is useful and budget friendly. A definite must for any parent new or \\"old\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst warmer ever!","review":"I've had this bottle wormer for about 4 months and I still can't get it right! The little measuring cup is not only hard to read, but also very inaccurate resulting in overheated or underheated bottles ALL THE TIME. To make things worse, once you warm up a bottle, if it's not right you have to wait 10 minutes before you can try again. Try telling a screaming, hungry baby that he/she has to wait 10 minutes to eat!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME AND $","review":"This was purchased in an attempt to save time - it actually doubles the time needed to heat a bottle. The reason is that you try the warmer only to find out it doesn't work (heats the bottle but not the milk) and then you are forced to heat by hand with hot water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work!","review":"We couldn't get this warmer to work. It would heat the bottle just great, but the milk inside was still cold. Because you have to wait 10 mins before you can use it again, we found it worthless. Our goal was to speed warming time, but using hot water took the same amount of time as this product. We returned it and got the Avent one and are much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Three Bears/Inconsistent","review":"The best way I know to review this bottle warmer is by comparing it to the Three Bears. Using the same amount of water each and everytime with the bottle always the same temp before heating....sometimes the bottle comes out too hot, sometimes too cold, and sometimes just right. I plan to write the makers of the warmer and complain. I have been VERY unhappy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I have found this product to be a waste of time. The water measure device is hard to read & volumes to use not well marked. It always seems to give me a barely warm bottle (I was using Avent bottles)no matter how much water is in it & the 'cut off' time before it will heat again is most anoying & frustrating. Using the old 'hot water' method has been far easier & I wouldn't reccomend this warmer to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it!!!","review":"Do not even bother with this product! This warmer doesn't warm refridgerated bottles! My 2 week old is taking 4 oz. bottles and THEY will not even warm. After I use it I have to put the bottle in a cup ...butt! If I could just rewarm it that would help, but it won't let you do that for like 10 minutes....and adding more water doesn't help either. I can just imagine how frustrated I would be in a few more weeks when my son will be taking 8 oz. bottles! This was a waste of money and I will definitely be trying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky","review":"When it worked, it was great. But more often than not, it would either not heat the bottle at all, or the milk would be scalding. Not sure why - faulty heater? The indicator marks on the water vial came of quickly so we needed to mark the line with a permanent marker. Again, not ideal. I would recommend reading more reviews to see if this is just a quirky defect or common for the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy product","review":"I love this thing!!! In the middle of the night, my husband or I can get up, pop a bottle in the warmer, go change baby's diaper, then come back and get a nice warm bottle for her. The downside: figuring out how much water to put in it for each size and brand of bottle. Also, if you pull out a bottle while it's still steaming, use tongs or potholder to avoid steam burns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good bottle warmer","review":"I don't use a whole bunch of bottles since I nurse, but occasionally I thaw out some breast milk for when my daughter and I are going to be out in very public places for a long period of time. This works great. I just put the milk in the warmer and in about four minutes it is done. Sometimes however, when I have a 7 ounce pack it takes a few times through it to get it all the way warmed. Since I am using this for when I am out it isn't a big deal that it takes awhile, especially because you have to wait for the warmer to cool all the way down before you can use it again. However, when I use it to heat milk from the frig so my husband can feed her, it works great. I wouldn't suggest walking away from it because sometimes it gets too hot when the whole four minutes is given to heat. Walking away while heating a bottle is not wise anyway, so it really isn't a problem standing there for it and it is a whole lot quicker than boiling water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was great at first, but after 2 months, it's terrible","review":"It requires CONSTANT watching. If I don't take the milk out and shake the bottle at least twice while heating, it scalds the milk giving it a terrible taste. I hate having to throw out breastmilk! Grrrr.The bottom of the inside where the bottle rests is getting all rusty looking, even though I've kept it clean. Makes it smell bad when the machine heats up.I have two of these, and both are having the same problems. I guess I got what I paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!!!","review":"I registered this item for my Baby Shower, but I ended up so disappointed because even though is compact (great on your countertop), reasonable price, and quick!, it's very hard to find the correct water measurement. You either get it too hot or too cold and you have to run cold/hot water under the sink for it to warm up or cool off. Who has time for that when you have a baby crying telling that he is hungry.This would have been a great product if the actual instructions would work. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS []!!!!Jan 24, 2003 - I am rewriting the review since i finally figured out the problem of being too hot and cold. This system works if you dont make the bottles ahead and put them in the refrigerator; in other words, make the bottle right then and there, so you cant have the bottles already prepared with the formula but it only takes 2 seconds to do, and if you have a hungry baby just prepare it a few minutes before you think he's going to start crying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best out there","review":"We were disappointed with this bottle warmer for our twin boys. We found that it can only heat up one bottle every 10 minutes, which is a real problem when you are trying to heat up two bottles or you mess up the first time, and its too cold or too hot, which is common with this warmer because you are constantly adjusting how much water to put in. At 3AM, this is just too much trouble. Also, it lacks a countdown timer, a memory for how long you needed the warmer the last time, and doesn't have a water reservoir. The Dr. Browns is much better, and we have found that one works great for Dr. Browns, First Years and Playtex bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"much-needed for first grandson!!!!!!!","review":"This is a must-have for parents-and grandparents.

I bought this warmer after being given the larger one with the cooler as a baby shower gift. I wanted to use this one for travel and to send with to our childcare provider's house. This warmer quickly heats up a bottle even in the care using an adapter. You do have to play with the amount of water added to the warmer, but not much. The automatic shut-off is a life saver and makes it an ease to use. I am confident warming up my breastmilk in this warmer and I would recommend it to any family with a new baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This is a great bottle warmer.

My daughter is a breastfed baby and when it came time for me to go back to work at 4 months I took this out and read the directions. It seems to me that 5 minutes is a long time for an item specially designed to warm up bottles. It takes that long to heat up a bottle in a big pot of water! My daughter is still breastfeeding at 6 months and only receives 3-4 bottles a week so a bottle warmer is definately not a priority. We warm up bottles and baby food the old fashioned way, in a big pot of hot water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very inconsistent","review":"I too am disappointed with this warmer. It is very inconsistent in heating the bottles. Although we use the same amount of water in the warmer each time, the bottle never comes out the same. Sometimes it's just right, but more often it is over or under heated. The enclosed booklet tells how much water should be added for each bottle type and size. It is grossly off. We basically fill the measuring tube full for a 6 oz bottle and heat with the lid off so we can stick our (clean) finger in ever few seconds to test and make sure it isn't overheating. As another review mentioned, it's extremely frustrating when it doesn't heat the bottle enough because it takes 10 minutes to cool down before you can rewarm. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"Thought this was the greatest thing the first time I used it, but as other people have written, it is very inconsistant when warming bottles, even though I fill it with the same amount of water every time, sometimes it is very cold, sometimes perfect. The other day though, I warmed up the bottle and thank goodness I always test it, I burned myself on the milk! I had to run cold water on the bottle to get it warm, because it was piping hot! I am returning the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if don't expect much","review":"I should give this product 3 stars. It is quicker than using boiled water. Also convenient because you do not need to worry about turning off anything. But just as other reviews, the performance is unpredictable. Sometimes it gives too hot sometimes not warm enough. I am using Dr.Brown's narrow bottles. For 3 ounce cold breast milk, water at level 6 (suggested by the manual) only makes it not cold. Anyway, I would say it is really fast.However I would like to give only 2 stars because I received a used one!!!!! It is so dirty on the bottom of the basket!!!!!!! This is really ridiculous for a product sold by Amazon!!!!! But I really need it immediately for I do not want to boil water in the midnight. Also the price at this time is acceptable. Next time I would require a replacement.

I like that this warmer works very quickly and uses steam to heat the bottle, but doenst over heat. The single button on the front is easy and quick to use when you have a crying, hungry baby in your arms. I also like the fact that the warmer turns off automatically and the light on the button turns off so that you know that it is done warming.I did want to mention that I use this warmer to warm breastmilk that has either been in the refrigerator or has been previously defrosted from the freezer. I do not use this warmer to thaw frozen breastmilk and would not recommend doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked okfor awhile","review":"I bought this warmer because it was able to warm disposable liners. I could never get the right temperature it was either too hot or too cold and if it was too cold you couldn't reheat for another 5 or 10 mins. Explain that to a hungary 4 week old. It did finally break at 6 wks. I found that hot tap water was the best way after all. It gets the bottle just right in no time.

The reality is that it's very hard to get \\"the exact\\" amount of water into the vial. Secondly, this \\"exact amount\\" does not adequately warm all bottles to the same temperature. I have since given up measuring and simply put in a vial or more of water and then monitor the temp by using my finger. In some cases, the bottle warms very quickly, in other cases, it takes minutes and minutes. For baby #2, we are tossing this one and on the hunt for a better quality warmer. Until then, we are making do.

It works great! The only thing is I wish you could push a button for a 4 ounce or 8 ounce bottle. Once you put the water in and hope that it is just enough you can not start up the warmer again until it cools down... But on the other hand if you put in to much it gets way to hot...Once you get the hang of it and your own system down like only warming 5 ounces and then adding one to cool it down it is pretty nice to use...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I have found that this bottle warmer makes the bottle either too hot or not hot enough (even if you follow the directions on how much water to use) and you have to wait ten minutes to start the cycle over again - that is TOO long to wait when you have a screaming, hungey baby who needs to eat!

It's easy to use and after one try, I figured out the exact amount of water to pour into it to warm a bottle for my son. In less than two minutes, a cold bottle from the fridge is ready for him to devour. He's happy and that makes me happy. Another thing I like about this device is the measuring cup that attaches to the unit because it makes preparing the unit that much easier. I would definitely recommend this product to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"The auto shut off didn't work","review":"I bought this bottle warmer but when it arrived the auto shut off function wasn't working.

With the same amount of water, it will make bottles that are absolutely scalding to the touch, or luke warm. That's supposed to be a button on the front, and from the (awful) instructions it came with, I surmised that it is supposed to auto-off when done. That is NOT a button on the front - I am still not at all sure of its purpose. If the unit is plugged in, the \\"button\\" is lit up. It doesn't auto-off, so you are just guessing at when is the right time to yank the scalding bottle out of the unit.Would not recommend this to anyone, unless they absolutely had no other option. I get far more consistent results heating the bottle in a cup of hot water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time saver","review":"Love this item! Used for my son 3yrs ago and purchased another for my daughter just recently. (had donated the old one) warms the bottle up very quickly with little fuss.

It was well worth it! As a first time Mom, I quickly discovered how long it takes to warm up a bottle running it under hot water. It's especially not fun when it's 3 a.m. in the morning, baby is crying and I'm half asleep. When I got this bottle warmer our world improved greatly. Both my husband and I can't imagine not having this bottle warmer. It steams the bottle up quickly and evenly. I usually pre-measured the water and have it ready for the next feeding.

I haven't changed bottles or adjusted the water levels, so I don't know why the heating temperature changes so much.

She was warming their bottles using tap water. It was taking too long to get hot and she felt like she was wasting a lot of water (we are in a drought). I looked at all the warmers and their reviews and decided to get this one. There is one that warms 2 bottles, but I wasn't impressed with the reviews. My daughter said this one is pretty fast. Her only complaint was the directions say to let it cool off for 10 minutes before using it again. Baby #2 doesn't always want to wait another 10 minutes. My solution was to send her a second one, even though I know her hubby will complain about having more stuff. At least they aren't a huge investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Would Buy Again","review":"I bought this bottle warmer based on the reviews I found here. This is an amazing product! Heats up the breast milk super quick - less than a min - and works with glass bottles.

Perfect heating everytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, simple warmer.","review":"This is a great product...a must have for nursing mothers who pump and also for formula babies!

However, I stopped using it after a couple of weeks and realized my son took the bottle just fine without the need to warm up the bottle. It was difficult to get the bottle at the right temp - it was either too hot or too cold. By the time I had it at an acceptable temp, my baby was already screaming for the bottle. The bottle would sometimes be too hot and would leak at the top. That left a residue at the bottom of the warmer which would emit a weird odor that might make you think something is burning. You might have better luck with it but it just didn't work for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have!","review":"this is a must have bottle and baby food warmer. it fits alomost all types of bottles. warms breast milk within seconds - this is critical when you have an impatient and hungry infant. i also used it to warm baby food sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I ended up buying a bottle warmer about 3 weeks after my son was born. I looked at a few and decided on this one because it heated the disposable bottles. I love it. As other reviewers have stated you have to get down pat the time you want to heat it for. The full 5 min is way to long for a 4 oz bottle. I have found that if you use the 4oz Avent bottles and the milk is cold that 3 min is good. As for room temperature bottle 1 to 2 min is good. I highly suggest this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I purchased this bottle warmer because of the automatic shut-off. I already had a Gerber bottle warmer which works great for heating, but the only way to turn it off was to unplug it. I am too afraid to forget it and have it burn so I wanted something with a safety feature. Let me tell you, I am not impressed. I really only need my bottles heated to room temperature, but we recently had to switch to liquid formula so once it's refrigerated it's too cold. I can't even get it that hot & I fill the water cup to the max! The scary part of that is I'm only using 4oz bottles right now. I can't even imagine once he starts eating more. Of course, I can't continue heating once it shuts off because of the 10 minute cooling off period so I end up having to use my Gerber one anyway. It's a terrible product and I will be returning it. It's too much hassle to have a screaming baby wait for food while I fight with this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottle warmer - if you have common sense","review":"Some reviews said the bottles get too hot and the liquid inside is still cold. Then there are others who says the temperature is not perfect everytime. Please people, all you have to do is put in a little more water than you need and then twirl the bottle to distribute the heat inside the bottle. When it gets to the temperature you want, just take it out. The machine is not going to know what the perfect temperature is because some parents might with it luke warm while others want it warm or very warm. The heat transfers to the outside of the bottle and the milk on the outer layer, but it's not going to transfer the heat into the middle section the milk unless you twirl and mix it. This is simple physics. Unless you want the bottle warmer to shake itself or twirl the bottle for you, all heating methods will end up warming the same way - heat reach the outside first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"There are one of two things that happen when we use this product, either the milk is ice cold or scalding hot.

We have used this warmer for the past 4 months and find it very unreliable in heating the bottles to a consistant temperature. Using the same bottle, same amount of liquid in the bottle, same temperature (from fridge) and same amount of water in measuring device....it would always be a surprise what the outcome would be. You have to start with a full tube of water and usually you have to run it again with a half a tube. Sometimes, it's even too hot with the first full tube. In a nutshell, this is quicker than sitting the bottle in hot water, BUT it needs monitoring. Next time, I will get another brand and do more research before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I hated this product.

Well guess what - I keep using the regular cup of water as a warmer. This warmer suffers from several major flaws:1. Steam operation - you put the water in using the measuring cup and you never know how much water is enough. For more than 3 ounces of milk even the max amount used in the measuring cup is never enough2. The bottom of the steamer becomes brown from the tiny amounts of milk that supposedly leaks from the bottle during the warming - so each time you have to clean it out with a tough sponge3. Even if the bottle is not warm enough you cannot turn on the warmer - it has a time period to cool down - and in the meantime your baby goes ballistic.The bottom line is - don't buy it. Buy the simplest warmer available - from Avent for example"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpredictable and broken","review":"As the other reviewers have said, it is a hit or miss on the temperature with this warmer.

I went through, in total, about 4 bottles that became scalded before I gave up on this thing. The opposite was also true. I would put just the right amount of water ina and the bottle itself got warm but the milk was just as cold as when I took it out of the fridge. And you can't just hit the button again to reheat because, I guess, there is some kind of thermostat thing in it. Therefore, you end up running hot tap water over the bottle anyway. Now I just fill a quart size Chinese soup container with hot water and put the bottle in there for about 2 minutes and it is good. No more scalded bottles or cold bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with glass bottles or bigger food containers","review":"Website said glass bottle should not be used.

However, when the bottle is not warm enough, I put a little more water in the chamber, wait for the \\"sizzling\\" to stop and it turns right on again. Then it only needs about 20-30 seconds more to warm the bottle enough. When the bottle is too warm, I add a little unheated milk to it to cool the milk down.

I use this maybe once or twice a week since I am home breastfeeding, but I still find it annoying. At first, figuring out the test tube water amount is confusing, and even then when you warm the bottle, it doesn't always heat it all the way through. If you want to warm it again, or if you want to warm another one, you can't because it just won't turn on until it completely cools down (which is a long time). I am assuming it is a safety feature so it doesn't overheat the milk/formula.

It takes a long time to heat bottles and the heating itself is inconsistent. Sometimes the bottle will come out still cold and other times it will come out scalding hot...on the same setting. Also, the design of the bottle warmer is just stupid. The power button is at the very bottom of the device and you have to push down on it rather than push in, which causes the warmer to tip over unless you are holding it with the other hand. I can't tell you how many times I've had my baby in one hand and ended up tipping the whole bottle warmer over, spilling milk and water everywhere, and when you have a screaming hungry baby in your arms, the last thing you want is to clean up a big mess and start all over.

Doesn't that kind of kill the nutrient content, though? It's really not that much faster than heating a bottle in warm water from the tap, and it probably kills a lot of the antibodies in breastmilk.If you're using this to heat baby food or formula, go for it, but I'm pretty sure it destroys the nutritional content of breastmilk something fierce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless item","review":"It may be my son only but he doesn't care if his bottles are cold or warm and I use water that is in gallon containers which sit on the counter so his bottles are generally at room temperature anyway.

All in all, this was a pointless purchase on my part; but the return of the item was easy cheesy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless warmer","review":"You can never get the exact amount of water to go in there. Sometimes it over heats and sometimes it is not warm for the same amount of milk in the bottle. Once it was made the milk so hot that my son would have burnt his mouth if I had not taken the care to check the temperature several times before I could feed him. I used the recommended amount of water and still it overheated the milk. Since then I have stopped using it so that I do not risk burning his mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"I had registered on my Baby Registry for this warmer because I loved the idea of its multi-use features (warms regular and disposable bottles and babyfood). Honestly, I wish I had not received it. In the time that I have used it, I have had more frustration than successes using this item. There is no rhyme or reason about how much water to use to get the bottle or babyfood jar adequately heated. Sometimes, it is too warm; sometimes it is too hot. I do not know if the other warmers are worth the extra money but I know this one was not worth its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"This bottle warmer works great with the Avent bottles, but I agree with a previous reviewer that it does NOT work well with Dr Browns bottles. They over flow causing extensive cleanup. If you use Avent bottles this warmer is a great product. Simple, quick and easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE","review":"I bought this item especially because of \\"The First Years\\" brand and I was extremely disappointed with it. I use Dr. Brown's 4 oz. bottles and, for some reason, each time I used the Quick Serve Bottle Warmer formula leaked or evaporated into the warming chamber and before I knew it we had burnt formula all inside the unit. My bottles that had 2 ounces of formula quickly diminished to less than 1 1/2 ounces when the warming cycle was complete and then I was left to clean up all of the burnt formula inside the bottom of the unit. Not a fun thing to do in the middle of the night or even during the day! I read other reviews where people had the same problem. I do not recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convenient","review":"I bought this warmer thinking it's more convenient than warming milk with hot water, but actually it is not...the amount of water needed is little therefore it has to be very precise to get to the temperature you want! It takes longer to fill the correct amount of water than needed. Also you have to wait 10 minutes to try again, if a bottle is not warm enough, you have to use something else anyway! The instructions state that the unit needs 10 minutes to cool down if you need to use it again, but it may actually take longer than that...I would prefer to use hot water than using this warmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Constructed","review":"This product is poorly constructed, requires patience and you don't have that with a baby crying. It doesn't heat to a temperature the baby would like, so you end up having to cool the bottle afterwards. Also I have to manipulate the On switch for far too long but I actually get it to turn on. After awhile I just gave up and stopped using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Necessary Evil?","review":"Been using this for 5 weeks now to heat 2-3 oz in Dr Brown regular bottles.

It does its work OK. It heats the baby's bottles.But it also has some important problems, which are kind of expected for the price:1) once it completes a full heating cycle, it takes a long time cooling down, during which you cannot use it again cause it won't turn on.2) the water that you put in it, very very quickly makes the metal heater at the bottom to become badly rusty and hard to clean up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great and cheap!","review":"I've had the same one for my 1st child, lasted 3 years... Wear and tear, now I just ordered the same one for my second baby. It's different color and style now but works great. Cheap for the time the product lasts. Well worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars!!!","review":"First off, mine was white and it looks like they changed the shape and color now, whether that matters, I don't really know, or care. This is the most awful product. We tried it 3 times, once actually following direction, then twice adding more water to see if it makes any difference. Nope. It doesn't work. The ONLY thing it does is get the actual bottle hot. Almost too hot to the touch, but if you test out the actual formula, it was literally ice-cold. Like straight from the fridge. Awful, awful product. I find these mixed reviews odd, because apparently for some, it actually works and for others, like me, it doesn't do ANYTHNG. I don't know about those positive reviews, but for me, it was just utterly dissapointing. Pity really, it would have been SO convenient to warm a bottle up as quickly as it says(1 minute, I believe). But we have to continue doing it the old-fashioned way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goos buy","review":"True that the water level isn't always accurate. My experiance is that it leaves the bottle too cool, but it works great when you add just a tiny bit more. It heats quickly. I know there is no way to avoid this since it heats with steam but my biggest problem is that the steam traps itself under the rim of the nipple part of the bottle and in EVERY crevice of the VentAire bottoms. The water that gets trapped burns me and I'm afraid to give the bottle to the baby before I let it sit on the counter for a second. If you use this product, try it on non-ventaire bottles and heat with out the lid of the bottle on. Then it works perfectly. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"When You've Got A Hungry Baby.....","review":"The last thing you need is to have to put everything down to check a bottle constantly. Every time myself or my wife tried to warm a bottle in this thing, it either came out too hot or too cold. Having to constantly check the bottle became too much of a hassle and we simply quit using this warmer. Despite following the instructions to a tee, the bottles NEVER came out perfect. We either had to re-heat the bottle or let it cool down before giving it too the baby.To make things short, I'll say this: Use the stove or microwave. Once you get your child into a reasonably predictable routine, you can warm bottles at a reasonable time and easily without having to waste time and money on the First Years Quick Serve Bottle Warmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy this warmer!","review":"We weren't planning on using a warmer at first but we thought it would be easier-it works, sometimes.... as someone else mentioned it goes by how much water you use, but sometimes you can put the amount of water it suggests, and it won't be warm at all, other times you can put in the same amount water you put in before, and it will be piping hot. ours is very inconsistant, but that may not be the case with all of them- i would choose something else next time.."},{"rating":"1","title":"temperature never right","review":"This bottle warmer is not that good. I would have to stand there and keep checking the temperature to make sure it didn't get too hot. you can imagine how thrilled I was trying to calm down a screaming hungry infant at three o'clock in the morning!! I do not reccommend this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty pleased","review":"It definetly does the job of warming the bottles and quickly. It does take a little practice getting the correct amt. of water so it's not too hot, not too cold. I'd suggest practicing with water or cow's milk first until you get used to the ratios.All in all, I'm pretty happy with it. It's ALOT faster than warming bottles in a cup of hot water!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hot, too cold... aggravating!","review":"I received this bottle warmer as a gift from my baby registry and I'm sorry that I picked that bottle warmer because it doesn't do a good job at all! Bottles are either too hot or too cold, even with the same amount of water... It's really annoying when you want to feed your baby and have to cool the bottle because the warmer heats it too much and baby wants to eat!The plastic inside the bottle warmer begins to deform after only two weeks of use and turns brown from the heat. Very cheap material for a bottle warmer when heat is inevitable.I can't recommend this bottle warmer at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this bottle warmer","review":"At first glance, I thought this product was great--it IS small, simple, and fast. What the \\"editorial review\\" does not say is that it is also completely UNRELIABLE. I've heated up bottles with the exact same amount of formula, at the exact same temperature, with the exact same amount of water. Sometimes they're perfectly warm, but just as often they're scalding hot, and, less frequently, still cold. If a product like this doesn't work consistently, it's useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpredictable","review":"This warmer is unpredictable. The same amount of water may overheat the bottle at one time, get it to room temperature another, and bearly heat it another time. It is rather annoying. The only reason why it got two stars is the fact that if it is still cool when you heat it, it doesnt take very long to warm it up to room temp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and Fast!!","review":"We had this warmer for our second baby and wish I had purchased it for our first born also. This warmer is easy to use and warms up the bottles pretty quickly for that crying baby who can't wait for that milk. It does take a few tries to get used to how much water to use in the warmer for the perfect temp. We had some overheat and underheat until we figured it out. It is very compact which makes it great for travel. We bought it everywhere with us; friends, famliy, vacation etc.Ok now what I don't like is that I used vinegar to clean it out often, but it still has build up on the bottom. Maybe it is just the kind of water we have here. Good recommendation...put it on your registry!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bottle warming product","review":"It works good but I didnt realize it used steam to heat them. Not a problem though. Also using the bottles that take liners you have to use more water or put it in more than once to get it to a warm temp. But all in all I really like it, have yet to use it for warming baby food but looking forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"It saves us from having to go down stairs to heat a bottle.

My son doesn't have to wait long to eat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great - for the price.","review":"For the $15(ish) price, I'd say that this bottle warmer works well. I mix all the bottles in the morning, put them in the refrigerator and use this to heat up the formula so that it is not freezing cold. I don't know how accurate the water-lines are because after experimenting with various amounts of water I don't think we've actually had a \\"warm\\" bottle yet - rather its just not cold - which I am completely fine with because I don't particularly want my baby becoming accustom to warm bottles when we are out or in the middle of the night. I would purchase this product again, however, if your baby needs a warm bottle I'd say you probably need a better/more expensive machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everest The West Ridge","review":"A detailed account of a great mountaineering feat.

The narrative is well written although the urgency of the situation doesn't really come through.

Overall, great series, poor book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best.","review":"This one is a bit disappointing. As a general rule, it is an enjoyable read, but the best scenes may well be the interaction between Millhone and Dietz. What really does this one in is the handling of the \\"ghost scenes\\", if you can really call them that. They read more like a badly performed seance.

I've read a number of Sue Grafton mysteries and she seems to get lazier -- or just more complacent with her core readers -- with every book. There's way too much description about things that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, which really doesn't get started until more than halfway through the book. In fact, the murder -- which usually propels a good contemporary mystery -- doesn't even happen until around the 200-page mark.

The twists and turns kept this reader's mind busy working out a flow chart of who did what when and where. Kinsey let her hair down just enough to remind the reader that she does have a heart under that tidy chest. It would have been a treat to see a little more of this side of her nature.

Grafton makes the Malek brothers so real and lifelike, even I wanted to strangle them for being s.o.b's! You feel for the deceased and know why Kinsey is going to find the man/woman who did this. The ending was great in that it was left open. I love it when writers don't tell the reader everything and leave the ending up to interpretation or just guess work. All in all, a great novel.

I was not impressed with it on smaller nuts, pistachioes and small almonds. They tend to shift away or become partially cracked. I would use restraint when tackling nuts as it is all plastic in construction. But given that, if used with slow deliberate intent, whole brazil nuts and filberts are easily achieved on a constant basis. I usually take time to crack several nuts and collect their meats. This way I do not have to always grab the cracker. Overall I was very pleased with the function and feel of this.I will offer this word as well. NOT for use with Black/American Walnuts.

However, the first sync up takes a while to work, so you get less of a 'wow' factor out of the box.A few little problems with this clock:. if you have *really* bad eyes, you might not see the projected clock reading. Not sure what the manufacturer can do about that.. the timezone button is right next to the 'stop the alarm' button (the snooze button is on the top of the unit). What happened to me was that I stopped the alarm but went back to sleep for a few more minutes. Turned out I changed the timezone too, so I got a little shock when I got up.. the alarm sound is crescendo, but I wish it starts out a little softer. The beeps are quite sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ceramic Flat Iron","review":"The HAI 2\\" Ceramic Flat Iron is one of the best out there. I purchase it and I'm in love with it.

It simply does not stack up to the emotional punch and narrative vision of films like \\"Raise the Red Lantern\\" \\"Temptress Moon\\" \\"Farewell My Concubine\\" or \\"Shanghai Triad.\\" The atmosphere in the other films I have listed is so thick you can smell the opera paint and incence, but Rogue was less engrossing, less compelling, less moving. The ghost from the past was out of place in modern-day Hong Kong. The directing was also a little weak in comparison with the top rate work on the films listed above.Leslie Cheung is fine, as in his later works, above, but I was not overly impressed with the female lead. She certainly does not hold a candle to Gong Li, who is the goddess of current Chinese cinema!All in all, fine for a rental, but not a repeat viewer . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dvd without final...","review":"A film sensitive, interesting and sad.

The two attempt suicide, but only Fleur dies, leaving her ghost to search for her lover for more than fifty years. Fleur's ghost puts an ad in the newspaper in the 1980's and enlists the help of a reporter and his girlfriend.The atmosphere in \\"Rouge\\" is outstanding and Kwan skillfully employs the right camera shots to supply specific moments in the film with a certain element of spookiness. The scene with Fleur's ghost on the tram with the reporter is unforgettably creepy.Anita Mui is splendidly enchanting throughout the whole film. With or without makeup, every shot of her is exquisite. Leslie Cheung also gives a fine performance.

Not only is this record incredibly well-concieved, it has a little bit every style that Neil is famous for, Whether it be acoustic driven ballads (\\"Old Man\\", \\"Heart of Gold\\") or the grungy off-kilter guitar rockers (\\"Alabama and \\"Words\\").

BRILLIANTThank you Neil Young"},{"rating":"2","title":"Defined a movement","review":"Neil Young's Harvest is one of the definitive albums of the 1970s singer/songwriter movement. When Harvest hit number one in 1972, Young's sensitive tone, somber musings, country/folk flavoring and willingness to work in a radio-friendly format set the norm for the cluster of sentimental folkies who would soon rise to popularity. Unlike many who would follow him, Young is the real thing. Harvest echoes with the sound of a lost soul. \\"My life is changing in so many ways/I don't know who to trust anymore/There's a shadow running through my days/Like a beggar going from door to door/It's hard to make that change/When life and love turn strange/And old,\\" he sings on \\"A Man Needs a Maid.\\" On Harvest, Young beautifully plays the part of the rugged, wandering stranger seen on long walks across dusty, country roads with a forlorn, preoccupied look on his face. Many would follow on his path, but few with the feeling and skill heard on Harvest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Few Weeds","review":"This is probably Neil Young's most famous album. Oddly enough, it's also one of his most uneven. Some of the songs are obvious works of genius. Others, like \\"Are You Ready For the Country\\" really miss completely.There is also a problem with overorchestration on some of the tracks. \\"A Man Needs a Maid\\", which was quite moving in concert, becomes just another production number here.All that said, the positive certainly outweighs the negative here.It won't give you any real picture of the artist, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fidelity is way better than the original release","review":"The orchestration has so much more detail and depth with this mastering.

(note - some audiophiles in the comments below have analyzed the sound waves and claim there's no frequency \\"clipping\\", but that still doesn't mean it sounds good - to my ears, it sounds terrible!)This rating has nothing to do with the music itself - it's intended to warn people to avoid this particular release.

Things move along a little bit different from what you are commonly used to, but that is the nature of the beast. These guys were there at the original summer of love in San Francisco, their musical contemporaries being the likes of the Airplane and the Dead. Originally more of a novelty act, I was happy to hear them mature into the music heard on this album. Fazon opens the album with a nice floating beat. Dancin' Wizard is a slow, simple tune with great melody and lyrics and lots of soul.

It draws you in, paints pictures, creates an awesome mood and will draw you back again. I found the first CD available from the bands website a few years ago and considered myself most fortunate! Now this is available for all in a new marketplace as mp3. There is no reason why this shouldn't be in everyone's library.

It was interesting to see how much I walk on a typical day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate","review":"I have loved my new Pedometer. I know exactally where I am as far as my steps are and so I can get moving towards my goals. I also love the Pulse meter. It is easy enough for my 4 year old to see how fast his heart is beating.

Just about everything you would need to stay on track!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"Don't waste your money on this piece of cheap plastic. It only worked for about two days.

I don't know if nobody had reviewed it when I purchased it or what because I would not have bought it with all those bad reviews. Anyway...I have not had accurate readings with this pedometer. It might be because I run with it instead of walk but even when trying to test it around the house walking it does not seem acurate. I have also e-mailed the company several times from their web site with no response yet. I also agree with it being hard to open the cover. when you are running and want to look at your progress it is almost impossible to open the cover without messing up the reading (That is inaccurate anyway so what does it matter)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad speciications","review":"On the operation manual everything is metric, is false, on my pedometer every is Emperial.Pulse meter does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this pedometer.

I tried several stride settings and sensitivity settings, but it never worked right. Also, the blue backlight died after just 2 days. I am planning to return it because it is absolutely worthless as a pedometer.

It has worked well for me. I found that the sensitivity settings worked, and that it recorded my steps accurately. I haven't had the problem with the cover, either. I've taken to using this as my watch now since it is on my side all the time! One thing I would recommend, thought, is to get a strap to attach the pedometer to your clothing.

He is a type casted actor and his role as a German tramp ship captain who hates Hitler is nothing short of funny. Not that the storyline is bad, it is just a situation of miscasting. Although Wayne's acting is good, his American accent and the thought subliminally that a cowboy is playing a German totally destroys the mood of the movie. But the movie is worth watching especially for Wayne fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Smart Lives Up to Its Name","review":"I bought this based on good Amazon reviews, and our 6-month-old daughter is absolutely captivated. She has been watching it about two times a week for about six weeks, and watches the entire half hour from start to finish without losing interest. My 17-month-old nephew saw it for the first time at our home, and he asked to watch it twice in a row, so it apparently also goes over well with older, active children.The artwork, storylines, and music are simply charming, and the narrator's voice is very soothing. I think of the Baby Einstein series as putting my daughter into a \\"wiggly\\" mood, whereas she seems to concentrate and become contemplative when she watches So Smart.Personally, I prefer the So Smart series to the Baby Einsteins (Mozart and Bach) we also have, because the production is professional, and does not seem as if it were created in the basement of someone's home. I would categorize this as \\"highbrow\\" baby entertainment, if there is such a thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lively and engaging introduction to the phenomena of color","review":"So Smart!

I would turn the unit on and all my data was gone... evern with fresh batteries. Palm was not able to diaganise the problem... just telling me to re-set it again... duh.

I figured the old Palm III had probably had it, but at least it had served faithfully for two years. The new Palm IIIx didn't make it through two days.Palm tech support says the \\"solution\\" to lost data is a reset. Sure it is--that restores the unit to its factory condition. And then you synchronize it again to restore from your desktop. And again and again and again?

The things he did for Lauren were absolutely breath taking. Lorraine Heath hit the mark squarely with this one. As always in many of the books I read, the heroes are better written and eminently more likable than the heroines. Tom grabs you right from the beginning when you see what an adorable young boy he was. I liked Lauren, but thought she was nuts for not grabbing Tom from the get go and holding on tight. This is a wonderful continuation of the English lords in Texas story. It is a one-sitting read and does not disappoint. The epilogue made me cry--it was so moving. This is a book not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgetable romance, just keeps getting better and better!","review":"Another winner for Lorraine. I am not going to go through the plot since so many other readers did such a wonderful job doing it. I am just going to add; that I was always a sucker for a teenage romance that lasts forever, and this one is definitely it. The love story is spectacularly written. I agree with the other reviewer that the last few paragraphs almost leave you in tears. However a word of advice, please read Lorraine's books in order. Her website has it all outlined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine story but....","review":"I was not taken in by the characters. Stronger tension and dramatic romance would better be served by reordering the way this book is presented. A good example of the whole \\"love revisted\\" theme was a book by Lisa Kleypas called \\"Again the Magic.\\" That book had me in tears. Or maybe, she was trying to do the whole \\"Notebook\\" thing which still didn't work for me. Instead, I am a bit sleepy after reading this one. The story is predictable, the antagonistic characters are like cookie cutter versions of the same characters in every romance.By the time you get into the romance, you think the heroine is still pining these last 10 years over a boy who just wanted to get a peek at her bosoms. We aren't treated to the rest of the flashbacks until much later and then it is too late...for their reunion meeting is over, and I just didn't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIGH...","review":"This is just another great Lorraine Heath book. It is sweet, touching, romantic, romantic, romantic. Made me want to cry. Made me sigh at the end. So there wasn't a lot of action or tension, it doesn't matter because it was romantic. I loved her Texas series, so Tom was a great hero. Highly recommend this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush, graphic sex in Victorian England ignites the reader.","review":"This historical romance-type setting for erotica, provides many lush and graphic sexual scenes. The woman-dominated-by-man theme may initially be uncomfortable to modern, sexually liberated women but the intense sensuality of the encounters soon surpasses one's reservations. It offers a total diversion from real life with the plot resolving in a satisfying, sensual manner that is ultimately respectful of Clarissa, the woman controlled by her lusty appetite."},{"rating":"2","title":"First 2 by Belew are worth checking out.","review":"Adrian's first 2 albums are a great intro to the wild musical world of Belew.

All current reviews published are in reference to the previous two-fer issue on Gott that was plagued with lackluster sound. I was about to buy this BGO edition outright and find out for myself how it sounds, until I saw the brilliant attention to detail paid by the art director on the cover titling \\"Twang Bar King\\" as \\"Twang Bar Kid\\".

Shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative Campaign Bio","review":"Then-Governor Jimmy Carter mixes personal biography and a modest agenda in this readably serious advertisement for his upcoming 1976 run for the White House. Honest and forthright, Carter is at his best describing his upbringing in rural Georgia and years as a U.S. naval officer. He's nearly as good describing the need for an energy policy, international diplomacy based on morality, and increasing opportunities for the poor. But the book lacks specifics on Carter's capable term as Governor of Georgia. Also, there's little sense here of what would arguably prove to be Carter's greatest weakness as President - his aloof unwillingness (or inability) to smooze important members of Congress. The book's title comes from Admiral Hyman Rickover, who as Carter's naval commander always demanded that his men do their best. This is a surprisingly good portrait from the standpoint of years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"A political campaign book","review":"This is a reprint of the book originally issued before the 1976 presidential campaign, and after all these years, is a very painful reminder of the promise and then the failure of the Carter presidency. In office, Carter proved to be a petty, self-righteous little man who was overwhelmed by the presidency. He was not a leader- he was a bureaucrat. His failures as President caused economic turmoil and international loss of respect for the United States. The book should be read for its irony only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drop Suckerpunch kicks A~~!!!","review":"This is one of the best CD's from 2004!

Footnotes are few, and there's little editorial help in navigating the complex historical, political, and religious issues relevant to the text.

It indicates many more steps than I actually take and is off by over a tenth of a mile in distance walked. I was especially disappointed when I learned that a friend and his fiance had purchased a different pedometer (for the same price as I paid for this one) that records their steps and distance travelled extremely accurately, even though they are completely different in height/weight characteristics. Moreover, theirs has a \\"talking\\" feature which tells them how many steps they have taken, etc. And, it looks nicer, with a black and silver case."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened!","review":"Others have indicated that their pedometer would 'count' on its own when sitting on a table...well mine did too!!

The extremes of the reviews, from 5 stars to 1 had me wondering if a few people just got a \\"lemon\\" OK - please listen to ME! It IS a waste of money. It IS difficult to open. It DOES NOT calculate correctly. I walk 10 steps and the readout varies from 14 to 256! I did reset, I did put the sensitivity button all the way to the left. It just is not a good item. Save time and choose another model/maker. I am returning mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is really helpful!","review":"I really like this little gadget. I try to get ten thousand steps a day and it is very accurate. When I first got it I would walk around the halls counting my steps and then check and it would be exact or almost exact every time. I don't tend to worry much about the distance or calories but if I did they would be really accurate and useful too. It encourages me to walk more and I'm hoping that maybe I will lose a little weight by walking ten thousand or more a day.

However, this product is not up to snuff. The first one I ordered was next to impossible to open, and returned to Amazon within a day.

The instructions are clear, but the machine doesn't seem to agree with my measurements, and so sometimes I get strange readings (30 paces, when I've walked 10 steps), etc... and no instructions given about how to troubleshoot this. I got it through experimentation, but I still get strange results...

I was adding a dozen steps to the readout just trying to get the door open. I tried to trim the plastic tab, but I took too much off, now the door flops open. It was useless the way it came from the factory, now I broke it and can't use it at all without a rubber band to keep it closed.Also, I was never able to get a very accurate step-count. I would count 100 steps and usually get 65-90 steps on the readout, though I'm not really sure because I had to shake the thing for a minute or two just to get the door open.For the price, I think this would be a great deal for someone with the patience to work with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Product...","review":"I ordered this product because of the great reviews that I read about it online. Once it was delivered, however, I was extremely disappointed with the purchase. First of all, I find it very hard to open. It requires a lot of force and is even more awkward to open when it is placed on a waistband (versus just holding it in your hands). I was also surprised that, not only is there no way to turn it off- it is constantly on and wasting batteries, but after leaving it on my dresser overnight I woke up to find out that it had walked 27 steps on its own while I was sleeping! Pretty amazing, huh? I am very disappointed in this product and surprised by all of the other reviews. Hopefully this one is just defective!"},{"rating":"2","title":"makes my day more fun!!","review":"i bought this because at my job i do a great deal of walking and just wanted an idea of how much i actually do walk. this device seems to over-count what you walk, but it has a sensitivity button on it to counter that. it counts calories, steps, and distance. the backlight is a neat little extra, as well as the clock. it is a small unit, so you don't realize you have it on half the time. but if you want a little extra fun in your life and are curious how much you move throughout the day, you should hook on of these up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent!!","review":"I love using a pedometer and recommend the simplicity and ease of use of this OS model... However, after buying many for friends and family I have to note the calibration is highly inconsistent. My husband kept bragging he was doing between 20,000 and 30,000 steps every day and I couldn't figure out how since I have a hard time getting in 10,000 steps a day without including a daily cardio workout. I wore both pedometers for a few days with the same settings and his is calculating 3X the steps as mine. I later learned a pedometer I had given as a gift was also over counting steps as well. Also the newer models are very difficult to open."},{"rating":"1","title":"500 Songwriting Ideas: For Brave and Passionate People","review":"This book stimulates the mind to a certain degree, however each listed idea seemed rather brief.

He will show you a few moves demonstrating his topic only to top it off by saying things like, \\"A simple yet strong move\\" only to follow with \\"Blacks takes advantage of White's weakening the f4 square\\" on Blacks next move. OK-If the simple yet strong move was so strong, please explain it.Why is it so strong when the very next move Black is able to take advantage of it?? Or, \\"The dark squares are permanently weakened,enhancing White's dark square Bishop\\" yet when Black does a mini combination that trades off this Bishop he says, \\"Black's remaining pieces are hopelessly uncoordinated.\\" If the Bishop reigned supreme how is Black worse off with it gone?Overall, this is a shallow book.

There are great uses of light, and the setting Ryga proposes is excellent, but the play itself is so rough and deliberate that it is a less-than-pleasant read. It was written in 1967, so though perhaps groundbreaking in its time, this play is not really one to read for enjoyment alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic effort.","review":"Funker Vogt is already quite well known with their electro-hard industrial sounds. While they haven't really made anything groundbreaking tracks, they have made some tracks that are catchy and hard. However, they skipped a step here with no decent effort. This is a remix cd yet the remixes are bland. I can not express how disappointed I was when the remixes only revealed slight changes or overdone distortion.

Other reviewers have pointed out plot problems, and between the by-the-numbers screenplay and William Wellman's competent but mostly unimaginative direction, there's little tension, no strong characters, and no memorable dialogue. Thank goodness the two stars had their innate screen presence to help keep this film from sinking outright; that said, there's no chemistry between Wayne and Bacall. For that matter, Bacall is woefully underutilized here. Other problems: Westerners cast in Chinese roles and lame attempts at Pidgin Chinese humor. Some decent production design, albeit rather too studio-bound.Wayne, Bacall, and Wellman all did much better work."},{"rating":"1","title":"provocative information but abysmal presentation","review":"If you've read Not By Fire But By Ice by Robert Felix then you'll find almost nothing new in this audiotape, in spite of the claim that it contains \\"missing chapters\\" of that book.Though I forgive Mr. Felix for the informal style of presentation (since he said in the intro to his book that he meant it to be an easy, fast read), I cannot forgive Laura Lee for a thoroughly annoying and unprofessional host/interviewer style. She interrupted Mr. Felix countless times. She'd introduce him or ask him a question, only to interrupt him in the middle of his answer, or start summarizing his answer before he finished giving it, or interrupt the answer to introduce a different topic or mention a related study... By the second tape I was yelling \\"Shut up!\\" at the tape player.Like others, I'd like to see a more organized presentation of the argument and supporting research. This tape is definitely not it.

Lloyd Carr's study of the Song of Songs (Canticles, Song of Solomon) does a great job of rescuing it from overly symbolic interpretations. Instead, says Carr, the Song is about just what it appears to be about. Sex, romance, and love. Carr unpacks the various images of flowers, gardens, grape vines, and spices, putting them into the context of Old Testament Israel's culture. He also forthrightly explores the explicit imagery of breasts, thighs, and sexual expression the book displays. Carr's book is short, pithy, but packed with enough information for the scholar. Written in the mid-1980s, it still seems fresh and frank and wonderfully edifying. My only reason for not giving five stars?

On the interpretation he discusses: allegory, typology, drama, and natural. Mercifully, he adopts the natural interpretation; it is ANE love poetry. The commentary itself is semi-technical with a lot of word studies. The Hebrew and Greek are transliterated. Footnotes are used (rather than endnotes), and these are helpful. Because he refers to the way Hebrew words are used in other parts of the OT, the book is also quite educational, I found a sense of beauty about the book, that was uplifting. He also refers to the LXX which was useful. The intro goes to p72 and at 192 pages the book is long enough to be useful. The new larger format of the Tyndale OT commentaries is superb.

A few prominent titles include \\"Safer Hands\\", \\"Killing\\", the chart-topping \\"You're not alone\\", and my favourite, \\"Curious\\". Although the pop-modern melody is present, this album seems geared toward the darker side of trip-hop, experimenting with deep drum & bass and toned down vocals rather than high pitched beeps and bops. A modest success and a solid recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just When You Thought You Had Heard It All...","review":"...something comes along that turns you on your ear. Whether you're looking for something to sit and space out to, dance until dawn to, or sing your lungs out to, this CD has at *least* a few tracks for you. The tone is definitely alternative, for those looking for something new. Yet the themes behind the songs are concurrent with what you'd hear on the radio. Lyrics that proclaim everything from the enamored \\"You're Not Alone\\" to the defiant \\"This Time/I'm ready for you\\" are in no small number here. Intensity, emotion, and breaking from tradition are the backbone to this CD, making it perfect for those who want to take their mindsets on a new path."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD.","review":"Take a little \\"Sade\\" a bit of \\"Morcheeba\\" some \\"Spicehouse\\" and a dash of \\"Frou Frou\\" mix it up and out comes \\"Olive\\". This is a great CD. Lots of soul and good songs, and a nice voice to top it off. This is a great collection of trip hop. \\"Trickle\\" is great too, but i'd check out this album first, the best song on this album is undoubtedly \\"Miracle\\".This a very talented group. Very instrumental, and very hypnotic, this album is great for anyone who likes relaxing music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for looks","review":"I bought this for a friend for his birthday.

About a third of the songs I'd never heard of, but loved. I'm only 16, so some of the songs from the older movies I didn't know, but they are great. One reviewer mentioned she was disappointed that the CDs contained so much new music, but for people my age and younger, Beauty & the Beast, Lion King and Little Mermaid ARE Disney. In summation, these CDs are absolutely the memories I needed, and well worth the price and wait. (By the way, the price?

It is great to hear not only the more popular songs with which I am familiar but also songs from live action movies or the original Wonderful World of Disney that my parents grew up on but I have not seen.

With a firm grasp of New York's abovegroud social history and a sense of bawdy fun, Sante creates in beautiful prose a portrait of the underground and reminds us how much the dispossessed and forgotten have contributed to our own daily lives as New Yorkers and as people. The graceful and inspring bibliographic essay is a nice bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Reading","review":"Luc Sante's Low Life is fascinating and engrossing reading. It's the story of New York, told from the underside. Luc Sante has given us an excellently researched, excellently written work which explores the seedy side of New York, from about 1840 through 1920. He lets us see how much New York City has changed, yet how much it has stayed the same. The improvements to life in New York are remarkable, not so much for what they are, but for what they improved upon. There is an almost uplifting message from this book: New Yorkers can accomplish anything, can improve everything, can recover anytime. If you know New York at all, or have any kind of interest in the city, I believe you will find this an engrossing, entertaining work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, readable intro to NY's wild years","review":"As a resident of a santized, tamed New York, I find it hard to imagine the city that Luc Sante describes in \\"Low Life.\\" Can't say I would prefer living in those crime-ridden and poverty-stricken days, but you can't help feeling a bit let down by the modern city reading about the colorful crooks and decadent nightspots of a hundred years ago. Sante has a real gift for making New York history readable and entertaining at the same time he conveys large chunks of valuable information. At times the sheer volume of names and incidents gets a bit tiring, but Sante's unique, world-weary voice will keep you reading past the rough spots. Highly recommended for anyone who liked \\"Gangs of New York\\" or who has a taste for truth stranger than fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong product, you send smoke, i buy clear","review":"Please note that the picture of this item its wrong, you are showing a clear lights and the one i was thinking.instead I find a very dark cristals,maybe its my mistake for not seen the word smoke.....the picture confuse me.Send me the clearones PLEASE !!!! i dont have money to bay them again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellowjackets Do It Again!","review":"I must confess that the Yellowjackets is my favorite band. But having said that, I do not like everything they have done, but I sure do like this one. Some of it is straight-ahead jazz, some of it is fusion, and all of it is very well done.

Does have a nice serial number list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photos were lacking","review":"I was a little disappointed in the that the book has no photographs of the cockpit of a C-5 yet, the author did manage to get cockpit photos of a C-141 and a Russian An-124! Also, I would have expected some photos of the plane under construction. There were none of those. There weren't any photos of the troop compartment and not very many photos of the cargo compartment or of anything being loaded onto the aircraft. In fact, a lot of the photos appear to have been taken at airshows!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No kitchen should be without it!","review":"Diane Phillips' Happy Holidays cookbook has become one of my favorites (and I have a collection of about 200 cookbooks). I love to cook for friends and family, but also like to be able to spend time visiting with them. I've tried three of Diane's complete meals (appetizers through desserts) and have not only found every recipe to be delicious and attractive, but was able to do the majority of preparation well ahead of time. Although I'm retired, it's great for working folks also because you can do a dish every couple of evenings, freeze or refrigerate them, depending on the dish, and just add the last minute touches on the day of your dinner. I've gotten rave reviews on each of her 'feasts' and look forward to cooking more of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I had actually looked at the recipes I wouldn't have bought it","review":"This book has less than a dozen photos at the very beginning and they're not that great of photos to begin with. I like to see what the dish is suppose to look like and I would think the food editors could have found a decent food photographer. The recipes don't seem to make sense with the holidays, like Father's Day is chicken fajitas and margaritas. Isn't Father's day about steak? and beer? That could have been any meal, nothing special about it for Father's Day. The paper the book is written on is matte finish, almost like cheap recycled paper and the print is not a dark black, some of it is actually hard to read especially where it's gray. I think the Sandra Lee holiday book is better or even the Celebrations book by Betty Crocker. Don't pay full price for this and certainly don't give as a gift, the polenta crust cheesecake was awful as was the marcapone berries parfaits. You can see why it's down to $3.00 used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly turgid","review":"I feel sorry for the any student in American Studies who has to read this dense, jargon filled book.

It traces the concept of patriotism from Sparta throught the Founding to current times.Of particular interest is its discuss of why Frederick Douglass felt that before a black man could become a citizen, he should first serve as a soldier.It discusses why the Founders realized the critical need for patriots, while at the same time not holding out much hope for such people.I strongly recommend this book, especially in light of current events."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT!","review":"This device works really well. Similar to \\"the stick\\" but I like this better. It comes with a handy reference guide, but as a personal trainer I have additional recommendations. Roll on RELAXED muscle. The area you want to work will respond better if you do not activate the muscle. Then try to stretch afterwards to further lengthen the muscle(s). Don't ponder this one, JUST BUY IT! No regrets, I promise. Oh, initially the lubricant inside will get tacky and rolling will be slow, after using it daily it slicks up and rolls more freely. A good thing for new users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes muscles happy!","review":"This is GREAT for preventing injury and rolling out sore or tight muscles.

My three year old grandson loves to say the name of this movie. He loved it. My favorite character wasGerard the Giraffe. My grandson's favorite was Marty, the monkey.Marty is always getting into scrapes. If something bad is going to happen it will be when Marty is around. Marty does not mean to get into mischief, but it happens just the same.I love that these stories are teaching lessons from parables that Jesus told. There are three parables used for these stories,The Lost Pearl, The Soil and the Seeds, and The Wedding banquet.We kept asking my grandson what he was watching just to hear him say BoogaBooga Land. It was hilarius to hear him talk about it.I recieved this dvd free of charge from Book Sneeze for writing this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adventures in Booga Booga Land DVD Review","review":"Both of my kids were excited to watch this. Each episode is about 15 minutes, and they all held my kids attention.The series are meant to be comparable to Jesus' parables. While we watched, however, we couldn't really draw any decent similarities. The stories themselves were a little bit random and didn't serve a whole lot of religious purpose, at least not in my kids' (or my) eyes. This actually distressed my 8-year old, because she was trying really hard to understand the \\"point\\" and to take a lesson away from it. They were very fun and silly videos though, and will possibly be watched again by my 4-year old boy. I give this DVD 2 stars.* I received no monetary compensation for my review.

The goo-goo ga-ga remind me of some movie reviewers who have yet to see a bad movie. If you want to get substantive knowledge about parrot behavior that can aid with your parrot(s), then this book is not it. This book is a rambling treatise ridden with generalities and few exercisable action items nor insights. The gist of the book, with careful annotation and qualifications, can be explicated in 1-2 pages. The author, by all indication, seems to be an expert parrot counselor who has significant experience and success solving \\"parrot problems.\\" Regrettably, that knowledge does not translate in this book. There seems to be a more recent book by the author I will buy and take a look. I believe in giving a second chance. A third chance is another matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a must have for any parrot owner","review":"If you plan on buying a parrot, you should buy this book first. I was first recommended this book by a local pet shop owner that specialized in birds. Parrots can be very rewarding pets, but they can also become nightmare pets if you do not know what you are doing. This book is good for day to day reference as well as a book to read cover to cover although it can be a bit repetitive. It covers everything from choosing a bird, cages and toys, health and hygiene, and most importantly, behavior (screaming, chewing, biting, feather chewing, etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginners book","review":"Lots of basic info for first time bird owners, helps you to get a feel for what you are getting into and basic care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Learning Tool","review":"I am new to parrots and this book literally takes you by the hand and addresses whatever issue you are having.

These creatures are far too intelligent and compassionate to force them to understand our needs and our expectations of behavior. I have found that trying to listen to what your parrot may need and want - by simply paying attention to their movements and their eyes will get you much farther. An attitude of profound respect and love, will lead you into this bird's life, as opposed to leading you into a position of warden in this bird's mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid book for beginners","review":"supports ideas with past experiences... solid book... bad format ... the first chapter of substance is a list of games you can play with your parrot... rest of the book is well written and in paragraph form"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"When I bought my baby amazon last summer, I needed information, I had done some reseach before my purchase but a lot of it was old info.

This book has much to offer, and I recommend reading it before adopting a bird."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ this if you have the first edition...","review":"When I read the write ups, it sounded like this is a whole new second edition book with new topics. So I bought it, but unfortunately for me, it's almost exactly like her first edition. All titles, and topics are exactly the same as the first edition, except for about 2 topics in the entire book. A few pictures were changed, but the context was the same. I knew the first edition so well after reading it several times I was very surprised to see everything repeat itself in her second edition.

The first - McCarthy's Towers of Power - has a lot of interesting sounds and textures. The third movement is especially attractive. The Plog is a delightful work, the best work on the album. The playing is lovely, and the flute is never lost in the texture. I love the Glass Concerto, and this performance is exciting. The ensemble and soloists play with precision and energy. The biggest problem is the sound quality. The ensemble is muffled and distant, and that undercuts the effectiveness of the music.

It gives the background and history of France, maps, and vocabulary. It conjugates verbs in chapters for each set, such as -er, -ir, -re and irregular verbs in present and past tense. It gives you many examples to work on and sometimes my teacher even reverses the rules so instead of re-conjugating the verb back into the sentence, she makes us translate it instead. All of the words are listed in the back (except for some easy ones) and there's a handy index too. All exercises in the book can be used in lots of ways instead of just what they say.

She's also shiningly intelligent, highly creative and nobody's fool. I found the review comment about her sense of self-importance interesting because, in the letters she's sent to me, the sense is just the opposite. She's just one person responding to another in the most friendly, generous and genuine way. Few celebrities of her stature write anyone about anything; she not only writes but most personably and personally. I find it interesting that as she grows older she looks better, not worse.

Part 2!","review":"If you read my review of Yes, Minister, there is little I can add to that review to describe this series. Yes Prime Minister picks up where Yes Minister left off. The premise is that the PM resigns mid-term, and a new PM is needed. A recently promoted Sir Humphrey Applebee determines there is only one person who can project the image needed yet he can control... Jim Hacker! You will see many wonderful and new looks into the political scene - yet never stating any party affiliation.Included in this set is what I feel is the funniest episode of the series where Jim Hacker is about to hold his first press conference. You would never believe that simply the way you sit could totally change the impression of what is being said until you see this! BRILLIANT!Also included is a great tribute to Paul Eddington, a life cut short way too soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant","review":"This is the finest political satire in existence. The ever verbose Humphrey almost always gets what he wants. Sometimes the Prime Minister gets a few unbridled moments of pleasure, however this is rare, the public service runs Great Britain, not the politicians. Written by two former British public servants, it's a fascinating insight into the real working of politics. Americans may find the humour hard to understand as the english vocabulary used is quite extensive, and if American sitcoms are anything to go by, the average vocabulary of an American is used twice over in an episode of Sesame Street."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great British Satire","review":"Yes Prime Minister is a satire about British politics. It is centered around the Prime Minister, who is believed to run the country, and the civil servants who actually run the country. The Prime Minister has innovative ideas that could revolutionize the England but is continuously stymied by the civil service who seeks to maintain the status quo.It relies on wit and prose for its humor rather than slapstick comedy and it achieves this in spades.An allround great watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best show ever - but....","review":"I am one of the greatest fans of this series and I own the tapes and the Yes Minister series as well. When I recommended the series to a friend she started talking about some episodes I had not seen after she bought the set. So I immediately ordered the Complete Selection with the added episodes. However, I was so disappointed with the quality of the images. Dark shadows around the faces and when the people move you can see smears across the screen. It has the quality of a bootleg version. Not at all worth the BBC label. The effect is somewhat diminished when I run the episodes on my small screen laptop which is my only option. My husband and I had looked forward to have a good laugh together on our TV - but that is not possible with this set of CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb British Comedy","review":"Just as excellent as Yes, Minister with the same perfectly matched ensemble. BBC sitcoms of the 70s and 80s deliver wonderful entertainment. Yes, Prime Minister and its predecessor offer wonderful dialogue and humor in every episode. Also recommend the BBC comedy series \\"Good Neighbors\\" if you enjoy this as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Disturbingly \\"contemporary\\", despite its original air date. I have watched this series repeatedly and am always impressed by the outstanding writing and excellent character portrayal."},{"rating":"2","title":"great political comedy","review":"If you like politics (especially, but not exclusively, if you have a conservative bent), then you will really enjoy this show. It is witty and relevant. A friend of mine who interned in the House of Commons says that they were required to watch some episodes-the series is that true to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO SUBTITLES!!","review":"I was extremely disappointed that the set has no subtitles. I think BBC should add subtitle to the set immediately, and replace the set to those who requests subtitles free of charge.The content of the DVD is great. The bonus features are great too. But for those who can't hear the conversation, please buy the book instead, or/and wait for a new release with subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot stand laugh tracks","review":"I watched all of three minutes of this well-reviewed series.

As soon as I took it out of the box I noticed the handle was a bit loose. Within a couple of weeks, the handle broke off. It was if it had been glued to the pot, as there was no hole into the pot where the handle was.

Excellent examples illuminate LeClair's text in a way that makes perfect sense for artists. LeClair applies sound color theory to art-making and inspires at the same time.

It is a comprehensive look at many approaches to the use of color (not a guide, as many books are, to using color in the the same way as their authors).

They spoke to me very deeply, they were affirming, loving and empowering. I cannot say enough good things about the songs, the lyrics, the music and the heartfelt singing. I listen to this when I am down, I dance to it and I sing along wherever I am. An absolutely wonderful collection of inspirational and mood-uplifting songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very important! Feed your shadow!","review":"The most important concept to come out of this book is the idea of feeding the shadow. This means we must give the devil his due from time to time. Did you know that the talisman is a minor form of evil intended to protect us from a worse evil? You will know all about this if you read Erich Neumann. There is no sense in trying to be good all of the time - it will just blow up in your face eventually. This is why we must learn to channel or canlize the libido in the proper manner - so that it does no real harm to ourselves or anyone else. Neumann is brilliant when it comes to teaching men how to feed their shadow - and divest ourselves of fear of the feminine - to prevent an unintended eruption of the shadow side of the unconscious. After all, the evil we can control is much less evil than the evil that is out of control. This is a great book for any man who wishes to take back control of sin and canlize the libido into a productive endeavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of great early Diz in one spot...unlike the LPs","review":"All of this stuff is contained on the RCA Victor Vintage Series LPs of Diz, and another RCA LP called \\"The Best Of Dizzy Gillespie\\" - but how nice it is to see it all in one spot. The two different takes (one abbreviated) of \\"Night In Tunisia\\", \\"Manteca\\", \\"Anthropology\\", the Afro-Cubano stuff with Chano Pozo, on and on...even the Teddy Hill cuts. Any serious student or fan of Diz must have this. Yes, there are a few 'filler' cuts, but hey - that's historic, too! Now what really would be nice would be to see a Prestige CD of what was contained in the 2LP set \\"In The Beginning\\" with stuff like \\"She's Gone Again\\" and \\"He Beeped When He Should'a Bopped\\", and the like. I'll have to dig further..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bop at its Best","review":"Like bop? Can you stand mono? Like the Diz? If you answered yes to any of those questions you will like these CDs.

Alter Bridge is amazing and I will continue to buy concert dvds of them if they make more of them. As close to being there, comes with a cd with live tracks from the show but not all songs, like 13 tracks and the concert blu ray has 21 songs; why it's like that I have no idea. If you are a fan of Alter Bridge, you'll love this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I expected","review":"I am a huge fan of concert DVD's and saw this release by Alter Bridge on sale, not a big fan of Alter Bridge although I bought the first CD and never really listened to it much after that. Recently I've seen Myles with Slash and was pretty impressed and since there wasn't any concert dvds coming out that I didn't already have, I took a chance and ordered the blu ray and so glad I did ! Really enjoyed watching the concert, sound and video top notch and the music itself was very powerful and enjoyable.

I used the reviews which were very helpful. It is fantastic! Not too confusing like some I purchased which were very technical. (Not being a scientist, I couldn't use a lot of them because I didn't know their botanical names!) This book is definitely user friendly. I am recommending it to my friends who also are getting into herb gardening. A lot of information for a good price, you won't be disappointed. Great recipe ideas too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but...","review":"This is an excellent book, but there are a couple of drawbacks. First, and most annoying, is the ordering of the herbs by scientific name. Makes it hard to find the herb you're looking for. Second, it's a large book, takes up a lot of space on the table and doesn't fit on all shelves.It has served me well enough, but I recently came acrossYour Backyard Herb Garden: A Gardener's Guide to Growing Over 50 Herbs Plus How to Use Them in Cooking, Crafts, Companion Planting and Moreand I have to say this is the book I would pick up instead, in retrospect. I may even buy it anyway. It's small, has all the reference information in this one (and then some), and more readily available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a classic","review":"I haven't heard the Mental's recent stuff, but this is a classic pop/rock album. I love Cats and Dogs as well, but this album has an even richer, more subtle texture and, like Cats and Dogs, one great song after another. Hard to pick favorites; it's changed over the years. I remember I first heard the Lp at a party in 1983, and I was blown away. I asked the host what it was, and I was surprised I'd never even heard of them. I immediate purchased, and have purchased four others over the years. This is still my favorite, with Cats and Dogs a close second. If you missed them, and still love great pop/rock, Creatures of Leisure is not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice to find this here","review":"One of my favorite albums of the early 80s.

Just one problem: the American LP had a great version of Orbison's \\"Working For the Man.\\" Where is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a blast, but the label had to fiddle w/ success","review":"On vinyl this *was* the album I could play day after day, year after year. Folks new to this won't miss the changes, but if you loved the US vinyl version, be prepared. The CD is not as good as the US LP. The songs are different, additions *and* subtractions. The CD packaging/liner art is poor. The artwork on the vinyl album liner (done by one of the band members) was outstanding, and totally complemented the music (one piece of art per song). It mystifies me as to why they would have changed a single thing! Buy it anyway, you will not regret getting this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A light weight indeed","review":"I was looking for a light weight vacuum to replace a 20lb Dirt Devil that has served me well for 6+ years.It's lighter and it does have good suction but I'm under whelmed with the features. The quick release hose only reaches about 3' off the unit and then it starts to tip. Don't even think about leaving it at the bottom of the steps and vacuuming them with the attachments....I could only reach 2 or 3 steps with every attachment it came with compared to an entire set of stairs with the Dirt Devil and its attachments. I may be picky but what's the use of a light weight machine when you have to lug the thing up the steps with you to clean. I think it would be fine as a back up or for limited use.

Gilbert has come across some fascinating material in his pursuit of the great man. It is also interesting to see how exactly a biography is written. The book starts out focusing more on the author, but works its way into Churchill. Gilbert steps away from merely events in his life and through letters and those who knew him best, gets down to the inner man. The best part is a letter Churchill dictated when he was only a small boy where he predicts a great deal of his future.

It is hard to remember which tracks have beats, and in Yokota's world it doesn't matter. By the time 'Kodomotachi' arrives, the listener is reveling in the mercurial interplay of subtle melodies and refined reverb. With a welcome suddenness, the looping keys of 'Naminote' redefine nu-jazz, effortlessly matching Innerzone Orchestra's 'At Les' as an artful hybrid of IDM and acoustic jazz. More subdued themes shake out the remaining momentum, but by now the player is on repeat play, ready for another round of this underestimated bliss."},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful!","review":"I am a long time Amazon user and after listening to this album I was motivated to write my first ever review.I bought this cd after listening to the amazon samples.

It took a little getting used to, as the instructions don't really tell you that you do have to apply a minimal amount of pressure downwards on the bottle when opening. but once you figure that out, it takes NO EFFORT at all to open any bottle.The charging dock is a very nice touch. For this price, i would have expected just a cable, or heck a USB cable to recharge the thing. But having a nice steady cradle for the opening to call it's home is ideal, and was frankly unexpected and a welcome surprised.

We're both excited about the wine opener, but not about the Chiller. It's just a little bucket that you put ice and water in to chill the wine. My opinion, it should have had a cord or some type of attachment that can help the water get colder faster in order to chill the wine faster. So bump the lil bucket, and just put your wine in the freezer for the same amount of time as the Chiller and get the same result if not colder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little tool","review":"After using this electric wine opener a couple of times, I wondered why I waited so long to purchase it!

It's great for anyone..but especially for those of us with arthritic wrists and keeping it continuously charged allows for ready use. The wine chiller is a nice accompanying item, though not really necessary. I keep it in the freezer for use as needed.

The electric opener is a breeze, and makes opening a wine bottle virtually effortless. It is a great gift for wine lovers - I've already given one as a gift and plan to order too more.

One annoyance about the opener is that the light indicator on the device is always on when its in the charging base. The light is rather large and red. As for the chiller, well I don't see much use in it. Honestly I didn't read the instructions for it, so I am not even sure how it is supposed to chill the wine. It is simply a tin bucket with no cooling device or even insulation to it. With most bottles of wine, there wouldn't even be any room to add ice to it. My best guess is that you could chill the thing in the freezer before putting the wine bottle in it. Perhaps just the nature of the metal absorbing the cold from a chilled bottle is supposed to help keep the bottle from warming up so quickly.

The book is more a mouthpiece for Watters' militantly athestic views than a scientific treatise on religion's psychological effects on young individuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: Roadbike Restoration","review":"These were recommended by the well known bike expert Sheldon Brown, as a replacement set of calipers for vintage 10 speed bikes that required an extremely long reach caliper to reach the bike rim. FAIL. Due to this calipers overall cheap construction and the very long reach, they did not work. When applied at full force, it took well over 10 feet to stop. With such long arms, it just becomes a physics problem; Not enough torque.I'd recommend restorers to go to a machine shop and have someone make you a set of drop bolts so you can use more modern, better calipers.I can't say as to how these would work on BMX bikes (their original application), but I am guessing by how flimsy they are that they wouldn't work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush Musical Soundscape, Great Recording","review":"Very rich and musical New Age music.

This movie did not show his full potential as an actor, but the music rocks. Not every film has to be deep and meaningful, it is okay to just have fun sometimes. This movie is a great escape...some funny moments...some sexy moments...a little bit heavy in some places...a great Saturday night all alone and solitary film.Jennifer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to stomach is the real title of this movie.","review":"Hard to stomach is the real title of this movie. My wife made me watch it, and I find it hard to believe that somebody with that type of talent would make a movie so bad. The only saving grace was the music. Graham Parker is very under-rated performer as well as Rick himself. Buy the sound track and skip the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is already on DVD?!?","review":"Sorry, but when I came across this title and that it is already on DVD when so many of my old favorites are still only avilable on VHS. I am astonished to say the least.That and how well this is rated by viewers. True, the sound track is worth 5 stars - so go buy the soundtrack. This movie however is a turkey and was a huge disapointment to me as a fan and I was embarrassed for Rick Springfield when it came out, of course it didn't prevent me from watching it several times over.(oh, and I was 15 at the time) I still cringe when I think back to the bad script, the worn-out story line and who the hell cast Janet Elber as the love interest, was she cut out of wood!? This is Rick Springfield, he's sexy, he's talented and here he is unforgivably wasted.Do Rick and yourself a favor, look away on this one and go wear out the soundtrack instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"a memory picture","review":"(my english is not good).when i saw this picture i began to play the electric guitar, love somebody's song was a special theme to me.now i play this type of music: BRYAN ADAMS, RICK SPRINGFIELD, JOURNEY, NIGHT RANGER, REO SPEEDWAGON, ETC.... 80's music.¿what do you think?. i want to know if i can to buy this picture FROM CHIHUAHUA, MX., send me a e-mail to tell what i have to do.thanks......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rick is STILL hot!","review":"I LOVE Rick and that will never change but the difference between how i \\"thot\\" i felt about this movie i remember from my teen years and now are well.......kinda \\"hard to hold\\" in LOL......stick to the singing babe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Music Soundtrack's better","review":"First, let me just say I'm a HUGE Rick Springfield fan.

Save your money on the movie and order that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Review","review":"I saw this movie many years ago and I heard a couple of songs from themovie on the radio and decided to purchase it.

Rick Springfield is really good in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard To Hold","review":"In \\"Hard to Hold\\", Rick Springfield was able to show the humble, compassionate and faithful side of a rock star falling in love. Working many concerts over the years, I have seen the different personalities of rock stars.(I have even met Rick!) I am very appreciative that he was able to portray a successful musician and show a more personal side. I especially can relate to the role of the teacher...since I am one! \\"Hard to Hold\\" is a Cinderella story...dreamable and believeable. I could care less if it won awards or not....I truly enjoyed watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plot gets no stars; Rick gets one.","review":"Hard to Hold was hard to swallow and hard to watch. It featured 80s pop star Rick Springfield as a teen idol who falls in love with a prissy psychologist. It's your typical opposites attract love story with only the flavor of Springfield's music to get you through the minutes. It was a completely embarrising first feature film for Springfield (which he admitted in later years), and it failed to let critics see past the lame storyline to Springfield's true acting ability. Springfield is a pretty good actor, but unfortunately Hard to Hold was a hard vehicle to display such talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rick's so so movie","review":"I saw this in the movie theatre when it came out and couldn't believe Rick did this mediocre movie at the height of his career. It's just okay and somewhat embarassing in parts. Also the lead actress was totally miscast...I had trouble believing that his character would fall for her...Rick could have done better than this but I bought it on DVD when it came out being a Rick fan...I LOVE Rick on GH when he appears though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Die Hard Rick Springfield fans only!!","review":"Sure the acting is pretty horrible and the plot is pretty stupid,but if you love Rick Springfield you can not miss here. Music is very very good and we get some much needed rear-end views of Rick. They could have come up with better story and supporting actors but you win some and you lose some. Poor Janet Ebert( the prissy phys. here) I do not think she has done anything but a bit extra part in the movie Might Joe Young since this movie. If you are a fan and have not seen this movie yet do not wait. Rent or buy it now. Or wait and check tv listings it is usually on USA's up all night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!! 1 of my favs of all time...","review":"Along with later released Hell On Earth. This album is strictly street. A very dark album with not 1 track mentioning partying a clubs or tricking on girls.Havoc was at his beat producing peak on this one.

With The Infamous being there second album, it is also there best,featuring artists like Big Noyd,Nas, and Wu-Tang's Raekwon,this is clearly one of the greatest hip hop albums ever recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"THESE 2 WORDS","review":"YO ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS 2 WORDS SHOOK ONES YO IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS RECORD GO LISTEN TO KELLY CLARKSON, OR CLAY AKINS NO DISREPECT TO THEM BUT THIS IS A MUST HAVE CLASSIC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, grimy tales from the slums of New York City","review":"Mobb Deep always used the studio to report from the battlefield (Queensbridge). What you get on this album is dark, realistic street-tales over grimy, scary beats. The music gets less grimier on some cuts, but it soon gets dark again. This CD is very good, but I can't give it five stars. The production on some tracks gets too dark and too slow, and damn near boring. Prodigy is a little overrated as an emcee. He is not bad, but he's not THAT good. His voice gets rather annoying, and he doesn't even rhyme all the time.Nevertheless, this is very good album, and it contains one of the best songs in hip-hop of all-time. Namely \\"Shook Ones Pt. 2\\". I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys underground hip-hop. If you began listening to Mobb Deep when Hell On Earth or Murda Muzik came out, you may not like this album. But give it a try, alright?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Mobb Deep--Hate Amazon","review":"The Infamous is a classic album. While Mobb Deep may have jumped the shark into mainstream rap, their sophomore effort still stands the test of time as an essential East Coast/NY hip hop record.My 1 star review is for Amazon and false advertising. Nowhere on The Infamous' page on Amazon does it mention that this album is going to be shipping without album art--it comes in a black sleeve. I'm not saying that the cover is essential to my listening experience, but if I'm gonna pay for something, I'd like to actually get what I paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mobb Deep is NOT even close to bein one of tha best","review":"Mobb Deep has sum good songs but only a few.Their stylez borin,I dont need Mobb Deep 2 tell me shit thass goin down, if I wanna know, I'll juss open up tha door..is that tha only thang they can flow about??If u want a TIIIIGHT cd...go buy Makaveli,E. 1999 Eternal,Creepin On Ah Comeup,or Guerilla Warefare. (dont look under mobb deep)"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGLY RAPPING","review":"Mobb Deep can't flow. Their rhymes are so choppy i don't understand how anyone can even listen to them. If you really want something good out of Queen's then get Illmatic or I Am... by Nas, or even Noreaga's new joint. Even southern emcees can flow better than these two guys. Anyone can talk about the ghetto, but it's not rap if you just rhyme when ever you feel like it... there's got to be some order to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"It's simple really: put this disk in your player and see how many times you listen to it continuously, it's going to be more than twice. This is the kind of disk that you play over and over again. There is nothing particularly innovative about this disk (that is - outside of charting the self-contained development of Mobb Deep's own sound) but Havoc and Prodigy blend seamlessly with the minimal but stellar production. Almost every song is well crafted, lyrically and musically. The inspired beats crackle with energy and all the songs are laced with choruses that make you want shout and gangsta stomp. I freestyle over this record all the time- the groveling baselines just propel the voice. This album has it's own flow that pulls you like an undertow you just can't escape. Drown to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bridge","review":"This album is a classic that belongs in every heads collection. The bridge was serving out hip-hop like no other borough in the mid 90's, with The Infamous, Illmatic, KRS-Ones self-titled album and other lesser known projects such as Big Noyd's Episodes of a Hustla, (which, by the way, also belongs in every heads collection). This LP includes the now \\"infamous\\" hit, Shook Ones Pt. II., along with my personal favorites Temperatures Rising and Survival of the Fittest."},{"rating":"2","title":"New York's Finest duo","review":"Yo yall that wonderin if this cd is worth buying, what is wrong with you. This cd has not one good song, it has 16/16 good songs. Shook Ones pt.2, Survival Of The Fittest, Q.U., Cradle to the Grave, and The Start Of Yo Ending. Shook ones is the classic but to anyone who is a Queensbridge fan or even a hardcore rap fan u need to bump this. It shows Havoc and Prodigy in their best. Everyone better buy this if ur lookin at it otherwise u will regret buying Jay Z or someone who aint real. One Love"},{"rating":"2","title":"NO SUCH THING AS HALF WAY CROOKS!!!","review":"This is what im talking about, it has to be said 93/95 were great years for hip hop and this piece of fantastic music was born right in the middle in 94. Mobb Deep the duo consisting of MC/producer Havoc and Prodigy came back after their great debut, but not only did they come back but havoc introduced a whole new sound, one which was no doubt inspired by Wu-Tang the year before. These beats most of which are classics Showcase the talent which is Havoc, he is a seriously underated producer and a decent MC and prodigy compliments Havoc both as a rhyme partner but just running on a Havoc beat. This is a seriously good lp although I have to say if you are not a fan of new york thug rap then you may not like this but this is thug rap at it's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queens Finest","review":"The Infamous is quite a CD. When I first bought it in '96 after Hell on Earth came out I couldn't believe it was released only a year ago. It's amazing how far ahead of it's time their rhymes and production were for such young MCs. The song \\"Eye for an Eye\\" with Nas and Raekwon was slammin. And Shook Ones pt. II took it to a whole new level. The freestyles on here are raw and uncut. Pick up this joint it's blazin! Ya heard what I'm tam'bout."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Instant Classic","review":"What can I say? This group recorded a classic album and a masterpiece in the rap game that you can just be proud of been part of that era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight cd","review":"Sick Cd, totaly worth buying.

If your new to the Mobb this is a good starting point to see what the fuss is all about them slipping (speaking of P). I for one thing they have improved due to the unit, I just hope they get better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another CLASSIC out of Queensbridge","review":"There's a reason that over 90% of the reviews are for 5 stars - because it deserves it. Sure, if you don't like hip hop, then you probably won't like it... but for hip hop fans, this is a must buy. It's easily one of my favourite hip hop albums of all-time, at least in the top 10, if not top 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn it up LOUD to fully appreciate.","review":"Oh man, I still remember when this one dropped... One of the most hardcore albums ever, for a few reasons. One: lyrics are so real. Two: pioneered the \\"gritty\\" sampling sound. Three: the snares. Just crank this up in the car or home, and listen to how hard the snares crack. It's like getting beaten with a baseball bat. Anyone who was listening at the time know how many people copied the style on this album, but there's only one original."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE UNDISPUTED GREATEST GANGSTA RAP ALBUM OF ALL TIME.","review":"The Infamous in my opinion is the greatest gangsta rap album of all time. It is one of the only albums I have ever listened to that everyone I've ever known that listens to rap (east coast fan, or west) has agreed is truly great. Every track is a work of art - a work of urban art. There are not many gansta rap albums out there that \\"keep it real\\" like this album does. Havoc and Prodigy came hard on this album, and they produced an absolute gangsta rap classic. This album was released in the early to mid 90s, and I still listen to it to this day quite regularly. The Infamous was definitely ahead of its time. This album is absolutely essential to the collection of anyone who dares to even think they know anything about not just gangsta rap, but rap itself. If you don't have it and you consider yourself a rap fan, you really need to add this album to your collection. Your rap music collection is nothing more than mediocre without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Economics Professor Review","review":"It is sad that with all the melt downs and the coming melt down we still teach our young adults garbage like the IS-LM Model.

The film chronicles strange and wondrous man-made structures but never really gets to the heart of what drives such unique and painstaking creativity. The makers of Scrap could have certainly taken a lesson there. I once saw a 22 minute episode on tv about the maker of a hotdog stand shaped like a hotdog that was more entertaining. Advisable only for background watching. Pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"5.Medellia Of The Gray Skies","review":"This is another one of the singles from The Aeroplane Flies High set that has a song that is one of the best of The Smashing Pumpkins and should be on the best of CD. Medellia is a peaceful acoustic song done with several guitars and with style. Definately my favorite song on here, and the re-make of Tonight,Tonight is good too. Another best of song there is \\"Mouthes Of Babes\\"(get that one on the single for Zero) which is heavy and another one that missed out on the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great single...","review":"\\"Tonight, Tonight\\" is of course a great song, and its accompanying b-sides mix very well with it. These are all pretty good songs, and are mostly laid-back. \\"Rotten Apples\\" is a nice little sleepy song, and my favorite of the original b-sides. \\"Tonite Reprise\\" is the biggest reason to buy this single (make sure the version of the single you're buying has this song on it!). It's a beautiful acoustic version of the a-side with a slightly different lyrical arrangement.The singles from Mellon Collie all had great b-sides included on them (except 1979), and this is one of the better collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWV: Survivors","review":"New Beginning and It's About Time are SWV'S best. New Beginning is a cd you can play from beginning to end, every track is so amazin' as SWV says. I even like the interludes Where Is The Luv and New beginning. I wish they were complete songs instead of just one minute long. About the only song I can do without is Luv Is So Amazin' but overall, this is a classic no one can do without. I can't believe Taj is on Survivor! She already has a million dollars but i hope she still wins! She need anotha million baby! GO TAJ! I HOPE U WIN GIRL, GET THAT MONEY BABY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Their Best...4 1/2 Stars","review":"SWV defintely showed growth between this and It's About Time. They kinda slowed down on the new jack swing material and showcased more ballads and their vocals. Taj and Lelee get to sing lead and Coko and Taj lend a hand in songwriting which shows their growth as artists. The best tracks are \\"You're the One\\", \\"Love is So Amazin\\", \\"When This Feeling\\", \\"Fine Time\\". There were really no low points of the album and this album really showed that these Sisters do have Voices. Good Job!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"diluted and weakly written","review":"This book is one of the weaker True Crime books I've come accross lately. What I found most irritating with this one is how diluted and padded this skimpy 300 pager is. The author pours in so many unnecessary generalized ingredients which lack detail and flavor. Without being too cruel, this book reminds me of a high school kid's padded report on Jeffrey Dahmer who didn't have all that much information to start with and STRETCHED it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot about everything but the crimes","review":"I tried but could not read past the first half of this book. Pages and pages are dedicated to the history of the rubber industry, the creation of the beer industry, the childhoods of people who eventually had buildings or streets named after them... but very little about Dahmer's crimes. When the book finally starts discussing the killings, each victim gets about a paragraph of text. The writing is poor, and it reads more like a history paper and a discussion of current world events, with a few blurbs about the murders thrown in. This book is not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, but poorly written.","review":"This book has a lot of information about Dahmer's childhood, his early adult life, and his life as a serial killer. It also describes in detail his apartment, where he commited most of his murders, as well as his mode of killing. There are very brief descriptions about each of his victims, and how Dahmer met them and killed them. These descriptions are boring, and perhaps that is somewhat to be expected since Dahmer's method was so formulaic.However, I was surprised by how poorly written this book is. It is filled with repetitive descriptions, stupid metaphors, and generally awkward sentences. Also, I was surprised that there was not more of an attempt to understand the man and his motivations. There is an interview with a psychiatrist, but it barely scratched the surface of Dahmer's psyche, and also roamed quite far off topic.In summary, I read plenty of information about the man and his crimes, but doing so was not a pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Milwaukee Murders","review":"Too general, repetitive and inaccurate. The author actually repeats the incident between the police and the 14 years old Laotian boy four times, without adding anything new.

I have never in my life read such a poorly written,dull inaccurte, dry book. If you want to know about the rubber industy, the beer industry, Milwaukee this is the book for you.

If you really want to read something accurate about the man behind the murders, read \\"A Father's Story\\" by Lionel Dahmer. If you enjoy reading a story based on sensationalism, this book is OK. It was entertaining to read, but so is \\"The National Enquirer.&quot"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks can be deceiving","review":"This book was amazing. I couldn't put it down for about 3/4 of it. How Dahmer disposed of his victims was interesting. The part where the cops went into Dahmer's apartment to investigate what was going on between him and Konerak Sinthasomphone was absolutely heart-pounding. How Dahmer talked to them in such a calm and collective manner I don't know. The only dull parts in this great book were when the author describes Dahmer's appearance in court, the Cheif of Police suspending the 3 cops who investigated Dahmer's apartment but passed it off as a fight between [them], and the funeral of Konerak Sinthasomphone. Aside from that if you like researching about serial killers buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly beneficial in the classroom","review":"I just finished teaching a seminar to high school seniors about the art of the personal essay and Dinty Moore's book was a godsend for them.

Without using esoteric language, Moore makes his perspective on the craft of creative nonfiction easy to understand and easily applicable in the classroom. The writing exercises he provides at the end of each chapter are also highly credible and I even use them to assist my writing. I simply can't say enough good things about this book.

It is screwed into our wooden vanity that is made from tongue and groove pine. One of the reasons I bought this holder was because it appeared you could install it with the screw holes pointing up or down. I needed to have them point up to cover the holes made in our vanity by the previous holder which are located in a groove. For our application, this worked out well. We had a bit of a problem getting black screws that would work with our installation and because the screws are located in a groove, the holder shifts a bit. What would improve this product? I would make it a bit smaller lengthwise so the toilet paper roll doesn't slide all over the place.

Except for the non-retractable cord, the unit seemed to have all the features I wanted and more. However there seems to be a basic design flaw when using this vacuum with low-pile but denser carpent, the brushes generate so much resitance against the carpet, the belt will burn up in minutes due to slippage. So far I've replaced 4 belts on this unit after only a few months of use (maybe 2-3 hours total use). I can't recommend this unit and am in the process of trying to get a refund for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what we had hoped for","review":"With various Panasonic and Amazon rebates, we were able to get this vacuum for a great price.It seemed to work well at first, picking up a lot of dirt and hair (the dog & cat shed like crazy) from the carpets. The first issue we noted was that it was difficult to empty the canister, as the dirt & hair would wedge itself between the filter & the cansiter. It was a pain to get out, dust would get everywhere.Then the vacuum started throwing the belt, eventually it would come off every couple minutes. We had purchased a couple replacement belts, but they did the same thing as well.So, we made the decision to return it. Kudos to Amazon for making the return experience a pleasant one. Ended up buying a cheap Eureka 5550A model, which has worked much better for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"This vacuum was a real disappointment. I expected a much better product from Panasonic.The plastic elements break easily and the 'bagless' dirt container is a REAL bad idea.

The Hoover is worth the few dollars more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt will break resulting in costly repairs","review":"I purchased this vacuum about 6 months ago and used it about 10 times and 2 belts broke on me. One of the belts is easy to replace (part costs $2.50 at a repair shop) but the second belt I couldn't fix and the repair cost e $39.00. The cost was mostly labor because the 2nd belt was so difficult to replace.This vacuum works well but I don't think it's built to last. Power is good.Talking with the repair man, he advised against purchasing this model because if the rollers break on this model, the part alone would cost around $60.00. The rollers in the front is not built very strong and it does look like it will break in the year(s) ahead. If it breaks again on me, I'll replace it with a better model.Well, I learned my lesson.

It's hard for me to even believe that Sony would put a product this bad on the market. And I'm not even looking for something with super high quality - I'm only using them in the gym anyway.

They are comfortable and secure, totally unlike the crappy Koss Spark Plugs I also own (see my review for those). The flexible ear plugs are so comfortable to wear even for extended periods of time. They also do a very good job of reducing ambient noise which is why I bought them. The over-ear hooks make them secure enough for jogging. The wires feel well made - not flimsy at all. The sound is clear without any muddiness; and, with a neutral bias (not too bassy or tinny).

The sound quality is good, but the claim of comfort is a sham. They must have been designed for people with monstrous ears because the ear \\"loops\\" are suspended in mid air when I wear these, which defeats the purpose. I'd be better off with just the ear buds. Additionally, managing these things once you take them out sucks. They very easily get tangled. Its a headache.

Goes to show that the more expensive headphones aren't necessarily the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Box","review":"The box says \\"Ultra Secure Fit\\" which couldn't be further from the truth. The bendable, rubbery ear \\"clip\\" barely touches the top or your ear (not where your ear meets your head, but the top of the entire ear) and often causes the buds to work themselves out of your ear. Running with these is a joke. They're worse than just-the-bud style of earphones because the clip prohibits the bud from going too deep in your ear and they often fall out and just hang there. Also, maybe my hearing is going bad, but the drivers sound worse than previous models of the in-ear fontopias. Not enough bass, weak sound and generally quieter than before. The real burn is that they're $10 more than the ear bud style. Avoid these earphones unless you have gigantic ears (it's nearly 1.75\\" from the middle of the earbud to the top of the rubber clip)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bass is not good","review":"I was very excited to buy this product at the price of $32.

They fit weird, and stick out and up. My ears aren't strange either, these things just dont fit. I have no idea what these people are talking about in other reviews about how great the fit is or how they stay hooked around your ears.

The Sony MDR-EX81LP's are the best bang for your buck for something small and portable. They are great for the gym or the outdoors and are perfect for short travel. I think the bad reviewers have not figured out that these are \\"In the ear headphones\\" and have to sit inside your ear canal to work properly. If you wear these headphones loosely over your ear (like the headphones that come with iPod) they will not reproduce the bass correctly. As long as you wear them properly (inside your ear with the right size adapter) the frequency response is very satisfying. Good bass and good treble. Typically in the ear type headphone are not made for hours of listening. For long listening sessions I like to wear over the ear headphones with velour ear pads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound.

Another thing that bothered me was the annoying wiring around the headphones. Why didn't they just make the lengths even, like regular headphones? And finally, the headphones have low durability. They broke where the ear buds meet the metallic part. Very flimsy.On the plus side, the several size options for the rubber ear buds is good. The small size ear buds fit perfectly in my ears.

The result is they may move around enough on your ears to actually fall off during vigorous exercise, as is the case with me.

Recommend looking elsewhere.","review":"I mainly purchased these earphones because I love the sound and bass you get from earphones while also being close-constructed means hearing less noise around you. But when I saw that Sony had developed earbuds that would stay behind your ear to prevent them from falling I out, I thought that would be a great idea. However, the product is very flawed. The plastic that is supposed to stay behind your ears is way too oversized, and there is no way to adjust it. Now, instead of keeping the buds in securely, the added weight of the the plastic tends to pull the buds out when exercising or even moving about. The sound is okay, but I would actually recommend the other Sony earphones, (the link to the right) as the sound is just as good, they are much more affordable and they feel a lot more secure.Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia Headphones"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL headphones","review":"These have to be the worst headphones I've ever used.

You'd have to slam these headphones into your ear cannal if you want to hear anything. And it's not just the ear-buds, the entire set-up feels cheap and flimsy. No joke, but the free headphones I got from an airline put out sound that's twice as good as these. I bought these headphones because I thought any Sony product would be a quality purchase.

They eventually replaced with an on-the-ear model.I have no problems with other Sony headphones or earphones, I think the speaker membrane was positioned too close to my eardrums.

They actually didn't fit me at all. The big loop that goes above my ear, would just hang there without even touching my ear. I was hoping that I could go running with them, and they would be much better than the regular earphones, since these supposedly would stay on my ears without falling out and release the pressure off of my ear canal by hanging over my ears, but that wasn't the case.

These would have been disappointing for $10, but at $32.54 the quality is a joke. It takes ten minutes to try to loop them over the ear and fit the bud into the ear canal, and the earpiece just will not fit properly. And then, however you can fit them, you can't get decent sound out of them. I've tried different position and different sized ear-hole plugs, and the sound is embarrassingly bad. No bass at all.I will never again buy Sony earbuds, and I'm going back to my cheap generic headset for the gym. I got burned, but you've been forewarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound great, then fall apart","review":"UPDATE: Six months after my last review, and after Sony sent me a replacement for the last earbuds whose wires became exposed, the right ear on my new earphones died. Because my two previous Sony earphones were fragile, I only wore this pair at work and never put them in my pocket or looked at them with malice. They sounded great for a while, but then gradually got quieter and, now, monural. If two to six months is a good life span for earphones, these are for you.As noted in other reviews, these earphones sound really good, but the cord starts to disintegrate after a month. My first pair were white, and when they fell apart, I returned them to Target. I hoped that the problem effected only the white earphones, so I bought a black set in Nov. 2005. By the end of Jan. 2006, the wires became exposed as the rubber-ish coating fell apart. I'm sending them back to Sony for replacements, but I would rather have bought a set of earphones that would last longer than eight weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best buy in a long time.","review":"I was looking for a Earphone like these, but wanted something cheap.

Not worth the price if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"real nice for $30","review":"i thought these earbuds were pretty darn good. much better fit than the ipod buds, which constantly popped out of my ears (i have small ear openings) and i like that these hook over the top and they fit in and stay in. you DO have to make sure they are pushed in with a snug fit in order to pick up the bass, but i found them to be very clear, good bass (not boomy or tinney) and all around i was very impressed for $30. i've only had them 1 month, so i'll have to see about wear and tear and break downs....tho i'm not hard on my electronics and music equipment.... i take very good care of my 'stuff'."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cord problem is real.","review":"The sound quality of these earphones is really good. I was very pleased with my purchase until about 4 months (1 month past warranty) into them, when I noticed bare wire on the cord in two places.

In fact, they DID NOT fit my ear (they fall off, because the metal shaft is too long), and when I inquired about returning them, Amaz*n tells me I am only eligible for a 50% refund because I opened them.The sound is pretty good (which is why they got a couple stars, even though they're useless to me), but they simply won't stay in, and I'll probably have to put them on *bay or something.Incidentally, I wear those \\"crappy Koss spark plugs\\" someone else referred to at the gym...the sound isn't the ultimate, and maybe the other guy didn't like them, but they stay in my ears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like in-ear headphones, these are a deal.","review":"It took me a bit to to adjust and calibrate the in-ear headphones, but they now work great.

Audophiles may want to lean toward upscale Shure in-ear headphones (these Sonys, while nice, don't compare to the sound quality of my primary headphones--Grado SR60's), but the MDR-EX81LP's are a good buy for the price point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty poor all around","review":"The only good thing about these earphones are the actual buds that go into your ear. They are comfortable. On the other hand, I don't see how the wraps fit anyone's ears. I have pretty big ears and they are still quite loose on me. The sound is very poor.

Don't waste your money if you plan to use these for working out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality and Bud-style isn't exactly fitting.","review":"The sound is WAY too soft. I understand that it might be Sony's intention since it does drown out the ambient noise and there is no need for turning it too loud to listen to the music, but I wish it had a bit more power in the lower frequency and a bit LOUDER.Despite it being the ear-bud style earphones, the wrap-around-your-ear loop isn't a customizeable fit. Unless you have huge ears they tend to slip off around your ear. It would have been better if the loop was adjustable. The earpiece turns at maybe 2-degrees for fit into your ears a bit better, but I'm not sure if the product was made that way intentionally or if I just have strong grip of things. It's okay for the price on Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad fitting earbuds","review":"The earbuds sound pretty good but they do not fit snugly over the top of the ear, unless I guess, you have really large ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not adjustable.

These are neither more comfortable nor better sounding. In fact, to get any bass or richness of sound, I have to shove them so far into my ear canal that they are soon less comfortable than the ipod buds. I'm going to buy some over-the ear phones instead of trying again with shure or some very expensive in-ear model."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!","review":"I bought these from this site about six months ago. There were mixed reviews but I felt pretty confident about them. I don't know what the people who posted positive reviews were thinking! Since I have rather large ears I was sure they would not be too large-not the case. These things are HUGE. They fall off all the time. The sound is ok, I have to give them that. But the guy that complained that one cord was longer than the other was on point. When you have one bud that has a six inch chord and one bud that has a twelve inch chord they pull out easily and often.

What a deal!Do yourself a favor before buying: consider my experience with SONY repair. I mailed in my bum buds - the second pair that failed - but I objected to SONY's pricing. Surely they have a better deal to offer? Nope. SONY shipped back my buds complete with torn packaging and internal routing crap.

I switched to the Sony MDR-EX81LP Bud-Style (hangs over the ear) Stereo Earphones to try and eliminate this problem.Now the earphone shocks my ear while running. I am worried that it will damage my hearing.I have slowly eliminated all the user-related variable to failure and determined that Sony produces cheap headphones that are UNSAFE and will fall apart.

The design is faulty, the ear hangers are fixed and should have been made adjustable. When the earbuds are in the ear canal the ear hangers do not rest on the top of the ear and when you position the hangers on your ear the earbuds won't stay in the ear canal. Several people tried them with the same result, in one case, with the earbud inserted in the ear canal, the ear hanger was almost one inch from the top of the ear.Earbuds (I've tried half a dozen different ones) seem to never stay snug and fall out with almost any activity. The sports-type ear hangers stay in position but can have low sound even with the ipod volume set to max.Now, I get the fit, volume and sound I wanted using inexpensiveSony MDR-J10 h.ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design (Black)coupled with theUpbeat Audio LLC R234-2 Boostaroo Revolution Amplifier for iPod (Black)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn!","review":"I was so hoping that these little beauties would be the answer to my prayers of a great sounding earbud that wouldn't fall out of my ears on the slightest tug. I have been purchasing this Sony line for 8 years and consistently find the sound quality to be superior to anything in its price range. The only problem was their tendency to become dislodged when very sweaty or if they got slightly entangled with my clothes. I had read that you needed to have the perfectly sized ears for these to be effective, and my wife has always told me mine are very cute, but, alas, it isn't enough. Although they sound great as usual, the configuration seemed too big to secure them around the back of my ear.I returned them for an even earlier model than the 71/81 SL series because I wanted a shorter one piece cord.

I was expecting something similar to Shure e2c which I already own, hoping for some noise blocking ability for lesser price. Unfortunately I did not get what I wanted. Although, these go in your ear similarly to shure ear buds, the rubber material making up the tips is very soft and thin and offers almost no noise blocking. The headset itself feels very fragile and cheap. I wish I just spent another 30 bucks and bought another pair of Shure e2c's, which are very well made and are great for the loud environments. One positive thing I can say about them is that the sound quality is OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed!","review":"Ok first with the good: they fit nicely, for 3 different ear sizes. That's 'bout it...The volume is very limited, in fact max volume is so low that I can still hear outside noise despite the noise cancelling feature of these earphones.The worst is the bass, which is simply non-existent with these earphones. If you like music with absolutely no bass, those are for you.I only listen to jazz and Classical music, so I'm not a fan of loud music with tons of bass, but I'm not a fan of the opposite either.

Bass is ok, it's there, you can hear it but it's not as full toned as you might like.The big problem with these was the fact that they were incredibly uncomfortable. I tried out all of the accompanying sized ear inserts and they all irritated my ears. I couldn't keep any of them in for more than 10 min without having to take them out and give my ears a rest. I really did try to give them a shot, and you could make the argument that I didn't give my ears enough of a chance to adjust but honestly, how much should they have to adjust?

I have compared them to the Sony MDR 7506, AKG K240, Senns and ATH - The most surprising difference was in the high frequency coverage-crisp and cool.

In other words, the only thing that that connects the ear pieces together is a piece of plastic that is about the cross-sectional area of a pencil. Unfortunately, I had these since July and they broke in the beginning of December of the same year.I contacted Sony and because I did not shell out a lot of $$, I was not able to get it repaired unless I paid 60 some dollars...Overall, stay away.

The volume level it is able to reach is worse than some $30 headphones I've had. There is way too much treble in this model but what's annoying is that even with sound adjustments, this problem can't be overcome. Considering how much this headphone cost, I am totally disappointed and will buy the Sony MDR-V700DJ from a trusted vendor.Beware buyers!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad kidnapping flick","review":"Brando is so bad in this he should be arrested for over-emoting. The film moves at a snail's pace, even for 93 minutes, and the big surprise ending is a mere cop-out. This is just one of many losers Brando did in the '60's until Last Tango and Godfather came along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brando, Boone make sordid tale interesting","review":"The Night of the Following Day is the story of four criminals who kidnap a rich girl(Pamela Franklin) upon her return to Paris. They take her to a beach house where she is held for ransom.Her captors include a washed up petty crook(Jess Hahn),his drug addicted sister(Rita Moreno), her boyfriend(Marlon Brando) and a sadist(Richard Boone). The film is very interesting, yet disturbing to watch at times due to the nature of the film. Watching Brando is fun. Its easy to see why he is one of the greatest actors of alltime. Boone is frightening as Leer, a big, unpleasent, wacko who is out for the double cross.I would highly recommend this film, but one should be warned that it is preety rough in spots and unsettling.Brando and Boone dominate the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Underappreciated Gem---Try It!","review":"I saw \\"The Night of the Following Day\\" yesterday. I'd heard, and expected, it to be typical of Marlon Brando's \\"stinky sixties\\" period, when he was just showing up for the check. The hype on this film was totally wrong! It's a period gem!Richard Boone and, especially, Rita Moreno more than hold their own with Brando. It's refreshing to see the Method man taking something of a backseat to Boone, at least until the very end. And what an end it is---genuinely suspenseful and a true twist which I didn't see coming.Brando plays, and plays well a sympathetic character among a cast of three-dimensional portrayals. The film is imaginatively photographed; 1969 Paris serves as an attractive backdrop for a movie that gives better than it got from critics at the box office.At five bucks for the DVD or less than that for the video, give \\"The Night of the Following Day\\" a chance. It's a good late night or rainy afternoon movie. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never recognized, quickly forgotten, terrific film","review":"Masterful performances by Brando and Boone, but, unfortunately, all videos I've seen are censored with the most powerful parts of Boone's performance being censored. This also disrupts the pacing and plotting, and what, on original release, was a great film has been turned into something mildly entertaining with a couple of great performances. I'm not holding out hope that this will ever be remedied. This was the period of Brando's greatest work -- not the beginning with 'Streetcar' and 'Waterfront', not the finale of 'Apocalypse' and 'Godfather'. It was 'Morituri', 'The Chase', 'Nightcomers', 'Mutiny', 'The Appaloosa' 'Night of the Following Day', and, most of all, 'One Eyed Jacks' that were proof that Marlon Brando was the most brilliant actor in film history! As to Richard Boone, a great actor, but with that face of his, no one expected him to skyrocket to fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murry MP 230 30-Amp 2 Pole 240-Volt Circuit Breaker","review":"This product was delivered as advertised and was a perfect match for my 30 year old Murray panel.

True, there are a couple of low quality clips here, but most of the content is pro-shot club footage. This was shot cheaply and suffers some from the light show the band was using.

While Sony took into account ear canal size (by providing different sized buds) they didn't put much thought into the piece that goes AROUND the ear. I'm a 5'10\\" female with, what I consider, normal ears. The loops don't even come close to hooking around my ear. No amount of adjustment will make them work.

I wear them primarily at the gym with my iPod Nano. While the sound quality is very good, unfortunately they do not stay put, and I am constantly having to fiddle with them to stay on. The \\"loop\\" is just too big for my ears, so when I put the ear bud into my ear, the loop part sits way above and outside my ear; not snugly fitting. There is no way to adjust them, unfortunately, and it only gets worse when I sweat during a workout because then they are sliding off!! I also paid full price for them at the time (January '06), and now they are discounted, but even at that price, they are of no use to me. I'm now in the market (again) for a set of earphones with good sound quality that are also a good fit for me. Any suggestions are welcome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you have HUGE ears?","review":"The sound quality (for a person who doesn't care that much) is excellent. Way better than the stock phones that came with my mp3 player. However I chose these phones because of the wrap around. I thought it would be more snug for when I'm traveling or working out at the gym. I was disappointed to find out that they are not adjustable. And they were twice the size of my ears. I'm 5'2\\" and female. I guess I have small ears. But my friend who is 5'10\\" and a guy tried them on and they were still too big. Why would sony think that there is only one size of ear? And why make earphones for ogres? Weird. I sent these back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing all the way around","review":"1) The over-the-ear hooks don't really fit over my ears -- they sort of balance on top of the ear. They are not adjustable. I'm an average-sized male, so it's hard to fathom this design.2) The buds pop out of my ears when they get wet from sweat from exercise. All 3 sizes of plastic earpiece covers do the same thing.3) The sound quality is mediocre; bass response is especially weak.4) After less than one month's use, the volume on the left earpiece dropped to around 1/4 of the volume of the right.All in all, I'm thankful therefore for Amazon.com's return policy; I'll use the money from the refund to buy a different set of earphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent headphones for the price.","review":"I went from Sony MDR-EX71SL's to MDR-V600's and i had those till they were stolen. With these being the replacements. I have to say they are of no match with V600's (rightfully so), these are almost 1/3rd the price and earbuds only. They are still good enough to notice that you need would need to change your bitrate from 128 Kbps to something higher. As the other reviewers have mentioned though, they do sound slightly better and more normalize than the EX71's by reducing the bass a bit. This may or may not be good for you as some of you may like more bass of which then the EX71's would be better.The earclips are of rubberly/plastic material that easily bends and the buds themselves twist making sure that there is a perfect fit. Much better than the other clipon headphones which are of a hard plastic. I like them, but I've also tried eShure e2C's which sound much more like my V600s in sound as costs....."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I've got no complaints with the sound versus the price.

The reviews on the site were great. I am extremely disappointed that I wasted my money on these lousy headphones. The sound quality is actually worse than the headphones that come packaged with the iPod. They are much more likely to become tangled in your bag than the iPod headphones, and the silly carrying case that's supposed to prevent tangling is totally ridiculous to even contemplate using. Not to mention they are very uncomfortable in your ears. If I had wanted to have the feeling like I was wearing earplugs, I would have gotten the noise-cancelling kind. These don't block out any noise at all, yet have the uncomfortable feeling of noise-cancelling headphones.

Not much low end either.It seems there isn't much you can do other than keep buying earphones and trying them. No retailers let you try them on for obvious reasons. I read reviews and they were very positive for this product all around but I'm finding reviews on earphones in general don't seem to be very reliable. This was my 3rd pair of disapointing earphone products.Best fit for clip over the ear types I've found so far are the overpriced B&O; A8s - They're a bit heavy and the earbuds are a bit large for my ear-canals but the hoops are adjustable and have decent base. A lot to pay at $130, but what are you going to do... If I had to do it again I'd just buy the clunky over the head hoop type for my situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value for the money on the market","review":"I've purchased many,many headphones over the years.From Bose to Etymotics,to Shure..I've paid anywhere from $15 To $350 for headphones. As a drummer I've played with these while practicing to music and they do a great job blocking out extraneous noise while delivering good quality bass and sound.I also wear these while riding the train back and forth to work everyday and they are a pleasure to wear..I have not tried to run in them so I dont know how well they are for running. For the money these are the best value for such high quality, out there right now. I have a pair of Shure headphones that I paid $180 for that have better sound but they tend to keep falling out no matter how much I adjust them.I tend to wear the Sony's most of the time because of this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value with caveat","review":"Overall, the MDR-EX81LP is a decent replacement over the Apple supplied earbuds that came with my iPod shuffle, but too much bass for my taste, the midrange is a little weak and vocals suffers. The hangers are a bit large for my ears and as such, don't fit snug around my ears, but they aren't falling off. After useing them for a couple of hours of listening, my ears don't feel fatigued. I would have liked the EX81LP's to be more 'neutral' sounding, but good value for what you pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect with Ipod","review":"These earphones have perfect sound quality and most importantly they stay in your ear while you run!

Then the volume in the right ear all but disappeared- the left ear remained fine for two more weeks. Then it became irratic, sometimes ok but most of the time soft enough that I had to sit still to hear it. Since I use it when I exercise this was useless. Now it is over 30 days from purchase date and I no longer have the original packaging so this was a total loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, but a little sweat can clog up the works","review":"I'm on my 2nd pair of the headsets. The sound is far better than the standard-issue iPod headsets and they're priced right. Plus, the earplugs do block out a lot of ambient noise. The problem: I wear them almost daily at the gym. After several months' wear, the volume diminishes. Sweat and whatever else seem to block up a pin-hole in each earplug. That hasn't kept me from buying 2 pairs, obviously. But I wish there were a way to clean them."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-the ear hook is bad","review":"If you're the kind of user who can always carry the (included) carrying case, then my comment will be irrelevant; enjoy the earphones, as they're as good as EX71.However, I usually keep my earphones wrapped around my iPod, and unless you are super careful, the over-the ear hooks make it susceptible to tangles. The same hooks also make it cumbersome to untangle.Also, the hooks make it a bit annoying to use the earphones while I use my sunglasses or my eyeglasses. It's doable, but it tends to push the earphones out of my ears.Finally, the white color goes well with the white iPod models, but after a few months, they tend to show the grime all too well.My advice: I don't think that any (claimed) audio improvement over EX-71 is worth the extra hassle. If your heart is set on this model, get the black one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good for Smaller Ears","review":"I gave mine away. These do not fit smaller ears. (note all the raves are from men). If you can stick the buds into your ear as they are meant to be (like the EX51/71SLs), the wraparounds stick up and look silly suspended over your (my) ears, rendering the ear pieces superfulous. They aren't the easiest things to put on either and you must take care if you wear earrings. I recommend the EX51SL or EX71SLS which you just plug in and be on your way."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you run a lot, not for you","review":"The ear piece is flimsy. Sound quality is good. I do a lot of running and the things kept on popping out of my ears, and if they don't stay in your ears you cannot hear the music, well you can but the quality drops from a 8 to a 1. I gave it to a friend of mine that just sits around and listens to music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Defective Pairs","review":"I've gotten these three times from and within three weeks of gentle use, each ear bud started playing at two differnt levels.

I guess I have smaller ears :) I could use them at the desk, but didn't work for me at the gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear Pieces","review":"The headphones have good sound and the buds themselves fit into the ear well.

I loved the sound I was getting from these headphones (I listen to music daily for hours at a time) and these really were compact, lightweight, comfortable in the ears.

Don't buy these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the other positive reviews...","review":"This is the worst earphone pictures I have made. I usually don't write reviews, but felt the overwhelming need to write this one. After reading so many positive reviews about these earphones, I decided to pull the trigger and buy it.

The sound is clear and it fits great on the ear. It comes with three different ear bud size that allows you to change between them and use whatever is comfortable. However, there's one thing that I do not like about it. I worked in an office where there are carpet floors and since there's metal around the head phone near the ear buds, static electricity transfer up to the metal rods quite often.

Just giving everybody a heads up..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice set of earphones, but ....","review":"I bought these earphones from Amazon, and used them religiously with an ipod shuffle while bicycling for exactly seven months. The sound quality was more than acceptable and the earphones were very comfortable. HOWEVER, they are no longer usable because the white coating on the wires has become sticky and has started to disintegrate, exposing the wires underneath. These earphones come only with a 90 day warranty from Sony. Sony will replace them with a refurbished pair for about the price of a new pair - $29.00. Previous reviewers have noted the same problem and suggested that Sony respond to this. They have. They have discontinued the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit me right","review":"Maybe it's just me, but I was very excited to get these and very disapointed when I had to return them. As far as the headphone piece itself goes, it seemed fine. I tried the different sizes of little nubs and they seemed to be securely in my ears and had good sound.HOWEVER, this unit also comes with the plastic piece that fits over year ear. I got this model because I run, and wanted the extra piece to help keep it secure. Well, maybe it's just me, but when the plastic piece was properly behind my ear, the buds popped out. And when the buds were popped all the way in, the plastic pieces weren't resting behind my ears correctly. Had the same frustration as the other reviewer, as it ruined my run.On the plus side, I was very impressed with Amazon's return process. Click a few pages online, it prints out a pre-paid address label for you, and you just mail it. They deduct the shipping cost from the return. Works for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound great, won't stay on my ears","review":"These fit in my ears and sound great. BUT the loops go completely OVER my ear. When I go running they constantly fall out. I'll post a photo shortly."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality, flexible, fits well","review":"These are very convenient headphones. You can wear them for long durations without discomfort. Some of the headphones that I've owned in the past have been really uncomfortable when used for long durations but not these. The sound quality is good and the range of frequencies it handles is great. I got very natural sounding lows, mids and highs when I tested them with some mp3s that I have. They do eliminate ambient noise quite a bit due to the snug fit soft ear plugs. The loop around the ear stops them from comming off when exercising. I would certainly recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great","review":"The sound quality is excellent, don't get me wrong. These earphones put out clear treble, deep bass (without washing everything else out) and have a well balanced tone that I have not found in most other headphones I have used. The backround sound cancellation from the in-ear style is not perfect, but does a better job than most earphones. My biggest problem: the fit! I opted for the over-the-ear style because I thought it would be better for an active lifestyle, and this would be true if they actually fit me where my ears are. The length of the earpiece is not adjustable so if your ear varies at all from the size they make, they simply don't work. In my case (others may have different a experience) the actual ear piece almost hits my earlobe - almost an inch too far down for these to fit right. Huge mistake not making them adjustable Sony. Bad Bad Bad design. It is a real shame because the sound quality would have made these some of the best headphones I have used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design and fit","review":"Sony is trying to be unique in this design but I have a problem with the fitting and the rubber around the wire started to unravel after couple months of usage. I am disatisfied with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good earbuds considering the price.","review":"Very good earbuds, considering the small price. Sounds excellent in everything except rock; a guitar sounds really loud and scratchy. I consider the case that comes with these to be useless. Overall a very good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great....Until they fall apart...","review":"The headphones have great sound quality, and if your ears are the right size, fit on you perfectly.But if you use them alot, they quickly fall apart and break (and thats from daily use, not from abuse). The cord is made out of some fabric that, as another reviewer said, almost seems to dissolve. It's like a stretchy form of rubber that quickly splits and rips.And where the cord meets the actual rubber that goes behind your ear, the cord rips and breaks off from the earbud, and the only thing keeping it intact is the wire itself.These seem like headphones that were designed for short, short use. I got about 2 months use out of them, and am extremely mad that this has happened so soon. for even 30$, its just not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The sound quality is tinny. The treble range is fine, but the bass response is absurdly bad. To listen with these things is like leaving out entire instruments. So if all you listen to are, I dunno, flutes, go ahead and buy them. But for normal music, they're really not even better than the standard iPod headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO BIG","review":"I played around with these headphones as soon as I received them and soon realized that the aluminum shaft between the ear piece and the speaker was much too long. The bud itself fits into my ear just fine and I can see how they would be useful in the gym, the very reason I picked them up. If I wear them as they were intended, inside the ear canal, then the ear piece sticks out from my ear where it serves no purpose. I played around with them and realized this problem could easily be fixed with a shorter shaft about half the size. If you have large ears these would fit and feel great. I consider my ears average, in no way are they small. The speaker is remotely adjustable swivling a tiny, tiny bit. Bottom line these ear phones would be great if they had about five more ways to adjust them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"First, I bought these because I HATE earbuds inserted into my ear, so I thought the over the ear feature would be great. However, the sound quality from these is very weak. The stock iPod earbuds have a much fuller and richer sound. To get any usable sound, I have to pretend these are ear plugs and shove them as far into my ear canal as possible, which is exactly what I hate. Even then, the sound is hollow and tinny.Second, the over the ear feature doesn't work for snot. I cannot get the freaking loop to fit over my ear and have the earbud in a comfortable position in my ear at the same time. Plus, this is a non-adjustable element. I think my ears are a pretty average size and shape, but I can't use them. I guess it doesn't matter anyhow, since the sound quality is so poor.The carrying case is a nice touch, but about twice as large as it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"good price","review":"I'm going to order this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com.

When I took them out of the box and tried them with my IPOD I could barely hear anything unless I turned the IPOD volume 3/4 up. I have to believe they sent me damaged merchandise because these were the worse sounding earphones of all time. I immediately sent them back and opted to just stay with my basic IPOD phones which seemed 5 star compared to the MDR-EX81LPs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony Quality has gone away","review":"Like the EX71, these earphones from Sony are an embarrassment to the name. Sony used to produce a quality product - not any more. The sound is flat. There is absolutely no bass. I'm also surprised that Amazon, when you return a product, makes you pay for shipping both ways! I don't plan to purchase things I haven't tried anymore from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't stay on/in your ears","review":"I never even got a chance to listen to music through these headphones. I couldn't get them to stay in/on my ears. The loops that go around your ear are huge and just make them more cumbersome. These may fit men with bigger ears better but I wouldn't recommend them for females."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad fit!!","review":"I guess I have small ears. The loop that goes around the ear goes way over my ear. I admit that the earbuds themselves are great, but the loop only works if your earsize is bigger than average. I called Sony and they were no help with the problem so I returned the headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your $$, don't purchase these","review":"I've been purchasing from amazon for years but this is my first review. After reading all of the other reviews on this product I decided they would be the solution for running w/ my iPod as the stock apple earbuds just fall out. Well, these do not adjust in any way so you'd better hope your ears are the same shape and size as they'd designed these for. they're very uncomfortable and keep slipping.. plus the sound SUCKS. Other reviewers said the bass response was great. Bologna. sounds like crap. You have to shove these way way into your ear canal to get the bass but they don't stay put there and again more discomfort. I hate em. waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 pair earphones, defective, customer service poor","review":"Bought 2 pair as iPod gifts based on positive experience with this model. Both quickly turned defective. Imbalance of sound, one side significantly weaker than other. Device is not cause. Amazon replaced 1st pair (slow service) after aggravating phone call to non-U.S. call center. Language skills and phone call noise objectionable. Now waiting several weeks for Amazon to credit $ return on 2nd pair. A shame that quality control has slipped on this item. Used to be good. Note there are \\"refurbs\\" of this product available at clearance spots. Good luck getting a good pair. Bottom line: 2 pair earphones, defective, customer service poor, Amazon and Sony need to do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP CRAP CRAPPITY CRAP CRAP","review":"BEWARE! BEWARE! First off, they sound like craaaaaaap, I have heard better sound comming off finger nails and a chalk board! The orgianl ipod ear buds put these to shame!!! Next the ear hooks cool idea, IF YOUR FREAKING DUMBO!!!! Must be some BIG eared freaks at Sony when they designed these things! No i dont have tiny ears, these are just some BIG DANG HOOKS! Im not the only one who feels this way, keep reading other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"what good it can be if it causes hearing loss?","review":"I loved this headphones. They were the excellent iPod headphones replacements. They have got fabulous reviews. But just do a google search typing ear buds hear. All serious studies done by different universities and doctors are concluding that that due to how close the ear-buds are present to the eardrum, they effectively magnify the sound by between 6 and 9 decibels compared with traditional over-ear headphones. Unlike headphones that go around the ear, these go inside the ear canal and can be louder because you're projecting that sound into a much smaller cavity with the ear speakers closer to your inner ear where we have a delicate system of sensory cells that are responsible for initiating the hearing process. Those cells are very, very sensitive to noise damage. Earbuds allow sounds in the environment to leak in, often causing the user to turn up the volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I bought these earphones for my mp3 player. I just have one question. Where's the bass? The bass is pretty much nonexistent. The crummy earphones that came with my mp3 were a lot better than these. Awesome design but without the sound, it's just an expensive paperweight. Not recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for smaller ears.","review":"After trying these out for 3 weeks, I dislike them.For the gym: They don't sit in your ear very well if you're running, and you need to push them back in when they are getting loose.If you're just sitting around, they are ok, but they still seem to fall out. The flaw in the design is that the piece that goes behind your ear is non-conforming. This means that it retains the shape it had when it came out of the box. When I bought these, I thought the could be bent to stay in a certain shape, but that didn't hold true.I've tried these along with other Sony portable headphones, like the MDR-G73LP - never buying any more Sony's again! They always seems to miss something that makes it annoying. I'll try buying those over-the-ear Koss headphones instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Do not Buy","review":"These earbuds are absolutely terrible. First, the wires constantly tangle. I bought these f-ing things so that I could stay motivated while exercising. But it's a real morale killer to spend about 3 or 4 minutes getting them untangled before ever getting a chance to use them. But this is assuming they are products you WANT to use. In the past I had used these earbuds while lifting weights. Under such circumstances, the experience is awful. Not only do they come out of your ears when you perform any slight movement, but since the wire is meant to hang around your head (and thus, behind your back), good luck trying to lie down or sit back against anything. AWFUL!For the first time tonight, I decided to run with my mp3 player. Every few minutes, I had to fidget with the ear piece so the buds would stay in my ears. No one should have to endure this BS from a product that is meant to enhance their listening experience. Enough is enough. I'm getting new earbuds. DO NOT BUY THESE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible for Running","review":"I've never been more disappointed. I was excited to get these earbuds after I read the other reviews, and the minute I stepped outside and sped up, they flew right out of my ears. After a song and a half I couldn't stand it anymore and had to carry my mp3 player the rest of the way without listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!","review":"These earbuds are very comfortable and have great sound. I love the changeable tips because otherwise they would be to big for my ear canal. The only thing I would maybe change is that the case is a bit bulky but I can live with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Major Flaw","review":"Indeed the sound quality on these is excellent. But I am on my second pair, namely because of the cord attached to the right earphone. After a few months it loosens and inexplicably develops a 'putty' like quality which soon peels away from the inner wire. Sony should have fixed this issue long ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"not meant for small ears","review":"I have very small ears and have a hard time finding headphones that stay in my ears, so I thought with the wrap-around that it would stay in place, but the section that goes from the earbud to the wrap-around is WAY too long and the wrap-around part was sticking way above my ear and instantly fell off. I would not recommend these if you have small ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second pair of MDREX81LP earbuds goes kaput! Thanks, Sony!","review":"There are two good reasons NOT to buy these headphones: 1) they may very well fail without cause, as two pairs I've own have failed; and 2) SONY is so contemptuous of their customers that they offer to replace your defective $30 headphones with a \`reconditioned' pair for $25. What a deal!Do yourself a favor before buying: consider my experience with SONY repair. I mailed in my bum buds - the second pair that failed - but I objected to SONY's pricing. Surely they have a better deal to offer? Nope. SONY shipped back my buds complete with torn packaging and internal routing crap. Oh - and they invited me to get back to them: \\"It would be our pleasure to accept a major credit card.\\"I bet: $25 for used headphones with no cut to the retail middleman. This is SONY standing behind its product. \\"You're on your own, sucker.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"They work fine before they break!!","review":"I've owned two pairs of these earbuds, one in white, one in black. In each pair, the left earbud has stopped working in less than a year (it's closer to nine months). That's almost 80 dollars I've spent on these headphones! The sound quality is acceptable and they stay in your ears nicely when working out, but watch out, they will inevitably break! I can't recommend these headphones unless you're ready to buy a new pair every year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound if they would stay on.","review":"These headphones sound great when they are in your ear, but if you are doing any thing other than sitting perfectly still they just fall out. The only good thing about the hook shape is they don't fall off you head completely. I personally find my self just wasting money on ear bud style headphones just to find they won't stay in my ear. I have about 8 different sets, I think it's time to go old school....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design, good sound!","review":"I like the quality of sound, but the Earphones do not stay in your ears well. For an item designed to stay in your ears, Sony really missed on these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but..","review":"Simply put, these seem like a great set of earphones just like the in ear model 71s but they didnt fit over the top of my ear. My thought was that these would be great for sports so as you ran along they would stay on. The post between the plastic ear band and the earphone is too long. I can only imagine how big ears have to be for these to fit on properly.They are great for sticking in your ear and cutting out backround noise and they sound great, they just dont fit and that is on many people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great for 4 months","review":"Unlike other reviewers, this earphones fit my ears perfectly. I used it for indoor exercising 3 times a week. It sounded great too.Unfortunately, after 4 months, one of the earphone stopped working, and of course it's just out of the warranty time. I didn't expect such a poor quality from Sony. So, I rate it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound, lousy coating","review":"These and all the fontopia line sound great. The big problem is the rubber coating on the wire comes off easily. It feels like bubblegum."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY. The rubber will disintegrate after 3 months","review":"It has been stated over and over again. These headphones are great for the first couple months (this accounts for the great reviews) but the rubber around the wire WILL start to come off right after your 3 month warranty runs out. Its strange but true.Once again, RUBBER DISINTEGRATES AFTER 3 MONTHS.Read the reviews...it happens on both white and black. I have the black. The rubber is broke in 6 different spots and sticky. Unfortunately, Sony is not putting out a \\"support alert\\" on this product because they have not received enough calls on it from owners that have had this fail *within the 3 month warranty period*."},{"rating":"1","title":"The honeymoon is over","review":"Well, I was completely happy with these until the white material that wraps the cables started to dissolve! I don't know if it is because of daily use (I used extensively for commuting purpose every day) or if it is due to super-powerful sweat. Doubt that.Long story short, these worked fine for less than four months, and now with the white cords falling apart, they are completely unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works","review":"It Works!

Bought the Mag Lite holders from Amazon and true to the reviews, they are very fragile and easy to break. Bought the quickfist clamps and they work like a charm. The key is that these are flexible rubber and durable. The mag lite proper holders are a kind of rigid plastic / epoxy snap in holder and the problem is that it is rigid and therefore, snapping in is easy and snapping in half is even easier!If you need a clamp to hold metal to your wall, or to your car, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No question, these are best!","review":"These are unmatched in quality and are all around the best product for holding items that you need quick access to, I have 2 of these holding a shovel to my roof basket, and they have held up to 100mph, drifting through snow drifts, and over 5000 miles on the road, no wear and tear at all. I have used these in down to -6, and they work just as if it was 60 out! I have to say, I was a little skeptical about these at first, but after testing them, I will never buy another product besides QuickFist’s! Also, after getting the larger ones to hold a $150+ item over my car on a 1000 mile road trip, I can’t say enough about these in this review! Try them, you won’t regret it!

These are only rated down as they \\"corrode\\" like rubber over time and do not come with any mounting hardware. Very thick rubber and have some adjustment for different sized objects. Get these in this size for axes, garden implements, gaffers hook on boats, oars, etc. Larger ones work well for fire extinguishers and farmers jacks. These should be sold in a 20 pack or by the dozen. Very nice to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"These quickfist clamps are invaluable. I mounted mine in the bed of my truck and use it to hold a shovel in place (as I go off-roading a lot). I would recommend this product for not only off-roaders, but for construction crews, handy men, etc. Well made solid rubber - very durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Design, But ...","review":"Bought these as a mount for a couple of Maglite flashlights (5-cell & 6-cell D-battery models), since the genuine Maglite mounts are brittle plastic and prone to breaking off. These rubber mounts are functionally perfect, but they really need to be mounted or secured to a rigid wood or metal panel, which in today's automobile trunks is not necessarily an easy thing to do. Ideally, they should be bolted through - with washers on each side - when mounted. Unfortunately, in my case that's just not possible for my application. Save for this, my review would be 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My truth","review":"I don't think I can add very much to what the previous reviewers have written regarding the book. However, contrary to what others have said I disagree that Price being so close to the band and having witnesssed many of the events is a bad thing. Golly that's why it's so great. Price has achieved a level of understanding on the manics through his \\"being there\\" few will ever surpass. He is a true fan. Regarding the reviewers bias charge I find the author not guilty. He lends equal weight to both positive and negative attributes of individual band members. The last thirty pages he rightfully laments the manics easy transformation in to a rather impersonal stadium rock act. Overall a well written and objective account of this once important band's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke immediately","review":"This toy stopped working almost immediately. The locking mechanism is of inferior quality. I bought two and they were opened two times before the combination knob fell completely off one, and would not work on the other. The keys would not open either box after this either. If it were made well, it would be a wonderful toy, but as it is, it only frustrates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"When I received this safe, first I was surprised how small it really was- even though I knew by the description it was going to be small. I opened the box and took out the shiny red steel safe and looked for the key to open it or the 'combination'. The keys were inside the locked safe and there were no written instructions on how to open it or a 'combination' anywhere. Since I was rushed to wrap it, I e-mailed customer service for the company to find out how to open it so that I would know when my son unwrapped this gift. Customer service e-mailed back promptly and told me to set the combination to 20 and turn the key-which was still locked INSIDE the safe. The metal slide knob to open it did not work and so I ended up forcing it open to get the keys out. When I did, it still did not work with the keys, combination or anything other than force. It is cheap and I am probably not going to give it to my son because it is frustrating to try to pry open and not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Locking Cash Box","review":"I have never written a review before, but I wanted to warn people against using this product.

He loves keys and locks so much that we bought him this. The toy is worthless because the key doesn't work. The combination opens on 5 but they don't have a visible number on the lock so you can see the number. So my six year old has a hard time with the tiny hash marks that he has to count. He hasn't played with it, just begged me to fix the key. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Locking box?","review":"Cute, but doesn't stay locked.

The marketing materials suggest the charger works well with AGM batterys, however I don't see that. It would appear the unit is a bit conservative, as it goes in to monitoring mode well before battery is fully charged. An Odyssey battery that has been rested for a while should show 12.8v or higher volts when at room temperature and fully charged. The charger went into monitoring suggesting full charge, so I removed the charger and found only 12.5v. If I had rested the battery, it would have been even lower, so I'm concluding that this charger could be good for only preventing deep discharge, which is not a big worry with AGMs anyway, so for me this charger has very limited value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery Tender Junior Review","review":"Excellent product and does what it is advertised to do. Very simple to hook up with either the supplied aligator clamps or more permanent ring connectors. It does an excellent job maintaining the battery at full charge.

I would highly recommend this battery charger/ maintainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save your battery","review":"Have 3 of these units now for batteries that are not used often and for motorcycle battery setting in off season, the charger and the maintainer, so it will top off a battery then keep it from sufating while sitting.

I used it to charge/tend a 1 yr old 12v battery and it seemed okay: the red light lit up per the instructions, the wall wart adapter became warm, and I could hear the fluid in the battery bubbling (boiling?). The problem is that it never stopped going full bore and never went into trickle charge mode, and the green light never came on.After reading other reviews about the Tender Jr. prematurely cooking batteries I didn't want to take my chances and purchased a competitor's product. It gave me a good laugh though, b/c whomever stuck the \\"Q.C.Pass\\" sticker on the unit was either incompetent or simply didn't give a rip if it functioned or not. Thus, I can't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant go wrong with these","review":"Bought these for my tractor and motorcycle. Amazon had GREAT pricing and they are well worth it.

I fired up my Triumph Bonneville which came back roaring to life.This is a great product and super simple to use. It comes with a quick disconnect for motorcycles which is really helpful especially when you want to maintain a full battery. Do not buy an extra disconnect.

Before you start taking your bike apart, look around, there may already be a tender connector.The bike had been sitting in an unheated garage in 20*F temps for over a week. The battery was somewhat depleted so the tender started charging and the light was red. After a few hours it flashed green showing 80% charged. Then it went solid green showing a fully charged and monitored state. The tender has a long cord so there is no need to use an extension cord.A few days later it warmed up a bit (thank God for global warming) so I took the bike for a 20-mile ride. It took 5-seconds to disconnect the tender and the bike fired right up with a fully charged battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as advertised","review":"This is the third Battery Tender I've purchased.

As long as it works, and while it does get unusually hot even when it is not charging, you might be okay with the Battery Tender. Just keep it away from anything flamable.Batteries are far more complicated than most people give them credit for. You can buy a new battery and have immediate problems with it. A battery may last for many, many years or may fail within a short period of time.Often, it is difficult to trace an electrical problem back to a bad battery.

This is a miniscule 0.75AMP compared to 3.0AMP for the SC-300A. Both come with the same 3 connectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Bought this charger to charge a security system 12 volt rechargeable battery.

The batter tender clips corroded through, and the battery was ruined due to being over-charged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery Tender","review":"Great product, it arrived on time and does the job as promised. Easy to understand directions and easy to use. You can leave the harness attached to the motorcycle for easy plug-in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery Tenders make life a lot easier","review":"As a devoted GearHead, I have long suffered the angst of dead batteries on motorcycles, lawnmowers, etc., that sometimes go unused for weeks or months at a time. Battery Tender has sollved this issue. I have two - and they are among the best purchases that I have ever made. Qualtiy and easy to use. Life is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery Tender","review":"I have used it for a month and it works just as I hoped it would. It keeps my battery charged and the status lights let me know if it is charging or in standby. I love it. I notice a big difference when I start my car after several days of not using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery Tender Junior 12V","review":"Easy to use, instructions are clear. Has a very long cord, which is helpful in the garage when connecting the cord from the wall to my motorcycle battery. Indicator light tells you whether it is charging (red) or fully charged (green). This battery tender is automatic, meaning that it shuts off when the battery is fully charged and this helps protect the battery. When the battery charge falls below a certain level, the tender starts up again charging the battery to full capacity. Because the battery tender connectors can be disconnected from the charger unit, I leave them connected to my motorcycle battery at all times. When I put my motorcycle in the garage, I hook up the connectors to the tender and it's ready to start charging. I strongly recommend this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Moto battery Charger","review":"Great price, short delivery time, looks good made product, I'm happy with it even I did not test on my bike yet, my bike is new!! but I have it for back up or the winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"I thought my 1 year old battery in my 2002 ML500 was about to be used as a door stopper. Long story short, I was left stranded after work twice, but lucky enough to get a jump start. This happened twice before I started using the battery tender junior to see if the battery would fully charge and hold it. I found out that I wasn't using the car enough or driving far enough to get a good re-charge. Now I leave the clips attached to the terminals when not in use and i never have to worry about carrying around jumper cables. I installed the quick attach cable to another vehicle that I rarely use so I can switch between the two cars. I like that the cord is long enough and not chunky either so I can close the hood of my vehicles while its charging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product and great price","review":"These chargers work extremely well, and for the price, you can't afford not to have a couple of them. There are already some excellent reviews on here, won't explain everything again. But I use these to keep all of my cars that are in heated shortage charged and use the 2 port ones (with temperature compensation) for the unheated portion. These are so much less expensive, I might use these on some less expensive batteries that will spend the winter in the cold. They also work well to charge batteries if you aren't in a hurry, and I tend to trust them more than my normal battery charger for that duty as well. I wrecked several batteries last winter with cheap trickle chargers, and now I'm sold on Battery Tenders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery Tender Jr.","review":"Great product, very convenient quick connect pigtail that stays attached to the battery. My battery was completely drained and the battery tender brought it up to full overnight. I have not had any issues since. I love the way the unit has an automatic shutoff and if the battery starts to show low levels again the tender will turn back on. It's a no maintenance tool that you can keep on all winter. I'm happy that my friends at [...] turned me onto this product, it certainly has saved me a lot of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love how small it is","review":"I love how small it is. It would be nice to know what percentage the battery's charge is at but there is a light that tells you when it's done. The bigger more expensive one probably gives you more detail. I guess I'd rather have small and affordable than bigger and more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"Other than the slow shipping by Amazon, everything is good with the charger. The automatic shut off is a great feature in a small charger. You can leave this charger plugged in and it will keep the battery at maximum charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for motorcycles","review":"I have had one of these for 10+ years, and purchased another for a new motorcycle. They just work - plain and simple. Plug it in and the bikes are always ready to start. They keep the batteries conditioned which extend the life of your battery - this alone saves you more than the price of the charger. The included terminal adapter is great to permanently attach the terminal leads to the battery, leaving just the quick connect wire hidden on the bike. Alternatively, you can use the clips assuming you have easy access to the battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works wonders!!!","review":"Love this little charger and the price that they offer it. This is the only safe way to charge small motorcycle, scooter and PWC batteries. The normal chargers will ruin them over time. This has a slow enough charge to not damage them. Also works well on large batteries to maintain them in storage over the winter. I bought 3 of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"Works as advertised.

I needed another way to keep the battery charged instead of the \\"start it up now and then method\\". After a quick look to see if the green light is on, I know that the battery is charged. The relative small size of the Junior was another reason for my purchase. It will be easy to pack up and store once the cold Minnesota winter is done. Cost was another factor it seemed like a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Motorcycle Battery Charger!","review":"I bought this battery charger for use on my 2002 Road King. It has worked perfectly. The lighting on the unit clearly shows the state of charge. Even though this is meant to be used on a motorcycle battery, I have used it on an automotive battery and it has kept that charged as well. I only use it once a week for most of a day to keep my battery charged, though one can leave it continuously connected as well.

I highly recommend this device as small batteries do go dead in a very short time unless they are kept charged up.

That's a good thing considering a motorcycle battery can run between $85-$110........"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Promised","review":"I did hook this up to my Jetski to charge the battery during winter times and the product perform as stated.

I have only had it a short while so can't attest to longevity."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Battery tender is boss.","review":"So I had one of these, and to make a long story short, I left it plugged in and backed my car out and ran it over. I got it good, pushed the two 'prongs' into the body. After disassembling it, everything looked ok, I pulled the prongs back out into position and plugged it in, and it STILL WORKED.However, I am paranoid and don't trust something electrical that is going to be plugged in when I am not around (shorts and stuff) so I replaced it with a brand new one. These are the tenders you want if you have an AGM / Sealed battery. Been using it on 2 of my batteries and it works great. I had a 'regular' trickle charger and I toasted a battery.Don't skimp on your battery tender, get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Item","review":"Great item, that works consistently, keeping my gel cell battery charged and ready for back-up service for my HAM radio equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for all of your toys","review":"I use this all the time for motorcycles, jet skis and boats.

The other models, the transformer is a few feet from the plug. This is a minor inconvenience given the price. Works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars. Great unit at a reasonable price","review":"Works as advertised. Only problem I have had is that sometimes it never goes out of solid red after connecting to the motorcycle, and if I unplug it for a few hours, and then plug it back in, it seems to then go through the correct cycle, ending in green. This could be the fault of the battery, but I can't know, so I am giving it a 4.5 stars (rounded down from 5 to 4 in this case). I also wish the cord were a few feet longer and they used multiple LED's to show status."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for motorcycles","review":"Item was received 2 days after it was ordered.

Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Battery Tender","review":"I bought this for my motorcycle to use during the winter season when I don't ride that much. I bought it based on popularity and many local autoparts stores carry them. They work great to keep the small battery fully charged at all time and ready to go. This is much cheaper than keep replacing the battery which cost 2-3 times more. I don't not believe they are designed for automobile battery, so you will be disappointed if you're going to use on the car. I would highly recommended this product for motorcycles, quads, mopeds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last more than 1.5 years!","review":"Bought this item back in 2010 and it worked fine until a couple of week ago.

The lengthy title whet my appetite and I took it home. Not only did I glean a quote and ace the paper; the contents became my life trumpet as I sought to headstand my way through our upside down culture. One of the most poignant aspects of the experience was on the book's dust cover where the due date was stamped. It revealed that the book had not been checked out for over seven years.

The covers of \\"A Thousand Miles Away\\" and \\"Sincerely\\" will certainly not make anyone forget about the Heartbeats and Moonglows but they are decent offerings.

Firstly, there are a lot of songs on it which are not sung by Noel Coward himself but by various of his female musical associates. The quality of these tracks is rather patchy and the words, so vital to an appreciation of Coward's talent, are frequently inaudible, in particular in the wonderful song, 'I Went to a Marvellous Party'. Secondly, 'Mad Dogs and Englishmen', undoubtedly the most famous of Coward's songs, has been edited in order to make it more politically correct by omitting the 'wogga wogga' sounds that natives in Africa are said by Coward to make. Coward belongs to a period of jingoistic colonialism and imperialism; attempting to dilute that by editorial intervention is unwarranted revisionism.Apart from these two criticisms, the CD offers a good sample of Coward's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, full-featured, excellent tone, great price","review":"There's a lot to like about this mixer. The case is all-metal, unlike some others in this price range; the pre-amps are excellent and quiet; there are insert points, XLR outputs (on top, which I prefer) and a contour control that really works; it's reasonably easy to use and is small for an amp that has six XLR inputs and fader controls across the board. Also, the power supply is internal, so there's no \\"wall wart,\\" unlike some competitors. Digital FX work fine for vocals but I could see how they could be a bit cheesy with some instruments. I put this together with a pair of Mackie TH-12 powered speakers for a PA that cost about $700 and will fill small- and medium-size bars easily.

I saw this book and after flipping through it decided I needed to have it.Lauren Chattman includes recipes for classics such as chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal cookies, and slice-and-bake sugar cookies. Also included are some more interesting ideas, such as black forest chocolate chip cookies, cornmeal cranberry squares, after-dinner microwave brownies, and m&m; biscotti.The black & white cookies were a big hit with my friends, and they were surprisingly easy to make. Tonight I'm making sour cream chocolate chip cookies, and I am so excited to taste them!I really recommend this book to anyone who has any interest in baking--no skill-level necessary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"At last, Dragon's Lair can be played as it always should have been - in real-time 3D! I am glad to see this ground-breaking classic back and in good form. The look of the game is nearly the same as the original, but now you have complete control of your character. The developers have added some additional villainous creatures, but you still have the time-honored foes (Fire Drakes, Giddy Goons, Singe the Dragon). The game in its present state has 15 levels and over 250 \\"chambers\\" loaded with traps, puzzles, and secrets.The cel-shaded animation is smooth and looks simply awesome. The music and sound is great, and you can expect hours of gameplay. The only downside of this new Dragon's Lair is exactly that of the original - limited replay value. But it provides a wonderful bit of nostalgia for us older folks, and the younger kids should get plenty of play out of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous S+H Fees","review":"I like the way this product looks on the Amazon page.

However, any younger person (< 30) should not buy this book. It is not an easy read.

Also, anyone who's code base is C/C++ will find it hard and annoying to read the books ancient language. I found myself reading each sentense 2 or 3 times just to understand the point.

I liked about 3/4 of it and will listen to again, just incase I was in a funky mood. Several times though if I had been drinking milk and listening to it, I think it would have shot it out my nose. Some parts are just that funny. This is not for children to listen to though. My son asked if he could listen to it and I said let me listen first and after that I said no way.

He wasn't funny then, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and embarassing","review":"Well I am a bit jaded because I live in a city where everybody talks and looks like Larry The Cable guy. If the people here don't resemble him then they resemble Ned Flanders from The Simpsons. So I get to put up with both extremes in real life. Why would anybody want to pay for this load of nonsense unless you are from a real sophisticated state or city and this to you is hilarious because you are laughing at how lame this obese comedian is. The blue collar TV show was mildly funny. This CD on the other hand is not funny. It isn't even crude or offensive. This humor is childish and bad and possibly young kids would think it was funny for a week but most adults wouldn't buy into this stuff for a minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite what it seems...","review":"It's been a long time since I've seen the Ugly American. I would have watched it more, it's just that it's so difficult to find... anywhere. Many people consider it a political drama. I would have to disagree. To me, it's more of a social commentary, not only on the entire situation in Vietnam, but also as relates to US foreign policy in general.It never pretends to have any of the intricacy of \\"The Insider,\\" or the insight of \\"JFK.\\" It is, none the less, one of the better fils I have seen to date. Marlon Brando's performance is admirable, and the mood almost reminds me of an Akira Kurosawa movie.In my opinion, this movie has been overshadowed because people did not like the message it sent, nor did they like the often thinly veiled criticism of US foreign policy during the 60's.Overall, I would say it was an excellent movie, turning me from an apathetic movie watcher to a marlon brando fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Prophetic","review":"Delivers an amazingly balanced perspective on Southeast Asian politics as it pertains to Communist/American involvement of that era. I was really surprised, it's so balanced and insightful that virtually anyone with firm political views and positionalities will be annoyed at times watching this film. The way it captures the danger of ego combined with a limited understanding is impressively displayed for us. Oh, and by the way, this is an unusual role for Brando and he's terrific. A sensitive and intelligent film way ahead of it's time, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brando Spinning in a Void","review":"The first film in Marlon Brando's five-picture deal with Universal, \\"The Ugly American\\" (1963) is a dreary political drama that the actor cannot bring to life. Flat direction by George Englund - further hindered by the obvious backlots substituting for Thailand. Brando tries, but has nothing to work with here."},{"rating":"1","title":"stilted studio melodrama","review":"A universal studios picture, complete with an actor from universal's THE GHOST AND MR CHICKEN. It also doesn't help that the music for this asian-set movie sounds so whitebread. And then there's all the phoney sets; most of this movie made on universal backlots, with a few minutes of actual scenes in thailand.the early 60s is too late for such a banal looking movie; the brando movie BURN, though set in the 1800s, is a better movie about whites in the 3rd world.brando doesn't do much, except maybe over-act; some yelling at whites, some smiling at asians; a more low key approach would have been better, especially when somebody like PSYCHO actor john gavin, and shirley temple became ambassadors. Brando, in a mustache, seems to be doing a clark gable imitation.this movie was directed by brando's friend, just like the flop brando movie CANDY was directed by another one of his friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Different","review":"This British version is totally different and not for everybody. No musical score - all drama. It's an extremely well-acted depiction of a descent into madness.

I bought it because I wanted to see it, and I couldn't find it anywhere to just watch it. However, I only watched it once without any intention to ever watch it again. So, if you do really want to see, I hope you can rent it somewhere. At the time I bought it, I don't think it was available on Amazon Instant Video to just rent. Maybe, that will change some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unredemptive message, but some honest material on childhood trauma","review":"I watched this movie on a recommendation, and was disappointed. Found it mostly sickening and over-the-top, which, I suppose, is what the directors hoped for. Of course, the movie was shot well, the acting was superb (the guy who played Sweeney was brilliant), the tension excellent...but still.Largely an awful message: a traumatized, unfairly imprisoned guy takes out his anger and revenge on strangers who never did him any harm--by murdering them. Yet the basic one who did him the real harm, his father, gets let off the hook easy. Sounds so much like the overall message our whole society promulgates as far as blaming parents: blame anyone else!That said, if Sweeney Todd really wanted to do the world a service he would have figured out how to grieve. But it's a lot easier to be a raging violent child in an adult's body than it is to be a self-reflective, grieving adult.Thus: this movie was a pointless failure.Don't watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"baby shoes","review":"These shoes are for babies.

Some chapters are better than others, but alarmingly the more famous cases shows a real lack of research that even the most elementary of students will recognize to be errors presented as facts.

Surely, I thought, its ambition and chitzpah alone would give it an extra star. How can you go wrong when you re-investigate so many intriguing questions?Well, I don't know how he did it, but Fred Rosen missed the boat here big time. Reading his book is like being stuck in a bar with the world's most boring drunk telling you his opinions on everything.The level of vulgarity and stupidity is total. For example, he asks rhetorically whether or not Lizzie Borden committed the murders in Fall River. His reply: \\"Does a bear s--t in the woods?\\" How classy is that, and for this sort of discourse we paid $14.95 for? What a waste of public space, and what a disservice this book performs all the way around. I had heard that he is a pretty good true crime writer, but if this book is any indication, Rosen's the bottom of the barrel."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this ever get published?","review":"I have not purchased this book. In fact, I haven't even read the entire book. The subject matter sounded fascinating; so I skimmed it on line. I have been studying the Lizzie Borden case extensively so I used that chapter to determine if I would buy the book or not. I will not be buying it. How could this writer not have even the simplest facts correct? He states that Lizzie was the elder daughter. She was the younger, Emma was approximately 10 years older. He states that Emma had her own residence. She was actually visiting friends in another town and lived with Lizzie and Mr. and Mrs. Borden. I stopped reading at this point. You obviously can not trust any of the information presented in this book. I do wonder how this book was published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and edited, plus rife with errors","review":"As noted, this book is filled with numerous typos and flat-out grammar errors (the author might want to review the difference between \\"affect\\" and \\"effect\\").Further, there are a significant number of factual errors in the book. For example, I'm sure Eugene McCarthy would be disappointed to learn that he is described as one of the architects of the 50's Red Scare.Finally, perhaps most seriously, much of the text of at least one chapter is suspiciously similar to a major write-up on a web site (and I confirmed that the author of the web site is not the author of this book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"The major disappointment with this book was the almost total disregard for the facts in nearly every case. Even the most well-known circumstances are ignored or miscommunicated by the author.Another disappointing thing was the horrible spelling and grammatical errors throughout the book, which makes it seem like you're reading a high school book report written by someone who did no research and didn't have spell-check on his computer. I expected a lot more from someone who teaches criminal justice at the college level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get past all the typos","review":"I wish I'd read the reviews before I purchased the book. I cannot get past the typos. Using spell check would have caught many of them. Luckily, I purchased a used book for only $4.98.

Don't waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth a rating of one star","review":"To begin with, a disclaimer. I applaud anyone with the drive to not only write a book but to see it through the publishing process. That being said....what was this guy thinking?!?!? I was absolutely astounded by the amount of factual errors in the book, and even more amazed at the author's temerity in presenting his own theories as proven fact. (Lizzie Borden, molestation victim?) The author continually jumps from a half-assed timeline of events to pronouncing a verdict of guilty/not guilty seemingly out of nowhere and unsupported by any evidence whatsoever. I bought this book to round out my library, but I will gladly give this one away to someone to save them the trouble of buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - Missing half the book","review":"For someone who is continually fascinated by even the most-solved of crimes, I found this book to be a terrible waste of time. Not only was the grammar and spelling completely off, as I read the above reviews, I am reminded again of the not-so-factual facts. There are much, much, MUCH better crime books than this one.On a side note, though this wasn't the author's fault, I was missing half of the book! About page 120, the book suddenly shifted back to page 28 and left out the rest of pages 120 through the end. Sorely disappointed.

Much like QOTSA, Mondo Generator is a healthy and balanced blend of vaious styles of rock, not falling directly under the \\"stoner rock\\" mantra.

Everything from the clan structure, rivalries, English oppression, how to carry a handful of oats dipped in a stream for daily ration; it's all there. Mr. Murray gives us very detailed information on the subtleties of the constantly changing political climate and the MacGregor's sense of injustice.This book is a must-read for anyone with even a passing interest in Scotland, the MacGregor Clan, or Rob Roy himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"1000mAh Eurus Internal Li-Polymer Battery for Palm m500 m505 m515 PD","review":"I aquired an old IBM C500 (identical to the Palm M500. except IBM branded) with a bad battery.

This is a great battery, added lots of capacity and I can use this PDA for weeks on end without a hotsync. It was fairly easy to install, if you are not too squeamish about taking stuff apart.

Muffler looked well made but selling truck it was going on and wanted more OEM. Almost foot shorter than original and I did not want to goof around with making filler pipe then when people looking at truck for purchase that would be the first thing a hear when they try to chew you down.

We had a Harry Potter party for our son's 8th B-day and didn't want to pay $300+ or nearly 3X the cost of these for robes alone. These are light-weight, come w/a hood and sash if you need to re-task it and was reasonable well constructed.

This may sound like some simple-minded devotee but I'm really not. IT surprises me that this is so. I just find in retrospect this guy was one of the seminal meetings of my life, like having a fleeting encounter with einstein or bach or swedenborg or john the baptist. Anything this person wrote should be taken seriously and read in a relaxed but careful, thoughtful way. At least that's my thought about him (he died two or three years ago). People like this are especially important in this age of the insipid. I'm not sure how much of himself could be contained in a book, though. His beingness was the message.

Peter Outerbridge played the most of human characters compared to some of his comtemporaries in the series; always thinking of the victim first. He plays a very gentle soul with many emotions.The reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5 is I was not thrilled with the amount of violence, but from what I have read that is how big cities were in the late 1800's especially violence involving poor and homeless.Other than that I recommend the set completely.I have not seen any of the other Murdoch series, I understand these were the only 3 with these actors - a shame as they really interacted extremely well !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Murdoch Mysteries Movie Collection","review":"I enjoyed \\"The Murdoch Mysteries Movie Collection\\" because it held my interest and it was believable.

Normally I am put off by injection of personal lives of detectives into the shows, but this is an exception, perhaps because it is a period piece (about 1900).Subsequent series is okay, but the second Murdoch series lacks true to life performances, which are required for what is supposed to be a realistic show. Yannick is okay. This show is popular and I've seen six episodes. Better than most t.v. cop serieses, but could be so much better. WRiting is probably the problem-also very low production values--little money for sets and extras. This is usually okay, but in this show, being a period piece, we need better sets etc. Still, if you have Netflix and don't have to buy the dvd's this show is worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Attention Span Theater","review":"I am a fan of the old detective drama: Sherlock, Poirot, Columbo and even the corny Ellery Queen. These more modern productions lack the intelligence, good writing, good acting, and taste of the older series.These seem designed for the modern audience who can't focus for more than 30 seconds and need constant quick changing angles, and lots of graphic nudity and violence to prevent them from tweeting their friends in the middle of the movie.The actor in the movie series is better than the guy who played in the TV series, but still, the casting is so Holywoodish. Where are all the character actors?If you really have nothing to do, these aren't too bad compared to the trash that is on TV today, but don't expect much if your IQ is over 90."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Liked Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes, You Will Like These Movies Also","review":"I had never seen nor heard of the Murdock Mysteries until recently and just reading about it made me do something unusual - I ordered this DVD set with the three movies in it. These films are absolutely fabulous! The details that were taken to make these movies seem to be authentic are incredible. You feel like you are there in the 1890's. The only other series I can even begin to compare them too would be the Sherlock Holmes series that were shown in the late 1980's with the late great Jeremy Brett playing Sherlock Holmes. I cannot begin to praise it enough. The actors, the period it's suppose to be taking place in, the dialog... it is all above and beyond anything you can see today.

I learned lots of stuff I didn't know about all the Latinos (Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cuban Americans, etc.) from this book. A previous reviewer didn't like the book because it concentrates on the U.S and not Latin America, but he misses the point completely. This book is about America and Americans with Latin American roots. It's not about Latin America and Latin Americans. I just want to add that I gave my mom this book to read and she really like it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfair and unbalanced hack at Latino history","review":"I was assigned this book for a graduate course in counselling Latino clients. It's possibly the worst book I've ever come across on the subject. Novas is either remarkably ignorant or cynically pursuing an agenda, I can't guess which. I'm tilting towards the latter, since the most egregious examples of bias come in her chapter on \\"Cuban Americans\\".In her introduction, Novas claims to be \\"taking a poke at a few stereotypes\\" with her book. In reality, though, she isinterested only in replacing one set of stereotypes with another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novas: A Culture Vulture","review":"The book on Latino history is not bad, but it is nothing special. She has simply re-written the work of her researchers. So yes, it's a good primer, but it is rather glib (After all, Novas wrote an article about sightings of Tejano singing star Selena's ghost for The National Enquirer. That doesn't do much to boost her credibility as an historian.) Advice to knowledge seekers: this is educational junkfood. Get a textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book had one too many mistakes. Definitely a thumbs down","review":"At first, I was excited about reading this book. I figured it would be a great way to get a general overview of Latino history. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. While Novas did cover a variety of topics, I found that MANY words throughout the book were not spelled correctly and there were quite a few \\"facts\\" that were just not true. For instance, the music group, Menudo, is NOT Mexican American---they hail from Puerto Rico. I would DEFINITELY not recommend this book to anyone. Latino history deserves more respect and should be presented accurately, especially since many times it is a subject that has virtually been ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somebody Woke Up on the Wrong Side of the Cama!","review":"I can't imagine that the title of Himilce Novas' book, Everything You Need to Know About Latino History is to be taken quite as seriously as some impassioned detractors suggest. Myself, being a Latino culture studies novice, Novas offers exactly what I need to get me started with substance, nuance, humor, passion and debth. She has written an extreemly informative and frankly handy guide, that does not overwhelm but fills the blanks in nicely and makes individual and universal connections which create a very good read. It is safe to say that Latino History concerning \\"all you need to know' must be an infinit research. Novas knows this; her distillation is remarkable, intelligent and clear. For us, the readers, the embrace of the various Latino cultures only begins here. And finally for me, her opinion (being Latino) is a most welcome fleshing out of what could be, authored by another, just a Latino almanac.

However, this is an excellent read and very revealing of the author's journey to her Olympic gold medal and world championship in the days when competitors' mothers still made their skating costumes. The book does give a glimpse into the rivalries and jealousies that admittedly plague this beautiful sport. One very terrifying experience recounted by Miss Hamill was brought to my mind years later when Nancy Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee by associates of rival figure skater Tonya Harding after completing a practice session for the Nationals (resulting in a field day for the media, both tabloid and mainstream), prior to her silver-medal finish in the Olympics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"I have read and re-read and re-read Corbett's stories since I first discovered them as a boy 25 years ago.The writing is clear, elegant and evocative, bringing to life a long-lost world.

Crappy jokes used more than once and facts repeated over and over points to poor editing or a ghost writer working off a limited number of points.The second glaring problem is the main character's back ground. Hawke is in his 30's, yet he already attended Oxford, joined the Royal Navy, passed flight school, flew in combat, joined the SBS, did \\"a tour\\" with them, then had countless other adventures.Despite being a child prodigy and a military superman Hawke then becomes confused with terms like HUMINT and a HAHO parachute jump.The final scene of jets firing heat seeking air-to-air missiles pushed me over the edge, forcing a 1 star review.If you're going to write a militaristic techno thriller at least try to get your facts right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than awful","review":"This book started well and then quickly fell apart. It became another entirely predictable spy-thriller story where the hero gets the girl, gains total revenge on his enemies (only after having a nice dialogue with them so they will remember what they did to him years ago, of course), and then saves the entire world in the nick of time. That's certainly novel, isn't it?This book was so bad that after a while I began to wonder if the author was deliberately attempting a send-up or satire of James Bond type novels. There are numerous plot holes, serious and significant story line problems, too many characters and not nearly enough character development.The only positive I could find is that the fellow reading the audio version did a superb job with it. The fact that he didn't die laughing while reading the stilted dialogue and corny conclusion is an accomplishment in itself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hawke\\"... a real clanger","review":"The book \\"Hawke\\" by Ted Bell is a thrilling adventure novel. Sadly, the story was poorly edited. Research was really lacking in the novel and errors were so blatant that even average people who read thrillers but are not in the military could notice the mistakes. The word 'obviously' was obviously overused.In the end one painfully finishes the novel to see what other thriller cliche the author will use.You find yourself looking for errors because you bought the book,you want to finish it,you know the author must have done this on a dare,so you slog your way to the end.

Others have pointed out the technical errors and the awful dialouge, so I won't go into it here. The subplot involving a hispanic Marine stationed at Gitmo, is the only part of the book that is well written. In fact, the writing is so superior to the rest of the book,it suggests to me that this book was written by committee. I see that Mr. Bell is a big shot ad exec. It must be nice to have friends in high places. I'm sure it helps alot in getting your work published,even if it is sub standard.As far as being hailed as the \\"new Clive Cussler\\", Ted Bell couldn't sharpen CC's pencils."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rip-Roaring Swashbuckler!!","review":"If you think they don't write 'em like they used to write 'em, you've gotta check out HAWKE by Ted Bell!

The characterizations are trite, the main character comically overblown, and the action scenes like something out of the \\"A-Team\\". There's no sophistication, no subtlety, and seemingly little research to support the book. It's OK to read (although it could have used a stronger editor to fix mistakes, clean up style--Mr. Bell obviously likes to use the word 'obviously'--, and reduce its repetitiveness), but it's a long distance below the likes of Clancy or Ludlum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - not worth the time","review":"As a rule I try to finish every book I've started, even the bad ones, if for no other reason to see how it ends. In the case of Ted Bell's Hawke, I had absolutely no misgivings about putting it aside. This is possibly the worst book I've ever read. Nevermind that the plot is completely disjointed, the characters unappealing, the dialogue facile; this story is lame and pathetic.On the upside this book was given to me as a gift, so at least I don't feel the disappointment of wasting money just the time I spent suffering through the first 100 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Cussler","review":"If you like Clive Cussler, you MIGHT be able to stomach this book...otherwise you're in deep trouble. Cussler's 2-D characters, Playmate-looking PhD love-interests , Flawless leads, and implausible plots are all here...but somehow even harder to take. I've actually been able to get through some Cussler books before, but this one was truly painful at times, and FAR behind even a fading Clancy.As other reviewers have mentioned, the glaring lack of basic research, idiotic dialogue, and cartoonish characters are really disappointing for a writer who is being prominently featured in the bookstores, and has some nice print reviews.

He has since grown to adulthood and works for both the CIA and British secret service. He is assigned to look into the disappearance of a Soviet sub that could launch strikes against the US mainland.

Where's my Clancy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Ride","review":"This is a really fun ride!! The story is fast and the characters are faster. It's got it all: drama, action, romance, humour everything a good story requires. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretentious, abominably-written book","review":"This is without a doubt one of the worst novels I have come across in decades. The publisher (Simon and Shuster) must have gone to press based on the, who knows, friendship with the author, since it obviously wasn't reviewed by an editor, much less a proof readerWorthless, even as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Bond I presume ?","review":"What a good read. I have now read all his books but backwards. This was the last for me which was his first. I find it a enjoyable, quick,fascinating read. His closeness to the Bond Books are there but not reflecting them word by word. His group of Merry men and their connections make the story ever more interesting and move it along quickly.I highly recommend this book and stand wating for his \\"Tsar\\" to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"This book is a totally mindless read and some may enjoy it for that. The main character is one of the most silly and irritating characters that I have encountered. I must confess, however, that I couldn't finish the book, so perhaps I am being unfair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously lacking in research and proof reading","review":"Ted Bell's main character, with his 'toys', is an inferior imitation of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt. I appreciate books that include a map of the story area. Unfortunately, Bell ignores the map and local geography. He tells of a boat sailing in the Straits of Florida that is caught in a hurricane. Hurricanes in the Caribbean move northwest, yet this boat is driven about 800 miles to the southeast toward Hispaniola. A plane is described as taking off from Martinique and flying north over Trinidad and Tabago - wrong, Martinigue is several hundred miles north of these islands. The plane then skirts the southern coast of Haiti and turns due north to the southwest coast of Cuba. Wrong again, the southwest coast of Cuba is about 800 miles to the west-northwest.This book is so full of holes it woulld sink if it were a boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawke: A Thriller","review":"For it being Mr. Bell's first novel, I thought he succeeded masterfully. The novel was very well written, ala Clive Cussler...He developed his characters very well, especially Hawkes's cohorts. I especially appreciated the 'flashbacks' of Lord Alexander Hawke when he was a young boy, gradually remembering the incident when his parents were murdered. Excellent continuity. Writes a lot like Cussler and another similar author, Jack DuBrul. I have already purchased the entire series up to this point and will buy and read any of his books that are published in the future. Exciting, entertaining, and an absolutely superb read."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's been compared to Ludlum.....","review":"This author is compared to Robert Ludlum? I can state that he is no Ludlum. The prime character Hawke is unbelievable. His confrontation in a pub while wearing a tux or tails. His special plane designed after a model. The bowsprit on his yacht that extends? The machete fight? Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cussler Wan-a-bee","review":"This novel was bad. I was ready to quit after four chapters. The errors in research scream out like nails on a chalk board. I'm glad I didn't quit reading though, because I would have missed the ground attack with Sidewinder missles and the Wrong Way Corrigan flight plan. All in all not worth the time to read, and you wonder exactly what the famous authors quoted on the jacket read, because it certainly wasn't this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot wait for the sequel!","review":"Clearly this author has a series in mind and, based on the first Alex Hawke adventure (a Cuban coup no less!)I can hardly wait for the next one...this is a terrific new hero with quality writing from page one to the breathtakingly startling finish. Major kudos to the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It !","review":"First off this is mind candy reading. It is a fantasy land read and it is a great one at that. Many of the situations and timelines etc don't really match. I did not find that too distracting. Afterall, the story is about some cocain bandits taking over a country and the little boy who watches them kill his parents grows up to be a secret agent. A little thing like time lines being out of whack does not seem to hard to accept.The writing is fast paced and the illusions are just plain fun. I liked the nautical references as well.Great read for fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody home","review":"I am amazed at the diversity in the reviews. It is as if someone sent him a big box of motorcycle parts -- some Fleming, some Cussler, some Deighton, some Clancy -- but forgot to send the instructions. How someone can make buried treasure, the Caribbean, Fidel Castro, super submarines, pirates and pretty women boring, is beyond me. But Bell manages to pull it off.It's like he jumped into the water before he learned how to swim."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Outstanding!\\"","review":"This is a seriously good adventure thriller. I loved every single minute of it and only wish it had kept on going, I was having so much fun. You gotta hope there's another one in the pipeline and and whole lot more...so cool to have Cuba in a thriller since its so close and so believable...Fidel, read this book and start watching your back, buddy. Wow, some book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"The most disappointing thing about Ted Bell's first novel is how low respected authors like James Patterson and Nelson DeMille would go to hype a book that is so silly it borders on the ridiculous. Mr. Bell apparently decided to create a character who fulfilled all his fantasies and place him in a world so overblown with unreality that the plot collapses under its own weight.Alex Hawke, whose ancestors included a famous pirate, somehow goes from professional soldier to billionaire business tycoon in about a decade. He would have been so much more believable if Mr. Bell hadn't tried to make him be everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bond or Bourne!","review":"This book began with much promise and blurbed comparisons to James Bond and the Clive Cussler novels had me anxious to delve into this swash-buckling adventure.The prolouge, where 7-year old Alex Hawke witnesses the brutal murder of his parents aboard their yacht is gripping and the promise of a revenge saga filled with pirate adventures awaits.Unfortunately, this nearly 600-page novel cannot hold up to the promise of the prolouge as it becomes another sodden espionage tale about a coup d'etat in Cuba that the now adult Alex Hawke is hired to stop. The group behind the coup turn out to be three Cuban brothers - the same trio that killed Hawke's parents many years earlier.There is not one second of swash-buckling or piracy in this tale and the revenge is dealt with so quickly it is as if Ted Bell lost interest and just wanted to finish the book and move on with the Hawke series.I sure hope the rest of the books in the Hawke series are superiour to this poorly constructed mess..."},{"rating":"1","title":"hawke","review":"Ted Bell is trying to imatate Clive Cussler,but does not have his talent. The characters are stereotypes rather than individuals and lack depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very excited about this book when I first read the synopsis - the idea would get 4 stars.The problem with this book is in the execution. Gardner's characterizations just don't ring true, and I found them very distracting. In particular, I had problems with comments about Lorne (that he's a \\"party demon\\" and \\"needs direction\\") Wesley (if this is early season 4, as I expect it is, Wesley's relationships with the Angel Team were still pretty strained) and Connor. (thinking that \\"Angel and his friends have never been anything but nice to me - I just need to find a place where I can think.\\"). Connor's confusion comes across clearly, but his rage does not. I tried to give the book a chance, but I was unimpressed with Gardner's grasp of the characters. I would probably not buy another book by this author, and I would DEFINATELY not buy one of his without reading a little of it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your hard earned cash!","review":"After reading the synopsis for this book I was looking forward to an exciting read. What I got was something a high school student could do better... The characters seemed forced and the villans frankly boring. There were many times I thought 'when is this book going to end'?? I kept reading to find out how the villans were defeated - the answer? - much too easily and without anyone at Angel Investigations even raising a sweat! The much hyped battle between Angel and his double was over in about two paragraphs, and how they knew how to kill their doubles was never explained.I won't waste any more time or money on Angel novels and will enjoy my DVD's instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad it's gone","review":"Bored To Death was one of my favorite series and I'm sad that it is gone after only 3 short seasons on HBO. Schwartzman, Galadianakis and Danson made a hysterical trio. This DVD completes my collection of the entire run of the series - look forward to watching all the episodes all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORED TO DEATH indeed...","review":"Very low level of humour, childish characters, predictable plot. This is by far the worst piece of comedy I have seen in a very long time. If you liked season one and two, don't spoil it with this. I generally like Jason Schwartzman and Ted Danson (Zach Galifianakis not so much) but they do not make up for this dilemma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great glasses, great service","review":"Great glasses, great service - what more can be said? I have another pair with dark lenses that I use for sunglasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious","review":"I've never been the biggest fan of her voice, but some of her songs are catchy and I can't help but like them. I couldn't believe how horrible these versions were though. \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\" is the worst. She sounds like an old broadway singer or something. I also didn't like that a lot of the energy was taken out of the rest of the songs. I wouldn't recommend this album, but you can listen to the samples to form your own opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much cuteness.","review":"This album is just dissapointing. After her last live album, I was expecting more challenging vocal pieces. Everything on this record is recorded as fluffily as possible.Her voice sounds terrible on Money Changes Everything. The slower arrangement on She Bop is inadvertantly funny. The Puffy Ami Yumi appearance is just silly and distracting. Ani DiFranco is buried on Sisters of Avalon. The only highlight for me was the Sarah McLachlan turn on Time After Time.None of these versions transcend the originals. The new songs have some nice singing, but have forgettable melodies. Perhaps I'm taking pop music too seriously, but I thought Cyndi at one time did, also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guitar Tab notation unreadable","review":"Warning: The guitar tab notation is unreadable! While the ink quality was very sharp, the typesetting crams the guitar tab numbers together so they overlap each other wherever multiple strings are struck (chords, etc.). OK for the single note parts, but impractical to read otherwise. I am not even talking about print being too small or blurry...it is actually overlapping so each set of notes must be deciphered or guessed at in some cases!Check out the page preview yourself at the bottom of page 26...it's like that throughout the book.Too bad, because it's a great collection of songs..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Print","review":"My copy's print was so bad, it was not readable in areas. I sent mine back. I can't say anything about the accuracy of the tab."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"The appearance of the ad lead me to believe that this was the music CD set.It was a paperback book. I tried to stop the purchase hours later after theemail confirmation revealed it was a book, but Amazon was no help. I refusedthe delivery, and sent it back to the supplier unopened (at my expense), butwas still refunded only a less than half of the purchase price (\\"re-stocking\\";nonsense).

What a performance! This guy gets better with every CD of his that I purchase! I love the sax, and love Warren on the sax the best! My new word for \\"wonderful\\" IS \\"Warren!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor audio","review":"I was so looking forward to this CD. I had the original album. When it came I found the sound quality was terrible, almost like t was muffled. I actually returned the CD and got another one, thinking it was a fluke. The 2nd one also sounds terrible. i don't know if they need to remaster the disk or what but as is, I would not purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Marriott always smokin","review":"This is a great album, full of raw energy and Steve Marriott's voice is in great form. Don't expect any similarity to small faces, this was Steve doing his own thing, getting back to the basics with blues and rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob from LA is just a lit-tle obsessed...","review":"Otherwise, he would rate this album for its content and not for its format. The 1 he gave it is a sad testament to his discretion...or is that the lack thereof? Unless, that is, he may have a commercial reason for doing this?Steve Marriott. That should say it all. \\"Smokin'\\" is not as visceral as \\"Rockin' The Fillmore\\", but really good nonetheless. They're better live, IMHO, but that doesn't mean they're horrible in the studio. Even in the studio, you can detect the hints of ad-lib and improv which make me love this band. Blues rock is best played with a hint of grit, and the Pie never disappoint. Therefore, I got no problem with giving this a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man Without Qualities Vol 2","review":"A very good novel.

Amazing psychological drama. This movie was is the \\"pre-quel\\" to The Innocents.. It could have been an amazing movie but it was so sloppy and cheaply made and Marlon Brando was walking around in muttering in some kind of an odd ball Irish brogue...just pure awful. Brando at his worst right before the Godfather saved his career and made him a movie god forever more....dont waste your time on this piece of s*** movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather dull and stagy despite the scandalous subject","review":"This has been on my radar for a couple of years. It's largely what I imagined. Michael Winner was always little more than a journeyman director, and the film plays out in a rather stagy and arch way. Brando and Beacham are good, but the children and housekeeper are merely adequate. All in all, it lacks atmosphere and confident pacing and ends up rather dull, despite the scandalous mix of sensuality, brutality, and death. In the hands of a more skilled director, I think the middling script could have supported a cracker, but it sort of reaches for Hitchcock and Zalman King and falls significantly short."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Night Comers","review":"I'm a big fan of Stephanie Beacham so I purchased this video.

Any serious student of history may easily skip this book and you will have missed very little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check out Thomas Sullivan's helpful one-star review","review":"I particularly appreciate Sullivan's review. The reason for getting the book was to learn a lot about the elder Pitt. Unfortunately, I won't learn it here -- because I'm not going to struggle through this unpleasant book. The Preface describes a complex and confusing situation; but McLynn only increases the confusion. Moreover, he is quite free with invective and name-calling, without offering support. He closes his Preface with an irrelevant gratuitous slam of George Washington, an even more irrelevant jab at the poet James Macpherson, and a boquet of blather. He's a bullthrower!Chapter one opens with a page-and-a-half libel against John Wesley -- just gross. So I skipped to page 96 and Pitt. Same old garbage. Consequently I examined Sullivan's review, which both convinced me to drop this garbage, and suggested better sources (It was Parkman who got me interested in Pitt).The one bit of good news for me: It's a library book! no wasted money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"This very detailed history suffers from several omissions:1. While describing complicated military maneuvers, there are no maps to enable the reader to follow what is happening.2. There are no notes to the text despite numerous references to obscure events.3.

More disturbing is how he found 24 people to agree with him. Those ratings must have come from a reluctant class assigned to read this book by some misguided middle school teacher.

Each of the main characters has some serious flaws and that is why you'll love em.

I just finished reading \\"Fly on the Wall\\" and enjoyed it so much, I have recommended it to my friends. Trista captured a mature 18 year old's mind and body and put him on paper with a 32 year old woman and showed how real the love was that they had for each other. You are amazing...This book is red hot!!!! I'm getting ready to start on \\"Chocolate covered forbidden fruit\\" and I know you will not let me down. You have a definite fan for a long time!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Oh, To Be That Fly On The Wall\\"","review":"First let me say, SHAME ON YOU PAIGE!! o.k. I've said it. I really enjoyed this book. The storyline came right out of recent headlines, although had Paige been male and Theo been female, guess where Paige would be. This book was funny, spicy, and because of what happened to Toni and Theo's brother Kevin...tragic. Eva should've been more severe to Paige, after all she(Paige) and Theo were doing the do, come on now! Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. The thing I truly liked about Theo was that he wanted to prove to Paige that he was a man, and that he loved her. At the end of the book he did, but her pregnancy should've happened farther down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go head Trista!","review":"I would like to start off by saying Trista Russell can write her butt off!! I dig her writing style, but I couldn't get into the whole Paige and Theo story as a couple. Because Trista can deliver a story so well I gave her 4 stars but I found myself skipping certain parts especially when it came to the two of them as a couple. I couldn't fathom this eighteen year old superstar basketball player with his whole life ahead of him willing to give it all up for a long term relationship with his teacher, maybe a fling or a one night stand but nothing more. Then the character of Paige was funny but not appealing. She was described as being sexy and beautiful but from reading the story that's not what I picked up. Theo on his own was a much more interesting story to me. But Trista Russell is very talented and I will buy her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me be a fly on the wall","review":"i must say this book was GREAT!!! Trista did it again. It ain't like nothing seen on t.v. or a movie!!

First we meet Paige, a teacher at a high school. Then we meet Theo a basketball player on his schools basketball team. When Theo and Paige first meet they're attracted to each other instantly! Now meet Musca Domestica, she's the fly that will take us on this roller coaster of love and show us how everything went down.If you haven't gotten this book then your the outsider right now!!

Mid-1932 marked a turning point in his career; he signed with Victor, and his recordings took on a more cohesive swinging feel, due not least to the arrangements of Gordon Jenkins. This superb selection of sides from this period mirrors those listed in Rust's Jazz Records and includes five of the six sides recorded in March 1936 under Woody Herman's leadership and issued as by Isham Jones' Juniors. A thorough illustrated liner note and discography completes this excellent reissue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dietl Worships Himself","review":"Dietl probably has a nude portrait of himself smoking a cigar above his fireplace. The man is truly enamored with himself. You might find a few kernals of winsdom entreched deeply within the 200+ pages of steaming poo, yet not enough to justify blowing twenty bucks on it. The constant self promotion and tales of small-man syndrome conquers evil bad-man will wear you down by the time you find the end of the book. Then you can read a special song written by Paul Anka for him, which takes 25 or 30 pages.Maybe he'll sell you his nude portrait so you too can worship him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bo Dietl is a legend in his own mind","review":"Just finished reading Business Lunchatations, by Bo Dietl and his ghost writer.

Way too expensive for a paperback with little applicable information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I bought this for my two month old cockatiel about two weeks ago. And it was good the first few days. He uses it everyday. It's very cheep quality. The ladder spacing is very tight and my bird got stuck in them. My advice, spend the money on a good play stand. Not one that you'll have to re glue a few times like this one. Hope this helped."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"This product was a disappointment right out of the box. The materials are flimsy, the swing and ladder were both out of square, the holes in the main dowel are drilled at an angle so the main support piece leans. The long dowel holding the rope toy doesn't touch the bottom of the playset, seriously undermining its stability. This playset is NOT large enough to comfortably accommodate a cockatiel. My bird, Paloma,can't fit in the swing and the ladder is too small. I strongly dislike the product and regret this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK quality, poor design","review":"I purchased the LARGE activity center, and it is too small for my lovebird! It's listed as \\"for Cockatiels and Medium Birds,\\" but I imagine even a parakeet would feel cramped.The rungs on the ladders are so tiny my lovebird avoids using them completely. The glue helps hold perches in place, but I had to duct tape one of them so the whole set wouldn't collapse. The swing is much too small, and the base needs to be 5\\" wider so the ladders aren't so cramped.I give it two stars because my bird likes the rope, upper two perches, it's a good surface for shredding bird kabobs and paper without much cleanup, and it's relatively cheap compared to other playsets. Having a playset is a must if you have your bird out a lot, but if you can afford it get the extra large or, even better, pick another brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I had a hard time putting the activity center together. The glue provided just would not hold!! I didn't want to use anything that could be harmful to my birds. I have one cockatiel and four parakeets who enjoy new toys. It finally held but not sturdy enough. The worst was when I tried to rinse it off, after being in the bird cage for a couple of weeks, the color on the wood bled all off!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone Can Do It","review":"I had two babies 14 months apart and I can tell you that this book can and will improve the fitness life of even the busiest moms.

The author does give you a program to use but focuses on one body part a month. I don't think any trainer would recommend this. It is not till around month six that they recommend putting them together and work different body parts within the same month. Also, she it seems as though she's having trouble filling the pages of her book. Each chapter begins with a few paragraphs with very obvious helpful \\"tips\\" such as \\"After having a baby, you'll notice you have to carry a lot more things with you!\\" Can't find the tip?

My 3 year old is just starting preschool so our days are very busy. The workout from this book seems cool if you have one small baby but not for someone like me with 2 or more small children. I also thought that it required you to have too many accessories to complete your workout. I believe that our body weight offers a good amount of resistance to begin a program, from there a resistance band or set of weights can do the trick.

Ms. Wegar also demonstrates how proponents and opponents of sealed records use the rhetoric of pathology and therapy to sway public opinion. A fresh perspective, and a recommended read for anyone sincerely interested in ending the failed social experiment of sealed records adoption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reference for Sealed Records History","review":"Dr. Wegar is one of only a handful of scholars to cover the history of sealed records in the United States in research and literature.This book is a great reference and points out how various arguments in the records debate can be stigmatizing to the adopted person. However, I did find the reference to the Adoptee Rights Movement as \\"the search movement\\" as problematic. The reasons individuals would like to see records (the Original Birth Certificate, which is a separate issue than adoption records kept by agencies and courts) are diverse. What unites the movement is the quest to be treated equally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stories excellenty produced, but pricey","review":"These German produced videos are, natürlich, in German, so it is moronic to downgrade them for being in German. The German spoken in these is \\"high\\" German and not the guttural German of Bavaria and the south. The production quality is very high, and the actors are among the best performing in German film and television today. The cinematography is wonderful and shows the very best of Venice without the hordes of tourists in the way. The stories and characters may vary some from the books, but this is almost always the case when literature is converted to film. In the end, what you have here are great stories well produced with the beauty of Venice as the setting. My only complaint is that these DVDs are way overpriced for 3 hours of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"You ARE in Venice with Guido!","review":"If you like the Donna Leon books, you will LOVE seeing them unfold in Venice. The photography is lush, the characters are well portrayed, and the German did not distract. Don't be put off by the subtitles. It is also nice to hear German spoken, not snarled by Nazis as in the movies. Always best to have read books first. Love Guido and his family relationships as much as the mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better in Italian perhaps","review":"The Donna Leon books are my favourites but this dull rendition of them to the screen in German, no less, fails to catch the wonder of the original novels on which the series is based.

This destroyed the essential Italian nature of the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brunetti Mysteries episodes 1&2","review":"No one bothered to mention these episodes were in German or perhaps I missed the fine print. To hear Italians speaking German in Venice is, to say the least,disappointing. The most beautiful language in the world traded for one of the most guttural.Signorina Elettra would not approve. One of the disks was defective and would not play the final ten minutes of the episode. Skip the video and just read the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor postage","review":"Would have liked to enjoy the Brunette mysteries but they were not packaged at all well and were damaged in transit.

Some were of a personal nature concerning Noel's philosophy of life: which was something of being an Ockhamist's and he was also anti-altruistic. He seemed influenced in a proginal sense by Saki; a dialectical sense by Wilde; and an antagonistic sense by Waugh. The stories ranged from being very good (Bon Voyage and What Mad Pursuit) to very bad (Traveler's Joy and Stop Me if You've Heard It). The most personal, concerning the purpose of life, was \\"Nature Study\\" which was enlightening and Noel gave a very simple definition of his philosophy there. The, perhaps, most personal account of his own life was \\"A Richer Dust\\" the meaning of which may only be known by Noel and was not a great story. I give the book as a whole four and a half stars.

The annecdotes by b-movie personalities would have excited me if there were more than 3 or 4 that were known personalities. most were micro-budget filmmakers, that most people have never heard of.

Day of Defeat is a wonderful gaming experience. The levels are well done and promote teamwork. Its a historically accurate, and fun game. However, it is a MOD for half-life. That means, if you own half life, you can download this game FOR FREE. You can buy Half-Life for 20 bucks, and get this game as well. Sure, it's nice to have a printed manual and box, but the retail version of this game is abhorrent. You will get disconnected for no reason, and I found myself unable to play Counter-Strike (another great mod for half life) at all. Terrible!The answer is simple. If you want this game (which I would highly recommend at 5 stars), buy half-life and download it for free. you will also get the awesome half life single player game.and to those who say that the game is dated: yes, it is. however it doesn't look like complete crap, and most computers will be able to run and enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointingly similar to Counter-Strike","review":"This new version of DoD is just like Counter-Strike, except it takes place in WWII europe. It's disgusting how similar it is to Counter-Strike. While some people do enjoy this game over the older version, most CS or DoD fans hate v1.0 because of its very unoriginal nature. As far as upgrades go, this version has added a very childlike interface, a dynamic crosshair that fails to reflect the time period that the game takes place in, and finally some new maps that seem more like CS maps than ever before. Sure, they added a few new textures, but the layout of the maps is still cramped to force the player to use strategies that would be used in the present day world of submachine guns and body armor, not those of old time WWII.If you want a WWII first person shooter, then go for Battlefield: 1942 or Return to Castle Wolfenstein. Don't waste your money on this Counter-Strike copy that uses the same outdated engine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undoubtedly not the best","review":"While I admit the gameplay is fun, it is far from the best.

Unlike Battlefield, all you do is just shoot guns and shoot guns and shoot guns. That's it. There isn't much of tactics other than just get flags. No airplanes, tanks, ships, nothing. In Battlefield, you can ride so many different type of vehicles, anti-aircraft guns, stationally guns, get on different types of airplans, ships.. so much more than just shooting guns. Medal of Honor is similar to this, but again, Medal of Honor is far better. Medal of Honor has missions to complete. All you do on this game is just shoot each other and get flags.....that's it. You can just keep running until you find somebody who does not have name tag showing up as \\"friendly\\".

In a time where brilliant composers are a dying breed (or just plain burning out), Scott's flame still burns with intensity. Where each recording is different than the last (this disc is no exception) Scott's consistent strand from disc to disc is his inate melodic sense and his intelligent and creative lyrical ability. The thinking man's rock musician with a keen spiritual bent. More electric and energetic than his two solid solo efforts. Not a weak cut in the bunch. Put on your dancing shoes, your thinking cap and have a good time. Highly recommended...Simon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This album catches the Waterboys trying to be what they are not (or, at least, have not been until this effort) -- derivative. Though the lyrics are adequate, the songwriting is subpar. This is exacerbated by, as another critic noted, the poor production and \\"special\\" effects. The result is a cluttered mess that isn't worth the struggle of dozens of listenings (at least not yet). This comes from a long time Waterboys and Mike Scott fan, who melted the plastic many years ago on singles like, \\"Church not made with Hands,\\" \\"Spirit,\\" \\"When will we be Married?\\", and \\"Be my Enemy,\\" and, more recent devotion to Scott's solo, Christian-centered, \\"Bring 'em all In.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What a downer","review":"Black, gloomy, bleak, and hardly a melody in sight (or sound).

Graphics are, for the most part, super. Land and seascapes are richly detailed, and there is plenty of special effects.So, why only four stars? Unfortunately, the game moves as a nearly constant pace, and it is a slow one at that. And, although there is a lot to shoot at, it isn't particularly engaging.

Top government officials, top military officials, documentation, from around the world... And it's not just someone telling you what they thought this official said or experienced, it is the government and military officials from several countries telling their experiences themselves, presenting their own documentation and evidence. If you've ever wondered at all if there could really be beings and crafts from elsewhere in the universe, and if they could have visited here, this is the DVD for you. Very compelling, indeed.

The author has succinctly examined the raid from all facets and illuminates the event and it's ramifications. For a thorough examination of the bombing campaign against Japan I recommend Barrett Tillman'sWhirlwindI highly recommend this title as well as these other Caidin titles \\"The Night Hamburg Died\\"The Night Hamburg Died(the British fire-bombing of Hamburg, Germany) and also \\"Black Thursday\\"Black Thursdaywhich focuses on the Schweinfurt raid.

While the art and stories are not as sophisticated as what today's comic book readers are used to, they are still incredibly enjoyable. Wonder Woman's character had almost a sarcastic side to her in these early days. Completely different from the very serious character in current issues. Readers will enjoy watching Wonder Woman toss around America's World War II era Axis enemies as well as cleaning up corruption and injustice on the home front.

This is a very emotional, high-energy song and Ann Wilson hits some of her most powerful high notes.I don't at all consider this album a \\"complete your collection\\" album, or for enthusiasts only. It's a great album on its own with enormous replay value. This was Heart's last great album before they started the whole Lovemongers effort. I wasn't too thrilled with Lovemongers, because they don't have the raw energy of Heart, like DWO does.If you like outstanding rock music, killer basslines, lofty powerful high note vocals, sweet harmonies, and mesmerizing lyrics, buy this album.

On the soundtrack of True Lies the song by SADE is not there. This was the first time I was so dissappointed by a soundtrack and was made aware that just becasue the song is in the movie doesn't mean \\"it\\" or the same version of \\"it\\" is found on the soundtrack. I actually demanded a refund from Tower records at that time. The music from this soundtrack will be used for my Spinning classes.

The songs really made the scenes of the movie in which they were featured. There are, however, a few songs that they overlooked when compiling this soundtrack. The first track that I think should have been in this soundtrack is Amsterdam. It was made by David Holmes himself and it confuses me why it wasn't included in the first place. It has been added on iTunes on a two track single titled, Amsterdam/I Love Art...Really!. The second and most obvious song that was neglected is The a la Menthe by La Caution. The third missing song is Rito a Los Angeles by Giuseppe De Luca which was played during the scene where the egg is stolen on the train. This can also be purchased on iTunes.

I was needing to dig post holes down by a culvert. I preferred to have the holes as narrow as I could since that was packed dirt. Dropped 4 foot holes with about a 3 inch margin for packing in rock and pouring concrete. Had lots of rain and the posts haven't budged. Time will tell but this style post hole digger really helped me. Only problem is that on one blade the welding bead didn't stay true to the handle and I feel it will get mud and water up in there and weaken that blade over time...I will contact Fiskars about this. Haven't had time yet.

The book takes the same attitude toward runes and the quest of the spiritual warrior. The difference lies in the interpretation of the individual runes.For example, the rune shaped like an \\"X\\" is the rune of \\"trust\\" in the \\"Healing\\" book. In the original book it is \\"partnership\\". The healing book asks you to examine trust in your life and what you can heal around that issue.I find these runes very useful and enjoy the \\"recovery\\" language used by Mr. Blum and Ms. Loughan.

About half of what *is* written in this book is composed of the 3 introductions, quotes, in-work citations, and poems from about 50 different cultures that have nothing to do with runes. The whole idea of 'healing runes' in Blum's sense seems farfetched... It really sounds like he just pulled everything in this book out of nowhere so he could make some money... In his writing, he makes the excuse that there are people in rehab, people who are depressed but don't want to go to therapy, blablabla....

His blood family only draws him farther away from the outside world of human social interaction.

The book if fantastic. The relationships are fascinating. I really cared about the characters, and I could understand why Macon would be attracted to someone like Muriel, particularly after the loss of his son. Tyler writes characters in a way that I can believe; I felt like I knew the people in the novel. I laughed, I cried, I yelled, I pondered. All the things I hope a novel will encourage me to do. And most importantly, I never felt manipulated. Tyler didn't tell; she showed. I would have given it 5 stars, but I did feel that she could've expanded a bit more on Macon's relationship with his family, and particularly, his ex-wife. What was it about them they pulled apart rather than together in their grief? I still don't have a satisfactory sense of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will make you laugh and weep!","review":"This is one of my favorite books, Macon is a travel writer who would rather stay home. His books cater to people who must travel, hence the tips about how to bring home with you on your trip. He is staid, compulsive, and depressed. His son is killed, and his wife leaves him. This book describes his depression. Macon stops cooking and cleaning. He devises a way to make popcorn from his bed, he sews his sheets together to make it easier to make his bed. Finally He meets Muriel and she is his opposite. She is impulsive, messy and fun. Macon is repulsed and then entranced. Macon and Muriel learn from each other. Muriel trains the dog \\"Edward\\" even when she is flat on her back and he tries to bite her, she holds her hand up and says \\"absolutely not!\\" Edward obeys her.

I very much wanted to like the book, but within the first few pages was burdened by informative dialogue and a protagonist whom by his very nature didn't want to go anywhere. Inevitably, the plot really doesn't go anywhere either, and I can believe it when the author states that she created only a one page narrative outline before writing the book. At the end, we're stuck with characters we don't really care about and a contrived ending that has no real lasting impact. I don't mean to sound harsh, but the banality was just too much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book about boring people","review":"I realy don't know what it is about this book that would make anyone want to make a movie about it.

My biggest problem with \\"The Accidental Tourist\\" (and it is a BIG problem) is that the narrative is boring...there is no ART in the way words and sentences are constructed and that, combined with a story line that is thin, have, for me, produced a non-page-turner.

She's such a boring character. She's young, but not motivated to work. In fact, she quited one of her jobs when Macon covered her rent. The dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men, and get support. The point is that she doesn't enjoy the job, thus, a detailed description of her dog training job (which she doesn't seem to enjoy) was just a boring digression."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is... pretty good","review":"Not the best book I've ever read but certainly an enjoyable read. The characters are truly beleivable, more so than most books I have ever read... It seems that you could run into Macon, Muriel, or Sarah any day at any store. Maybe it's that fact that didn't make this book 5 stars... The characters are REAL, but not interesting enough to make this book GREAT. Personally, I prefer John Irving's fascinating characters on the edge of reality. This book is an easy read, and worth it if you're not looking for something that will involve you deeply."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good one!","review":"I just received the book and it's very beautiful!

I've read it dozens of times. At first glance, it's fetching and readable, but look beyond the surface - some passages are near masterpieces. Look for Macon fixing the sink with Alexander, and Macon shopping for clothes with Alexander. This book also gives a believable and touching description of a person changing. Just follow Macon's thoughts and see how they change with time. I think this is Tyler's best (and I've read them all)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters are boring. not enough plot","review":"I was getting fed up with the book, noting that I was halfway through it and nothing had happened. The main character is boring and much too much time is spent on proving how boring he is. The other characters (except Muriel) were not very interesting either. The relationship beteen Macon and Muriel is simply not believable, based on their personalites.So much more could have been done with the plot. I expect the movie would have accomplished this or it would never have been made into one.For those who have said that the characters are quirky, I suggest that you check out books by William Deverell (eg. April Fool), where the characters are considerably more unique.Of the 7 books I read during my holiday, I rate The Accidental Tourist at the bottom of the barrel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Quicky book I read.","review":"I read this book when it first came out in 1986.

The characters' only hope, it seems, is somehow finding a way to express themselves in their dire conditions, all of which have something to do with sex. If there were some way of expressing how contrived the bleakness of the world and the situations they encounter, how flat and boring the characters are, and how \\"random\\" the thought and phrase juxtapositions are... Well. I would. Alas, the only real way to experience this psychobabble is to pick it up for yourself.

Her first 3 books were not only beautifully crafted, but \\"Sexing the Cherry\\" and \\"Passion\\" created delicious fantasy worlds--these books made you want to have Winterson over to dinner. \\"Art and Lies\\" makes me want to send her to writer's camp, or better, to some better world where she can recapture her sense of wonder. I will still buy her books, hoping she can seize the magic once more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collection of Random Thoughts","review":"My favorite Winterson books, The Passion and Sexing the Cherry are beautiful narratives filled with amazingly observant thoughts. Contrastly, Art is a series of amazingly observant thoughts filled scantily by a complex narrative. Not what I would call a good read.

Ever since, she's completely lost the plot. Is the language beautiful? Yes, but after you've read her other books it fails to dazzle as much. This one is about 3 nameless characters on a train, running away from their miserable existences and you'll probably need to read it twice to figure out what the whole thing's about. Basically i think she's trying to say : The modern world is rubbish, and art (supposedly this book counts) ought to rule. All very tiresome, a bit naive, and exceedingly pretentious.

Buns have delicate digestion and many treats for them like this one are geared towards enticing well meaning human owners with less regard if any for pets well being.

I love thillers and I love Algeria and have been there three times for quite a long stay (average 25 days) and this book has managed to leave me cold and indiferent.Algerian people are really nice and loyal friends, that I agree with but Touaregs live their life in the far South and they would never go to Algiers to play war of guerrilla. And there is something more: with the settlement of the nomad tribes came the Islamization, yes. But Touaregs have been traditionally animists and their traditions are very different from what is pictured here.In the terrible years of the terror war there is no way they would make an alliance with GIA to go up North in a massive manner (25!!) and there is something else: you will not find a Touareg dress with the cheche (turbant) in Algiers!!. Simply there is not need for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad story","review":"I haven't read it, but I am curious if the brave and so honorable protagonist uses Xanax and Valium to subdue and interrogate ruthless female enemy agents posing as nice, modest women while in Algeria?If not in this book, perhaps in the sequel, which I understand a CIA operative with embassy cover manages to terribly harm the US reputation, feed Al Qaeda's hate machine, and endanger the lives of countless Americans in the Middle East -- all while having sworn to defend our country?

That being said, you don't need any jamband background to appreciate this CD.The tones of each song distinguish themselves. Reid Genauer is an incredible songwriter.

If you're a fan of Strangefolk you'll like this cd. It sounds just like any other cd Reid and the boys could have put together (Simplistic and poppy sounding). Having graduated from UVM these guys were everywhere in the Burlington area. Now with Reid gone SF & AOD are two \\"different\\" bands. But not really.

But you wouldn't know it from these translations. Grennan does a masterful job of carrying over this great poet into English.Leopardi is among the most bleak of poets.

Is it just me, or does his current lackluster style of art show how lazy he's become? His original Superman work is far superior in quality of both story and art. This series had many good concepts but Byrne's corny dialogue, poor character design, and hokey storylines within the series left it feeling a bit too \\"cutesy\\" and childish.

I gave this book its one star because of the personal stories, which I found to be relate-able, but there was no real \\"advice\\" here, just the author's pet thesis, which I found not only less than helpful, but also relatively patronizing. A much more helpful book (and funnier too) is So You Want to be a Lesbian? by Liz Tracey and Sydney Pokorny.

His voice is great--very bluesy and only Dion can place emphasis on music like the way he does: he's expert. What I love about this live CD is that the stereo setup and sound quality is done right. I went to a concert in the 90s and the sound system was not set up right. The musical instruments had their volume set so loud you can't hear the musician--no matter how experienced the singer. The only good song in that concert was the one where the performer played piano to their own sound system--that was the ONLY set where I could here the performers voice.

Slightly better than his debut \\"Hawke\\", but that ain't saying much. I can't imagine reading any more of this series. James Bond? LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great spy tale. I really enjoy the recurring character and his crew of buchaneers.","review":"The recurring character, Alex Hawke and his many cohorts, are always a great read and the mystery is well-written and very intriguing. We know Alex is always going to live through another ordeal, but it makes you wonder how he will escape each escapade."},{"rating":"1","title":"disjointed","review":"There is a good basic plot in this \\"high adventure\\" novel but inconsistencies, contradictions and repetitive descriptions distract from it. Book editors should have caught them. Skip this one and go straight to Tsar - it's better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thrill in loose writing.","review":"I, too, took Glen Beck's word for this book.To say it strains credulity is being way nicer than it deserves.Dont pick up this book if you like writing that hangs together, is at least vaguely believable and indulges in real character developement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book that Even \\"Institutionalized Morons\\" Will Enjoy","review":"A great \\"airplane book\\". I was intrigued by a previous reviewer who motivated me to make a purchase when he commented something to the effect that \\"if you are an insitutionalized moron, buy this book\\". If being a graduate of Stanford, Georgetown and Rhode Island College[institutioanlized or not] makes me a moron - so be it. I found the story line better company in the middle seat of a 737 from BOS to ATL than most of my fellow passengers. The yarn was interesting, at some points even riviting and throughout told in the manner of a Celtic Shanachie. Shakespear Mr. Bell is not; but nowhere in all his blurbs do I see that he, his editors or his publishers make that claim. Buy the volume and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I must say that I agree with Belinda in her assessment of this book. There is evidently a first Hawke novel, although I have not read it. The characters in this book apparently depend on the other to \\"flesh\\" themselves out. Their development in this book was very weak. Hawke really is unbelievable as a character. There is no place that he hasn't been or thing he is not the best at. The second plot line was added just to use a few more characters. It was OK as a \\"summer read\\" but there are better thrillers out there that deserve our reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever you do, don't read it...","review":"This is my first ever Amazon review. If I stop one person from wasting their time and money on this book, my efforts will have been worthwhile.Let me provide a little context: I really like tongue-in-cheek trash fiction. Bond, Pitt, even Bourne, are entertaining. I even read Jeffrey Archer!Bell, however, has created a miserable work. The prose is leaden. The plot twists are beyond predictable. The characters are made of kevlar re-inforced carboard. The lifestyle aspired to is ridiculous. C'mon, a silver spoon in mouth English lord who is also a commando, corporate raider, secret agent who tells the President of the US what do, and lover to the Secretary of State? This doesn't bend, it breaks. The kicker is that this ridiculous uber-mensch also has pretentious taste in wine.Run away before you do something stupid, like buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"amateurish and cartoonish","review":"Are you kidding? Mindless drivel is just piled on with no sense whatsoever. Every woman is beautiful, every man is deadly and plot makes no sense and the whole thing stinks.

I'd rather watch paint dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointed!","review":"I also bought this book based on Glenn Beck's hype of it and am now considering ending my Insider account with him. You can't tell me Glenn really thought this book was great. And to tell all of his listeners everyday for the last coulpe months how incredible this book is - what a joke. He's a total sell out. Maybe someone who has never read another book in their life might find these characters interesting, or the story line thrilling - but honestly it read like a bad Steven Seagal movie made into an even worse book."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!","review":"Ted Bell must have a lot of family and friends to write all of these nice reviews- because after reading this book, I don't understand why ANYONE would think this book had any substance whatsoever. I bought this book because it came highly recommended by Glenn Beck, and am thoroughly disappointed that I actually paid money for it. I kept expecting the book to get better but it never did.I want those 6 hours of my life back."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books Ever","review":"Why any publisher would print such drivel is beyond me. The characters are cartoon-like and have no depth whatsoever. It is very sloppily written and edited. Just to name a couple of errors that others haven't mentioned. In the boat chase, Stokely Jones' boat at first is powered by two 150 hp Mercury engines. A couple of pages later they become 250 hp Yamaha engines. The bad guys take off from Indonesia flying northwest ostensibly over the Pacific to Los Angeles. Hello? Flying northwest will take you over Asia, not the Pacific. His description of nuclear weopons is total nonsense. Thank Heavens I got the book from the library and didn't pay good money for it!!

And let's hope none of this imagination ends up in history books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst book of the year","review":"This is probably one of the worst books published, this or any other year.

Better yet also invest in some eyedrops because reading this trash will make your eyes bleed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbose","review":"Mr. Bell certainly likes to see himself write. He could have cut out a hundred pages and still have too many. It was very difficult getting through the overuse of adjectives. I will not be reading any other Bell tomes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time and Trees","review":"This is the first book by Mr Bell I've read and it will be the last. It's unbelievable that someone actually published this poorly written trash. The other reviewer's comments regarding cliches and trite writing were, \\"spot on, old thing\\", as one of Bell's precious British characters might say. I especially disliked the Ebonic dialog employed by his African-American character, a retired US Navy SEAL. The SEALS I know are all intelligent, resourceful, tough and, argueably, crazy but they do not speak like crack heads or Amos and Andy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't bother to finish it.","review":"I have to agreee whole-heartedly with the negatice reviwes of this book. Not a great follow-up to the first installment. Stokes' character is laughable as is the \\"bad guy\\". I got about 100 pages into it and could care less what was going to happen on 101."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book Tom Clancy would've written","review":"...in high school. I intended to hammer on the abundance of cliches in this book, but others have beat me to it. I short, if you can relate to a rich, pedigreed, intelligent, handsome, decorated war hero with zero character flaws, than Ethan Hawke is your man. And no, a penchant for margaritas is not a character flaw.I actually shouted at the book out of frustration a couple times. Imagine your father or grandfather trying to rap or talk teenage slang, and you'll get an idea of how awkward some of the dialog feels. It gave me a nosebleed just trying to read the parts featuring the \\"Stokely Jones'\\" character.This was the first and last Ted Bell novel that I'll ever read. Shame on you Glenn Beck for talking this up so much on your radio program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable Drivel","review":"Wildly illogical plot, improbable dialog, strangely developed characters and you have a really difficult read. A former Navy SEAL/NYPD detective who always talks like an uneducated crack dealer working closely with a member of the British gentry and other unlikely characters trying to snag a 400 pound Arabic-speaking psychopath with a really strangely contrived name irritates me to no end and makes me want to pitch the book. But, the cover price has risen more than 50% so I'll slog my way through this mess through to the end. Ted Bell is definitely off my reading list. Pity: I generally enjoy British writers - not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book -- comic book character or not!","review":"This was the third Alexander Hawke book I've read (previouslySpyandPirate: A Thriller (Hawke)) and this was my favorite so far.I see the critics talk about how Hawke's larger than life persona has reached comic book status. I say pour on some more Mr. Bell!Bell brings a very plausible plot (terror, nukes, pox, etc.) togtether in an interesting international adventure story.I can hardly wait for the new book!Wish I could get a copy of \\"Hawke\\" the original book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An extremely poor attemt at a spy/thriller","review":"I had to force myself to finish this book. I don't allow myself to move onto a new read until I've finished the one that I've started, and this by far was the most difficult to get through. The dialogue between characters is laughable, the promising plot points are either too rushed or go on for far too long thereby destroying any bit of excitement that could be felt from them. Ted Bell's description and background on these characters makes them too unbelievable either by allowing them every positive characteristic (Alex Hawke) or changing their characteristics when its convenient (bin Wazir). There is nothing endearing about this novel, I honestly cannot believe this book was ever a bestseller. Do yourself a favor, bypass this book and read the 007 series by Ian Fleming."},{"rating":"1","title":"killed my desire to read more","review":"This was my second Ted Bell book and I must say it was better than the first (which is really not saying anything). The action is fast paced enough to keep you interested but in the end the horrendous technical inaccuracies, ridiculous characters, and poor writing make you wish you'd never started it.I made a long list of technical inaccuracies as I read, but I will limit this rant to only one. Hawke's super yacht (which we know already contains a plane and a speed boat from his last book) is now equipped with an Aegis radar system! Most commonly seen on US guided missile cruisers and destroyers, Aegis' SPY 1 radar uses 4 gigantic phased-array panels that emit enough energy to cook a human being. Somehow he has secretly attached these to a yacht without anyone seeing them. ARG!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Every cliche used - absolutely painful","review":"Let's throw in Sherlock Holmes, James Bond, an Evil Muslim Terrorist, and a Navy Seal with dialog of Amos and Andy. This book is horribly predictable and uses every sterotype of an action character out there. At some points I was laughing at how predictable it was. Those who gave it positive reviews must be either 12 or Ted Bell's friends. In fact, if you look at what other books the positive reviewers reviewed, what do you know, other Ted Bell novels with great reviews. By the way, Mr. Bell you owe me $7.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for more","review":"Hawke and his band of supporting characters are simply addictive, as is Ted Bell's storytelling. This is a thriller that invokes memories of my first Ian Fleming books, with less suspension of disbelief required. The rich trove of characters makes me think, as one of the editorial reviews says, \\"Hawke is the kind of character somebody really should put in a movie\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"dismal","review":"The build up is- these guys are top of the line agents- and yet they are consistently blundering their way into, and blundering out of situations- if they are that good, how are they soconsistently surprised? Sophomoric, especially when Mr. Bell attempts to write black American jive as the Stokely character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly Blasphemous","review":"A truly terrible book. I mean that. For Mr. Bell to dare invoke the name of the great Genius P.G. Wodehouse is nearly blasphemous. Wodehousian prose was lyrical: Bell is a butcherer of the English language. Only a Wodehouse afficionado can appreciate the rabid fury I am experiencing. \\"Assassin,\\" as a book, is so sloppily written I fully intend to take it outside tomorrow and shoot it (possibly more than once) thereby saving my family and friends the agony found within its pages. I have heard hints that Ted Bell may be on the NYT's best sellers list--If that is true, I am extremely dissapointed. If you want a good book, read the masters. Rex Stout, Dorothy Sayers, Wodehouse himself, or any number of craftsmen (and women) who really appreciated the art of storytelling. Ted Bell, and I can't stress this enough, is a hack. Glen Beck, you have greatly dissapointed me. By endorsing this book you have lowerd my esteem of you no end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, interesting characters, but author needs a better editor","review":"Yes, the story is pretty unbelievable, very much in the same class of the works of Fleming, Cussler, etc. However, it is not the story or the character development that makes this a below average read.......the author really needs to change editors. This book could be improved immeasurably by a better job of good editing. Way too wordy, too many extra pages, scenes, action, etc, that do not add anything of value to the overall story and do much to impede the flow. Did the author get paid by the word? Get a bonus for going over 300 pages? Editing, editing, editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A B movie in Paper Form","review":"I picked up this book at the airport as I was heading to Japan. While staying with my in laws in the country, there is no English language anything. This is all I brought so I had to finish it. But it was a struggle.Firstly I like complex thrillers, and I liked all the Tom Clancy Jack Ryan series. Technically excellent, if with totally one dimensional characters.This book reminds me of the original Star Trek, where everyone but the Captain is affected by the virus. The hero is always right.Bell can write, his prose, I think is fine, but the scenarios are sometimes laughably implausible. I also agree with another reviewer here that there is an unpleasant racist overtone in some of his depictions of some of the bad guys.Overall awful, just awful. My first and last Bell book. I will be leaving the rest of the Bell collection on the shelf"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex Hawke... James Bond or Dick Marcinko?","review":"A little of both actually. This is a must read.

What it is an overpriced, superficial textbook aimed at freshmen wondering if they should \`\`go into'' journalism and what jobs they might fill at a newspaper (reporter? ad salesperson? maybe, someday, a circulation manager?)Take it from an experienced newspaper manager, this book is not going to help you navigate the thorny economic, political and ethical issues facing newspapers today.

The dreams feature alternate views of Creation. The personification of emotions in these dreams is brilliant...\\"So Desire Fear and Anger covened together to cut each other's long lustrous hair...\\"\\"The daughters of Knowledge, the twin sisters Truth and Faith, squabbled continuously...\\"In the dreams we come to know the personal traits of the arcangels as if they were our relatives.

Both produced by the wizardry expertise of Dan the Automator. Arguably, the two best produced hip-hop albums, ever. So, tell me why his technically \\"solo\\" albums come up so short in comparsion? Especially this one.The first two tracks with Kool Keith, or Sinister 6000 to be exact, are really the only official classic cuts.

Low replay value."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Harlem Renaissance as Hoodoo","review":"Ishmael Reed's tribute to the Harlem Renaissance is everything that you would expect from Reed. It's funny, energetic , filled with slang and post modern anachronisms.It is also his most researched and ambitious book to date. It concerns Jes Grew, a Voodoo loa who jes grew and engulfed America in an afrocentric wave of culture. The story, filled with black muslim militants, white exploiters and hoodoo priests rolls back and forth scratching the European dominated history books to find an American culture rich with people and culture.This book should be required reading for all Twentieth century hisory courses."},{"rating":"1","title":"book condition was fine","review":"but the content wasn't. now, i'm an international, and i have absolutely no background in jazz music and everything african american related, so i couldn't understand any inference at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK!","review":"Honestly, it's been a hot minute since I've read this book, but I've got to say that the wonderment this novel evoked within me while I was reading it still resonates with me, so much so that I consider it in the top five greatest novels I've ever read. For a lifelong bibliophile such as I that's a powerful statement. Admittedly, this novel isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, but most truly extraordinary things tend to float above the radar of the masses.I know my \\"review\\" isn't very descriptive, but my goal is merely to counteract the negative reviews that were clearly written by dim-witted adolescents who were forced to do so for a class assignment.

Powerful stuff goes on there, but the book is about us, here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mumbo Jumbo","review":"I felt the book was confusing and very hard to follow. I had no idea what was going on the first 100 pages or so until it was brought up in class. Also, the book skipped around too much and I was constantly lost, and found myself reading many pages over again to try and figure out what was going on. The one thing I did like, however, was the story line. I felt Reed had some real potential with it, but the way it was written made the book too hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"mumbo jumbo review","review":"The book mumbo jumbo, by Ishmael Reed, is a story about well, it seems almost nothing. The title of this book clearly explains the issues and storyline throughout the book. The book is supposedly to be a humorous take on western civilization, but the way it is written makes it hard to understand. From dialoge with no quotation to paragraphs with no punctuation, the story is hard to follow and very distracting. If one has the time to re-read all the passages and figure out all the hidden meanings than it can probably be an interessting book full of humorous events, but I did not, so i didn't get as much out of it as I could have. Read it for yourself to see, but be aware of the confusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everybody, but I liked it.","review":"This novel is not going to appeal to those with a need for a clear and linear narrative. Much like the Pynchon's Crying of Lot 49, this books grabs the reader and drags him through a thousand years of history.Make sure that you have done a refresher on the Crusades and the Harlem Renaissance so you can keep up with the some of the allusions. Make no mistake this is a dense little novel and requires close attention to all the characters and the different names they go buy.Though difficult, the novel turns out to be one of the finest and most innovative in it depiction of the how race and culture have come to together and tranformed one another in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book......","review":"I feel the book Mumjo Jumbo by Ishmeal Reed was very confusing, and I would not recommend it to anyone. I think in order to understand the book it is necessary to be familiar with United States history, and even then it is extremely confusing. There are too many characters being introduced at one time, and the book keeps jumping around to different people and places. He had strange ways of using grammer, and punctuation that i doubt anyone can understand- i do not think it had any relevent meaning to the book. I think Reed had the potential to write a good story-but tried too hard and failed miserably. I would not recommend this book to anyone- the only reason I continued to read it is because it was a required text for my class."},{"rating":"1","title":"confused","review":"I found this book very hard to understand. The storyline was extremely hard to follow. The book did not state exactly what it meant and I am not very good at interpreting things and finding the deeper meanings. This book was very challanging and requires a lot of time to figure things out and I personally do not have that kind of time to spend on one book.I do not think that this book is meant for young children or even teenagers, unless they haver a good understanding of the Harlem renaissance and the crusades. I personally do not know much about these topics and had a hard time with the book. With the knowledge of these topics hopefully the book wouldn't be as challanging for those who decide to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUMBO JUMBO is just that.","review":"In general I feel that the book, Mumbo Jumbo, written by Ishmael Reed was one of the worst books that I have read. It jumped around a lot and used some rather unorthodox methods for grammar and puncuation. The book introduces many different characters at once and then the reader won't hear about these characters for some time and then they are shoved back into the story. The author made some odd biblical references throughout the book as well. The strange terminology and poems found sporatically placed in the text also added to the difficulty of reading. This not an easy reading book nor is it entertaining. I would not recomend this book to any reader of any reading level. I also feel that this text is not a very good book to make critiques on because it does not seem to be relevant to any one subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I think I missed the boat on this one. I found it totally confusing that Reed constantly changes point of view and location. Worse than confusing, however, is that in doing this we don't care about any of the characters. Even when they die I'm not inspired to shed a tear. Reed wants to be the African American Kurt Vonnegut, but I'm sorry to say that this effort falls far short of that mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mumbo Jumbo....that's all it is","review":"I am in a book club and we read this and everyone was at a loss about it. Noone could follow it and noone enjoyed it.

He provides no liner notes (which are very interesting, even if Greg Brady had nothing to do with them) or blurb. It's just his smiling face gracing the cover of this very fun album. I bought it for a drive to the beach, and now it seems the perfect choice. You get Edison Lighthouse, Dave Loggins (Please Come To Boston, one of the all time great songs) and First Class singing about their Beach Baby. In addition, Brewer and Shipley go One Toke Over The Line and Vicki Lawrence talks about a night when the lights went out in Georgia. It's like listening to AM radio in the 70s. Just a fun album, plus you get Greg Brady's picture in the bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"70's still rock","review":"Hubby was very happy with this cd that provided some of the songs they just don't play anymore.

Peace!Update:As mentioned above, I bought this to round out the total purchase with other items. It cost $6.49 at that time and was well worth it.That said, it is now very expensive and must be noted that many of these tracks aren't the original tracks. Many are re-recordings by the same artists, or perhaps the lead singer with some \\"house band\\" playing the music. While the songs are still VERY similar to the originals, there is just a little difference - enough to notice but not enough to make the song ghastly - the price one might pay today is way too much.Still, get a groovy feeling with Barry Williams on the cover and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"So nostalgic","review":"This is a great CD and brought back lots of memories.

Davis seemed to gravitate to songs about heartbreak, but she's not a shrieker, not a belter. She's more in tune with Dolly Parton's style of vocalizing, with a sad smile underneath her words.

Sawyer and Neanderthals, you think of his Hugo Award-winning HOMINIDS and its sequels, HUMANS and HYBRIDS. But it turns out that he was writing about Neanderthals and characters who were geneticists long before those books, as this earlier Hugo Award-finalist by Sawyer demonstrates. The settings are Montreal, Canada, and Berkeley, California, and the template is that of a Robin Cook-style medical thriller (but with richer characterization than Cook ever provides). Interestingly for a science-fiction book, it's not set at all in the future. Rather, the setting is the Human Genome Project in 1997, where all is not what it seems, and people have dark secrets in their pasts. Wonderful stuff, would make a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science fiction with an underpinning of real science!","review":"So much that is labeled 'science fiction' has only the very minimum of real science in it. It was this reason, in fact, that I pretty much gave up reading in this genre some years ago. But I came across Sawyer's recent 'Hominids' and was swept away. That one was about Neanderthals and was accurate in most respects. This one is about several things: the genetics of Huntington's disease (the disease that killed Woody Guthrie, to jog your memory about it), telepathy and the possibility that it could be a real condition with a genetic origin. On top of that the book is a thriller and a romance. And very well written, too.What more could one ask? I know I'll be reading more of Robert Sawyer's books now.Scott Morrison"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good thriller","review":"This is a thriller, a scientific low-key sci-fi thriller, and it's a very good yarn. The action is well paced and makes for a real page-turner. The writing range from fair to quite good with some downfalls to yuch-bad; at which points clichés upon clichés are thrown at the reader who must not be too choosy. But on occasion the writing is perfect, such as when Avi Meyer hears about his father's life in Treblinka or the final family photo session between Pierre, Molly and Amanda. Sawyer's writing at those moments is elusive, almost moody, and touching-yet he resists the temptation to reveal all (which is a major failing with sf writer as I see it, this compulsive need to tell all and everything, to let no stone unturned, this absence-excuse my French- of subtlety). On the whole, Mr. Sawyer is an energetic writer and a sound craftsman, with buckets of interesting ideas and the will and enthusiasm to produce first and foremost a Good Story. And he's Canadian, eh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read, although perhaps a little too ambitious","review":"The book was very well written and the plot interesting. I was totally involved with the characters by the end of the first chapter. But the book seemed to take on too much, dealing with insurance issues, a Nazi war criminal, human genetics, telepathy, debilitating disease, etc. Because of this I found the ending vaguely disappointing, perhaps a little anti climactic. However, this is a minor complaint. I still really enjoyed the book, and do recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No zing at all","review":"I just finished this book and was saddened.

The science parts are not as awful as in other books of the genre, but the writing is wooden, the characters are flat and the abrupt insertion of long quotes from other books and works of political oratory is annoying. But that's not why I call it unintentionally hilarious. No, that's because the bad guy is ... (drumroll) an evil insurance company! An evil insurance company that engages in a secret plot so that it can keep its actuarial tables up to date, no less!

Unfortunately, there appear to be a few too many of them to cover in this rather short book: A scientist wrestles with a deadly genetic disease; discovers a telepathy gene in his wife; uncovers a secret Nazi death camp guard; his wife gives birth to a Neanderthal clone (although she is a PhD herself, neither notices anything \\"wrong\\" for a long time!); finds a secret code in \\"junk\\" DNA. The plot twists left me feeling abused rather than amused or intellectually challenged. A much stronger book would have taken just ONE of these story lines and developed it in greater depth. The ideas are interesting - I liked reading about Berkeley, where I was a postdoc. The writing style is spare and doesn't get in the way of the plot. Unfortunately, as it is, I felt like I was reading the script of a made for TV movie - probably the FOX channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"changing genes","review":"\\"Frameshift\\" by Robert J.

I scanned color photographs that were sent to a word document. I was very satisfied with the quality. The fax works like a charm sending and receiving.

It is not meant for heavy printing like laser printers but it is the best model they made for pictures and color copies. It is a shame that HP doesn't listen to photographers and others of us who need the more finite printing colors.

Even if you can barely sew at all (like me) this book gives you enough information for you to build a multitude of costumes. The drawings show how several different pieces can be re-combined, and multiple variations on a theme.The binding was purposefully chosen to permit the costumer to lay the book flat (I only wish more cookbooks used this idea!); mine has been laid flat, folded over, and abused in dozens of different ways and has never lost a single page. Bad bindings are easily replaced by the publisher if you send a faulty one back.This is a PERFECT book for folks on a budget who are trying to achieve an expensive look without breaking their wallet as well; it's affordably priced and it covers inexpensive techniques that look like a fortune. I've frequently referred back to this book while creating new outfits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just starting off","review":"I've been grabbing for any and all info in regards to the world of belly dancing.

It was almost like S.E.

Later Travis finds that he and the Star Runner have a lot in common.I didn't care for this book because it didn't have a lot to do with the Star Runner. I think S.E. Hinton should have added more detail on how the Star Runner got tamed. I would recommend this book to a young adult like Travis: a procrastinator from the city. I think this because I feel if you're like the character you can understand more about the story you're being told. It was an okay book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love all S.E. Hinton books","review":"I loved the book! The characters were real with emotion and how they spoke. Her other books, THE OUTSIDERS, THAT WAS THEN,THIS IS NOW, RUMBLE FISH, and TEX, all ended very strong. And TAMING THE STAR RUNNER did not end strong at all. It ended with new emotions to begin. You really didn't know much about Joe or the twins for a dramatic scene to happen about them. The book was great other then that though. It really explains how you can go from something your used to and something you love, to something you know nothing about and the complete opposite and just move on. To learn to live with it and enjoy it. So I give it 5 stars!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"This is the first time I've ever read an S.E.

Taming is about a 16 year old boy going through problems and is sent to live with his uncle. His uncle happens to live on a ranch where he meets a girl named Casey who he starts to like. A friend of his comes to visit and he realizes that change doesn't have to be a bad thing.Although the book is quick paced and thrilling, it is pretty 2 dimensional. I felt no real depth within the characters to feel more close to them - and depth in character makes a book more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taming The Star Runner","review":"Travis is a violent kid he lashes out on his stepfather with a fire poker and got arrested as well as banished from his home leaving him a newcomer on his uncle's ranch.

I thought it was real interesting when Travis went to his uncle's so he wouldn't have to go back to juvenile hall. The one thing that I didn't like about was that from the title it sounded like it was going to be all about a horse. But it didn't.

The book has nothing to do with the U.S. Border Patrol or any realistic law enforcement.

Her photographs evoke a profound experience of both a personal and a social psychology of the feminine. Her pictures include concerns about puberty and sexuality as well as motherhood and family. How does an artist describe what she truly loves without reducing the person to an aesthetic subject. How does a mother relate to her daughters without denying their autonomy and complexity. These questions are raised again and again in Mann's work. The photographs are muted, sad and beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know it when I see it","review":"If you don't think this book is pornographic look at the other things people who purchased this have bought.

But portraying one of the worlds most interesting and beautiful city like it was is a real shame and pitty. I am a Greek living in Athens who visits Istanbul and beaches at the south of Turkey with my family at least twice a year and know what I am talking about.

How dares he, this spoilt NY brat who couldn't figure out if to smoke hash or pot or be gay or not.It's one of the worst books ever! It has nothing to do with Papillon at all!It's a diary of a whiner, a naive primitive, spoilt American, and a criminal brat.Let's face it, he did attempt to smuggle and he was a drug user. There's no way around it!Papillon is a march towards grace and soul freedom over elements and hurdles of life told in the most adventurous style. This lowly tale is a strife of a spoilt New Yorker, who never once had to work in his life and had everything handed to him on a platter. His tribulations are of personal nature only second guessing his sexuality and penchant for drug abuse. Nothing in the book makes for good reading. It's of no spiritual or uplifting value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this luggage tag","review":"My husband gave me these tags and they make spotting luggage at the airport very easy.

I didn't know he was going to remix it too. The remasters off Capitol Punishment sound good, here Mustaine decided to remix and play with the master tapes, creating a completely different sound to the original. The first major problem is the smooth and intermingledness of the album as now it lacks that distinct almost cyborg-metal sound that the original had. The extras aren't that special, just a couple of Japanese extra tracks and demos, and the demos are not that special. While it would have been interesting to have seen an evolution of the songs, in the end we have a version that sounded like it the version before they recorded the album instead of a really early version. In the end, stick to the originals, this doesn't offer anything new... just different and not better."},{"rating":"2","title":"counting down..........","review":"this is the follow up to rust in piece and megadeth's evolution into the mainstream metal that many a band has done, most notably, metallica's black album. it starts off with a bang with skin o' my teeth, which is a great song, one of the best on the album. next is symphony of destruction, which was the first megadeth song i ever heard. another stand out track is sweating bullets. its basically dave just being himself, aka a nut. awesome song and one of my favorites. all songs on here are solid, captive honour and psychotron standing out for me, but the last song, ashes in your mouth, is probly the best on the disc. perfect song. the album started with a bang, and ends with one too. a change for megadeth but a good one at that. the next album would continue this new sound, and continue it well...overall, great cd if youre a megadeth fan, must have. not thrash, but still a good metal release."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing guitar work","review":"dave mustaine and marty friedman have written not only good riffs but virtuosic solos as well the best solo is on ashes in your mouth where friedman has on then mustaine the they have a duet it may seem weird but its awesome this is a good megadeth album to start with i say that because this was my first megadth album"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great album...","review":"In all respects.

Although Megadeth always lived in the shadow of singer/guitarist Dave Mustaine's former band, Metallica, I find Megadeth to be just as, if not more, talented.

Those 2 albums killed Countdown. This is the decline of Megadeth. It's when they started playing the Cryptic Writings sound they have now. I thought it wasn't bad at first but after a while I got sick of it. Not recommended if you want Megadeth for the 1st time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Remaster sucks","review":"Anyone who purchased this album years ago will wince at the errors in the remaster, entire words missing from 'Countdown' and the remakes on the 2nd half of the album blows. I'd rather listen to Ween. Recommend if you are a true Megadeth fan is buy nothing but the original soundtrack, not the remasters or remakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy People, Listen Up","review":"This is a great album. But when I read most of the reviews on here I'm blown away by some of the love dished out.Best ever? Thrash? Heaviest Megadeth album ever?My good friends, let's not get carried away. Gushing love is a good thing but let's not overlook something obvious about this album: COMMERCIAL.Yes folks. The big 'C' word. Ever notice how all these songs (except Ashes) are neat and trimmed for radio length? Ever notice how furious time changes and 18 different guitar riffs have been slimmed down to a mild handful? Ever notice how bad Psychotron is?Don't profane the past. Listen to Rust In Peace, listen to So Far, and listen to Peace Sells, and then listen to this. You'll notice a huge difference. Don't get me wrong, I love this disc. Best tracks include: This Was My Life, Countdown, Ashes, AofA.But please don't call this thrash. Please don't call this Megadeth's best ever. And please don't say it's the heaviest 'Deth because that is simply untrue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album, but not sure about the remix...","review":"There are a couple of good things about the remix, namely the sound is more pronounced, the guitars are clearer, and overall you get more 'Deth in your ears. HOWEVER, why Dave Mustaine made some of the choices he did, I can't explain. For instance, Symphony Of Destruction is missing the harmonized guitars found in the chorus, one of my favorite aspects of the original. What was wrong with the way it was?If you've never heard the original, then better for you. Its still a great album. Fans of the original with fond memories, be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"I'll admit it up-front: I'm no metal fan. But I love this album! The guitar work is amazing, the vocals are good, not fingernails on the blackboard like some other metal albums I've heard. If you're already a fan, you don't need my advice, but if you just want to have something heavy in your diverse collection, this is the album to have! You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible rerecording","review":"Dont buy this if you are a Megadeth fan. It sounds like crap compared to original recording. Buy the original album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album, but watch out Thrash/Speed Lovers","review":"Countdown To Extinction is a good album, with great guitars, more \\"elaborated\\" solos and some great lyrics. But it's not like any other Megadeth album, it's more \\"experimental\\" and commercial. Here you'll find shorter and slower songs, great guitar solos and rythm changes. So, if you're seeking for something like Rust In Peace, you'll probably end a little bit dissapointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"EH.... my least favorite so far","review":"Hey, I have a lot of Megadeth albums, and this one definitely interests me the least. It just seems so uninspired and repetitive, and doesn't really grip you. Of course it couldn't be a Rust in Peace, but I wasn't expecting that. The solos in High Speed Dirt are good, but fail to amaze in most other songs. Skin O My Teeth, This Was My Life, Captive Honor, and Ashes in Your Mouth, are fair tracks, but only fair. Cryptic Writings and Youthanasia are really good. I haven't heard Risk really, but from what I've heard this one might be a better buy than Risk. I'd skip this one until you have Youth and Cryptic already."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is wrong with you people???","review":"This album was a big disappointment for me. a few years ago when I was just another big Metallica fan I heard of a great group called Megadeth and one of the greatest metal albums called countdown to extinction. so I bought this album and instead of the great metal album I expected to I got simple chords, silly lyrics and some good guitar solos. luckily a good friend of mine loaned me Youthanasia and I really liked it then I got Rest In Peace and So Far, So good... so what? and those were killer albums also. now I got most of Megadeth's work and I can't believe I almost missed this great band because of one bad album, C.T.E. if you haven't heard Megadeth yet do yourself a big favour, get R.I.P and pass this one or you might miss a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Megadeth goes MTV - with mixed results","review":"This is the album where Dave Mustaine decided to make Megadeth MTV/radio friendly, and frankly, the previously aggressive Megadeth suffered heavily. Only one track (\\"Symphony of Destruction\\") captures the feel of Megadeth's masterpiece \\"Peace Sells .. But Who's Buying?\\", while the rest is a not-so-coy attempt to make Megadeth more acceptable to the MTV generation.Gee whiz Mr. Mustaine, wasn't \\"Peace Sells\\" an ironic comment on the vapid generation of Americans spoon fed information and entertainment on television? If this album was a savage parody of metal bands selling out, give it four stars. As it is, it's going to have to get by with two from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Countdown to Extinction","review":"Most of the people I knew looked at Megadeth as a bad or over-rated band. I got the tape for this album so I know nothing of the bonus tracks. I listened to the tape front to back and I liked it. I can't say that I loved it because I didn't. The singer wasn't great, but that's really my only complaint. I would say Megadeth is actually under-rated because not many people of this generation have heard of them. The Megadeth guitarest is completely off the hinges. The guitar solos were really great. The rhythms to every song were original and good. I think Megadeth is something more people should be looking into. Especially fans of 70s and 80s rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carful when purchising from this seller, i was lied to.","review":"I bought a Remastered, Bonus content Edition CD from this seller, and when it can it did not have the bonus content, If you about buying a CD from this seller, be carful you can be lied to."},{"rating":"2","title":"the greatest megadeth album","review":"countdown to extinction was without a doubt the greatest album from Dave Mustaine and his boys.this is thrash metal at it's finest.songs like symphony of destruction,architecture of agression will remain classics.very highly recommended along with peace sells.five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fix what ain't broke!","review":"If you listen to this new version of countdown you miss out on so much. And you might think; well I don't care it's the songs that are important not the production and I get alot of bonus songs with this one but when the producer miss out on basic things like getting the volume levels right and maintaining the atmosphere it just isn't the same anymore. This album is sloppy produced with only one thing in mind, and that is to milk the most money out of fans possible from this already perfectly produced album. The only bonus song that isn't a demo(shrug) is crown of worms and that is available on the terrific maxi-single 'train of consequences'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Megadeth Albumn","review":"This by far is Megadeth's best albumn. All the songs are classic. Dave Mustaine rips on vocal's and prove Megadeth is the leader in top metal bands. In my opinion this put them over Metallica. Although they have not achieved the level of this albumn since, United Abomonations is close. If you can only buy 1 Megadeth albumn this is it! I listened to this one thousands of time on tape! I still have the tape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Foreclosure of a Dream","review":"Many Megadeth fans prefer \\"Rust in Peace\\" and \\"Peace Sells But Who's Buying\\" but this Megadeth is the best-selling album. This is also one of the heaviest Megadeth album, there's only the title track that is quite peaceful. The album has some great moments with \\"Skin o' My Teeth\\", \\"Symphony of Destruction\\", \\"Sweating Bullets\\", \\"Ashes in Your Mouth\\", \\"High Speed Dirt\\", and \\"Psychotron\\"...excellent strange lyrics in every song and also great hard heavy metal riffs. \\"This Was My Life\\" is my favourute song in this album. Dave Mustaine's voice is very deep and he can do the song very good. \\"Foreclose of a Dream\\" has quite peaceful moments too but this is quite little.Stars: Sweating Bullets, Symphony of Destruction, Ashes in Your Mouth, Skin 'o My Teeth"},{"rating":"2","title":"another great Megadeth album","review":"I've been a big Megadeth fan since KIMB, have seen Mustaine in concert, and own all of the Megadeth releases to date (as of 2006. The only Remaster version I have is of MD45, of which I have the original version and the remaster.)Countdown is one of my favorites, rivialing the first 3 releases of KIMB, Peace, and So Far. It's a heavy metal album, but the songs also stick in your head and have catchy choruses and riffs. All in all another stellar CD from the Mustaine crew. I give it 4 stars because it's not quite up to par with KIMB or Peace Sells but it's still great. It's in my top 5 Megadeths for sure. Standout tracks include Skin of My Teeth, Symphony of Destruction, Foreclosure of a Dream, Sweating Bullets, and High Speed Dirt. I can listen to this CD from start to finish without skipping a track. If you are into Megadeth, this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megadeth Rocks!","review":"\\"Countdown to Extinction\\" is one of the best Megadeth albums ever, with Cryptic Writings in a close second. From the second this CD starts you are [taken] in by \\"Skin O' My Teeth\\" and \\"Symphony of Destruction\\". But in my opinion the best song is \\"This was my Life\\" with a mixture of great lyrics and burning guitar and bass riffs thanks to Dave Mustaine and Dave Ellefson. Also the little monologue in \\"Captive Honour\\" is awesome.This Cd blows any Metallica album away and is a must buy for any Megadeth fan. So my advice is BUY THIS CD! Peace Out."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Megadeth album.","review":"First off I'll admit I'm no Megadeth expert. I've only owned three albums. I know a handful of random singles. This is the only album I ever kept. It's the catchiest and best of what I've heard. I'm sure many fans disagree about which is the best album. I think this is no doubt their most popular album, and there's usually a reason for that. Dare I call it Megadeth's \\"black album\\". It's front-to-back kick ass. Most every songs is heavy heaven, but the title track alone is classic enough to own this. It's cheap used. Any metalhead should have gotten this many years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Megadeth","review":"I love this Album. Have been listening to them since they first came out many years ago and was happy for the remastered album. I could listen to this over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"18 Years","review":"I bought the \\"Countdown\\" cassette tape at 12 years old in 92. It's definitely aged well. It's heavy as hell but has some hooks and is listenable to the average joe. This is the last masterpiece created by Megadeth. Pick this one up instead of \\"Endgame\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd!","review":"This cd I believe is one of their best albums ever! I give all A+'s to each of the songs, especially Countdown to Extinction (title track). It's a really good song! After all, it reminded me alot of Metallica's self titled album that was released in 1991."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album (one of the best ever)","review":"I miss the sound of \\"Rust In Peace\\" and \\"Peace Sells\\", but megadeth is gotta move on. Countdown is one of the finest metal albums out there, by far better than Metallica's self-titled. Songs like \\"Skin Of My Teeth,\\" \\"Psychotron,\\" and specially the last track prove that Megadeth still rocks hard. The over production on the album though kills a little the aggresion. If you don't believe this tunes are as good as RIP or PS... Listen to them live and you'll be convinced. Highlight: The tittle track, it may not be that heavy but the melody in the song is one of the bests ever in this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of my favorite CD's.","review":"This hard crashing, head banging CD is always one of the first CD in the player when it comes time to rock the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"What is this.....?\\"","review":"O.K. When I heard that Dave was going to remaster/re-release the Megadeth back catalog I got real excited. I still believe that this album is a true masterpiece, but when I bought the 2004 remaster/remixed version I was MORTIFIED!!!! What was Dave thinking when he decided to remix it. All it needed was to be beefed up just a little, but he went to great extremes to ruin it. I know Megadeth fans were pretty pissed about this, but the one thing I did remember is that the first time I heard Countdown... when it was release in 1992 it gave me chills........period! I have regrets about buying all the remasters at once.......BIG MISTAKE!!! So in closing I went back and found the original versions of So Far...So Good...So What!, Rust in Peace, and of course Countdown to Extinction, and yes Capitol Punishment...The Megadeth Years.

This book is meant as an alegorical statement of the experience of loss and defeat by \\"outsiders\\" so dominant in Arab consciousness, so it shouldn't really be read as a historical novel. But there is something disappointing about the lack of nuance in character development and depth in the story it tells (in fact, it reads a bit like an adolescent novel). It's too bad, because Ashour is a lyrical writer and the subject is a serious one. If you are looking for some serious fiction by women writers from the Arab world, I strongly recommend Huda Barakat and Sahar Khalifeh (Wild Thorns is a classic about why people in Palestine resort to violence even when they abhor it in principle)."},{"rating":"2","title":"None Better","review":"A perfect mix for this wonderful singer /songwriter/master guitar player.

It ends up being silly, and can't escape its cheapness. The DVD is poor. The picture is below average. The sound in mono is a little muffled, but that's because of the age and budget of the film.

I read an average of about 20 400 page plus books a year and this book isn't even on the list of good ones I've read. The story has absolutely no point and plot and is probably another way for Annie to make a quick buck. I could not put this book down because I wanted the nightmare to finish. Who cares if you collected rocks and labeled them. If you have enough time to do that you have no life. Plus your going to write peices of junk like 'An American Childhood'. If you can't sing then don't sing, if you can't write then don't write. Leave it up to the experts Annie, you can't write."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Gave Me a New Experience","review":"Never before have I actually woken up the next morning with the book on my face."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a childhood memory and a future refernece for me!","review":"Since this was a required reading for Ramapo High I was forced to read this book. The first time I looked at the book I stood in awe. This was a long book for me ( well for the summer ) and I was totally discouraged. But as I started reading the book I realized that Dillard had so many experience like mine and had experinces that I wished to have but didn't. This is a wonderful book and I recommmend it to anyone young or old to read"},{"rating":"1","title":"An American Childhood","review":"As a child who grew up in Pittsburgh, Pa during the timeframe of the book. I was expecting something along the lines of \\"In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash\\". Instead I got a self indulgent muse of a pampered life that did not embrace working class Pittsburgh of the 50's and 60's. A great let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Dillard is a good writer, but I could barely finish it.","review":"I had to read this book, as an assignment. I found it extremely boring. I could barely finish it. I think Anne Dillard is a really great author, with a large vocabulary, but I think the story would be more entertaining if it was less descriptive of unimportant details. Maybe she should try writing fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Escape from a Coma","review":"I am reading this book for a graduate English class, and I find it hard to stay awake long enough to finish a chapter. As others have stated, the author uses a pretentious, overly descriptive writing style to describe increasingly mundane experiences such as reading a textbook or drawing her baseball mitt. The lack of action in this memoir would lead me to believe Dillard spent the majority of her life in a coma. For someone who normally finishes 300 page books in one or two days, I found this book a slog."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Childhood","review":"An American Childhood by Annie Dillard is a good book with many vivid details. It takes pictures of Pittsburg and gives them to the reader and it is given in so high quality. This biography is the first biography of a person which I have enjoyed and after thsi book being such a good read, I am going to continue reading Dillard's books to see if they are as good as htis book. I recommend this book to all and I think you should read it.Well, this book content is pretty much self-explainatory; it is a biorgraphy but unlike other biographies, it is very exciting and took me through Dillard's life, showing me what she did though the details and scenery that she gives. There isn't much else to tell you about this book. Just read it and enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"take me back","review":"An American Childhood, will seem slow and cumbersome to some. To me, it was a recollection of my growing up years well written. It is a memory of a time irretrievable, I am sure; a time when a child could run through the neighborhood at night in complete safety while all the while thinking it a clandestine adventure. Annie Dillard perfectly captures the mundane excitement of growing up in a safe American neighborhood that unfortunately may have disappeared forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dillard rambles on and on about the painfully mundane.","review":"This collection of literary snapshots from Dillard's childhood is made up of short passages that spotlight and explain her inner life, as well as the curious activities in which she engaged as a child. The book is filled with glorified, painstaking explanations and descriptions of the mundane. At times, it became difficult to trudge through certain parts of the book. Forced to read at least fifteen pages dedicated to rocks and minerals, I felt like a fifth grader studying a never-ending earth science assignment. Although some of her vignettes were interesting and insightful, too many were unnecessary and boringly specific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who in their right mind would buy this book?--Besides for school.","review":"This book gets 5/5 for literary technique. Great use of literary devices and highly descriptive in nature. It is as if you are reliving the character's moment in the past. However, this gets a 1/5 for enjoyable read. There is absolutely no plot. I have read journal style novels and they are far superior to this novel. You just jump from page to page without purpose or guidance. It is like walking in a dark tunnel, blind-folded, and praying that there is no oncoming-train heading your way. I bought it for IB English :(. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring book -It fatigued me!","review":"I had to read this book for a reading group. I had tried several years ago to listen to it on audio-tape, but hated it then. At that time I attibuted its tedium to the reader. It wasn't the reader's fault, it's the book!! It's dull and says little. I agree with several of the earlier reviewers that it lacked cohesion and interest. I must admit that I never finished the book - after l50 pages of extreme boredom, I gave up. (I was beginning to think I lost my love for books-- I started another novel soon after and found that I could get absorbed easily.) I only wish Amazon let me give it zero stars. My heart goes out to that high schooler. Couldn't his teacher have found something better? I'm around the same age as the author, I should've identified in some way, but found it as dull as the high school student did. The other reviewers were very generous with their stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book is possibly the worst piece of literature that I have ever read in my lifetime. I do realize that the book is an autobiography and is by no means meant to be an adventure fiction novel. However, if you are going to write about your life, please do something interesting. Nobody wants to hear about an average person leading an average life with no specific events to back it up. Dillard tries to make her life seem interesting by filling the book with useless descriptions and seemingly random transitions. I will keep this book by my bed simply because if I am having trouble sleeping, it will put me right out.Here is a quote to show exactly how disjointed the writing is.\\"I was hoping the streets would fill and I could shoot my cap gun at people instead of at mere sparrows. My project was to ride my swing all around, over the top. I bounced a ball against the house...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"this book sucks","review":"I am currently reading this book for AP English, and i have NEVER read a book as boring as this one. the author drones on and on and on about the stupidest things. for example, there's this 10 page section about her stupid rock collection. of all things to write about... A ROCK COLLECTION??? i can't read more than a couple pages of this book at a time; if i do, i start dozing off. the only reason to waste your money on this book is if you need a good nap. I guarantee reading a couple pages of this book is better than any sleeping pill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lexicon","review":"I don't relate at all to this \\"American Childhood.\\" The author uses vocabulary that shows how many obtuse words she knows. This is not effective communication. I am well educated and would still have to look up many words which interrupts the flow of her story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Descriptive and pointless","review":"If I didn't have to read this for an assignment, It would have been placed on the shelf to eternally collect dust. The only time it would be picked up is to be dusted off and placed back. The scenes were extremely detailed. I did not enjoy reading numerous pages describing a rock collection, or descriptive ideas of what a library looks like to a child. It was a very boring book, I used it to put me to sleep at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent value for the money","review":"The seller shipment was a little slow.

I do not believe that all of the songs on these discs are so good that they deserve a top rating (or even a mediocre rating, for that matter), but most of them are what you'd expect: Elvis' beautiful voice and great songs accompanied by talented musicians. It is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have collection for all fans","review":"This is a great 2 cd collection of some of his best movie songs. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars though is for the fact that some of the songs are really kinda corny, but I suppose they fit into the film content. But seeing as I haven't seen many of these movies, I can't really comment. But it is a fun album, and the songs for the most part, are very enjoyable. Plus all the songs have been digitally remastered, which is a plus. The 24 page booklet is also a wonderful addition. It includes tons of photos and a wealth of information about Elvis and his movies. This really is a necessity for all true Elvis fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Command Performances","review":"Well we all know Elvis could sing anything and make it sound good. This compilation is proof. Though there are some great songs on this set there are as many forgettable. I have to admit I bought it as soon as it hit the shelf but I am avid. I would not suggest this as a starter kit.I hope RCA does a follow up to this compilation for there are songs I would have voted for in favor of some that were left off.Pocketful Of Rainbows from G.I. Blues is a much better song than Shoppin Around.King Of The Whole Wide World is a great tune until you cut off the Boots Randolph sax solo at the end as RCA has chosen to do so here.C'mon Everybody should have been included for the Viva Las Vegas ditties.And I don't care what anybody says Do The Clam from the movie Girl Happy is one of the most embarrasing songs in Elvis' catalog. Do Not Disturb would have been a much better choice. It is a very romantic ballad suited for candlelight and lovemaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is awful","review":"I guess if you're looking for the kind of Christmas sound that captures the experience of waiting in the lounge at the Honolulu Airport on December 24th then this is the album for YOU!

There's really nothing remarkable about it at all. The caption on the back describes this film as a \\"descent into madness\\". A woman gets hooked on cognac and valium, has an affair with a doctor, gets depressed and has to deal with her witchy in-laws. She gets really neurotic and is afraid to be alone sometimes. Big deal. The only outstanding aspect of the film is the leading lady's performance, which is occasionally really creepy.And there isn't anything subtle or disturbing about it. It's just what I've described. I could tell this was made for TV. More like an ABC school special than a foreign dementia film.

I was hooked from the very beginning, but landed when Mr. Vampire-Lite, Chris enters the world of the Doman. I won't ruin the tale for those who like fine dialog, character and pacing--and puns. I would suggest, however, that the story not only evokes all of the Mafia tales of getting out by getting back in again, but also Vampires Meet Rambo or Vampires meet Indiana Jones. And I would caution the reader not to careen through the book as the break-neck pacing invites because therein lies the pity of missing a subtle nuance that will leave you going \\"what the--\\" in the end.

They both love it, but be aware that the ear piece it REALLY loud, so if the kids aren't careful it will hurt their ears. I really scored on this one with the cheap price and free shipping.
