There's not much gray area in his style and tone, so you don't find a lot of ambivalence in his readers. Personally, I am charmed by his quick wit, dry humor, and bizarre life. His books are never boring, and while they are memoirs, they aren't self-aggrandizing nor self-pitying. I enjoyed \\"Dry\\" thoroughly and look forward to more from this talented -- albeit disaster prone -- writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny","review":"This is a collection of mildly interesting stories that become grating very quickly. Burroughs comes across not only as self-absorbed, but also self-righteous. David Sedaris is much funnier and much less cynical. Couldn't make it through 2 full discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"augusten is the funniest, most interesting man alive!","review":"This is a great book. I am a huge fan of augusten burroughs. This book was so funny. I find myself forcing my friends and family to read some of my favorite stories! Buy this book! And all of his other books! Do it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phoning It In","review":"I've read all of Augusten Burroughs' books and enjoyed watching his maturation as a writer. From \\"Sellevision,\\" to \\"Running with Scissors,\\" (a story that likely could not withstand the scrutiny James Frey was subjected to), to \\"Dry,\\" and \\"Magical Thinking\\" his writing got better and better. And then this. \\"Possible Side Effects\\" reads like a collection that was slapped together at the 11th hour of yet another extended deadline. The essays are too cute, too easy and generally not very well developed. Maybe Mr. Burroughs should spend a little less time resting on his laurels and more time developing his craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Sedaris Lite with a splash of bitters.","review":"Burroughs is a funny observationist with a snarky view of the world that is filtered through a pretty odd background (as anyone familiar with RUNNING WITH SCISSORS might know).Though I find his humorous take on things entertaining about 98% of the time, sometimes his style gets a bit tiresome. If he were a cocktail, I'd call him David Sedaris lite with a splash of bitters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead On Arrival","review":"Augusten Burroughs is clearly out of material and his talent for tall tales is in a death spiral. As another review mentions, this collection of stories appear to the rejects from past efforts. While reading this I can imagine the same content being typed by a 13 year old who is out to try to impress his audience with tales of forced juxtaposition and icon shattering. I am embarrassed for St. Martin's Press and can only assume that they are stuck in a contract with Mr. Burroughs and that is why they published this future pulp.I liked Sellevision and elements of RWS and while I do not expect Updike when I open Burroughs, I do expect not to be preoccupied with the question of whether or not I can return this book. If you want a good summer book, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been some time since I've read something like this.","review":"For a book of short stories, especially from Burroughs, it was a complete disaster and too too too hard to finish. But I finally made it through hoping there would be one story that would merit reading it. There wasn't. What puzzled me more was not only was it slightly depressing, but there was little to no direction in the organization of the stories. It becomes clear, if a reader hasn't already established it, that Burroughs had a troubled life; and all I can say is, \\"who hasn't?\\" I also would like to point out that it's one thing to make fun of yourself, but it became clear that Burroughs really isn't someone you'd want to, well, even let in your home. I just couldn't endear myself to his person, writing, or wit like I've been able to in his past books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possible Side Effects","review":"I enjoy his books but disagree that he is one of America's funniest people. His books are entertaining, and I have read all of them. He can be over the top with some of his topics, but overall a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed fan","review":"i'm a big fan of augusten burroughs but i can hardly get through this book. it's just not really all that funny - certainly not as clever as his fans would expect. the stories seem really random and forced - almost as if he was ordered by his publisher to crank out another winner but he just didn't really feel like it. he lost his edge on this one. hope he gets it back. he's no sedaris on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Augusten Burroughs, Our Hero","review":"Possible Side EffectsI've read every book of Augusten's and thoroughly enjoyed this one as much as the rest. Burroughs has given everyone living a tragicomedy hope that one day you can be functionally dysfunctional. I haven't read a book of his where I didn't feel a wide variety of emotions. With Possible Side Effects, you're able to get yet another glimpse into the life of Augusten that shows you the up's, down's and in-betweens of real life.This is a book anyone could read and anyone could enjoy, short of the obvious types. If you've read anything by him, you shouldn't have to check reviews on the rest as you're already a fan and should buy everything he's written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by Augusten!!!","review":"Everything that Augusten Burroughs has written has been fabulous, and this book is no exception!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Unique","review":"Possible Side Effects took me to places of hilarity and heart. It is a wonderful book and yet different than Mr. Burrough's others in that it gets closer to his real life than ever. Recommended most highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burroughs Has Lost the Magic","review":"Burroughs is definitely a one trick pony and the books are getting progressively worse. Running with Scissors was hilarious, although not really all that believable. Dry was my favorite and I enjoyed it regardless of how true the stories are. But Possible Side Effects is just not funny. I'm not even sure he thinks he's funny or even cares. And the personal facts he reveals such as blowing his nose on his shirt and throwing empty food cartons on the floor is flat out disgusting. I realized I have no interest in what a person has to say that has no regard for personal hygiene. I imagine he must have some sort of mental illness such as hoarding all though I really am not interested. I met Burroughs at a book signing in San Francisco and he looked dirty. Get some help and some writing advice from James Frey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillariously funny","review":"Great book, easy read and very funny. Augusten really milks his crazy family and chaotic life, and I'm glad he sees the humor behind the madness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Boring and Whiny","review":"There are people who tell stories and you are engaged and interested not always because of the content, but because of their delivery as well. Augusten Burroughs left me wanting better of both. Maybe it was b/c I listened to this as an audiobook... but I mostly found Possible Side Effects a book full of complaining disguised as a bunch of boring stories. I actually caught myself rolling my eyes a few times! I admit, I didn't get all the way through the book - I was so annoyed I just bailed a few chapters from the end.Just for background - I LOVED Running with Scissors when I read it years ago. I think he used up all his good material in that fascinating memoir. I loved it so much I picked up Sellevision which I gave about 2 chapters and shut it permanently - also annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this kind of writing","review":"I had a bad nosebleed in a plane once too, so I feel for Augustan! In my case, I was just a small kid though and it stopped bleeding soon and wasn't as bad and embarrassing as his.What a witty and hilarious writer. I'm amazed by the brilliantly witty and funny way he expresses and writes down everything. I was completely taken with this book right from the start with grandma and the tooth fairy and I just couldn't stop snickering as I turned the pages and passed from story to story. An effortless, endearing, and addictively funny read. I read it in just 3 days, which must be a record for me since I only have an hour or two in the evenings to relax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Mr Burroughs","review":"Unfortunately, \\"Possible Side Effects\\" has threatened Mr Burroughs' throne in the Number 2 spot on my list of favorite authors. I found this book seriously wanting. It is unlike all his other books, and even though I screamed when I saw the cover at the book store (not knowing Augusten was releasing another book), I was disappointed at its finish.Apologetically, I give this book 2 stars... which is bad for me- I usually enjoy just about everything.Sorry Augusten. I'd still like to be your friend some day."},{"rating":"2","title":"so great!","review":"warning: do not read in a public place unless you're comfortable with getting stared at for laughing by yourself like a maniac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it - hilarious","review":"For English class this last year, we were told to pick out the memoir of our choice and read it. I went to the library searching for books and saw this one. Well, the only reason I chose this one was because I liked the cover (I know, I know). Anyway, I got home and started reading it and I loved it! Never before have I laughed out loud so many times while reading a book. It's a great collection of stories and I really recommend it. It is very funny. I also read Running With Scissors, but I enjoyed this book much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring stories","review":"I have read all of Mr. Burroughs' books, and have enjoyed them. That is, until I sat down to read this book of short tales. I found little of interest to keep my attention, and after 4 or 5 stories, put it aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Didn't Laugh Once","review":"I Didn't Laugh Once - not once! As others have said, I couldn't get through the first 4 stories. All I kept thinking was, \\"This guy wishes he was, and is trying to be, David Sedaris.\\" He is NOT David Sedaris or Amy for that matter, and I'm huge fans of both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing wrong with waiting for paperback","review":"No need to rush out and buy this one. Burroughs is Running on Empty with these stories that don't measure up to his previous work. There is little that can be said for the organization of the entire book, much less the individual chapters themselves.Nevertheless, there are moments where you will be tempted to laugh out loud. I'm a big fan, but this effort was a disappointment. I would recommend the NYTimes review, which says it all better than me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and stupid","review":"Out of fairness, I should tell you that I didn't listen to the whole audiobook. I got about 1/2 way though the first CD and just couldn't stand it anymore. What I heard was boring and extremely slow moving. It's read like a \\"see spot run\\" story for children, which makes the boring storyline even more boring and I found it to be a bit insulting. I think an audio book of names and nummbers in the phone book would be more exciting. Maybe it gets better as it goes along, but I am not willing to endure any more to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I love this guy's writing style. Very entertaining, comfortable reading, very funny. I just hope some editor does not screw up his conversational writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with P Smith","review":"I was so looking forward to this book after having read Dry, Running With Scissors, and Magical Thinking. But after having struggled through the first 3 chapters, waiting for the book to be like his others, I think I'll put it down and move on to The Ride of Our Lives by Mike Leonard. I'm only giving it one star, two at the most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Man's David Sedaris","review":"This book proves that neurotic and gay does not necessarily equal funny. It doesn't hurt, but some cleverness is required as well. This book doesn't have much cleverness. It is the first book by this guy that I have read and I am going to read Running With Scissors now because it must have been pretty good if it was good enough to get this mediocre book published as a side effect.There are a couple really good stories buried towards the end like the one with \\"Sommer\\" in the title which was good but not funny and \\"What's In a Name\\" which I laughed out loud at. His best stories seem to be written about his family and childhood, but most of the stories in this book are obsessive-gay-man-obsessing stories which come off flat and bloggy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possible Side Effect: Stitch in side from laughing so hard","review":"Augusten Burroughs is that wonderfully witty guy in the cubicle behind the filing cabinet who sends you snarky e-mails about your co-worker's shoes and your boss' receding hairline. Oh, how I wish I knew this guy in person! Fortunately, with \\"Possible Side Effects\\" I can pretend for a while that he is on my speed dial.\\"Side Effects\\" is another collection of stories of dysfunctional relationships, love affairs gone awry, childhood horror stories, and more tales of life in the big city. Though he's covered much of this same ground before, the essays are never repetitive or boring; instead, I grow to love Burroughs more and more as he reveals ever-deeper layers of himself, his insecurities, and his quirks and foibles. I laughed, even as I hated myself for laughing. But that's what makes it so great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny. Sad. Read It.","review":"It takes a lot for a book to make me laugh out loud -- not only did this one make me snort, it also squeezed my gut & made me want to cry.I'm a big Burroughs fan; I enjoyed this more than Magical Thinking. Can't wait for another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possible Side Effects","review":"I found this book to be yet another brilliant addition to my Augusten Burroghs collection.

It is equal parts funny, sad, and ubeilivable. Augusten is very matter-of-fact about the valleys in his lfe, and it's refreshing to see that an author can do that without having to jazz it up, he just let's the experiences stand on their own.I did enjoy Dry and Running with Scissors better, if you are a first time reader of Burroughs' work, I would suggest reading one of the earlier titles first. Overall, Possible Side effects is another solid book by Burroughs, but at times lacks the \\"Wow\\" or shock factor that w as present in his earlier works."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"This book is awesome!! It will make you laugh out loud and have you sharing stories with your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possible Side Effects","review":"Excellent book! Loved everything that I have read by Augusten so far. Not as great as Running with Scissors, but still a really good book that held my interest the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaking Highlarious","review":"Augusten Burroughs has a way of making mundane events laughable. Possible Side Effects has no plot. It's a series of recollections, but it's his cynical/naive/self destructive point of view that makes the work even more addictive than a continuous storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond my expectations!","review":"I ordered a used copy of Barbara Kafka's book on roasting and was thrilled with what I received.

Yes, you get smoke - I recommend opening a window and turning on a fan. Yes, the pan gets caked with stuff, but deglazing gets it clean (or use a non-stick pan and clean-up will take two minutes).

The reader (an unknown man) does a good job in reading, but has a voice that will knock you out (asleep that is, not a good thing while listening and driving). I have yet to get all the way through. This is not recommended unless you have insomnia and are listening at home. The book urges the reader to pray, covering various experiential reasons to do so (some Biblical references are thrown in, but not enought to my liking, oh well). Pass this one by, there are better audio books out there. Run time: 90 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected delight","review":"I'm really digging this album and I need to thank Warren for introducing this to me. This is mainly instrumental music that combines elements of jazz, rock, and pop with a modern twist. There are some serious grooves laid out on this disc, lots of melody, and the musicianship and writing are top-notch. Three songs have vocals, sung in Spanish, but only on \\"Sin Retorno\\" are they through the whole song. The vocals only accent the other two songs. From what I understand, Tempano started out in the late 70's as a prog group, in the 80's they changed course and played pop, laid dormant in the 90's, and it was this release where they went back to their roots. I'm glad they did, as this is such a rewarding and exciting disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skins For Speed","review":"I definitely see so much with customization for video game systems, in the word of skins. There are just so many different kinds of skins to play around with reflecting one and the personality. This skin reflecting the game Sonic Riders for the Nintendo Gamecube gives a unique detail based on the display box of Sonic and company, battling it out for who is the fastest on the air boards. The display is very great for die hard Sonic fans, with a sense of the thrill of speed. I thought this skin looked very delightful, and is a great way to make any Sonic fans' Gamecube look fast and furious.Price: B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Stravinsky","review":"I listened to the vinyl version of this recording as a kid, and along with Schoenberg's string trio, it was basically my introduction to 20th century music. I have to say I usually do not have the stomach for the sustained tension in serial composers longer orchestral works. I respect them as composers and greatly enjoy a disc of Berg/Schoenberg/Webern piano music I have, but really have a difficult time with works such as this Berg and Schoenberg's piano concerto. (Although the Schoenberg string trio is an all-time favorite and I enjoy practically any other kind of 20th century music.) It is difficult to discern any kind of shape in the Berg concerto. That Bach chorale is nice, but everything surrounding it is quite unintelligible to me.To get to the point, I think the average listener would find the Stravinsky far more accessible and enjoyable. It is basically an all-around well crafted piece and each movement is very exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Guitar Player","review":"If you like Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Eric Gales, Johnny Winter or Robin Trower, you'll definitely like this guy! He's right out of that school, and he has some chops! Standout cuts include; \\"day of dreams\\", 'Simplify your vision\\", \\"stones in my passway\\", \\"skank\\", but all the cuts are good! Lopez has mastered the use of the Wah pedal, and has that powerful Texas player presence. Good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Slinger's Delight.","review":"Out of all the Lance Lopez albums this one is my favourite because it's more restrained than his others.There is plenty here for guitarists to sink their teeth into guitar wise, the songs though are pretty simple and the lyrics are straight forward but it all seems to collectively work together in it's own funky way.So groove out baby and simplify your vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont do it","review":"dont even waist ur time....this movie ( if u could call it that ) is a c movie...worst than the Italian westerns from the 70's...one girl is suppose to b a recovering crack add. and i think she is on crack while filming this movie....it didnt even show any boob..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this movie.","review":"I am sorry, but this movie was horrible.

This book, which featured an adventure/romance between government agents Navarro Breed and Elizabeth Lawrence (aka Bethany wind), simply fell flat. I couldn't even finish it.For me, the dialogue killed this novel. At the beginning, the reader was given stilted lectures on the history of the native American uprisings in the 1880s. This information was interesting, but could have been worked into the story more gracefully.Then the characters' speech to each other just didn't ring true. They sounded too modern and almost wooden - rather like the dialogue in a bad TV movie. I didn't sense any chemistry between the main characters and their attachment to one another didn't feel real.I may give Janelle Taylor another chance, but this book is certainly one to avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot but dialogue was a disaster.","review":"This was the worst romance novel I've read so far.

Then, it goes through each gull species and all of its plumages, including the months you might expect to see them in that plumage. It ends by discussing the various hybrids. If you ever hope to get beyond referring to gulls as \\"gull sp.,\\" this book will do it. When you hear other birders refer to \\"the gull bible,\\" this is it!!!

She unwillingly becomes a cheerleader with her friend Rina \\"it was one of the few things Cass never did\\", and one night meets Rogerson. Rogerson is unlike any boy she's ever met and as she spends more and more time with him she is introduced to new things and her whole way of life changes. Everything seems perfect until one night a dark side of Rogerson shows and the entire story shifts gears. I was drawn to this book just after reading the first few pages and after that I couldn't put it down, her style of writing just makes you want to keep reading. The story is filled with unexpected twists, fighting, love, and drugs, some things that most teens can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamland","review":"This book reveals situations that teenage girls go through everyday but aren't talked about.Caitlin celebrates her birthday among a frantic household because of her sisters sudden runaway from home, leaving behind plans to go to Yale, a sad mother, dissapointed father and a sister trying to fill in her gap.Caitlin meets Rogerson, the green-eyed bad boy that would change her life forever.

Caitlan begins making questionable choices for herself in order to separate her own identity from her sisters. In order to hide the pain from an abusive relationship, Caitlan falls into a distant, dream like state, thanks to the help of marijuana and self-isolation from those who truly love for her.This book is a close up, realistic look at a teenager's inner feelings. The isolation and pressure that can be felt in a family, as well as, the twisting, painful hold that love can create is woven into this story so well that the reader may feel the hurt the same as the characters. This is a well written, gripping novel that deserves to be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!","review":"WOW! Thats all i have to say. this is one of the most wondeful books ever.

This novel is so true that I think every girl and guy should read it just to see what this world is going through now with abusive relationships.

The problem is learning when to get out when the person you love turns out to be the person you've come to fear. The protagonist of the novel unexpectedly becomes the victim of an abusive relationship and it is her own struggle with this that makes this novel different.

Because I read love stories most of all genres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamland","review":"I could not put this book down! Very well written, money well spent. I suggest buying this book, it was great if you ask me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I loved this book before i got it and now i have it and i love it even more and now i can read it anytime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All about life","review":"Dreamland by Shara Dessen is about a girl named Caitlin. The day of her 16th brithday her sister Cass runs away. No one knows why but Caitlin was left with a journal that she gave her. The journal she gave her was for her write her dreams in. Caitlin had to see for herself what her sister had gone through and now knows why her sister left. I enjoyed reading this book. It was a type of book that deals with teenagers and what they are going through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickly Depressing","review":"I can't make myself like this book. At first, I thought it sounded good. From the back, I thought it might possibly be a fantasy novel. Not even close. Some of the characters are interesting, but not a heck of a lot of them. The plot is so depressing it left me feeling mildly sick afterwards. I really liked This Lullaby by the same author, but Dreamland just makes me feel like the whole world is being sucked into a pit of despair and strife.Dreamland is about Caitlin, a teenager who meets Rogerson. Rogerson seems like a kind, mysterious boyfriend. At first. The next thing Caitlin knows she has to wear long sleeves and pants all the time to cover her bruises.I suppose this book is a clear window into abusive relationships and why people stay in them, but if you are just looking for a good read, well... Let's just say that if you like depressing books about drugs and abusive boyfriends, you might like this story. If you don't fall into those categories, stay clear of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamland","review":"What can I say about this book? I went into dreamland after reading a few pages.It was the most boring book I never read. I actually did try to read it. I tried multiple times. I couldn't get into it, I didn't get it, I didn't follow, I didn't feel any emotion. There was so much telling and I was bored out of my brains.However, all my friends have given this book high reviews, so it's probably just me and you should read this book anyways, just because it's a Dessen book. She's usually got pretty great books. So, yeah.If you like her, check the book out despite this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake up, Caitlin.","review":"When Cass leaves after being accepted to Yale and living what is described as a perfect life, Caitlin is left to pick up the pieces. Her mother has always fawned over Cass and now it's Caitlin's turn. She's encouraged to join the cheerleading squad she has no interest in and soon meets up with Rogerson, an abusive drug addict who soon has her flunking out, drinking and drugging and getting knocked around. I don't think the author did a good job making the reader understand why Caitlin stayed in the relationship as long as she did. And, though I understand the mother had to be portrayed as someone who would needle until someone would want to run away, the mother irritated the snot out of me. When Caitlin did think her mom had finally figured out her secret and was going to confront her, the mother was simply confronting Caitlin on the lack of color she had been wearing in her wardrobe. Not much of a plot here. Can't say as I enjoyed the book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked beyond what I thought possible","review":"So boring to start off with, I can't believe I actually read the entire book. A complete waste of my time. Also her boyfriend starts beating her and she stays with him, and doesn't tell anybody about it. It personally frustrated the crap out of me because all I could think of is that I would never allow a guy to do that to me. The first time \\"Rogerson\\" slapped her I would have hit him in his goodies so hard he wouldn't have known what hit him. So if your not getting into the deep meaning of the entire story line, its pretty much a load of frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downland","review":"This book was a major downer. I thought it was going to be a light fantasy about dreams. There was nothing dream like about this book. It was horribly depressing. The climax was staged; I mean how often does a cop show up and arrest the abuser in the act of smacking his girlfriend around out in public? The conclusion isn't much better...though I don't remember too many details...I started skimming in the last three quarters of the book...it was very boring and gloomy. I couldn't wait to finish it. Two types of books spawn me to write my own; really fantastic novels and really horrendous ones...Dreamland was the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable","review":"I do not understand the good reviews for this book. I don't see the motivation for the main character to stay with her abusive boyfriend. He is never really very nice to her nor is he charming or sympathetic in anyway. All we know about him is that he is a drug dealer who has a good memory for trivia and a father who hits him. Then when he starts hitting her, there is no real reason for her to stay with him since he is not nice or interesting at all even before he becomes abusive. It is also hard to believe that a formerly committed student who did not do drugs would suddenly not care about her studies and suddenly decide to watch bad television in an old farmhouse and get stoned all day. The author failed to make me care about a single character."},{"rating":"1","title":"kibri","review":"i bought the book for my daughter. i always let her read about the book before i order it, but this time she was dissappointed. She said the book is boring and she didnt like the fact that it was based on a sister whom was nearly grown & college aged who ran away. Her input was why are the so focused on the sister running away? WHO CARES SHE ALMOST GROWN, she states the story drags on & on before any action happens"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"This book is Wonderful. From the first sentance, Sarah Dessen puts you in her spell. It is whimsical and gut-wrenchingly scary at the same time. If you haven't read it, do. It will be worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamland","review":"Caitlin's sister has just run away. Caitlin can't believe Cass would do something like that. She needed her.Then Caitlin meets Rogerson...who is popular, rich,and a troublemaker. Their relationship starts off great until Rogerson starts hitting her. Caitlin seperates herself from her family and friends while she goes off into her own little dreamland.I really enjoyed Dreamland. It posessed everything I like. Anyone who has read Sarah Dessen's books before will love Dreamland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving tale for girls my age","review":"Wow. I bought this book at a used bookstore four years ago. I had started to read it but thought it was boring and never went back to reading it.Two days ago, I picked it out of my bookshelf and tried to read it again. I finished it yesterday. This book was very moving, a girl named Caitlin, who's sister runs away. Caitlin meets the drug dealer named Rogerson and falls for him instantly. Then he gets her addicted to pot. Typical druggy tale of a lost teenager right?Well, then Rogerson starts to beat Caitlin. Every time she's late, doesn't show up, or for no specific reason. The worst part is she puts up with it. She doesn't tell anyone and continues to have him beat her. My heart would sink every time I read about her getting beat up by him.I think this is one of Sarah Dessen's best books and tells a story that a lot of teenagers are going through to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Won't Want to Wake Up!","review":"This is absolutely fabulous. It completely sucks you in till you're ready to cry right along with Caitlyn as she deals with the conflict and pulls of her suddenly altered life. I've never before read anything that dealt with abusive relationships like that and I can totally understand and relate to ever decision she had to make and why she did what she did. Took me like a day to read because I couldn't put it down. If you're a teen, (even a boy), you need to read this.Spend some time in Dreamland...you won't want to wake up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dessen Fails To Impress","review":"As a big fan of Sarah Dessen, I bought this book eagerly, hoping for a light but enjoyable teen girl story. I was disappointed.Dessen tells the story of Caitlin, a high school student whose older sister, Cassandra, has been the prettier, smarter, and more talented daughter her entire life. With Cassandra poised to leave for Yale, Caitlin hopes to step out of her shadow. But Cassandra runs away the night before Caitlin's birthday, leaving her family bewildered and sending them on a downward spiral of depression and anxiety.The premise, though clich��d, is interesting, and where Dessen goes wrong is the execution. Caitlin often sounds whiney and trite, and her decent into drug use and abuse is not very realistic. Even the various well written supporting characters cannot save this book. If you're looking for a good teenage depression book, try 'Speak' by Laurie Halse Anderson, or look into some of Dessen's lighter fare, like 'This Lullaby'."},{"rating":"1","title":"~Exspect the Unexspected~","review":"I was disappointed wasn't the best work of Sarah Dessen. I guess I exspected to much from her. Although it did have its moments I must say that. I kind of felt like I just wanted it to be over and that it was to dragged. That's just my opionion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entrapping","review":"Sarah Dessen writes this novel with poise, and perfect character development. Caitlin is an average teenager forced into cheerleading by her perky, popular best friend. One night at a keg party, Caitlin ditches a football player who is about to present her with his lettermans jacket for the rebellious, dreadlocked Rogerson. She forms a relationship with the mysterious teen, and as the reader, you, too, begin to fall in love with Rogerson as Caitlin does. When Rogerson, spurred by his fathers' own abuse, begins to hit Caitlin, you, like Caitlin, are torn between loving Rogerson as he was before and hating what he has become. The novel is beautifully written, and timed exceptionally.Sarah Dessen, by making you feel precisely as Caitlin does, draws you deep into Caitlin's world, falling into her downward spiral. The novel is difficult to put down, and will leave you thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"very realistic","review":"i like this book because it was written well and it was about real life experiences. dreamland was also funny and enjoyable because teens can really relate to everything the author writes about. it is a very valuable book, in my opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't stop reading it","review":"I just picked this book at random one day at the library, and I am so glad that I did. I couldnt stop reading it. I was so into the book, the story and the characters. I loved how the details were written out and how they characters have deep personalities. Rodgerson was my favorite character. Like many other people in these reviews say, you are *sposed* to not like him, but I felt so sorry for him. There were so many ways I could relate to both Caitlin and Rodgerson. I like how the book is more *real*.. I don't like books that have the perfect girl with the perfect guy and the whole thing.. This book had Caitlin, who was not her sister, she was trying to be accepted as who she was, and Rodgerson, who has the bad boy appeal, but then you get to see the sweet side too. I can't even describe why I like this book so much, but I HIGHLY recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"xxDreAmLanDxx","review":"Dreamland is about a teenager named Caitlin. On Caitlin's birthday her sister Cass runs away to live with her boyfriend. Due to her sister leaving, Caitlin's parents become so wrapped up in trying to locate her that they start to neglect Caitlin. When Caitlin joins cheerleading, her mom becomes more involved in her life which makes her want to continue with it even though she doesn't want to. One night she meets Rogerson and to Caitlin he is the only one that can make her forget about Cass missing. But when being with Rogerson is a larger issue than being without him, she must decide what to do with. Stay with him? Or leave him?I really liked this book because the problems that occur in the book could actually happen in real life and I think that was the whole point in the authors way of writing. I would recommend it to anyone who likes realistic fiction/dramatic books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamland","review":"Sarah Dessen did a great job with this book. It has real consequenses that people might be going through just like Caitlin. it was a moving story. Caitlins sister runs away from home and Caitlin feels that she has to takes things of her mum mind and she feels she needs to live a life like her sister. She becomes a chairleeder even though she hates it and joins clubs with her mum, she is put under stress. until Rogerson comes into her life. A gorgeos olived skin, dreadlocked, green eyed boy. Thats when she starts to change. She takes drugs and doesn't think much of school. Rogersons under stress too and takes it out on Caitlin, but she is to in love to do anything about it. It becomes a regular thing but caitlin doesnt tell anyone. Shes scared and vunreble to love. This book made me cry a number of times and feel alot for Caitlin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating once it got going","review":"Like some of Dessen's other novels, Dreamland finds struggle in the suburbs. This story involves a destructive relationship and I thought captures excellently the many dimensions of women, young or old, who are abused.Despite a meandering beginning, the story gripped me. Of books I've read recently, I would say only Kerry Cohen Hoffman's new release, Easy, pulled me in more quickly. (You just can't match Hoffmann.) Dreamland is on my shortlist of great teen-relationship reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!!","review":"I loved this book!! I picked it up and started reading it a little bit but then put it back down.. I went back to the library the next week and I got the book.. I was drawn to it.. I started not being able to put the book down.. I had to get past some of the begining to really get into it, but once I did, I got into the whole thing and couldn't put it down.. The book really related to a similar situation that I was in.. Except I never got hit, I just got the verbal abuse.. I knew what she felt like, because I did what she did, I hid everything, my body, what was going on, and I broke away from my friends.. I loved this book and I hope that every teenage girl reads it and gets a little insight on what can happen in a relationship like this and to look for warning signs in abusive boyfriends.. Everyone should read this, and I hope they do.. Everyone needs to know what 1 person can go through and what the effect that they can have on people's lives.. Highly recommended 5 stars!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A totally unforgettable, amazing book","review":"I don't understand how anyone could give this book less than five stars. It's a powerful, gut-wrenching story of a girl and her relationship with her abusive boyfriend. After reading the reviews, there won't be much suprise in the events that happen in this novel, but just to learn why she stays with him and even loves him is reason enough to read it.Rogerson, her boyfriend, almost seems like two completely different people by the end of the novel. The sweet, caring boyfriend at the beginning of the book and a monster by the end. When you finish reading the novel, you may even question if you yourself would be strong enough to get out of that kind of relationship.With her knack for describing details so vividly and her amazing character development, Sarah Dessen has become my favorite author. Anyone and everyone should read this book. It's not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a happy ending","review":"It's okay and has a lot of excitement and the judo lessons in the book is perhaps helpful but it has a few satisfying endings."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"My daughter's feet keep sliding out the front of the shoes. The size is just right but since the shoes are \\"elastic\\" they don't keep the feet in place.

Don't know why I waited so long to own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but NOT the best recording.","review":"This is a very good performance of this piece by Strauss, as you might expect from such a great orchestra and conductor, especially when produced by DG.However, one thing seems to be missing on this recording. That thing is presence! Listen to the vinyl LP digital recording that Karajan made for Deautshe Gramophon and the one thing that strikes you if you're using a decent sound system is the presence. You can hear the very air move and vibrate as the orchestra plays, and most especially when they pause.Well worth the purchase, nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"locking tweezer","review":"this item is not a toy! the item is a tool and a great addition to the other tools i use for my hobbyy , making small plastic airplane models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revlon Just Peachy Cream Blush Is Great","review":"The Just Peachy cream blush is great with my light complection and reddish hair.

The emotion Rostropovich conveys through the Dvorak concerto is immense. The Dvorak cello concerto is my favorite concerto of all...and I'm a violinist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated and over-blown","review":"Not only is this not the best Rostropovich version (try the ones with Boult or Khaikin) but it is not nearly as good as some more recent versions, such as Jean-Guilhen Queyras on Harmondia Mundi (with perfect balance between soloist and orchestra and a deeply poetic and powerful interpretation)or Hoelscher with Keilberth on Warner/Teldec (wonderfully executed). There is of course the classic version by Fournier with Szell and Casals with Szell. If you must have Rostropovich, get the Khaikin version with those wonderfully fruity Russian horns: he sounds so much better there than with Karajan whose orchestra is just overblown."},{"rating":"1","title":"try Feuermann's","review":"I first heard Feuermann's version, and then this one. I have to say there is no comparison. I can't say Rostropovich is a bad cellist, but he seems to have very different philosophy and style as Feuermann, and I just can't find his playing a treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rostropovich disappointed me","review":"I have heard different versions of Mr. Rostropovich playing the Dvorak cello concerto, over the years. I was looking forward, hopefully, to hearing him at his more eloquent, but this playing tho nice enough, was not \\"wonderful\\" for me. I shall keep searching for him, to carry me away happily."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only mix that matters is missing from this release","review":"\\"Freelove\\" was a huge club track for Depeche Mode in early 2002. The ONLY mix that got any play in the clubs was the \\"Deep Dish Freedom Mix\\" - by far the best of all the remixes of this song. Deep Dish even went so far as to make two versions of the mix (one for Europe and one for the U.S.) to promote to the clubs. Their stellar version of \\"Freelove\\" was a standout in the fact that it actually sampled DM's own \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" and in how it brought Dave Gahan's vocals out into the forefront. Unfortunately for Depeche Mode fans this mix has never been released.Without the Deep Dish mix the rest of this CD appeals only to the most hard-core fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Deep Dish remix???","review":"OK, so the Deep Dish remix of \\"Freelove\\" hit #1 on Billboard's dance chart AND just so happened to be one of the most slamming club tracks of the past year.... so where is it? Apparently DM are not fans of house music (??!?!) and did not authorize the commerical release of the Deep Dish mix. What a shame. I've never been a DM fan but would have actually bought a copy of this because Deep Dish is amazing and I missed my small window of opportunity to snag a promo-only 12\\" vinyl copy of it.

It cost me just over $500. to get it replaced by Inskip Nissan of RI (theives!). In the process, they did several things to my car (like overfill my oil with gasoline- WAY over- then claiming there was gas in my oil...yeah, now there is!)that made me never want to go to ANY dealer ever again. I let them do this job because I was worried I'd have trouble drilling out the security sheer bolt that hold the ignition in.In hindsight, I would have been better off trying, and possibly failing, to do this job, rather than let them mess up my car the way they did. They also did a bunch of other horrible things, but they did correctly diagnose a failed distributor. Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend you try to replace the ignition yourself using this part. JUST DON'T GO TO A DEALER!!!Best of luck"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!","review":"I have got to say this is is one outstanding product. Charge lasts a long time.

Prokofiev's intentional discord in some parts was a little jarring to my ear, but that's a feature of the music, not the performance. I think you would be surprised to recognize parts of this music even if you think you've never listened to Prokofiev. Bits of these soundtracks have been recycled for other films than these. This is a worthwhile addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accessible","review":"I think those who are already well-educated on fashion would find this interesting, but as a regular person who's just interested in understanding the changes throughout the past century (hemlines, makeup, fabrics, colors..)

It seems to be more of a history of fashion as an art form and of the high-fashion designers' collections and without really clear dates or references to how ordinary people wore styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly executed","review":"Bought this one over some of the others because of the digital window. Unfortunately, the mechanism that drives the digital display makes a very loud crack every time the clock goes past the hour mark. There is quite a bit of resistance from the hands at the hour mark.

Amazon was great, and sent me out a new set right of way.I'll be dogammed....the new replacement set for the first defective set arrived and right out of the box, one of the shocks was leaking oil from the seal where shaft meets cylinder and also offered no resistance when I checked it...the other seemed ok, but, by then confidence in the product was shot. I returned this set as well. Still waiting for a refund.Unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heepster","review":"Love it. So good to see Heep 30 years on as strong as ever. I gave these guys away after the Wonderworld album. After seeing this I am back in full support.The mix of songs is really good. Sunrise and Sweet Freedom are stand outs. Between 2 worlds packs a punch right from the start and sounds great. Bernies rendition of rain is just like the original, supurb. The sound, particularly the bass, is excellent and hard to believe it is live. The guys still harmonises really well and there is some excellent vocal work from Bernie with Lee doing an outstanding job of backing vocals and drums. Mick is his usual happy self all the way through, providing some great licks. The show moves along at a really good pace, doesn't slow down and leaves you wanting more.Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good trip back to the past!","review":"I don't have any records of uriah heep in my collection, but i have heard a lot of them. I prefer buy a recent dvd of a old band instead of buying a cd compilation. I was quite surprised by the quality of their music, now i know why they have a good reputation.

The actual product has some significant flaws, however. First and foremost is the quality of the books they scanned. Many of the issues, especially from 1962-65, are so tattered and banged up that they'd be graded 5.0 (out of 10) at best. The omission of the annuals and giant-size issues from the compilation is a curious oversight. And although I understand their desire to not have people printing up copies of their work willy-nilly, stamping \\"MARVEL\\" across every single page is distracting and disruptive.You'd be hard pressed to find a bigger Spidey fan than me, but I can't recommend this software.

It's a series that just does everything pretty good (art, story, humor, romance).My only complaint is that this new story arc feels rather forced as if the producers said \\"We're popular, let's drag it out a little bit!\\".

I tried Medela, Gerber, Platex and Ameda. The Platex ones were just really gooey and messy. It took a while to get all the residue off before nursing. They were relieving, but not even in the same ballpark as the others. I HIGHLY recommend the Ameda ComfortGel hydrogel pads.

Either you'll use it for taking advantage of people as a salesman, advertiser, etc., or else you'll used to protect yourself from being taken advantage of as a dupe, a sucker, an easy mark. Regardless of which side of the equation you fit on, this book should be high on your list.Cialdini presents a very small number of concepts, but describes each of them with a wealth of detail and examples.

And if you've read neither, go the used book route and save yourself money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book on influence","review":"Cialdini is an expert in the field of influence. The book is a comprehensive study on the psychology of influence. It is a indispensible tool for professionals involved in sales and marketing and negotiations, but it has practical applications for everyday social intereactions as well.Cialdini explains techniques (aka weapons of infleunce) that can be used to gain compliance from others. These techniques are drawn from real-life situations. While he constantly cites academic sources and laboratory experiments, the book remains accessible to the casual, non-academic reader. Illustrations, cartoons, and \\"reader's reports\\" are sprinkled throughout which helps the book stay firmly grounded in practicality. The study questions at the end of the chapter help to pull each chapter's ideas together.To critics of the book many of the ideas presented are seen as common sense, but I really think that everyone can benefit from reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"same book","review":"Pleae note that this book and \\"Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion\\" are the same in content.

But this was before I understood that he means not to educate the public in order to empower them to withstand the techniques of advertisers, but rather to give advertisers, marketers, and other salespeople new weapons in their ongoing battle against human consciousness.From reading his first book on influence, I thought Cialdini believed that persuasion professionals posed a problem. I thought he was on the side of autonomous thinking by individuals, and hoping to persuade the persuasion professionals to cease their debilitating attacks on the public through advertising and public relations.This book, and his consulting practice, reveal that he is just another advertiser - just another person using the most advanced psychological techniques against human beings.His is an especially dark art, given how much America needs to wake up right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and eye opening","review":"I read the book on a recent business trip. Very easy to read and follow... and sure did open my eyes to some sales and marketing tactics currently deployed. Highly recommended to sales people who want another edge in on their potential customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Speculation","review":"Three things that make 'Influence' more useful than 95% of marketing books:- It is based upon observation and experiment, not just the author's opinions.- Cialdini uses examples from marketing, advertising, cartoons, and the real world to illustrate his points.- The book is not a new business pitch from an ad agency or a front for a consulting group. Cialdini is not out to sell you anything (other than this book). He just wants to share these fascinating things he's learned.Each chapter covers one specific 'Weapon of Influence'. It's easy to read in bite-size chunks, and Cialdini's insights are broadly applicable in marketing whatever you've got. 'Influence' is perhaps the most useful book on advertising and marketing I've come across since Luke Sullivan's 'Hey Whipple!'."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the bible of persuasion books","review":"This book will give you more and better insight to how people make decisions than anything you've heard before.

He gives the origins of his creative thinking in social psychology studies. He enumerates six fundamental psychological principles (rule of reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity) underlying tactics that successful influence professionals use every day.

Mravinsky uses his elite, higly idiosyncratic, Leningrad forces with the infamous vibrato laden raw brass section playing its heart out. Moreover, the recording is live!In this sense, I much perfer the Karjan version of the Honegger 2 to the 3. In Karajan's hands, the second has a grandeur, the beggining reminds one of the Karajan's stunning 1954 Sibelius 4th with the Philharmonia- his most revelatory sibelius interpretaion.But that doesnt bring the Honegger Third any loss of merit. Karajan gives it the Berlin treatment indeed. Much like his Shostakovich 10th, the reading is spacious and opulent.

Three movements named after parts of the requiem. It comes at the end of the war with a yearning for peace while still immersed in militarism--marches interspersed with plaintive prayers.

He's tried many things for the RLS and no one treatment works 100%. The combination of maintaining a very consistent sleep/wake times, turning all electronics off an hour before regular bedtime, 30-60 minutes of exercise most days, no or very limited alcohol, magnesium supplements, and a small dose of prescription medication works the best for him. The powdered forms of magnesium are easier for me to digest than the hard tablets. I still need to go easy on these products and I don't take the recommended dosage of either.

No late 20th Century conductor has been as successful as Bohm in conveying the drama as well as lyricism present in Mozart's greatest symphonies. I doubt I have heard the Berlin Philharmonic play these symphonies with such elegance, warmth and technical precision. These recordings are among the highlights in a complete Mozart symphony cycle which Bohm and the Berlin Philharmonic recorded during the 1960's. If I'm not mistaken, this was the first Mozart symphony cycle recorded in stereo. The sound quality is impressive with the latest image bit digital remastering."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOZART #s 35-41","review":"This CD arrived in a timely manner, but for some unknown reason the audio plays extremely low on my equipment.

I have never heard such beautiful recordings of the best symphonies ever written. (my humble opinion ;) ) In addition to the music, the jacket contains interesting information on the composer. It seems he was kind of an anal retentive jerk, but I guess it paid off. This is truly a masterpiece, and worth every penny Amazon is asking for it. If you like these Mozart symphonies, take a look at Philips' recordings of 'The Great' piano concertos. I would venture to say that they are a tad better than these symphonies..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try this.","review":"With classical music it's often very hard, even impossible, to get out of the shadow of the first interpretation of a piece that you ever heard. Particularly if that version was an excellent one, it will always be imprinted on your brain as the \\"best\\" version. Yet this set of Mozart's last symphonies by Karl Bohm and the Berliner Philharmoniker actually made me forget about Marriner and Walter, at least for a while. Vibrant, convincing, moving performances, in fact, you might say altogether persuasive. And this 2-CD set is a steal for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL! BUY THIS RECORD!","review":"Symphony 41 is my favorite symphony of all time and this is the best recording of it that I have heard to date. It is emotionally moving and vibrant and is definitely worth the purchase! The last two movements are my special favorites, but also the first movement of symphony 39 is excellent, as is the third. These four movements constitute, in my opinion, the best of the album but the whole thing is worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Thank you all for the infomative recommendations. I also find B?hm's interpretation impressive. I think that right now it is probably the best there is on the market - it is only comparable with two other conductors: Marriner - and according to my ears even better: Adam Fischer (and the Danish Radio Sinfonitta- who are currently recording all of Mozart's symphonies)Mozart: Symphonies [Hybrid SACD]. The 3 three of them are right now on the top 10 of the best Mozart interpreters.

This is the WORST PERFORMANCE of Mozart's symphonies that I have heard.I have been listening to Mozart for close to a decade and along with Beethoven is my favorite composer.My criticism of this CD is mainly that this is not the way Mozart's music is to be played.

Of the 60's, 70's and 80's HvK Brahms cycles, the 60's are the best, even with their documented flaws. Don't bother with the 80's digital recordings. The 70's versions are \\"OK\\", the playing is perhaps a bit cleaner overall, but the sound stage is tight and un-interesting.The 60's recording of the First has nice sonics and many great moments, some unsurpassed in my experience. Now, if you just want a very good, modern recording of the Brahms First, then try Jansons/Oslo Philharmonic. I own it and like it very much. It received a 10/10 at Classics Today, a site I have found to be reliable.The Schumann on this disc is very good. I own the recent Barenboim Schumann Symphony recordings which have received fine reviews. I find this HvK recording more firey, rhythmic, and edgy, which suits my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Schuman, Bad Brahms","review":"To add yet another voice to this chorus of critics, I must say that I think Karajan does the best job possible in selling the Spring Symphony as a great work (which it really isn't). This may sound like a back-handed compliment, but it really isn't; it takes true talent to turn mediocrity into greatness. And the irony is, all the things I usually hate about Karajan's \\"sound\\", the thick and luxurious string tone, the warmed-over woodwinds, the blaring brass, are all right at home in this symphony. So Hurvitz is wrong on this one. He has a point with the Brahms, though. Karajan never understood the burnished, noble qualities of Brahms, and here he simply skates over some of his most glorious orchestral writing. So, an unusual situation: recommended for the filler, not for the main feature. If you want this orchestra doing Brahms 1st, try Abbado's digital recording. If you want an older, cheaper, classic recording, go for Bruno Walter's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bull's Eye!","review":"To me, this is THE Brahms' 1st. If one were to ask me if I liked Brahms' 1st, I'd say \\"yes, the Karajan recording\\". The sound is excellent (excellent balance of instruments, and good dynamics for the time), the playing is phenomenal, and the interpretation is perfect for this symphony. Karajan took a broader approach to this symphony, allowing the architecture to show. The tempos are rigid, and sometimes a little on the slow side, especially in the first movement. The textures and thick counterpoint are very transparent as a result. The expressive lines in the symphony are allowed to come out on their own, without exaggeration.I strongly prefer this recording over the newer Karajan recording that comes with complete set of Brahms' symphonies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karajan's Best Brahms and Schumann Symphony Recordings","review":"I strongly disagree with David Hurwitz's abysmal review of this CD. I believe this is one of the finest recordings Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic ever made of Brahms' 1st Symphony. The same can be said for Schumann's 1st Symphony too. Karajan had a fine understanding of Brahms' and Schumann's rich orchestral textures at this time; both performances are vibrant, and exhilirating, filled with the warm ambience you'd expect from the Berlin Philharmonic's string and wind sections. Karajan was a perfectionist with regards to sound quality. That's why he recorded these symphonies, as well as Beethoven's, several times. Yet these earlier recordings hold up better than this later ones if only because his conducting became less inspiring towards the end of his career. Karajan fans will certainly want to add this CD to their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intermediate C++","review":"If you are confused about templates or about the design of class hierarchies this place is a very good place to start.The writing is rather compact and to the point and avoids the trap of getting the reader into a long boring example.Yes sure, it's dated, (this book was written before STL came on the scene, but many of its ideas are there) but you may not need all the latest features of C++ right now.

Fricsay, a student of Bartok while at the Franz Liszt Academy, has a unique understanding of his music and really brings it alive. This version of the Concerto for Orchestra is recognised as a classic - with hungarian authenticity and a superbly executed performance, this is an electric experience. The Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta is a personal favourite - if you've never heard Bartok before start off with this version. The sound is mono (recorded in the mid/late 50's) but this doesn't detract from the enjoyment of listening to these pieces played by a master."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ozarks: An Excellent Early View","review":"While not as famous as Lewis and Clark, Henry Schoolcraft conducted the first of his many expenditions with similar care and attention to detail. One needs to excuse some of the poetic descriptions. The book gives an excellent insight into the very early development of the region shortly after the Voyage of Discovery.The author has considerable personal research with Schoolcraft's travels as a college professor leading field trips on portions of the expedition. The most helpful is the author's appendix which keys the days of travel to current day locations.For anyone studying the Missouri and Arkansas Ozarks, this is a must-have. It provides the only contemporary vision of this part of the United States prior to the rapid development in the years prior to the Civil War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitty-Ful!","review":"If you like films that are \\"all over the place\\" and hard to follow this is the film for you.

I found both the hero and the heroine interesting as opposed to most novels where either one or the other is interesting but rarely both. There is enough humor to satisfy a Brockway fan, but this time there is more sadness beneath the surface. Nicely developed characters and a well deserved happy ending. Definitely worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked \\"As You Desire\\" MUCH more!","review":"I highly recommend \\"As You Desire\\" over this one.

I liked Jack's lust and love for Anne from the beginning. I liked Anne's intelligence and thieving skills and her ability to figure out who had the missing letter. I liked some of the plot twists. I liked the scene describing how Jamison first met and took Jack as his son from a workhouse.What I did not like: The ending was unfinished. I wanted to know where they would go and how they would live. I wanted to know what would happen to the money and property Anne inherited from her previous husband. I didn't understand what Anne was trying to do when she visited Jack at night in his room and tied him up.

The Heifetz/Reiner version of Brahms on RCA seems to be the most famous, but this performance by Oistrakh and Konwitschny is better. Oistrakh has much more heart than Heifetz. Heifetz has always been cold blooded. If you want warmth and sentiment, Oistrakh is your man. Oistrakh also has a Brahms concerto with Klemperer, in stereo. If you must have one in stereo, the one with Klemperer will suffice, since Oistrakh's performance with Szell has not yet been issued on cd. The Beethoven romances are filled with such warmth and emotion, it's bound to give you goose bumps. The Tchaikovsky is also played in the grand, warm Oistrakh manner. Once you hear Oistrakh's deep sense of emotion, you will be hard pressed hearing it by others. There are many good performances, but get Oistrakh's. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must own!","review":"The Bach concertos are amazing. I don't think I've heard a better violin tone in my life than what is captured here.

But it's material like this that's used by other writers to scribe the interesting books with lotsa pictures. Hey, I didn't enjoy reading it during my Pompeii class, I probably wouldn't have read it at all if the Prof hadn't assigned it, but it helped me to familiarize the city of Pompeii and its principal ruins. And I'm not saying that I did great in the class either, but the book helped.There are no pictures.

Argerich can adopt a reckless, hectoring style, but at her best--as here--she's full of imagination, wit, and an uncanny ability to see beneath the surface of the score.I can only second everyone else's high praise for the Prokofiev and Ravel concertos, which are spellbinding, as well as the praise for her Gaspard de la Nuit, which is staggeringly virtuosic and original. Abbado conducts with gusto and style, if not the greatest nuance, and only the somewhat dated sonics detract (marginally) from an acclaimed recording that has remained in print for forty years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is definitely a marvelous CD.

Very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripped","review":"The Prokoviev 3rd is played in Argerich' usual performance style:she practically trips over the notes in order to get to the next one. Nuance, emotional interpretation are nearly non-existent (except for those who equate musical interpretation and emotingas the production of speed on the keyboard). Prokoviev obviouslyexpected speed where it is called for in this piece, but I hardlythink that he would have enjoyed his music being trampled upon. Even the expert downhill racer appreciates the style of his craftand wouldnt consider himself a better skier if took the mountainon a ski jump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfull","review":"This is simply the worst recording of this concerto. I realize she was young, but it is unmusical, almost as if the idea is to play just the opposite of what the composition calls for. Sort of out Gould Gould.

Avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst of post modern performers","review":"Miss Argerich remains one of the most dreadful of current pianists. Her playing is cliched, affected and strident. She represents the perfect postmodern classical musician; Interpretations which convey a contempt for the audience by virtue of its obtuseness and meaningless \\"musicality\\", all style and no substance. No wonder the vast majority of the public detest classical music. Classical music and performers, like literature of the past 50 years has lost its relationship to the public and any real human sensibility.

The China product is a bit different. The accent color is precise with each color being separate and distinct from each other where the USA product colors are mottled and blended together, looking artsy and having a pleasing meld of color.

She didn't title it Ruined By Reading for nothing - she pretty much said she wasted time and didn't learn a thing. I agree with the few negative reviews. I was looking for inspiration, and wound up with the exact opposite!

I hate to say this, but I really didn't like it at all. I thought I would, but after the first few pages I knew it was going to be difficult to get through it. The major problem is that I couldn't relate to the author at all. I think it may be because I don't take reading as seriously as she does. All the books she referred to were classics, heavy reading for intellectuals. Then she spent some time talking about how she thought movies weren't a worthwhile form of art and how horrible it was that some books were made into movies. These viewpoints go completely against what I believe and the way she put them across made her come off rather haughty. The book also seems a bit like someone talking about their own vacation.

Anyone with an ounce of experience configuring any type of network device with a web-based interface could have written it. It's not a book that explains cause and effect relationships of configuration options.

No kidding, I wouldn't have guessed that's how it works! Brilliant! This book is chock-full of great, insightful gems like that.

I was about to re-read some Aristotle and was seeking to re-acquaint myself with his particular style and language. This is definitely not the book for this purpose.Adler's text is clearly geared to the young reader who has not been introduced to philosophy. I do not mean this to be disrespectful but to help oher readers avoid by mistake. Adler, himself notes in the introduction that his initial thought was to title the work Aristotle for Children.

I guess I should have known from the price that this was not the \\"game\\" I grew up with. The original game I played 30 years ago belonged to my father and came with bidding cards (at least the size of the playing cards, maybe a bit bigger) and plastic holders to display the bidding cards. This set came with a sub-par deck of cards, 4 bidding wheels (flimsy cardboard discs w/ numbers written on them) and 4 bidding wheel \\"holders\\" that can best be described as empty matchbook covers with a notch cut out to display the bid. The worst part is I bought this as a Christmas gift for my Father (I actually bought 2 of them so my dad, my 3 sisters, my wife, my 10 year old daughter and I could all play at once.

I have heard it called \\"Oh Hell\\", \\"Oh Heck\\", and \\"Up and Down the River\\", but its all the same thing. You start by dealing one card to everyone. You go around the circle and bid either 1 or 0 (since there is only one trick). You play the trick like any other trick-based game, but you don't have to play to win the trick. The only restriction is that you must follow suit. If you get your bid (and 0 is a valid bid), you get 10 points + 1 point for each trick that you won. If you don't get your bid, you get 1 point for every trick as well.You deal 2 cards for the second round, 3 for the third, etc. until you deal out all the cards or as many as possible for the number of people you are playing with. You can introduce trump by flipping the top card of the remaining deck over once you deal.

The fan was expensive. The battery also stopped working when it was 3 years old which the Vaio customer service center said was about the life time of a battery.

Instead they expect you to creat a recovery disk. Then to make the story even better. I go to create a recovery disk for next time and I eat through 20 Dvd's trying to make it work. Their solution is for me to uninstall 3 of my programs that they installed and then try again. Long story short. It never worked. Stick to Dell or Apple.

I believe that at a point, Richter and the music become one and the same. It is as though he were fused to each note. The result is a performance that is both flawless and yet, warm, sonorous and full. There is nothing that he has left out.

They use various technologies available at the time (but not all widely used), including a precursor to airships, rail and gatling guns. A number of other historical figures, events and technologies affect the story.The novel shifts to a future where \\"The Kelly\\" is a hereditary dictator...

Word. For. Word.Needless to say, I was less than thrilled.I suppose there's some amusement at seeing the slight differences between this and the first two episodes of FK, but I was just annoyed at having wasted my time to watch it.I was even more annoyed at Mr Slan and Mr Parriot for not even bothering to change anything.

His profound statments make an individual contemplate and search his inner soul for his true identity. This book, if read carefully and with much thought, can really impact one's life. It can help one search themselves and think differently about life in general.

It combines a classic whodunnit plot with a family drama. It can be a cold and rigid courtroom battle or a moving tale of love and devotion. The story is told in the first person viewpoint and provides an insight into the psyche of a man whose life is torn apart. It has the reader aching for this man, while at the same time wondering whether he is rightly accused! Ethics, the law, technical stuff, family love, tragedy and the pursuit of personal agendas are matters that blend together and create this masterpiece of suspense with feelings... an unusual combination. The hero's turmoil becomes your own as you read this book and stays with you long after you finish it. This book tests the reader, presenting in it intellectual puzzles and ethical challenges.

It's a simple chase game, but after each move you act something out. The acting has nothing to do with the goal of the game. The acting would be fun, but my 4 year old wasn't interested in acting out the card. Instead, he always acted out a plane. My 5 1/2 year old didn't have the refinement in her movement for anyone to guess what she was doing. There are only 6 game pieces, and really no reason they had to be choking hazards. Since they truly are, I have to keep my 1 year old far away. The quality is poor. The cards are flimsy.

The game is low pressure, but high energy fun. She loves acting out the animals and is surprisingly good at charading the household items and activities included in the game. The pictures make it easy for prereaders to play,and the game has worked well for groups of varying ages including older cousins and even Granddaddy. After playing it repeatedly, the game cards will be memorized by frequent players, and although this hasn't dulled the excitement for my daughter, I might make up some new cards just to keep myself interested.

While I thought much of the insight was realistic and the characters were somewhat likable, overall I wasn't as impressed as I thought.More than divorce, I found it to be a catalyst to promote Mormonism.I was confused as to whether it was supposed to be written from a child's perspective or an adult-looking-back perspective. There were times when the vocabulary was too large to be from an 11 year old and the sometimes drippy prose was definitely not a child-like quality.What I did appreciate was the lesson that a step-brother, no matter how 'dorky,' can be a great addition to the family. Hopefully, it will help kids reading this book not to see 'new' relatives as a threat or negative."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must read","review":"As a financial advisor I can say this system works.

Most recently I've discovered Klara Wurtz and find her refreshing to listen to in her well balanced lyrical interpretation and technical skills (Check her out! - she plays Schumann beautifully). But this classic recording will always be the #1 recording in my book.It' no wonder Richter is still counted today as one of the top 10 pianists in recording history. Emil Gilels (a world known pianist) himself said, \\"If you think I'm something, wait until you hear Richter!\\" His playing is a delight to hear and the orchestra in this recording does him justice (regardless of what some negative reviewers have said).

It's a great followup to a compelling story about how the Bismarck threatened the lifeblood of civilization, and how the good guys beat the odds and sunk her. Cameron's expedition allows for good talk with children about how wars are tragic even when they need to be fought, how young people die, sometimes horribly, and how the survivors afterwards can indeed be friends.

Ms. Reynolds literally choreographs the full spectrum of what was 20th century dance: no stone was left unturned.

(Nothing quite like a poem to Death to leave you breathless!) And Karajan's overemphasis on the strings (it could just be the recording and mixing) means that orchestra color is downplayed (and this when listened to on B&W reference speakers).I still prefer Schwarzkopf.

But very groovy. The female singer--no names are given, nor a photo of the band, which lost them a star--has a voice almost as low as Nico's, and the predominance of minor chords gives the music a dark feel. The guitarist is a great mimic of 60s guitar sounds; I heard echoes of the Electric Prunes and Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd, among others. And is that a Vox Continental organ I hear occasionally? Recommend to people who like the \\"Nuggets\\" compilations."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like STEREOLAB, you'll love Midnight Movies!","review":"WOW! I first heard \\"Strange Design\\" of the Midnight Movies on Sirius satellite radio a few weeks ago. It hooked me in the first ten seconds, has a psychedelic flavor like Stereolab.

Poor writing, flat characters, lack luster plot, complete lack of the farce it attempts to have, are all hallmarks of this work. Never mind that this wretchedness is foisted upon the audience for at least twice as long as it should have been. It was not the actors in any way, but the play itself which was beyond poor. There isn't enough space in this review to accurately and faithfully list what is bad about this play, and leaving a single period to list any merits it may have is too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adds real meaning to what it covers","review":"I have trouble keeping track of the aims of an author writing about Nietzsche because I have so many personal issues of my own, but a line in the introduction about trying to shake us free from the hypnotic vocabularies of propriety and responsibility that animate our thoughts on the self and its place in the world almost gives me hope that readers will realize how much the alternatives being offered for a gambling addiction that is bouncing around trying to pick a path to a spurious infinity are merely symptoms of those who are freaking out about maintaining economic growth in a world of billions of people that will never get the kind of medical attention that bankrupts whoever plans to pay our bills. This book might not have the vocabularies I am looking for, but it knows some people are really shook."},{"rating":"2","title":"To be more than honest with you...","review":"I really enjoyed this considering it was in the bargain basement (most of them aren't uusually worth picking up). I was forewarned that the front cover-art had nothing realling to do with the film (ie. skeleton). When I looked at the back of the cover and saw some of the scenes from the film with Linda Blair, I vaguely remembered seeing this years ago on TV.I finally watched the DVD the other day and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's one of those films that you cannot take seriously, but just treat it as a bit of escapism. While the storyline is totally far-fetched, the acting makes up for it. Lee Purcell was great as the cousin who is nothing but a nasty witch.This 1978 movie turned out to be an enjoyable afternoon's viewing. Worth a look (just don't take it too seriously)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"I thought the movie was a little spooky...but a little bit cheesy.

I'm usually a fan of Wes Craven, although his truly great films are few and far between. I couldn't believe how horrilbly cheesy this film was!! Linda Blair is very annoying in this film, from her grating voice, to her 1970's afro. I know that it is a 1970's TV movie, but that's no exuse. Salem's Lot was from that same era, and it had some decent scares to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap from start to finish","review":"there's no way wes craven made this. it is just too, horribly bad. i mean, c'mon. monty python and the holy grail is scarier then this. don't waster your money on this trash.p.s.

Actually, I found Linda Blair to be so whiny I almost rooted for Lee Purcell! (Blair has a very nasal whine throughout the movie, and it is really annoying...) but her family and her friends and boyfriend treat her very badly and very unfairly in favor of Purcell, who is, far and away, the more attractive of the two...for a time. Then her real self emerges and...but you have to see the movie! Good, light, semi-scary fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made-For-TV Wes Craven","review":"For those renting this because it's a Wes Craven film, be forewarned - it may be a Wes Craven film, but it's made for TV (and 1970s TV at that), so it has none of the Wes Craven trademarks. ive years after The Exorcist, Hollywood (in this case television) was still trying to capitalize (and unsuccessfully) on a post-Exorcist Linda Blair. Older and pudgier, she certainly had done nothing in the intervening years to hone her acting skills.

The reviews on this site were obviously written by the author's friends. This was written by someone who doesn't understand the fundamentals of writing. Her characters are flat and uninteresting and do not make you care about them. Nearly every sentence is destroyed by an over-abundance of adjectives. The story is choppy with poor transitions, and the author cannot seem to make up her mind if she's interested in teaching her belief system or telling a story. I would suggest she get some old books by Taylor Caldwell, such as \\"Great Lion of God\\" or \\"Dear and Glorious Physician\\" to research how a novel of this genre is handled by a great novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literally a boring, boring book","review":"The book is extremely boring.It's just about the younger life experiences of the authors coupled with texts from the Bible.1.) Why did they have to relate the experiences to Bible texts so many times for?2.) Like I said before, it's about the experiences of the authors when they were younger and hence those years are not relevant to our years now.Bad, bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE SOMMER KNOWS","review":"Remember the delectably sexy Elke Sommer? SHOT IN THE DARK, THE PRIZE, DEADLIER THAN THE MALE? All hit movies of the sixties. And she makes an appearance as the sinister housekeeper in this dubbed movie from Germany. Once you get past watching the mouths (the dubbing is awful), you may enjoy the slashfest that occurs. The movie has some original twists that I didn't see coming, including the ending which is reminiscent of the beginning. Fiendishly campy with some strange humor, and some big plot holes, FLASHBACK was penned by Jimmy Sangster who gave us some of those delightful Hammer films of the seventies. The scenery is beautiful, including the house in which the movie was filmed. The acting is about par for this kind of film, and it is relentlessly gory. But slasher fans, particularly of the Euroslash will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"The Painless wiring kit is very well made, although I wish it had a few additional features like a ground post as part of the fuse block. The screws that came with the unit needed to be replaced due to my install location with longer screws. There was plenty of wire associated with the kit. The wires exit the bottom of the block in a tight angle, making a 90 degree bend. I added some reinforcement to protect the wires at this point. It might have been easier to wire without the wire already attached to the block, but it can be done...all the excess wire is in the way as you are trying to route things around parts under the dash. As an after thought I should have purchased the water-proof version and mounted it in the engine bay...it might have been easier. Location under a 66 Mustang dash is prety tight...so finding a place that was out of the way and accessable is hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Information spread too thin","review":"Jwing-ming Yang is certainly a knowledgeable person, but his books are too padded with historical and cultural information (as oppposed to practical information) and make too many cross references (to know more about this aspect, read my other book etc...).

He has some great essays on Plath, Auden, Moore, among others. There are a few dull essays.

But on the whole this is a great collection for all poetry lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular...best performances of these songs ever","review":"I purchased this cd because I am an avid Bryn Terfel fan. The Rodgers & Hammerstein music held little interest. The recording was a revelation. One can't imagine that this music could be better performed. The singing is truly magnificent: effortless, thrilling and heartfelt. Each song is a mini-drama in itself. Terfel tries hard to adopt an American accent and largely succeeds.. his diction is outstanding. There is a great spirit of joy. The charismatic Terfel clearly enjoys singing this music. Even in the lesser known numbers, this great artist has the unique ability to turn inferior metals into gold. The contribution of Paul Daniel and the Northern Phiharmonia is outstanding. Opting for traditional orchestration rather than more modern, jazzed up accompaniments only adds to the listening pleasure. I have grown to love much of this music but couldn't stand to hear anyone else do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aptly Titled","review":"The best thing about this record is the song selection. It is apparent that the album was meant to inspire. One of my favorites on the disc is \\"Come Home:\\" the tenderness expressed in Mr. Terfel's rendition makes it a true gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Emphasis on Expression","review":"I was disappointed in this CD. I love Terfel's rich baritone voice, but on these songs, I was forever turning the volume up and down -- he either sang a few words or lines WAY too softly and then BOOMED out a few words or phrases. I had my finger busily readjusting the volume constantly! Too bad, nice songs, poor delivery for listening to on a CD.

The first set, bought maybe 20 or 30 years ago worked well.Two points. First, the tool is now made in China, with a somewhat poorer fit and finish. Still, it looked usable . . .Second point, looks are deceiving. It wouldn't cut 9/64\\" braided cable (just above 1/8\\" and well below the stated 3/16\\" capacity). All it did was gnaw at the strands. Even if I had the patience to gnaw my way through, the wires were separating and a clean cut would be impossible.Perhaps some get a tool that works or are using it on softer cable.

Sounded easy enough, but after making 3 out of 10, painstakingly difficult, cuts in our T-316 Grade 7x19 Stainless Steel Aircraft Cable with wire cutters (aka dykes), we gave up and started searching for a better tool. The dykes not only made cutting the wire an arduous task, but the end of the wire came out too frayed to slip into the swage fittings without piercing our fingers. We are so happy we waited to finish the job with this cable cutter! The HK Porter Pocket Wire Rope and Cable Cutter made the cuts fast and clean. We were able to complete the entire job in under an hour - the dykes took us more than twice that time to get 3 cuts! It does take some hand strength to use - my wife wasn't able to cut through the wire, but I found it easy. I wish we'd started with this tool.

It started out whiny and blaming others, but I figured she was trying to portray her thoughts as a teenager, so I kept reading. I kept waiting for her to grow up and stop blaming everyone else and stop having a pitty party, but she never did. In the end, I just didn't want to hear her whine about how one more person had hurt her, or how she couldn't sleep again because she was so overcome with grief. This was the longest pitty party, the longest whine, and the Longest Road, that she somehow never got off of. I hope this isn't a true reflection of her life, because, while it is clear she grew up in a very dysfunctional family, she really needs to take some ownership too. Until she does, she'll just continue to be a whiny pathetic person that no one wants to be around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok","review":"I am always looking for new books to read on my kindle and I came across this title the other day on a free list.

Let him decide when he will get back into her life because he was obviously making her feel worse. My opinion is that she should never even have tried to find her son's father. I think she wanted to find him more for herself than for her son. And she kept making the same mistakes over and over again. I couldn't really feel for her.

I didn't think much of it at first, then it stopped working all together. Being an electronically minded fellow, I opened it up, only to discover that a wire attached from the circuit board to the outlet prong was disconnected.

Dubay will make them much easier to understand and absorb.Fr. Dubay gives practical guidance for the Christian who wants to know God more deeply. Discerning the real from the imagined is hard enough; when the word is really from God, seeing past our own inclinations and avoiding mistaken interpretations is even harder. Fr.

Levine's performances of the two symphonies makes the listener want to continue listening.

His Haydn is an example (The Oxford is a must to have it).And even his conception of Sibelius's music may be troubled for many listeners, please try with Tapiola op. 112.This work is one of the less played in Concerts and even in studio recordings.The special commitment that Rosbaud got with Tapiola is hard to believe. Its inner passion, the increased tension among the strings section and above all these obscure themes depicted by the winds are so clear defined and drawn by this conductor like no one else before and fifty years later.Segerstam makes a very close approach but the orchestra has not the carats of Berlin Philarmonic an that's a real trouble.You need a first class orchestra if you want to be a winner playing Sibelius.

Cooley established his career on the west coast during the Second World War and became an early star of televison after the war. Cooley's brand of Western Swing was sophisticated and at times approached the experimental, making him something of a Stan Kenton of the genre. His \\"Swinging the Devils Dream\\" opens with a sweeping floor harp and then segues into rapid, yet fluid, twin fiddling. Cooley was never as funky as Wills or Milton Brown, but he was clearly cutting his own path with a smooth sound. Unfortunately, his later recordings were rather lackluster and reflected a move toward mainstream pop and occasional cornball treatment of material. But during the period of the war and immediately after, Cooley swung beautifully. This collection is essential and is the best introduction to Spade.

This book is an excellent teaching tool for freshmen or sophomore history classes (some of the older kids thought that the reading level was too easy).

The fact that the protagonist is 16 and there is a \\"love story\\" subplot makes it even better.As far as the swearing, it is not at all excessive and actually adds to the book as it shows the culture shock that 16 year old Jack underwent when he joined the Army Air Force.

If you are into death, tech/mathcore, prog or pretty much any other type of extreme music, you need to pick this up. All the instumentation is breath taking and quite satisfying. The one area Burst start to lose me on is the vocals, which come across as completely inappropriate at times. When I'm hearing the kind of melodic, grooving and intricate riffs that this band plays, I really don't expect or want to hear somebody growling over it in an impotent attempt at Meshuggah worship. Those vocals work for some bands, but not for Burst; not all the time, anyway. They have crossed into such panoramic territory, that they should not be held back by the limited scope of so much full on screaming. If this band can learn to infuse even just a slightly more melodic approach to their lead vocals, the world at large will soon be singing praises for Burst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries, but rarely explodes like it wants to","review":"2 1/2Not without attempts to invigorate hardcore with more melodic assaults and occasional off-genre experimentation, Origo still ends up sounding more or less like so much of the same by almost always reaching back into the base of generic riffs, fragmenting whatever creative momentum they have going into smaller, less significant bursts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Society in America","review":"I needed to receive this book for a summer college class that is only 5 weeks long.

Standard earbuds won't stay in my ears, so some kind of insert style has always been my preference. When I got my iphone I wanted a way to use the standard earbuds because they have a mic in them. I replaced the rubber piece with a different doubled version I had from another headphone, and they stay in well.

These buds easily snap over the existing iPod earpieces, and they actually stay in, and most importantly, they do a very good job at sound quality. I have a set of Shure e110s, which cost many times more, and the bass level on them isn't nearly as good as the Ear Jams. Apparently, snapping the chamber over the existing iPod ear pieces really does make a difference! Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate that they do not fit my earbuds","review":"I think that these would be great, but they do not fit on the newer iPhone ear buds even though it is also considered an iPod...The vendor refunded my money but of course made some on the shipping and handling.So if you are looking for enhancement for you iPhone playback ... well, I guess you are going to have to wait..."},{"rating":"1","title":"these things suck","review":"the standard apple earphones aren't that comfortable to me. i bought these in hope of making the apple earphones more comfortable, but all they do is muffle sound. oh, and they don't provide any additional comfort. in fact they just make the whole thing fit awkwardly. at this price i'm not too concerned though. perhaps i'll break down and buy some better earphones with an integrated mic.so, if you want a crappier fit and muffled sound buy these now. otherwise stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it if earbuds don't work for you","review":"My husband's ears are shaped in a way that regular earbuds just fall out. We've solved that problem for regular music listening with the er6i's which jam into his ears (and has great quality, sound isolation, etc), but he still has some earbuds that he needs to use.... for example, the set that came with his cell phone, and a motorcycle intercom that we bought. He just pops these on the buds, and is able to use them without any problem.He's not too concerned about the sound quality in this case, but rather the adaptor quality.The negatives. Sometimes they pop off the earbud when we're storing them (note, we've never used them with iPod earbuds, just the two mentioned above). Sometimes the grey part alone pops off, and that's all too easy to lose. I can't use them at all. My ears just aren't big enough, the result being that the back of the earphone pushes against my ear - really uncomfortable!Anyway, my husband is happy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept, bad execution.","review":"I was really looking forward to using the earjams for my iphone. unfortunately even though it may cancel out noise, the sound that these buds give are horrible.

The stock ipod earbuds sound great but aren't comfortable and fall out too easy. My Sennheisers sound even better but don't fit. Tried these and not only do they fall out with the most trivial head motion (don't try bopping your head to the beat of the music) the sound quality is TERRIBLE (as I noted above, I guess the name earJAM refers to the sound). It's frustrating 'cause they LOOK like they should be great.I just sat through size swaps, position adjustments, listened to different music styles, compared with headphones, my other earbuds, and compared the sound to the cd played thru room speakers, etc. These, unfortunately, are the worst of all options.I like the case!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yes, they do fit the iPhone!!","review":"I'm not sure why others have said these don't fit iPhone earbuds. This package comes with two sets of snap-on covers - one fits the iPhone buds and the other fits regular iPod buds. As for the sound, there really is very little difference with these covers on or off. Maybe a little less highs with the covers on, but I had to switch back and forth several times to really tell any difference. The best solution would be for Apple to offer their in-ear buds in an iPhone model with the microphone, etc. But since Apple isn't doing that, these covers are a good second choice. These are far more comfortable than the iPhone buds by themselves, and you get much better isolation from outside noise. For the price, I don't think you can go wrong by giving these a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"These really aren't that bad. Increases the bass a lot, which is a big plus for me, and they're pretty comfortable. They don't make my ears hurt if I have them on for a long time. I'd say they're worth the 7.99... but not the 20 bucks I paid for them at best buy. So, if you're considering buying this product I would buy it online. I don't know how much the shipping is though."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst products I ever bought","review":"These attachments for your earbuds make the sound all muddy, not good at all. Upon trying them, instantly I was grossed out by the sound. Totally not worth buying. Also, they look strange. You are much better off buying better headphones or just using the stock headphones as is rather than trying to buy these. Trust me, they are just a gimmick and actually hurt the sound rather than help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't fit!","review":"I don't understand how anyone can get these to stay in their ears - unless they have massive ears! The size of the rubber attachment is irrelevant since it doesn't get anywhere near to going right into your ear. It is blocked by the main earjam connector and the earbud itself, both of which are way too big to go in most poeple's ears.Great idea, but poor design. I wish I had just gone for the ipod in-ear headphones as they do appear to be a lot smaller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful product for factory provided EarBuds","review":"If you are like me and most EarBuds you buy with any equipment don't fit in your tiny ears then these are for you.

In fact, they even start to hurt after a while and they leave my ears sore. They are not worth the money at all.They do give more of a closed-sound atmosphere, but they aren't worth the pain and the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not headphones, hurts to wear","review":"This is only a plastic cover that goes over the earphones that come with the IPod. This makes them too big to go into your ear so they don't stay in, unless you force them, then they hurt like hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a dime","review":"I bought these because my iPod earphones don't stay in during a workout.Incredibly these fit even worse! (none of the 3 sizes of rubbery earpieces stay in).And (as many of the reviews mention) they make the sound worse.What a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressed","review":"I feel duped by this product. After reading through so many product details I must have misread this one. The product is actually only a cover that fits over a pair of ear bud headphones. The headphones pictured are not included with the purchase, and I found nothing that such a fact. They work OK but tend to become uncomfortable after several minutes. I haven't tried to move around while wearing them, but they don't feel like they are stable enough to stay in place while doing so. I paid less than $6 including S & H, so I can't say I didn't get my money's worth. Just be sure you know what you are getting with this product. COVERS ONLY!!! There are three sizes of ear pieces so maybe there is a size that will fit you better than me."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry i bought these","review":"this is the first review i've ever written on amazon. I have taken time out of my busy day to proclaim my disgust for these stupid things. i am a bit of an earbud snob i must confess but i can't see how anyone can listen to a an mp3 player with the earbuds included with an ipod. i consider those to be garbage. these ear jam add-ons do improve the sound by jamming them into your ears but they are clumsy and don't stay in the ear canal. i love my Shure E2c earbuds and would gladly pay the $65 to replace them if i ever lost them. they are as important as my ipod to my listening experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"only because zero is not an option","review":"useless piece of ****go with a quality in-ear headphones from sony, etc.. this really won't give you the effect you are looking for. in fact, it deteriorated the audio output from the headphones that came with my mp3 player(Cowon iAudio X5L. one of the best out of there)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out!

It says that they simply \\"click\\" onto the ear pieces. There is no \\"just click\\" going on with this product. It doesn't snap into place it doesn't adhere to the existing ear piece in any shape or form. Now I am tasked with having to send back a product that clearly doesn't work and spend more time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible w/2nd gen Nanos","review":"Bought these to enhance the uncomfortable earphones on my wife's new 2nd generation Nano...problem is they don't snap on - they're too big, and once opened, cannot be returned. No info suggests they're not compatible, but they weren't in our situtation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Painful Product","review":"These Ear Buds are large and hard. They have sharp edges and hurt my ears. I have large ears and large ear canals and wear other earbud type headphones all the time which do not bother me. These were not only painful but did not enhance the sound, but actually reduced it. This product should be taken off the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not fit Iphone","review":"As others have said here it does not fit all models. I decided to buy regardless the review as I saw on their website it had the original iphone 8GB as supported. To my disappointment the ear jams are too big to fit the iphone earbuds. I tried taping it to be able to use it but it just looks stupid. I though about gluing it from the inside but I don't want to damage my original earbuds."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are cool!","review":"These are cool! They snap right onto your headphones, and vastly increase the bass, and reduce outside noise. Well worth the money. Only one complaint- the first time I bought these, they came with a second, smaller set of covers that fit regular round earbuds. I have the sort of oblong or oval shaped headphones, and that is the kind that fits. But I also have the round earbuds, and they do not fit. Bummer. The little case that comes with it and the spare covers and rubber pieces is a very cool bonus. I highly reccomend these ear jams, because they make the sound much better, they are inexpensive, and they last a long time. I will definitely purchase another pair when these wear out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Do not under any circumstances buy these things!! They do not even fit onto the Apple earbuds. And as far as sound they make the earbuds sound like they are in the other room.

I have an old set of apple earbuds and a new set. Both are the same size, and the ear jams are to large to snap on either. I am returning these today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is useless.","review":"I have three sets of Apple earpods that came with a Nano, iPod, and iPhone respectively which I purchased over the last couple of years so they are all the same model. None are different in respect to size, shape, appearance or quality. This Griffin product would not fit on any of them. The adapters were much larger than the earpods and would not attach as advertised. I even tried to super glue them to one pair and the plastic used would not adhere to the earpod plastic. This product is worthless and the cost of returning them negated the possibility of breaking even on a return."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For.","review":"Everybody knows that the white headphones that come with the Apple iPod not only deliver inferior sound quality, but they don't fit some ears comfortably. This add-on provides a solution for one of these problems. The Griffin EarJam Earbud Sound Enhancing Covers, when snapped onto the iPod headphones, fit snugly into the ears, and there are 3 different sizes of earpads for maximum comfort. But the sound quality is a different matter. While the bass is definitely more aggressive, the clarity is lost, and the sound is frankly muffled and a bit distorted. This may not matter to casual listeners who don't care about these nuances, but I found it unacceptable and unlistenable. For the low price these buds ask for, you'd be foolish to think you'll get premium sound quality. They do little more than improve the fit of the iPod headphones. If you're looking for anything else, spend a little extra cash on another pair of headphones that offer better sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I have had a hard time with my iPod earbuds. I have tiny ears so the regular earbuds would not stay in my ears no matter how I positioned them. I am sick of big bulky headphones and wanted to opt for in-ear sound isolating headphones, but I am on a strict budget, so these are worth the money. I bought them in a college bookstore and LOVE them. My earbuds stay in place, I don't have to have bulky headphones and I can enjoy my music with less outside noise. I do agree with most people that yes, the bass increases, but it's kind of a muddy, blurred sound. I found the solution is to go into EQ and adjust the settings to increased treble and that solved the problems. Normally I'm picky over my sound quality, but made this little sacrifice just so the earbuds could fit in my ear. I don't have any discomfort with them and find the advantage of not having to have the volume up as loud! Definitely worth the money, but I wouldn't pay anymore than I did for them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Don't buy them , unless you have extra large sized ears. They're too heavy and too large. The smallest rubber ear pads still won't fit comfortably in my ears.I use my ipod primarily when walking several times a week. They won't fit snugly and are constantly falling out and have started to irritate my ears from the constant reinsertions.I've stopped using them and will buy something else. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"I did not find these of any use to me. They just did not stay in my ears and diminish the sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good if you have small ears","review":"These fit okay in my husband's ears, but he says they are fairly uncomfortable. I have small ears and I cant even get the smallest fitting to fit in my ear. Great concept, but really needs some help before it is effective. Bottom line, don't buy these if you have small ears...just invest in some different headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless on headphones w/ my iPod 'Video' 30GB","review":"I just bought these for WAY more than I should have from a big box store (couldnt wait for Amazon shipping), and come to find out they don't 'snap' on as advertised...they are too big.

It cancels noise and improofes the sound for a significant factor. It also fits other ear phones than the Apple ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money for better headphones","review":"The Earjams work exactly as described in the featured review, and are, I suppose, worth the $11 I spent on them. But I'd strongly recommend that you use the money towards Apple's in-ear phones. The Earjams increase bass at the cost of everyting but volume. All the nuances and detail of of my music are diminished, and that's not very pleasant There's just more bang for your buck buying better buds. For 3 times the cost of earjams you can get Apple's earbuds and 10 times the sound quality of the earjams. If you only have $10 to spend, get the Earjams. But if you only have $10 to spend, how the heck did you get your hands on an iPod??I do use my jams every now and then, notably biking on city streets - they up the volume without silencing car horns and attack dogs. But for quality listening, they're unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"THESE DO NOT FIT ALL IPODS!!!!!","review":"I have a 4GB ipod nano that I got for Christmas and this doesn't fit them."},{"rating":"2","title":"help for sore ears","review":"The ipod earbuds really hurt my ears after just a few minutes-they are just too big for me. The EarJams make a huge difference and I'm happy with them. They stay snug in my ears and the soft silicone is much more comfortable than the hard plastic ipod earbuds. Once in a while, one may fall out if I am trail running, but I can usually get it back in snugly and continue on. I recommend these to anyone with small ears. I'm no audiophile, but the sound quality seems fine to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally worthless","review":"I bought this item, hoping that I can use them with the First generation IPOD ear phones as described in the product home page.

Well, a year of using them everyday took a toll on them. So, I decided to buy another set. They most have changed the design of these. The first set I had, snapped in place. But, these didn't. They were lose fitting. My daughter lost one in two days. Get something else unless you find a set before the re-design. Those were pefect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apple has changed the design of their earbuds","review":"This product is absolutely wonderful. I bought might years ago when I first got an iPod nano. They make the earbuds so much more comfortable and functional. All the reviews saying they do not fit are due to a change Apple has made in the design of their earbuds. The covers fit the earbuds which came with 3rd Generation nano's and older models. Beginning with 4th Generation iPods, the earbuds are different. I found this when I purchased a new iPod and tried them. It didn't work. I use my old earbuds with my new iPod because I'm determined to keep using the covers.This is probably why Griffin has discontinued this item. Also explains why I can't find them in any store.Also why on earth do these now cost $.99 and shipping is $5.00 for EACH item!? Glad I saw that before I purchased them. I'd rather pay more than a dollar and have $5.00 shipping for the whole package!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My headphones no longer fall out!","review":"My headphones always fell out unless I jammed them painfully in my ears.

All of the earbuds are the same size, so this is not an issue with the iPod. The problem is with this product.With so many complaints, I have to wonder why they haven't corrected this problem yet?In addition to this, the three different sizes of flexible covers were missing one in one size and had an extra one in another size, rendering the entire product worthless.

No wonder they discontinued them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointmernt","review":"Griffin generally makes very high quality items for the iPod. This is not one of those items. On the plus side, they do stay in my ears much better than the Apple iPod earbuds. That is the ONLY plus side. They sound AWFUL! Volume and bass is indeed increased -- it turns all sounds into a loud, muddy mush. I threw them away after about ten minutes of painful testing. Now that they've dropped the price to practically nothing, that might be a clue about what they're worth. Just go buy a better pair of earbuds and don't waste your money on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"These sound like crap - Don't even bother","review":"Yes, they increase the bass, but in the process completely cuts out all high frequency detail, sacrificing any semblance of clarity.If you are interested in real in-ear plugs, there are plenty out there to choose from. I thought I'd try the cheap route, but I just wasted money, as these are going right in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fine.","review":"They transform Apple's earbuds into sounding much fuller, are very comfortable, are thrifty, and have never fallen out of my ears, even when exercising.

The price was GREAT too on Amazon!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, Mediocre results","review":"Griffin Technology usually makes good products, but I have been disappointed by this one.These little attachments for your iPod earphones actually deliver more bass *at the expense of midrange and treble*, producing muffled sound.If you are into bass-heavy music, then these may be worth the money (which is, fortunately, quite little).As for the fit, they are indeed more secure and less likely to pop out, but the clips that hold on to the iPod earphones are ever-present against your ears, and a bit annoying.If you are into classics, jazz or new age, the only solution is to get a decent set of headphones - which usually are not cheap.Sorry, Griffin Tech, thumbs down on this product - nice idea, mediocre results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for iPhone","review":"Bought these for my iPhone, which greatly improved the sound. I had purchased the Shure earphones specifically made for the iPhone, but there is no way to pause the music or answer a phone call as music plays. Only the Apple headphones give you this capability. So back to the original headphones, but with the Earjams added it is a whole new experience. Clear bass and the volume doesn't have to be turned up 75% to get great sound. I highly recommend this product if you are a new iPhone user."},{"rating":"1","title":"NoseJams","review":"If you want to know what these will sound like before you buy, take your iPod's buds and stick them up your nose instead of your ears. And yes, I know how to put the EarJams into my ear canal, so it had nothing to do with an improper fit, they just suck.The fact that they stay in your ear better is actually a detriment because you will want to jerk these puppies out of your ears the second after you hit play. Can you tell I don't like them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with 5G Ipod","review":"I bought these hoping they'd make my IPod buds more comfortable. Unfortunately they don't fit the new IPods. So... I can't really rate their performance -- except to say don't buy for a 5G IPod.

I don't think they're worth half that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable","review":"Yes, the fit was better, but what was gained in bass response was negated by the reduction in highs.

Great little carrying case that is probably worth the price alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"a nice case","review":"For the $7 I paid, they were an ok deal and at least the case should be handy. They do indeed provide a better isolation seal when added to the ipod earbuds and increase the volume. But I agree with comments I have heard that they make the sound a bit like listening in a tin can. The sound is ok at low levels if you play around with the equalizer settings on the ipod. I prefered \\"loudness\\" setting. Long term comfort was NOT great for me either. Short term comfort was ok. They are mostly collecting dust for me in the \\"nice try\\" pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"EarJams really JAM your ears","review":"I bought these Ear Jams thinking that they wouldn't fall out as much as the standard ipod earbuds. I was right, they don't. But they do hurt a bit. They should make them softer somehow.

They do help the sound, but don't really make them feel comfortable in your ears.

No such luck, at least for my ears. These were worse than the standard earbuds.But that's just the shape of my ears, I suppose.

I got this thinking it would work with the new model earbuds, but they didn't. I used a buddies old style earbuds and tried them out to see how they sounded, and it was not that good at all. The older style earbuds are not as clean sounding, but to me these distorted the sound way too much. I tired to set the EQ on my IPOD to flat and anything else that I could, but there was so much bass I couldn't even hear the music. My suggestion is to spend the extra money and get the newest earbuds from IPOD that go inside your ear. They are a a lot more expensive than these, but they sound 100x better. I wouldn't waste your time with these. You end up spending 3x more on shipping than what these are earbud covers are worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are rubbish","review":"I got these for my son for him to use with his new shuffle.

I had to wash my hair twice, I felt as if it was still dirty. My hair is long, and the shampoo made my hair feel tangled, the conditoner made my hair appear greasy at the scalp after I air dried it.

I was so excited to try it, but it just didn't do anything. It didn't seem to penetrate the way the AO conditioners did. It just sat on top of my hair and gave it a waxy feeling. It did nothing to soften my hair and it did nothing to help with detangling. I was just not impressed with this conditioner and will not repurchase. I gave it two stars because of the all natural ingredients..If you are looking to try a AO conditioner, start with honeysuckle rose."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed, I was a fan for years.","review":"I have used this product faithfully for years.

I hate it now!I don't know what has happened to Aubreys. They have changed their formulas. I was so devoted to buying all of my products from them. I can no longer use their products. Why in the world would anyone mess with perfection. I am so incredibly disappointed. Honeysuckle Rose was my absolute *ultimate* conditioner. And it just does not work the same anymore.

I read the ingredients and they were so different from what is listed on the amazon site. Water and alcohol are now the first two ingredients, Rather than aloe and a coconut cream base. This is false advertising. I am going to try to let amazon know. I now checked the other reviews and see someone else noted the same thing. Wish I had checked the reviews first. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like the smell","review":"Unfortunately I didn't like the smell so much that I can't attest for how well it works - I've only been able to use it once. The odor reminds me of the perfume making kit a friend of mine had as a kid where you could make cheap, bad selling perfume with blue or yellow dye. The scent of the conditioner makes me feel slightly nauseous (though a lot of perfumes have that affect on me). I didn't know something natural could smell so artificial. Hopefully the store will take it back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I used this product once and realized it wasn't for my hair.

Seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great truly all-natural conditioner","review":"I only use Aubrey hair products because all of their ingredients are truly safe enough to eat. My hair is thick, wavy/slightly curly, and tends to get frizzy. I use this conditioner at my gym because they use hard water and this one works best there. I've tried the other \\"Dry Hair\\" products and the Island Naturals and White Camellia left my hair too soft or oily and I didn't like the smell of the Desert Herb as much as I like the Honeysuckle Rose. I use the GPB conditioner at home because I have soft water there and the Honeysuckle Rose can make my hair too soft. A recommendation - if you have problems selecting a shampoo and conditioner, bear the water hardness in mind and try several, especially if you shampoo at more than one place. Thank you Aubrey for developing and producing such wonderful products!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful conditioner","review":"I always use this conditioner, but usually buy it online directly from Aubrey.

It gives great slip, I used it as a detangler when taking down my braids and it worked beautifully. I just wish there was more in the bottle, I'm almost positive I won't get more than 8-10 uses. Other than that, awesome conditioner with great all natural ingredients, definitely worth a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love love love it","review":"This conditioner actually makes my hair softer and less frizzy than just shampoo alone - which is not something I can say about any other conditioner I've ever tried.

My hair has just finished air drying and I couldnt wait to write the review. I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical because it seems there are a few negative reviews and since nothing worked for me before I assumed this wouldnt either. I was wrong! My hair has never felt so soft and smooth. It literally feel like strands of silk, even the damaged ends. there is also no frizz anymore.

I have used it on dry hair, wet hair and even deep conditioned overnight with it. This product is great for thick, kinky hair. Especially those of us who are transitioning and or natural. I would definitely recommend it. The only thing I don't like about this conditioner is the consistency.

Reduced hairfall considerably.Unlike other reviews it has a very faint smell and the conditioner actually works wonders for your hair.

I even added a little olive oil for extra moisturizing and it did not make a difference. It also felt heavy while rinsing out of my hair almost as if there was some kind of film left on my hair. Perhaps I used too much (1/4 of the bottle) on my thick hair. I'm too scared to try it again. It took me two weeks to get my hair almost back to normal."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"Great scent and very good for moisture. I have v used this in the past and just rediscovered it.

If the ratings would allow minus points I would definitely use them now, unfortunately I have to put one star which they don't deserve it as this product did nothing for my hair, it even made it worst ever.

I liked the shampoo for my oily hair, but this rinse sucks. I know it's not supposed to be thick like a normal conditioner, but the consistency of this was hard to work with. It just runs out of your hands before you get it on your hair. I tried pouring it on my ends directly and leaving it on for 3 minutes like I do for any conditioner, but it didn't seem to rinse out well. Felt kinda oily like there was a strange residue left behind, which is strange because it is so water-like. It wouldn't have mattered if it did anything for my hair, but it provided no detangling, no body, no anything. I literally watched the money I paid for it wash down the drain little by little. I could've gotten a bad bottle, but i'm not willing to repurchase to find out if i'm wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I don't really care much for this product. It's not thick enough and it left my hair feeling stringy, coarse, and brittle. I usually like aloe in my hair, but apparently I do not like aloe in a conditioner. Also, this conditioner smells like lemon scented mopping solution. There is no universe in which I find myself wanting to smell like mopping solution after a shower. I don't have anything against lemon fragrance, quite the contrary. I usually like the refreshing zing of lemon in a body care product, but this stuff just smells funky. I don't recommend this for people with my hair type (3B, doing curly girl), but perhaps this works for some people.

I typically leave my deep conditioner on for about an hour and my hair really didn't have much reaction to this product.To work with this, I mixed this product with shea butter, a cheapy condish (suave naturals), coconut oil, jojoba oil, and honey and it is wonderful.

I don't usually read romance novels because they're all the same: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back. Usually the girl is weak and has no personality. Katherine Myers breaks this mold in Ribbons of Silver. The woman, Kenna, is three-dimensional, strong, and very likable. The love story between her and Grey is passionate and realistic. The book had a great plot and wasn't just a background to the romance.

I've used them on basswood/balsawood, cured fimo and sculpey clay, and acrylic painted clays and plastics successfully.The sheets are small enough to use in small areas and the variety of grits in one package gives a lot of selection. I've used the roughest one the most, and it can be used to take the splinters off soft wood without a problem. The finest grit is barely rougher than automotive sandpaper. The sheets are thin enough to wrap around a tool to get into tight spaces, which creates a crease in the plastic film that can't be removed.

Keach's character is witty and has more personality than most portrayals of truck drivers. A young Jamie Lee Curtis teams up with Quid and together they try to find out if their guessing game about the strange man in the green van is fact or fiction.

This radio had trouble getting them both in terms of signal strength and clarity- a great deal of backround hissing. Adding external antenas did not improve things.

The characters take turns narrating every other chapter which would be fine but the timeline was not sequential and ended up confusing me.

In sum, a delicious book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to write like this in junior high school","review":"I had high hopes for the author within the first few pages. But then all the fluffy and agonizing descriptions of every person's outfit just reminded me of how I used to write at a very juvenile level. The other reviews are right: it's very predictable, but worse than that, it seems that Diana just wants a man around just to have one around. Please, haven't we all evolved past that stage in our lives?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A satisfying romance","review":"I've read this book twice, once before and then again after moving to DC. Diana's comments about the men in this town, and the southern power influence over it were right on target, so if you're in the dating scene in DC, you'll especially enjoy it.Otherwise, it's still a great book. Diana is forced to make that classic decision of security v. passion, but it's not the typical gorgeous/dangerous v. serious/rich plot. Bartolomeo's characters are more dimensional than that, and Harry (the passion guy) feels like that guy best friend that you want to protect. And Diana's sisters are hilarious.All in all, a really good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dickinson Alumna Makes Fine Debut","review":"Having graduated Dickinson College along with Christina, I can humbly say that the writer did fictionalize certain aspects of her own life. While it's hard to like or admire a main character who two-times her fianc��e, the Christina I remember was a kind-hearted, very likeable person, who showed signs even then of becoming a talented writer. When she dramatizes her own life in her first novel, it is only for the sake of a good story. Novelists, by my definition, should have the ability and wherewithal to reflect upon themselves in the way that she has done. I'm looking forward to her next novel. Good job, Chris!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and boring","review":"This book just didn't do it for me. Although the plot was indeed interesting, and there were some good moments, especially Diana's odd relationship with her father and sisters, for the most part this book just isn't what I thought it would be.

For one thing, it's unimaginative: I had the sense that the writer was just fictionalizing aspects of her own life. The narrator's self-descriptions sound remarkably like the photo of the author, and details about the neighborhood don't conjure up any sense of atmosphere. There isn't a single metaphor or evocative image in the whole book, and precious little insight. Add an occasional jarringly bad detail, such as a Catholic church wedding held on a Sunday, and you have, all told, a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"How can such a short book take so long to read? I hate to say that, because the first chapter sucked me in. Just when I thought the plot was going to move along, she starts to get into a bunch of backstory. Okay, fine, we need a little expostion. Then the book turned out to be more whiny backstory than any real plot. The book lacked any real character development and Diana just couldn't stop whining to save her life. To top it all off, the author used Tom Waits in vain. It didn't sound like she was really into Tom Waits, just using crib notes in the hopes that it would make the book sound \\"edgy.\\" It only made her look like a poseur. If this book had a soundtrack, Tom Waits wouldn't fit the bill. Try some Dan Fogelberg next time, Ms. Bartolomeo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"Last month I watched the Hallmark Hall of Fame movie \\"Cupid and Cate\\" which was based on this book. I thought the movie was very good, so I searched for this book. The book is much better! It's not a heavy intellectual read, but it tugs at your heartstrings. As a woman around Diana's age, I can relate to the frustrations that she has with life and love. I agree with some of the other reviewers that Bartolomeo is sometimes a bit wordy and too descriptive, but overall, it's an entertaining and touching read.

Daredevil was handled slightly better in \\"TRIAL\\" however, although the costume was a bit blah. The extras on these discs are definitely interesting, including the \\"STANDING TALL\\" documentary of Lou Ferrigno and the as-always wonderful interview with Stan Lee.I wish they would release \\"DEATH OF THE INCREDIBLE HULK\\" on DVD, as this was by far the best of the three movies.

Releasing these 2 as a 2 disc set is only to capitalize on Thor and Daredevil appearing in them as well. Alright in Death of The Incredible Hulk, nobody wanted to see the character die (in fact Bixby was planning on making another sequel, and explaining why he didn't die, but then Bixby himself got ill and passed away soon after) but if you're gonna release these \\"sequels to the series\\" on DVD, it is illogical to release 2 together as a set when there were only 3 movies.

The Herhsa's sisters story is told by a talented writer,Ted Swarz, who brings to life the brainwashing experiments used to create Manchurian Candidates. Dale Griffin, through his investigative quest, has provided us with the proof that Children were used as human guinea pigs to perfect these heinous programs. If we are to understand any of this, we must look beyond our preconceived notions that things like this only happen elsewhere. We cannot deny what comes out of our own government's declassified top-secret files. Colin Ross's book Bluebird, gave us the proof of the deliberate creation of multiple Personality for covert use and how it was achieved. Now we have the heart rending account of its effect on two innocent women.

As a CIA spin doctor, Schwarz has definitely earned his blood money.The book \\"Secret Weapons\\" is well-crafted disinformation.

Solid performance by a young Jeff Bridges as the brother of slain President seeking answers to the plot with standout cameos by Richard Boone, Anthony Perkins and - in particular - John Huston, in a role eerily similar to that also played by him in Chinatown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conspiracy Follies","review":"\\"Winter Kills\\" isn't a particularly great film but it had the potential to be one. Richard Condon's dark comic source material is handled adequately by writer-director William Richert but a more assured hand could have really spiced up this Kennedy-esque conspiracy tale. What makes the film worthwhile is the work of the veteran character actors on hand particularly Sterling Hayden and John Huston who chew the scenery in royal fashion. Their performances demand the audience to take note of the material's twisted overtones but Richert, to a degree, undermines them. Jeff Bridges, with his classic movie star looks but a character actors thought process, wisely defers to his older compatriots. Just a thought: In 1985, Huston brought Condon's \\"Prizzi's Honor\\" to the screen with smashing results. One could only imagine what he could have accomplished if he was at the helm of this venture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of a classic","review":"I first saw this film when it came out in general release sometime around 1970.

She rides horses, speaks her mind, moves with energy and enthusiasm, and thinks for herself. When the handsome, well bred, and well to do Thomas, Marquis de Guis, takes an interest in her, they are beside themselves. Will Margaret settle down, give up her charity work with fallen women, and behave like a proper lady? Nope. Margaret's thoughts aren't on settling down, they are on why a passionate and attractive man like the Marquis refuses to kiss her. What is he hiding?This is by far one of Regina Scott's most unique characters and unusual plots. If you enjoy a good plot with your romance and women who aren't Barbie(tm) dolls, buy the book.

The plot-line consists of alot of Atlantian nonsense to justify the existance of the creature. Bad FX shots like the creatures locked behind the horizon, never venturing to where the people are running around. Buildings that explode for no good reason, Gamera walking through a construction site, the girders explode from within each piece. Buildings scraped by the creature explode from the inside-out.

Is it the monsters who are conveniently locked behind the horizon with people running in the foreground among city destruction? Or the buildings which explode on contact? Is Tokyo a storage house for Nitro Glycerin? Why do skeletal girders on a contruction site explode when touched? Is it made of C-4? Why are the FX work in this movie praised? The original kept it simple and had to explain less. This movie explains outlandish creatures with even more outlandish and convoluted explanations.

Don't get me wrong. I love the Godzilla movies as much as the next G-fan. But I have to tip my hat to the makers of the newest series of Gamera movies.

I own almost all of his movies, good or bad, and a multitude of books, figures, posters and comics. However, I am also a fair critic, and I cannot deny that Gamera: Guardian is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Most of the concepts that were originated in the Heisei Godzilla movies, but never fully developed, are beautifully done here, and the visual effects are some of the best ever in a kaiju movie. Shusuke Kaneko crafts a story that never loses it's momentum and is at no point ever unengaging. The score is also excellent, worthy of some of Akira Ifukube's better work. If you think this movie is good, however, watch Gamera 2: Advent of Legion and Gamera 3: Awakening of Irys. They must be seen to be believed."},{"rating":"2","title":"gamera returns from atlantis to fulfil his mission","review":"one of the best movies of the decade..it has everything you could ever want out of a monster movie.while not as good as gamera 2 or 3 it is still something you kaiju fans should pick up. so get off your computer and go get it or i'll beat ya up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A spectacular upgrading of Gamera","review":"This is definitely not your parents' Gamera.

The new effects are positively magnificent...a lot of Hollywood SFX artists who are going CGI-happy should take a long , hard look at this film, as well as its two sequels (\\"Gamera 2: The Attack Of The Legion\\" is also available here in the States)...they would learn a LOT. Both Gamera and his arch-rival Gyaos look positively terrific, and their rampages of destruction are first-rate.

If my words give you pause, I highly recommend you use the preview feature before purchasing this.UPDATE: All is forgiven. I regret my low star rating as this music has really grown on me in the past few days. Spektor's voice somehow set off a \\"cutesy\\" alarm in my head.

Let me clarify by saying I thought SOME of the lyrics were unique and fresh, but the songs were filled with too much ah ah ah and weird noises. This is and never will be an album discussed amongst groups of people at social gatherings. I don't think it will appeal to a broad audience. I do give Regina kudos for offering a FREE 6 song CD along with Begin to Hope, in hopes her music will get shared. But these tunes were not for me or anybody else I know. I can't even give the real CD away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good, some bad...","review":"This cd has a few AWESOME songs on it. It also has a few AWFUL songs on it. First and foremost, I HATE any kind of drug reference, and had I known there would be some on this cd, I would have passed on it. So, with that said, I enjoyed the first 4 songs or so, and didn't like the rest. Very unique voice, great talent, but I think she needs someone to take her under their wing and help get her going with some good stuff that doesn't involve any drugs. We just don't need it. Call Mutt Lange. Maybe he can give you a clean boost to get those few great song hooks into the charts. Can I get my money back and just buy the first two songs?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Step down, and wecome to planet Earth","review":"This is not important. An egocentric voice, not very willing to communicate with the listener. I have tried but most of it is just passing me by. I like voices trying to make a personal style but she seems more interested to imitate someone else. Whoever that can be does'nt make me more happier about this kind of acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Begin to Hope~ Regina Spektor","review":"Regina Spektor's CD was so terrible that after listening to it twice through, I simply gave it away.

Buy it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky, great music","review":"I first hear \\"The Hotel Song\\" on pandora.com and was blown away by it. I bought the MP3 album of this a few days later and love Ms. Spektor's voice and quirky tempos and lyrics.I highly recommend her music for those that like Feist, Goldfrapp, or Dido. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Joy From Russia","review":"This lady is talented, funny and grows on you. Her voice is delightful, her piano work is great and her diction amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic Sound","review":"Regina Specktor is perhaps one of today's most talented singer/songwriters. Unlike other skilled pianist who sing peppy songs that are played all to frequently on the radio (aka Sara Bareilles' Love Song) Regina's sound is altogether set apart from the \\"pop pianists\\". Though it may take the average listener a few play throughs for her eclectic style of music to grow on them, grow on them it will until they become, like myself, slightly obssessed and play it none stop on their commute to school. She is a raw talent and her songs are haunting. Her odd vocal technique, which ranges from beat boxing to soft sttaccato, graces each song in just the right moment that makes the listener smile and listen intently for the next oddities they want to pick out. I have enjoyed both this cd and her original which is just as good. For those who enjoy Fiona Apple or Tori Amos, Regina Spektor' Begin to Hope is the next cd for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regina is the best!!!","review":"Think..a happy Tori Amos.

I can't wait to see what's next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky, Cool & Fun","review":"I don't buy many CD's but I saw Regina Spektor on a morning news show recently and was mesmerized by her voice, her life and her poetry/lyrics. I tried to resist, but finally gave in and purchased this CD.I was not disappointed! I like every song on it. It's so rare to hear a truly original soul anymore who isn't prepackaged and tied with a pretty bow by media mogols, but this CD is NOT your average music. It's funky, cool, fun and unique. Her voice is as much an instrument as her piano and she plays it with abandon.If you march to the beat of a different drummer, you will LOVE Regina's music. I can't wait to hear more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting if Odd lyrics","review":"I bought this as a gift for my cousin and she made me listen to it some. I liked the music, but thought the lyrics were just....odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best by far","review":"What a disappointment. I should have bought the songs individually and then I would only have paid for two as that's all I've found I can even listen to. She is all over the place and needs some direction. This is a failure and I hope she will improve with her next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"2-3 good songs, lots of filler","review":"I really like Regina Spektor's voice and her piano playing. The first song, \\"Fidelity\\", reeled me in. That song is just addictive, and along with \\"Better\\" and \\"Hotel Song\\", has great hooks and recognizable song structure.However, she seriously needs to work on her songwriting. The rest of the CD sounds like she sat down at the piano and made up the songs as she went along - not a good thing. They often sound like she's not sure what to do with the song but just keeps on making stuff up until she reaches the 3- or 4-minute mark. Meandering, changing course, it's self-indulgent and not that interesting. (Don't even get me started on the bonus EP.) Definitely not a CD you can listen to over and over each day.I want to LOVE Regina Spektor, I really do, but she needs to reign in her self-indulgence and work on crafting actual songs. Once she's got that down, she will rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finest recording of this masterpiece","review":"The chief glory of this recording is soprano Luba Orgonasova, who sings with commanding ease and gorgeous tone her difficult music, she is one of the top sopranos of our time and it's a scandal that we don't have many more recordings with her. Cecilia Bartoli needless to say, is also excellent and so are the tenor and the bass. All in all this is the finest quartet in any recording. Myung-Whun Chung proves a natural rossinian, his reading is stylish and exciting, and the Vienna Philharmonic play like gods for him. There are other good recordings of the Stabat Mater, the Marcus Creed version in Harmonia Mundi with period instruments is most interesting, and very well sung too, and the beefy Semyon Bychkov version with the marvelous Bavarian Radio Symphony orchestra and chorus should be considered too. But Luba Orgonasova is so special, so unique that this recording gets my top recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - Avoid (c) 2000 by Anchor Bay","review":"I ordered the Anchor Bay (c) 2000 edition and then found the Disney version (c) 2004 at the library. There's no comparison. The Anchor Bay version has TV scan lines in it! It's like watching a pixelated mpeg. True, the Anchor bay version has both 1.66 and 2.35 versions on flip sides of the disc, but even the 1.66 version looks bad like it's out of proportion, and not just the opening title got squashed.I'm returning the Anchor Bay version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old niche movie - Civil War Buffs will enjoy","review":"Having just complete a week long trek through Georgia following Gen. William T. Sherman's route through Atlanta to Savannah beginning in Ringgold, Georgia, I enjoyed this Old movie. It is as accurate as can be expected from a Disney production. We visited Tunnel Hill and the Southern Museum of Civil War Locomotive History in Kennesaw, where the Locomotive the General is on display."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my favorite movies of all time but horrible quality DVD","review":"Rather than going into details on what is one of my favorite Disney live-action movies of all time, I thought it was important to get another warning out regarding the APPALLING transfer quality of this DVD. While the DVD is barely watchable with color and other image fluctuations, Disney is completely irresponsible releasing this movie with such poor quality control, it frankly says to me they don't care and I suppose Hannah Montana and other modern-day brain candy makes them more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look at the civil war","review":"This Disney movie tell the story of union operatives who steal a Confederate train.The movie tells a toned down story of the actual events as thismovie is intended for children. It stars Fess Parker (Davey Crockett).Enjoyable movie for young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Disney Historical Train Flick","review":"If you like to watch trains you must have this. The old locomotives are great including the General Lee. But the best thing is the beautful railroad and Georgia scenery. Many wooden trestles. Walt Disney liked the railroad so much he tried to buy it. He couldnt because of the excessive debt the railroad had. The plot and the acting are a little corny but hey this is an \\"Ole Yeller\\" and Davy Crocket vintage film. GMA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Film, Disappointing DVD","review":"Read the other reviews for a plot synopsis. Be aware that this film is presented in \\"Letterbox\\" widescreen, not anamorphic (although the menu pages & even the copyright warning page are anamorphic widescreen). The picture quality is mediocre, as is the sound. I thought that Disney (who released the original film to the theaters in 1956) would treat this film with some respect, but alas, as seems to be happening with all major studios' DVD releases now, they appear to be taking the cheapest way out. The film is a very good historical action piece that deserves better, especially from Disney. I just hope they treat the upcoming Davey Crockett release better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Locomotive Chase","review":"This was a great family movie so sit down and watch. My family and I enjoy watching the early Walt Disney classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but not very useful","review":"These were a nice addition to my set but I can't get salt or pepper out of either on of them. I think the holes are just too small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a moving story, neither good, bad or indifferent.","review":"Dull, over implied metaphors to make some \\"sort of\\" impact that comes off like an insiders only tale. Is this what we have to expect from our writing program Graduate students? Who is she doing this for and what is the reason? Obviously just for herself and those who know her..Invisable Sign For Me is just that, for Aimeme. This story is not for me or anyone who wants a well developed story that respects the reader. This story could be summed up by the phrase coined by Gertrude Stein: There's no there, there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mathmatic conceit that overloads the story.","review":"I really looked forward to the most recent work of this author but why am I not moved to recommend this book? Could it be that A. Bender spent so much time impressing the reader with her so called \\"wizardry\\" and forgot that there was a story to write? This style is best kept short. A friend of mine hyped her first book which I enjoyed, mostly give or take a few forced ideas, and it seems success is hard to live up to. Also, I cant help but suspect the 5 star reviews are really posted by freinds. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlike Anything Else I've Read","review":"I absolutely adore this book. As a reader and huge fan of Bender's short stories, I had been looking forward to her first novel and wasworried that it wouldn't live up to my great expectations. What unfounded fears! The book is funny, original, and full of astute observations about what it's like to be alive. Mona, like Bender, herself, charmed me, intrigued me, and left me wanting more. She does with language what no else can do - giving voices to human fears and frailties in prose that makes reading a joy-ride. Do yourself a great big favor and buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it. Lovely writing, scary details.","review":"A well written book that draws you in has an even stronger punch when it hits you with unpleasant events. Book reflects a fine line between whimsy and madness with details that collide like a fascination with an ax, a 19 year old teacher, resulting in an injured child. Maybe this is \\"literary\\" but I don't like it. Does have some interesting themes like an obsession with one's parents mortality, triggers to sexual repression, etc. But overall depressing I thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative Writing Student's Wet Dream","review":"This little jewel of a book reminded me of what a lazy, self-absorbed, creative writing student desperately wishes would happen to her life. Granted Mona is disguised as a math geek...whose knowledge is limited to 3rd grade math. She is hired as an elementary-school math teacher without any credentials or college education. In fact, the job is practically forced upon her when the school principal calls her at her home recalling a summer years ago when the she spotted Mona in a park doing long-division. I kept thinking \\"You're 19, have your own place, and a good job. Your quirks and emotional unrest are not going to draw sympathy from me. They are going to make me think you are a little turd.\\"As a math buff myself, I was constantly annoyed. Mona doesn't love math. She is not good at math. She is good at arithmetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant book, multi layered and brutally honest","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It has so many layers, twists and turns and it will keep you anxiously wanting to know what will happen next. It is also brutally honest as it shows the main character's emotions larger than life. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a bit of absurdity combined with a close look at raw human emotions"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is An Awful Piece of Fiction","review":"Well, I made it to page 80 and decided to give up. What a boring story, what a boring character, and whata horribly boring style of writing. Not imaginative at all, no energy, no momentum, just tedious flat sentences that took me no where. I abandoned it at page 80 and skimmed the rest and the end and decided, who cares!Why are these books published? I really don't get it.M.

Spare yourself the horrid memory that will be forever planted in your brain and avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"viva too different","review":"Standing out + getting noticed = crazy. There is so much in the stories that could be interesting but with all the heavy laden metaphors (drippingly obvious for attention) which the writer is soooo proud of as if to say gee Im a genius look at me I can add...makes me feel like..who cares! Knock it off, get out of the way of the story and write."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Great Book","review":"While her collection of short stories \\"The Girl in the Flammable Skirt\\" was innovative, creative and imaginative, this new book by Aimee Bender is simply stunning. I cannot remember when I have been so profoundly moved by a work of fiction. The novel is brilliantly crafted and rewards the reader with an unbelievably powerful ending that is somehow both heartbreaking and life-affirming at the same time. They don't come any better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual, imaginative, but unsatisfying","review":"The premise of the story is interesting. The relationships between adults and children were developed and had depth. While we don't need to take ourselves so seriously, the nuerosis and serious dysfunction that seems to effect the majority of the characters was a little \\"overdone\\" and grew irritating as the story progressed. This is not a \\"literary\\" criticism about prose, writing style, etc., I just didn't enjoy this book. Although not without merit, I would wait for the paperback or check it out at the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Densitometer not needed","review":"Oh these stories are so lovely and wow they really touched my heart. And the teacher character who eats soap is oh so touching. Gosh this really makes me happy. I love this book so much, kind of like, like the stepford wife for the bizarre. I just feel like this is it, so pleasant, comfy in the darkness of my unknowingness yet true to the whole. There is nothing that makes me so proud as this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"Aimee Bender used to be my elementary school teacher and would create stories for us at the end of every class we had with her. So when I found this book, I knew that I would instantly love it as much as her book of short stories. I was right, this book is the best of Aimee Bender bringing a surreal quality to her heroine Mona. I'm so excited that this book is going to be a movie that I can't wait to see it. I only hope that the movie can do justice to this wonderful masterpiece written by one the best authors. I only hope that my former teacher will write more so that my collection of her works grows."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books i've EVER read -- and i've read a lot.","review":"wow. WOW. i woke my best friend up at some ungodly hour to shriek about this. i haven't read something in one night in a loooong time, but this was one such instance. i think everyone recognizes that bender is brilliantly imaginative, but she's honest and perceptive and a darn good storyteller on top of that.i work in a bookstore, and the tragedy is that a lot of books these days seem to be written for a market. fiction is really breaking down into niches: you have your dustycovered oprah-y books about women facing adversity and whatnot, in earth tones of course, then you have your sassy quest-for-mr.-right deals with bright covers that look like someone just threw a copy of cosmo in the blender, and then you get the biting generation-x-male-disillusionment ones in their sharp neon-colored covers.... this was written with total disregard to those emerging categories. bender just wrote a GOOD BOOK that's fun AND touching AND brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blue glass fairy tale","review":"What a sweet, wonderful, sad story Aimee Bender has told. I'm a fan of her short stories and am happy to see how the novel form fits her like a shoe -- a glass slipper, maybe :)She has used the format's extra space to create a landscape whose tucks and rolls provide an excellent pathway for her characters, a town that somehow feels like middle America and the Black Forest, a stage setting and your own living room.I'm generally prone to plot summary when recommending books, but stripping away the wonders of Bender's language doesn't really do the plot justice. After reading the book, I'm more blown away by the characters and how they realize that life experiences are either disfigurements or badges of honor.I don't really want to give much else away. She's a wizard. I don't know how she does it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knock on wood","review":"From the moment I started the beginnings of this book, I found it absoultely irresistible. In fact, I found it very complicated to even put it down. I read through it in most of one sitting, even denying myself the simplicity of water.Aimee Bender gives us a wonderfilled, poetic story about Mona Gray. A woman, turned 20, obsessed with numbers and good luck. This incredible story reaches far into the reader, taking a life of it's own deep inside, even though far from insouciant.A must read for Plath lovers, as parts of the novel remind me of Esther Greenwood (The Bell Jar), and in reality, these two could have been best of friends, or better yet...worst enemies.Bender turns obsession and compulsion into a moving story of a woman that knows too much...and too little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird and wonderful","review":"Coping with dying is difficult, but this book gives the reader an interesting perspective on how one can go on living when someone close to them is ill or dying. Wearing our heart on our sleeve, or a number on our chest, doesn't guarantee that we'll be noticed or treated differently. Mostly, we are left to deal with life's troubles on our own. However, if we find like-minded souls in the world, and we reach out to them, we can help each other embrace our time on earth as a gift, while at the same time letting go of those who must move on. Although this story has many weird aspects and quirks (which I find refreshing), it also holds an important message for anyone who cares to notice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Debut!","review":"This novel is really unique and extremely well written. It combines magical elements with very real ones and touches upon the fears and insecurities that are part of the human condition.I'll never look at a bar of soap again in the same way. Read this book and find out why!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read","review":"I read a lot of non-fiction, and this book is one of the very best. It is well written, and it covers a fascinating topic that is timely, even though the events happened over 100 years ago. When should we listen to \\"experts\\"? How should we develop public policy and decide how to spend tax dollars? This book would be a great case study for college classes in entomology, forestry, political science, history, environmental studies, and others."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Disappointed as this book is so small it looks like something you would find in a cereal box. Bought it online, used for just under 12.00 plus shipping expecting more as other books from same author have great recipes and pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karajan does injustice to Mahler","review":"I bought this CD based on all the positive reviews on Amazon. I also have to admit that I am a huge Karajan fan.But I am disappointed. I don't feel this is how Mahler should be handled.Karajan does his best but he gives it what I would describe a classical treatment. As a result, he missed out on the highs, the lows, and the emotions that should be associated with this music.Also I think the range in dynamics is disappointing. There are stretches were the sound is too low (minor issue though).The Adiagietto is still one of the best.I love the version by Daniel Barenboim. Bernstein from the 60's is also not bad (except for recording quality)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"\\"overrated?\\" \\"bombastic?\\" \\"Dripping sentamentality?\\" That reviewer demonstrates all that is troubling about listeners who worry that others might not recognize how \\"educated\\" they are. Karajan is generally recognized as the master of the adagio. He was not made director of one of the most eminent philharmonics in the history of music and he and the Berlin Philharmonic did not stay together for so long because he was \\"bombastic\\" or dripping his sentimentality. He is revered because he and his orchestra literally breathe life into beautiful music. Of course there are other great conductors - as well as great orchestras. Each list is very long. Karajan and the BPO are beyond magnificent - they are magical in their ability to transform the listener. This recording is from that magnificent magic. It is stunning in its beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karajan at his best!","review":"Don't listen to all those old farts who tell you this is no good. I've heard several recordings of the Mahler 5 from the so called Mahler experts and this one surpasses them all. Most of the criticism towards Karajan stems from him being a commercial success, a sellout to some and has nothing to do with the quality of his work. Some reviews of this CD are a perfect example of this.Karajan did his homework for this one and the BPO sounds fantastic. Add to that, the sound engineers at DG did an amazing job. The album notes do mention that Karajan himself was delighted with the master tape and he should have been. From an accoustical standpoint, this is as good as it gets for a recording from 1973. I wish most of my newer DDD CDs could sound this good! Buy it and be amazed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful Mahler fifth for your collection","review":"There is no doubt that the Berliner Philharmoniker under von Karajan was an excellent orchestra with a uniquely 'polished' sound. It is however arguable whether this sound is appropriate for the music of Mahler, which often involves themes like pain, loss, and death.Compared with Barbirolli's, Berntein's (DG), or Kubelik's (Audite and Tahra), Karajan's version of the Fifth lacks the warm expansiveness of the former and the sheer energy of the latter three. I get the feeling that the Berliners' playing is a little too deliberate. Personally I like my Mahler fifths a little more rugged and spontaneous.A big plus is the fourth movement, Adagietto, that is very fine and very sweet.Karajan's serves as a good alternative version. For a first choice, any of the above mentioned four recordings, especially Barbirolli's, will serve well.Better still, get them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"great replacement, tho a bit pricey","review":"This was almost perfect size to replace the original burnt out heat plates.

Not ready to sink another $400 or more into a new grill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not fit without modification","review":"Modification was definitely necessary for this to fit my grill. At this price, these should fit from the get go. If you buy these, plan on a lot of work, these are not easy to bend.

I have to return it because maybe I might have received a defective one.Essentially, the issue is that the adapter of the hdmi cable seems to have \\"bad contact\\". With hdmi, you plug it in and it is supposed to work. However, with this 50' cable, it will lose signal or show funky color(dark scenes/portion) unless I bend the adapter a little or adjust the angle of the adapter attached to the laptop a little. I don't know if this issue is related to the length of the cable or not, but if I held on or keep bending the adapater, it seemed to work fine(for the couple minutes that I tried). I tried connecting the laptop with a short hdmi cable and I didn't have this issue, so I know it's not the TV or the laptop's adapter...Overall, I'd say that if the cable works, it would have been a good deal...but for me, I had to return it because it's defective.

The last 7-8 minutes are especially ethereal. Perhaps Karajan and Reiner have better known recordings, but this one beats them both (and I'm a BIG Reiner fan.) After hearing Levine's rendition, Karajan's left me flat. The Don Quixote is also exceptional. Great sound in both pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutter struggles with Sibelius - and loses","review":"This is one of the worst Sibelius Concertos I've ever heard. Mutter struggles once again with the technical challenges of the piece and comes up short in terms of artistry. Her entrance in I is too muddled, and she slows down too much during technically difficult passages. In this case, her artistic ideas do not serve well in preserving the clash between 'fire and ice' in this piece. I would recommend Sarah Chang's Sibelius Concerto, a far superior recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound and...what?","review":"Mutter has got a really fabulous tone and it is always pleasing to listen to the sound of her violin. But musicmaking requires something beyond the mere tone, I believe. Where are the rhythm , musical idea, and especially,'CONSISTENCY' that support the flow of music in Mutter's Sibelius? Previn and Dresden Staatskapelle are wonderful and together struggle to cover the shortcomings of the soloist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilfiger socks gone bad!","review":"These socks were much inferior to the previous ones I have purchased.

The reason i didnt give it 5 stars is that i am not feeling the beats as much. Some of the beats are really nice, like windows, and the immigrant, but there are some weak tracks lyric wise and beat wise on this album. The content of a few tracks on this album just doesnt fit with the flow of the rest of the album. It is well worth the money though, the good tracks on this album amazed me.

Molly Ringwald gives a fine performance. However, I fell in love with Robert Lindsay's character and became an instant fan of his after this performance. This story makes you believe that \\"love-at-first-sight\\" is possible, and that \\"with money or love, you've got to gamble to strike it rich\\".

The first two or three songs are good, they are the only stuff that keeps this cd from being a one star thing.

The bag the buttons were in looked like it was played with a lot, and 3 of the buttons are subsequently missing! All I got were the Dealer, Small Blind and Big Blind buttons. I didn't get the Reserved, Kill, or Missed Blind buttons. Quite disappointing for a product that's supposed to be new, and it looks like it wasn't.I want to exchange it for another one, but since it's sold by Chips and Games and fulfilled by Amazon, I can't do an exchange.

I loved the way it cooked plus cleanup was a cinch. But then it just stopped heating and nothing I did (including pushing the reset button) could get it working again. I've never been crazy about the way the plug inserts in the back of the fryer - for safety, I suppose, it's magnetic and didn't ever seem to be fully connected the way I would have liked. But that wasn't the problem with heating either. I called Customer Service and they told me the only thing I could do was take it to the nearest service center - which is over 100 miles away. I'm buying a different brand for a lot less money. If I knew it was only going to last a year, I never would have invested $100 in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for entertaining","review":"My sister-in-law purchased one and after seeing her use hers we decided to get one too.

I would recommend this fryer to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"deep fryer","review":"DeLonghi D14522DZ Dual Zone 4-Liter Deep FryerI purchased a DeLonghi fryer very similar to this one. ( I don't know the model number, but the features are the same). It has the magnetic cord connection and the drain spout. It fryed the food as it should but we only used it about three times in the first year and it wouldn't work anymore after that. The company does not have repair parts available, but then what would you expect, it's made in China. They want you to pack it up and ship it out for repair. There is a $24.95 charge for them to set it on their work bench.The magnetic cord is a pain to connect and keep connected. It tends to fall off or break the connection too easily. I would hard wire that if I could get the part for the electrical repair. I would not recommend this brand to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior Quality","review":"The deep fryer worked great for the few times it worked. The product only lasted a few times as plastic parts on the housing did not hold up to the heat. The holder for the heating element cracked after just a few uses making it inoperable. The part to replace is as expensive as the unit making it about $20.00 per use. Not a good ROI! Will not purchase DeLonghi products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it 0 stars","review":"Most expensive, worthless piece of junk I've ever bought. This fryer gets great reviews, but it has a fatal flaw - the safety mechanism on it is a little ticklish, and keeps shutting down the power to the fryer frequently. The result is disgusting fried food, since there is no way to maintain any consistent temperature. I wish I had bought something reliable like a fry-daddy that will just stay on while I'm frying. The draining mechanism is nice, but that's little consolation when the food tastes terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine twice then stopped working at all","review":"This was a gift and we only used it twice, to make Rosettes, a dainty scandinavian Christmas cookie. So I wasn't even that hard on the thing. When we tried to start it up this last Christmas to make the cookies it wouldn't turn on. I jiggled the heating device and it would turn on only briefly. Looks to be an electronic issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"All good except basket","review":"The unit works as advertised. The temperature control seems to be accurate and the heating element is fast. My only complaint is the basket. It is stamped out of a sheet of metal rather than made from round or tubular stock. Because all the holes are a result of cuts in the metal, all the holes in the basket have rough edges which allows batter and other items in the fryer to stick to the basket way to easy. It is generally easy to clean (except basket). I don't know whos idea the magnetic power cord is, but what a joke. Don't bump it or you will loose power way too easy. If this is some kind of safety feature then someone (probably a government) really missed the mark. The only way to make a deep fryer totally safe is not to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this a favorite?","review":"The lid is hard to seat right & is not hinged so you're stuck trying to figure out where to put this hot oily lid.

I took it out of the box, cleaned it, put in the oil to the max line and tried to plug it in. First the magnetic plug is touchy. If you just bump it, it falls off of the unit. My plug didn't work, it just won't make a connection. If it was a normal plug, the fryer probably would have worked. I now have to drain out my oil, reclean it up and send it back.

Electronics died and I couldn't find the same unit so I purchased a D14427DZ (same unit with digital temp control). Electronics died. Got another. Same fate. Got this unit. Thought great, the digital temp was replaced with analog. Problem solved. Wrong!!! It died too. On number 4 of this model. I have had other DeLonghi products and been happy, but 3 of 4 of this model died, and 1 other model died. If it would not die it would be a great product; however, not worth the agrivation. Hard to salvage a pot of warm fat laden fry's!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Big and Plug is in bad spot","review":"This unit definately has more than one flaw. Be aware that this is a pretty large appliance to have sitting on your counter. It is fairly deep for a home counter. Also, the electrical plug comes strait out of the back of the heating unit, so this increases the depth of the fryer. The other issue is the sensor on the heating unit where it attaches to the oil pan. As stated in the other comments, if this is not seated properly, the unit shuts off. So if you don't have LOTS of depth on your counter, the electrical plug bumps into the wall, and unseats the heating unit just slightly and the fryer shuts off. This happens ALOT. The unit is very easy to clean though."},{"rating":"1","title":"with light use broke down in a few months","review":"Broke down in a few months with little use.

When a person is in the military, and they are given orders they have difficulty with, do they obey their commander, or their conscience? Would they be willing to go with what they believe against orders, even if they would be executed for it?This movie was made at the end of the Cowboys are the good guys and Indians are the bad guys era. It is much more historically accurate, and shows things from the Indians point of view also. James Garner and Vera Miles are brilliant as always. There are some hair-raising moments which add to the action, as well as humorous and heart touching ones.I saw this on DVD, and would have liked to have seen an interview with the actors, especially what it was like to have worked with the animals involved. Who else but Disney would have come up with James Garner being chased on a camel ? So much fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch this movie if you have children or care about animals","review":"We were drawn into this movie and liked it up until the last few minutes when some stupid idiot shot and killed the mother camel, Rosey. What a stupid and cruel way to end a FAMILY movie. I think life will teach kids about death without a movie doing it. It is of the same ilk as \\"Ring of Bright Water\\" where another idiot kills the star of the show, an Otter, with a shovel at the end of the movie.

He shows the nice widow woman how to start a cattle ranch instead of tring to far or fish.OLI is very boring. Not one of my three kids stayed for the end. And isn't that the true test of a movie.

I acquired this book as part of my recent appetite for understanding JFK/RFK.I found it to be a light-weight overview of the major periods of JFK's life, along with some information on RFK and Jackie. While it revealed a few new things I hadn't heard before, this book is really of interest primarily as a coffee table book for ocassional perusal, and not for study. It's a great combination of stories you will have heard and pictures you have already seen.The accompanying CD, however, is particularly interesting in what it reveals about JFK the man and his way of being. Overall, I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mainly for die-hard Rick fans","review":"Count me in as one of the die-hards. I enjoyed this collection but from a quality perspective the majority of these tracks are not close to his best works. I'm not a fan of multi-vocal tracking and several of the tracks are in this vein. Rick had a good voice and this type of production simply clouds his vocals. Of special note are selections like \\"I Need You\\", a smooth ballad, and \\"California Free\\", a country-rock piece, both of which showcase Nelson's talents.I'm a big fan of liner notes and the included 26 page booklet is almost worth the price of admission; chocked full of great information and with the back page featuring a color fan photo of Rick and his beautiful wife Kristin.

Most, if not all of these bears, came to Clise after their earlier lives with their original owners. Clise celebrates them with short descriptive essays, personifying each bear with its likes and dislikes. Most of the accompanying photographs are black and white, although there are a few color photos. Ophelia, who is the star of other Clise books, is one of the bears profiled in this book.I have owned my copy of \\"My Circle of Bears\\" since my teen-age collector days in the early 1980's. It has survived college and numerous moves in my adult life, and I am still enchanted by the sweet and sentimental trip in this book. In these days of busyness and stress it is a delight to visit bears who dress in Edwardian underwear and lace, wear French pastry cones, and have passions for things like piano, heart ornaments, their delusions of grandeur, and each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brotha lynch's lynch by inch album review","review":"This whole album is OFF DA HOOK.

Heavy on \\"who\\" \\"what\\" and \\"when\\", this text never offers the reader any explanation of \\"why\\" anything has happened in the Sudan. The civil war in the Sudan is a result of a number of forces, not the least of which are colonial rule, economic strains, and ethnic and religious tensions. O'Ballance's book does justice to none of these factors. Historians often get annoyed with journalists because they don't take history into account.

It looked just the book for me to start learning Swing. (I know Java already). When I looked through the book I was shocked to see that it was little more than a doorstop. Gutz is one of those few gifted individuals who really knows what he's talking about. BUT doesn't know how to explain it clearly. Apart from his coding style and the last two chapters this book rushes through every aspect of swing with very little to say about all parts of Swing.

It 's light reading but gives you enough detail to understand the basic concepts and components in Swing.Once you've read through the entire book you'll have no problem transitioning to the Swing components. The code samples are simple and straight-forward, although not very useful when looking for more complicated, practical, real-life examples, but it's a start in the right direction. The book was one of the first Swing references released.Definitely worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good UI Guidlines.

Even so, far too many important issues are glossed over and there are many, many typos. Overall, a very rushed job.The author is definately a hold over from the AWT coding days; his applications tend to subclass JFrame (a now unecessary habit) and he avoids all use of inner classes without any explanation of their pros or cons.The chapters build, in a rather unpredictable manner, towards the more complex examples, which mix JTree and JTable together.On the flip side, the book is very effective at uses screen grabs and illustrations to demonstrate ideas (a weakness in other books, notably Eckel's \\"Thinking in Java\\").In the final consideration, I seem to be liking this book less as I refer to it more and more.

This is unacceptable, and LWW's customer service at 800-638-3030 states that no one has mentioned this problem and they don't know what to do about it. Anyway, if you have the second edition of this book, I dare you to find any information on pulmonary embolism. If you do, tell me what page it's on. Thank you in advance.

For one, the face off plate does not snap in easy at all. It almost feels you have to force it in. Secondly, why does a stereo needs a reset button?!! I had problems with some buttons which were doing something they shouldn't, as if it was programed wrong. For example the volume knob was also a button to scroll between the bass and trebel... well each time I pushed the button, it would turn up the stereo. I hit the rest button, yet it didn't work. In my experience, a deck that has a reset button must have problems from the get go! I had to return two of these brand new decks due to malfunctions. I don't suggest this deck at all!Lastly, it's difficlut to read the screen. My dash slants slighty which causses a slight glare. There is no brightness control at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great receiver","review":"I also found that the face plate was a little difficult to snap in. This doesn't bother me as I'll never take it out. The radio was a snap to install and it worked just fine the first time. All the features work. One thing; when you first start up the unit, make sure you put it in stereo mode. It took me 15 minutes to figure out why my left speakers weren't working. I love the bluetooth. The sound is great over the speakers and the microphone picks up your voice just fine. Unlike other brands, you cannot call for tech help if you run into a problem.

But then only three days after that the toy started repeating the opening line like a broken record again. It was creepy, annoying and obviously, not soothing. I thought maybe, because I had purchased it resale, that it was just not working. However, after reading other reviews, I realize that it just ate through the batteries in only three days and that the broken record routine is what happens. I am shocked that three C-cell batteries only last three days. While it was soothing when it worked and my 6 month old son loved it, I can't afford to replace batteries that frequently so we have abandoned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but loud","review":"We really like that this soother has both the projector so the baby can look up and parts that move on the screen for her to watch.

I know I could probably find a tight screw, as another review pointed out, but honestly do not have time or patience for this2) Batteries run out VERY quickly. We have it on the lowest sound setting and batteries run out after only a couple weeks. My other daughter has a very similar toy and batteries last at least a month, but its more like 2-3 months. When the batteries run out, the music starts to skip. You can turn off the projector, and that fixes this problem, but that's the part my daughter likes the most.3) We have had problems with it not shutting off. This may be a function of low battery energy as well.

When the batteries are running low it repeats \\"Its Lullaby time\\" in a voice that sounds like it should be in a horror movie and then it squeaks and wont stop running until you remove the batteries.My son enjoys the music but the toy is not very interactive. There is one button to press that starts the music to whatever you as a parent have it set to.

We have travelled a lot (home 2weeks, gone 2weeks..) and this has been all we need to keep him sleeping like he does at home. It did develop the grinding squeak but it fixed itself after a month. It didn't bother him so I didn't let it bother me. He loves the projector light, if I dont turn it on - thats what eats the batteries up!!! - he immediately gets up and turns it on for himself. I just invested in rechargable batteries and would gladly buy another one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product...poor manufacturing!!","review":"I bought this for my 7 month old to replace his mobile and he loves it! My only problem is a horrible crank noise it makes when the wheel turns and the fact that it eats C batteries like caviar!

I love the ceiling projection and the ability to set the duration of play. My husband loves the sound sensor which will turn the melody on when it senses baby sounds for a couple of seconds.

The product didn't quit running, it would keep reiterating itself, like a broken record, instead of turning off or continuing the song.

She is a skilled writer who engages the reader with ease and makes you want to continue reading. Not only was she the author of this book, but Helen Zia also participated in many of the protests engaged during the Civil Rights Movement. It wasn't just the Black Power movement that made the Civil Rights. It was the combination of coalitions created by all colored and white groups fighting for the same demands of equality, education, prosperity, liberty, and happiness. In Asian American Dreams, she puts into focus certain mind-shaping events that helped propel the Asian American movement during the late 60's and 70's. A must read for any person wishing to understand the Asian involvement in Civil Rights."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal & political history","review":"Ms. Zia's has written a book that artfully blends personal, familial and cultural issues.

He plays the Suites slowly but with much feeling and freshness."},{"rating":"2","title":"reference interpretation","review":"The 6 cello sonatas are not as technical (i.e. dry) as, say, The Art of Fugue, yet they do not make for facile listening either. With this in mind, I would describe Fournier's interpretation as the most suave on record. If painting were used to locate the Bach/Fournier 6 cello sonatas in the spectrum of interpretations then this rendition comes the closest to impressionist. Then Rostropovich's would would be constructivist and Casals' would be expressionist.So, in case you either want to temperate the harshness of this more technical work of Bach or like everything impressionist then Frounier's rendition is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fournier Cello Suites","review":"I love the way Fournier played. I had recordings of other pieces played by him, but hadn't thought to listen to the Bach Suites. I'm glad I ordered this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The one to get","review":"Of the five versions of the Bach cello suites that I have heard -- Rostropovich, Starker, Yo-Yo Ma, Casals, and Fournier -- the Fournier in my opinion must get the nod as the finest overall. Ma seems mannered to me, and Starker a bit on the dry side. The Casals is important historically, but I find it stiff in its phrasing. There are moments in the Rostropovich set that I treasure above the corresponding moments in the Fournier, but the sound is muddy and Rostropovich's intonation is, honestly, not all it could be in all instances. The Fournier is beautifully recorded, despite the rough spot noted by several other reviewers, rhythmically assured, deeply felt, noble, and completely in the service of the composer. It is thoroughly beautiful. If you like Arthur Grumiaux's version of the solo violin sonatas and partitas, you will like this version of the cello suites."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be avoided","review":"There is indeed something wrong with the Gigue of the Sixth Suite, as with every other movement in every other Suite on this recording. But the culprit lies in Fournier's performance, which sounds rather uninteresting and somewhat detatched. This album leaves \\"the world as it should be,\\" preserving the status quo and offering nothing terribly new or interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decidedly Average","review":"There are truckloads of recordings when it comes to these Cello Suites, as the earlier reviews make clear. This album represents sort of a middle-of-the-road performance in relation to the other available options. It is neither terribly good nor terribly bad in terms of technique or musical concept; even the price of the CD places it in the middle of the spectrum. Spend a little time listening to musical samples from other recordings of this work, because you are likely to find cheaper and/or more compelling alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"This is a completly messed version of the suites. I absolutely hate it. The playing is so stiff, it's hard to listen to. The quality is terrible, and I have never listened to this kind of recording of the suites before. There are notes that are wrong, and the playing does not sound professional at all. I recommend that you buy Rostropovich's suites, Yo-Yo-Ma's, or Cascal's. Those are much better than this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity on four strings","review":"The cello as we know it has four strings, not six, as a previous reviewer suggested. They really shouldn't allow those martians to review our earthly affairs! As long as I'm writing this, I might as well mention that I agree with the person who said there are better recordings available at lower prices. This cellist (Fournier) seems to lack confidence in his playing. Maybe he's confused by the extra strings on his cello."},{"rating":"2","title":"exceptional album","review":"This recording, compared to other versions of Suites, definitely stands out in the sound quality level. While Fournier's performance is obviously as close to perfection as possible and his instrument amazes with beautiful rich sound, the recording engineers did a great job here as well. While I enjoy all my other Cello Suites albums (Casals, Rostropovich, Cassado), when I desire maximum audio clarity and perfection, I play this Fournier's album.I see that some reviewers keep accusing Fournier of playing too mechanically, without enough passion and such. I strongly disagree - I'd instead say that other performers use much more expression. Which approach is more appropriate is undeniably matter of personal preference of the listener - I personally keep enjoying all the great versions of Cello Suites alongside each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great set","review":"For me, the suites opened up when I listened to Fournier and Wispelwey simultaneously, movement by movement, back to back. The pieces place heavy demands on the listener and reward in kind, in time. For that initial inroad, a dual set approach may work for some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pool quality - Poor shopping experience","review":"Bought this item from handhelditmes (IGG factory) directly, not through Amazon.

However, despite how much Magellan charges for this product, they also charge for updates. This is particularly unfair since the updates, according to the Magellan web site, fix bugs in the original program. I would have to pay $ 80.00 for an update. I'm not going to pay it.

It may be a good book for adults, but to classify it as young adult is a mistake. No 7-9th graders would even be able to comprehend this story past the first page.

He has one slight impediment to conducting: he doesn't care for music very much. Or at least not music that embodies thought and feeling. Music for Strings is one of the most sublime testaments in Western music. The shattering climax of the first movement couldn't make Bartok's meaning plainer. But you'll never learn that from this perverse rendition. Boulez deliberately ignores the forceful accents, smoothing over them because he finds strong accents sentimental and stupid. The result is cynical, pedantic, and profoundly ugly. And the less said of this decidedly less than Miraculous Mandarin, the better. Any recording by a conductor who sympathizes with this music is preferable."},{"rating":"2","title":"takes forever to receive","review":"this is a great deal if you're not in a hurry. i make sure i come back well before i have to recharge my minutes, it takes couple weeks for it to arrive if you purchase from amazon. i dont understand why they dont just \\"digitally delivery\\" this item, all you need is the code on the back of the card but it comes in a HUGE packaging box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Benefits Galore","review":"460 minutes of talk time!

It has a clear plastic insert that goes inside to keep the seed dry and the seed does stay dry most of the time except in a really hard downpour.My complaint is, that I've only had it a short time and it already fell apart at the hinges. Then I realized upon inspection that they didn't even really connect the top hinges very well at all. There are holes in the hinge, but it looks like it was just lightly soldered on. No wonder it came apart at the hinge. This caused it to fall - it didn't fall very far but hit the deck and the inside plastic cracked.I really love how it looks. It is by far the favorite feeder I've had concerning aesthetics. However, it's not worth the price if it doesn't even make it through one summer without falling apart. I hope they fix this flaw. Just a little extra effort in the factory and this would be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great All-around Feeder","review":"I purchased this feeder for the size of the tray to accomodate all birds in my rural setting and it works great. It is shared by Chickadees, Tufted Titmice, Cardinals, Carolina Wrens, Bobolinks, Arkansas(lesser) Goldfinches,& Purple Finches. Only the Juncos and my neighbor's Guinea Fowl haven't tried it! It accomodates several birds at once, the ones who like to sit-to-feed and the grab-&-run feeders alike. Nearly ideal for photographing from my study window(1 foot away on a swing-away, wall-mounted plant hanger) & the nervous feeders usually go to the crape myrtle 4 feet behind it to eat what they grab. Only drawback is no roof overhang, but some birds like to perch on the ironwork top to wait their turn.

The recommendations that readers/buyers have made were right on. No NOISE from a fan! Even heat, easy to roll on the wheels. Actually, no negatives.

The design is such that you have to hold the unit to even push it and get burned. This is a poor design and I would not recommend this especially to homes with kids as it gets too hot to touch, even to operate the switches. It does heat a space but with a broken switch I don't think it is safe. I have to pay for return postage for service and so is not worth it since there is no service center near me and postage is a lot. I see how this company makes a profit by selling stuff that is too expensice to return for service. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 Month Review","review":"This is the best heater I've used. I tried a couple other types of heaters before this, forced air and micathermic, and they both had drawbacks I couldn't live with. This radiator worked out for me, mainly because it doesn't dehydrate the air as much. Also, it is completely silent except for a soft click when it cycles off and on.The only problem with this heater is it doesn't work well on high. It seems to overheat when it has been on high for hours. And, the heat radiates through the front panel and warms up the heat sensor, causing the unit to constantly cycle off and on. It works great on low and medium settings though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delonghi 7707 Oil Filled Heater","review":"I have owned a similar DeLonghi heater for 14 years which has been fantastic, so I decided to purchase a new one which I planned to use in my home office. I have had the 7707 for about two weeks now, and I have decided I will be returning it. It functions just as good as the older heater, but it gives off this very potent oil type smell. Being that I work in my home office all day, and not knowing what is causing this smell, I am choosing not to be breathing this all day in an enclosed area. When I first turned it I didn't think much of as I thought it was just an oil coating or something on the heater which would burn off after a day or so, which is why I have kept it for two weeks, but it us still just as strong and the smell is not limited to my home office.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emits a bad smell","review":"I've run the unit for 2 days straight and it still emits a really bad smell.

The faint smell is present after the unit is heated up. Not sure if the slight smell will still occur after several use of the heater.Update Nov 2012:Used the unit for couple of winters now, and it is still running like a champ. To answer my own question, the faint smell does go away after approx 2 uses. Have since purchased another unit for my grandmother who resides in a 55+ community.

It has not leaked since, but both of my Chinese manufactured units are of much lessor quality, and only have about 60% to 70% of the heating capability, when brand new, as my ten year old Canadian made unit that I bought at Home Depot for a full price of $39.95.Both units, after only a total of about five months of light use are starting to fail when used to try warm up a small area of around 50 square feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy Thermostat","review":"Possibly a defective product, but the thermostat cycled on and off LOUDLY even when the unit was not anywhere near the room temperature called for.

My house is 360 sq ft and this is the primary source of heat. It heats up quickly, is attractive enough, moves around easily, and will probably work for most people. I knew that I was going to have to supplement it as a heating source but there are times when I just don't feel it's putting out enough heat. I've had different brands of this style of heater in the past and based on my satisfaction with my portable DeLonghi air conditioner this summer, I decided to give this heater a shot. My other heaters a) broke--literally spilling oil when one was knocked over in the night which is unexpected and b) died after less than two years. I did quite a bit of research first. I can't really find any fault with it and will probably buy a second, slightly smaller one of the same brand for the other room when I can afford it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was good while it worked","review":"I purchased this Delonghi EW7707CM heater about a month ago, but didn't need to use it until this past week.

That is, it heated well until one of the two switches refused to activate after being switched on, leaving me with only the \\"low\\" setting working. I will not attempt to return the unit for service or replacement because the return postage is too expensive. I'll put it out in next spring's subdivision garage sale and hopefully get a few bucks back.

Elements in the bottom heat oil which circulates through tubes which get quite hot and radiate warmth. Aside from clickings from the thermostat, it is silent. It is slow to warm a larger area because it's relying on thermodynamics rather than a forced fan but will eventually do the job and do it quietly and well. I have two of them, one a fancy digital controlled model with timers, the other a no frills basic model. Both were made in Italy and have been trouble free. A friend bought a more recent basic model and it was from China and a little poorer in quality and smelled bad for a long time so pay more if you can find an Italian one.

The unit was delivered in one day from Amazon with regular delivery.I am delighted with its quiet operation and fairly high heat output, sufficient to keep warm a medium sized room in New York weather. The unit is easily portable as it is on wheels. It gave a slight smell during first few days of high power use, but the smell is hardly noticeable, and gone after a few days. I found the preset comfort heat button to be too hot a setting for my liking, and use the included thermostat at setting 4 (range 1 to 6).

Even though I think it is a manufacturing problem I was told I have to pay the shipping costs for it to be serviced in a service center (new radiator!!). After I considered the cost of shipment of this quite a heavy piece I continuted using it, the spark went away but the heater seemed not to be able to warm up my baby's room on a highest setting. After a month's of use (nights only) our electrical bill was $150 higher than normal - it eats a lot of energy (1500W).

It heated our 200 square foot room nicely, but it gave off a strong odor that I thought smelled like \\"hot metal\\" and my wife desribed as \\"hot oil.\\" After talking to a friend who had a similar heater, and reading various reviews on the internet, we thought maybe it was a \\"new\\" smell that would burn off. In fact the manual states that there may be a smell that will burn off after about 2 hours. Other reviews we read were more pessimistic, stating the smell never burned off. We shared that latter experience. I put the heater out on a porch and kept in on for several days... well over 30 hours. The smell never went away when the heater was on and even on the open porch we could smell it within from couple of feet away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic Fumes","review":"I like the silent, steady heat provided by oil-filled radiators, but this particular model emits toxic fumes. The odor is somewhere between burnt rubber and paint remover. It irritates the back of my throat and the fumes predictably intensify with a higher heat setting. I've been able to burn off most, but certainly not all, of the fumes by running it outside on the porch for four hours.Bought a similar (non-delonghi) heater at wally-world for thirty eight dollahs and have noticed no fumes from this cheapo model.

You have to have some clearance around them to keep nearby items from catching fire and this takes up a lot of much-needed floor space.2. The heater needs a ceiling fan moving or some other kind of air stirring to work to its best effect. I prefer a heater with a fan setting that will stir the air up instead of just a radiator.3. The heater is slower than my smaller fan-based heater. If you're really cold coming inside, this heater will not get you warm quickly.My husband, who is not as cold-natured as I am, uses his DeLonghi heater in the basement just fine.

In order to solve the problem I had to take apart the entire unit, disconnect all the electric wires and remove the heater coil from the resevior using a pair of channel lock pliers. You'll need to break the o-ring seal on the unit in order to remove the heater coil. I would not recommend this to the inexperienced user.

I gave this a couple of hours of trial, but it just wasn't good enough for my purposes. I also own an older model version Delonghi oil-filled radiator that has a forced fan on it, too.

Two things that I love about the writing are the development of the characters -- seamless beautiful transitions from distrust and dislike to love as well as well-crafted shifts on the timeline (flashbacks) that give the reader insight into the situation and the characters. My favorite parts however are when the characters discuss philosophy. Within the content of the conversations b/t characters there are incredibly thought-provoking statements that I haven't seen in any of her other books and is what really sets this one apart.

The Templar Zombies are awesome for the time, creepy, slow moving and very deliberate, however, a big flaw is the horses they ride, the horse is covered with a creepy tarp and that is all, no attempt was made to make the horses look more zombie/creepy like. The acting will not win any awards, but they do keep you entertained, especially in the original Spanish version. The setting of the ruins is a great locale to film the movie, it gives an auora of inpending doom.

Fortunately, I bought it. Because I think the cast is excellent. After heard it, I found I was disappointed at this recording. Of course, the conducting is great. Levine's conducting is worth buying.Though I am a fan of Cecilia, but her voice is too small in this recording and is not suited well this role.But the most dissapointment one is not Cecilia, but someone who sung Ilia. Her singing sounds like that of Kathleen Battle, and I'm not fond of this kind of soprano. However, the rest of casts are excellent: Domingo and Vaness, Hampson, Terfel provides the best performance.That's why I rated this for 4 stars. And now, what's YOUR opinion?"},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are awesome!","review":"Go to their web site ( darkseed.com ) and listen to samples.

Disc 2 is the reason you want this. It features two long ragas performed in concert, and they're quite astonishing. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is a personal hang up I have about film directors cutting to extreme close ups of musicians every time they smile or nod. Fortunately, that doesn't happen too often, but there it is. The concert was filmed in a beautiful place and the sound is also wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morris is great","review":"I liked this book very much.

Not because it is the greatest piece of music ever performed - I have better CDs, lots of them, alone from Martha - but simply because the performance of the Nutcracker delivers more unadulterated pleasure than almost anything else I own (can't speak for the concerto - i listened to it once, and haven't done so again since)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"I compare this recording to my Mel Gibson Hamlet video. I am glad I have both Gibson and Agerich, just to know where the low end of the meter is. Gibson's reading of Hamlet is ... well ... bizarre, the low end of a scale topped by Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. Bizarre is perhaps the kindest thing one can say about this \\"interpretation.\\" Richter. Cliburn. Bronfman (whom I heard live tonight, a concert that confirmed my judgement). Not Agerich....

It is a terrible movie. People forget their lines, lines which weren't anywhere close to decent to begin with, production values are awful, and, perhaps worst of all, the filmakers take themselves seriously.

In times like these when so many focus only on Klout scores, numbers, and data, Jack shows us the value of keeping history alive. He does it with ease. Escape from Mounth Moriah is a riveting read; I read it cover to cover, not even interrupting for a second cup of coffee.Jack has mastered the art of expressing what others have said with many words. In his chapter NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING he has his father ask the question:\\"Do you want order?\\" \\"Or truth?\\" Usually, they wanted order.George Orwell would have been impressed.My favorite story is I RESIGN. It is about the choice between two words: resign vs. quit. And with it Jack says it all: It is our state of mind and our deliberate choice of words that make us who we are.Thank you, Jack, for this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape from Mount Moriah","review":"While to a large extent the book sooms to be a venue for the author to express his vocabulary, the story still manages to be gripping and believable.

It would be way too time consuming considering the amount of books I read. But this book is SO AWFUL I couldn't resist. First of all, I would like to point out that I really liked Noble Intentions which is why I decided to read Harry's story. But OMG how horrible!! For one thing, In MY Kindle version, Noble is known as Lord Weston. Then in The Trouble With Harry, the author changes his name to Lord Wessex. Which is it?? Can the author not keep track of her own characters or was someone in the editing dept asleep on the job? As far as the story goes? Snorefest! So boring I could barely get through it but since I'm not one to leave a book without finishing, I had to suffer through the nonsense. Harry was NOT the strong male force we come to expect in historicals. I really don't want to read about a man who keeps pushing up his spectacles and how soft his belly is. UGH!! What trash! Please be warned! Don't waste your 99 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, but sweet romp","review":"Harry is adorable and so is Plum, but the story is seriously flawed. The children are annoying, not cute. In fact you really wish they would conveniently disappear with a governess so you can concentrate on the main characters. The mystery takes too long to develop and then the main characters brush it off as unimportant. (Death threats and kidnappings are somehow less important than scandal) The ending is rushed and hardly explained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I found this not as funny as some of Katie MacAlister's other books, but still thoroughly enjoyed reading it.The kids are a HOOT, and the developing relationship between Harry and Plum is wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked It","review":"Nobel Intentions was such a good read I thought I'd read this one since I liked Harry in the book. This was very funny at times but I will admit I didn't like it as much as NI but it was good worth more than the $.99 I paid. I don't think I've read a historical romance with a 45 and 40 year old H/h but it worked. I'll look into others by KM. Happy Reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me interested","review":"The premise was a little far fetched - Harry falling madly in love with Plum at virtually first sight and then two plots working against their happines - Plum's first husband who wasn't a husband who was thought to be dead but really not and someone who is trying to destroy Harry. I enjoyed the characters, especially the little diablos. I didn't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Joy Ride","review":"\\"The Trouble With Harry\\"was a joy to read. It started out slow and before I knew it I couldn't put it down. Some sections were laugh out loud funny and others extremely sweet. By the end of the book I wanted to know more about Harry and Plum so I bought the other two books in the Noble Destiny series. I enjoyed them even though they take place before The Trouble with Harry.

Sp he has his man of affairs put an add in the newspaper advertising for a wife.Whom he finally ends up with is someone who has a lot of secrets and a true love for connubial calisthenics. Probably because she wrote the book on them...literally!This is another delightful entry into Katie's historical series and one I wish she would extend to more entries. We have well thought out characters, an interesting story, mystery (who is trying to harm Harry's children?) and a whole bunch of laughs.I highly recommend this book along with \\"Noble Intentions\\" another of my very favorite \`Katie' historical romance books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Katie Macalister yet!","review":"I love Katie Macalisters fun books.

The hunt for the book built up my anticipation.I was very excited to read it (and usually I can finish a good book in one afternoon), but I found myself losing interest page to page. I became impatient with the pace of the book. The characters failed to capture my interest or admiration. Not feeling invested in the characters or outcome, I quickly lost interest in the entire book. The book fell flat and I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so..","review":"It seems that I have a love hate relationship with Katie McAlister. I absolutely couldn't stand her vampire novels but on the other hand, I absolutely loved The Corset Diaries. The Trouble with Harry is very clear from the beginning - Plum. I couldn't stand the main character. She lacked consistency, at times completely self involved and delusional and at others selfless and matronly. I got no true sense of who she was because she never developed completely. I gave the book two stars because the plot was interesting, but the mystery only remains a mystery because MacAlister witholds information from the reader. The children were a bright spot, and incredibly funny. All in all not the worst book I've ever read, but I probably won't be rereading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish Harry would give me some trouble!","review":"Here's yet another wonderful submission from Katie Macalister. If you enjoyed 'Nobel Intentions' you will love 'The Trouble With Harry'. This book has the same quick wit and sexy interludes. Plum and Harry strike sparks off of each other right from the start. The secondary characters are hilarious (I love Thom and the children). We get a brief glimpse of Nick from 'Noble Intentions' which I hope means a book about him will soon follow! Have no fear and go ahead and purchase this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short and easy to tip over","review":"Our 2 1/2 year old daughter has always been a good height for her age (75th+ %), so we figured any kid stool would work for getting up on the potty and also reaching the sink to wash her hands. She received this Dora stool for her b'day, and it's just too short to be much help. Six months later (and noticeably taller), she still has to work to get on the potty, and reaching the sink is impossible. Also, it's very lightweight, so if she stands too close to any edge of the stool, it tends to tip over. I'm sure it's a fine stool for bigger kids, but my toddler needs a taller, sturdier boost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids step stool","review":"I got the stool and the potty seat for my son who we are attempting to potty train. he loves the elmo theme"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lightweight stool","review":"I was looking for a cute step stool now that my son is potty training. I bought this one in the red/white because it matches his toilet seat. It isn't very high or large in area, but it's enough to help him climb onto the toilet in our small bathroom. It does tend to move if he's pushing at it with his feet, but it's sturdy enough and cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional little stool.","review":"I purchased this so my daughter would be better able to reach the kitchen sink. The stool works great and is extremely sturdy and even mom and dad can use it. My daughter was thrilled with the Spongebob design. The only problem is it gets in the way in the kitchen sometimes, but that is no fault of the stool, and it is holding up great to getting bumped around the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Er, wrong stool received","review":"I am giving this product 4 stars as it works great and my boys love it. HOWEVER, I should like to point out that we ordered a RED Dora stool to match a red seat we already had. We received a PINK stool with Dora dressed as princess. Hmmm. At the time of ordering this pink stool was not even a listed option so I have no idea why we were sent this. Fortunately my boys liked it anyway so we kept it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy","review":"Very pleased with this step stool. Sturdy.

Perfect for what I need it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy. Not great for a child or potty training.","review":"I bought this for my 2 year old as she was toliet training to help her get on the potty and to reach the sink as she was washing her hands. It is not even high enough to reach the sink (not its fault--but it is a very low stool), so it is pretty useless for that purpose. Even at our lower sink, she still cannot use it for that. For the toliet, we have a tile floor, and the bottom of the stool is plastic with no rubber covering so the stool slides everywhere, so she cannot actually use it to climb on to the toliet. It slides everywhere and she has fallen.I gave it two stars because it is a cute stool and if you are using it for another purpurse, such as maybe a playroom or something else, it is a cute stool, but most moms I know buy these kind of things for potty training. It it NOT for that purpose. Try something with a rubberized bottom or something multilevel or higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money!!","review":"This flash is slow slow slow, it is not much better than the flash on my 400D as in terms of light but it is cheap, cheap all the way around.

The slave flash did fire when the camera flashed, but the camera would not pick up any of the slave's light. Apparently the slave was not in sync with my camera and its internal flash. I adjusted the camera settings for every possible shutter-curtain / synchro / flash output / red-eye combination, but had no luck. I finally got some results by switching out of the camera's automatic / program modes and into the camera's manual mode; but each different scene then required 7-8 trial shots to adjust the shutter/aperture settings. It was too much of a hassle for me. I returned the flash to Adorama for a refund.Overall, I liked its look, its bounce feature, and its price. I wasn't able to test the non-slave regular flash function....And perhaps the slave option would work with a camera different than mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I bought this to save some money.

His success in making himself what he would become would cause hims to avoid questioning himself. During unique times, this would cause him to stay trapped in a path that would only end in frustration.

Somehow the interplay between melody and accompaniment (always an equal partnership in Schubert's hands) is heightened by this experience.Not that the entire album is appropriated by the cello standing in for a vocalist: the opening work is \\"Sonata for Arpeggione and Klavier\\" and is one of the highlights of the CD. But just listen to the performances of 'Standchen', 'An die Musik' and 'Du bist die Ruhe' and hear the extraordinary marriage between the piano and cello, singing as beautifully as any other version. This is one of those CDs that bears keeping out for multiple listenings in the late evening. Grady Harp, October 2004"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go for the Arpeggione Sonata!","review":"I bought it after hearing the deeply moving performance of the Arpeggione Sonata (5 stars). Not for the songs without words (3 stars), though they make pleasant listening. The cello lacks the liveliness of the voice and tended to make the songs overly sentimental, rather like hotel lounge music. The originals are to be preferred, unless you have an aversion to singers. But if you are looking for high quality hotel lounge music instead of Schubert, here it is (5 stars for that!)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"The chain is a little flimsy, but the tiger eye pendant itself has good color, and is a nice size--my wife liked it, and that's good enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp Solid Stainless Style","review":"Another beautiful knife from this series.Wonderful balance, solid forge, well built, great edge, stylish, and practical.

My friend suggested the Barron's version to me, but maybe she had a different version because this did not help me at all. The questions were based on definitions, while the actual test was mostly common sense. The part which I found the most alarming, is that this book did not provide an example of an essay, and just told you to consult your professor/teacher, and ask him to rate your essay. Maybe the LAST preparation is worth the buy, but not the ATS-W, because I studied, and I doubt I passed the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I cannot believe that a reputable brand such as Barron's would publish a book with so many logical inconsistencies, grammar issues and incorrect answer keys.

As one reviewer said, it would be more valuable to read Aristotle than to rely on this book. The sheer number of errors and idiotic statements is absurd. I would request my money back, not from Barnes and Nobles, which is where I bought it, but from Barrons, if I only thought I would be refunded. Do not buy.

I use 11x17 only occasionally, but when I need it, I need it. The printer is much more rugged than the typical HP small office / home office unit, which is to be expected given its significantly higher price. The individual ink tanks are a big plus, since 11x17 printing can consume a LOT of ink, and you can easily deplete one color of a three-color cartridge, causing you to discard a lot of perfectly good ink. The footprint IS large, but hey, it prints on large paper. It IS noisy before it starts printing, but that isn't a problem in my situation.There's a drawback if you plan to use this printer for photos -- it can't do borderless prints. It DOES print well on small stock, and since it sits close to my chair, I use its single sheet feed slot to print the address and return address (with a color logo) on the #10 envelopes I occasionally send out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crooked feeder","review":"HP's Officejet Pro K850 Printer feeds paper crooked.

I believe that it was the first time that I'd noticed how beautiful it is when the energy of poetry is fused with prose fiction. Particularly interesting is the fact that, while Toomer wrote a deep portrayal of the issues of race in America at that time, he functioned more as an anthropologist than an insider for, while he was black, he was descended from the socially detached black middle class and had to learn about most aspects of black culture through observation rather than experience. This makes the work that much more powerful. I especially loved to read \\"Blood Burning Moon\\", a story about the fatal competition between a black and white man for the affections of a young, alluring black woman.

Finally gave up and ordered another ThermalTake because I knew it fit and worked with my system... and guess what... this one arrived DOA! I'm sorry, I like a good deal like the next guy, but a good deal consists of value for my money... right all they have is my money and I am sending this one back for a REFUND!

Not many new PSUs will work on a Presario manufactured in 2000 (because of something related to the ATX version and perhaps other things which I can't accurately explain. I found this out the hard way in November 2009 - by purchasing and having to return a PSU that would not power up my system). I contacted Thermaltake directly and was told the W0070RUC would work in my PC. So I bought this, and it works! And I have purchased a second one to have on hand, \\"just in case\\". And incidentally, I now hear hard drive activity again. Also, I can hear some low-level noise from my CPU fan again, which is a joy (believe it or not) because the other PSU was so loud that it was driving me crazy! I'm not sure if I am hearing fan noise from the W0070RUC but even if I am, it is not annoying to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk for the money","review":"Terrible Power Supply.

I have been quite pleased with the performance and reliability. I had absolutely no issues with installation. I really like the cabling, it is wrapped in a black mesh to aid in air flow, and it did wonders for making my setup look more modern and less confused on the inside.When I first got this unit installed, I thought it was defective, because I could barely feel any air coming off of the back. My old PSU was constantly blowing hot air at a high rate. This unit runs cool and quiet under all loads. I felt the unit after 2 hours of heavy gaming, and it felt cool to the touch. I have tried to get this unit hot, or to push it hard enough to kick the fans on high, without any luck. This is the best PSU I have ever owned. As long as this model lasts me for a while, I will probably stay loyal to thermaltake. This is my first one, and so far it has been stellar."},{"rating":"1","title":"May not be suitable for most....","review":"This PSU is larger than normal. It is hard to fit in a case. I am glad I took measurements before buying. This almost did not fit into my case at all, but I adjusted a few things and shoved it in. It took a lot of force and effort to get this unit installed.Once running, the PSU is fairly quiet, and it is not noticeable at all, because the processor's fan makes way more noise by comparison. Still, my system is fairly quite, and I love it.This PSU is good, but I recommend getting more power when possible to avoid issues with video cards and an excess of devices.UPDATE: The PSU burnt out. It has an odor now, and the PC no longer turns on, and it did this while the PC was in suspend mode. I strongly recommend staying away from this PSU."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real power supply for less demanding systems","review":"This is an excellent choice for older replacements and less demanding build-no hi end gaming systems, I work on pcs and have replaced countless motherboards due to power supplies over volt when they die.

This new power supply is much nicer and more powerful than what I had and 2 fans is a bonus.

This power supply is also very quiet and at $40 a very good buy for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead On Arrival","review":"I ordered this power supply based on mostly favorable reviews here and at another site. Also, almost two years ago, I ordered one of these at another site for a friends computer in which the PSU had committed hari-kiri. That one has seen a lot of use and has worked flawlessly, so based on that, in the interest of fairness, I am giving this PSU two stars. I have just RMA'ed the one I purchased for a refund. It has the feel of a quality unit, aka heavy. Heavier is usually better with power supplies, indicating a quality build. It has plenty of connectors and all of the current connectors, all of quality construction. Not sure if Thermaltake's quality control has slipped, although if there is one unit in a hundred of an item that is a dud, I will get it everytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"No complaints.","review":"I bought this a long time ago and never reviewed it.

It has been in service in a poor mans gaming computer for over a year. However upon upgrading both of the sata connectors broke. Just the pull of the cable against the connector had the thin top side (without the notch) snap off. OK! must have done something wrong with that one, no matter I'll be extra careful with this one....no... that just broke too....wth...IF you get this and you need sata connectors, factor in the cost of buying molex to sata converters because the stock ones WILL fail you no matter how gently you treat them. the plastic is about as thick as 5 sheets of printer paper stacked.

But in the end, you get what you pay for. I would not expect to power any video card produced within the last 5 years if not longer. It will tire out apparently.Specifically I used it only occasionally with a geforce 8800GTS video card. So in a way, thirteen months is not long. Especially since only Civilization V and City of Heroes was played on it. The former for a couple weeks, the latter for two months. Outside of this period, there was no heavy strain on the PSU at all.I've learned the hard way that one should overshoot their power supply needs, rather than try to save a buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Used this in my Dell 8300. Was not an exact replacement fit. This one has a power switch on the back of the power supply which I had to shave down to get it to fit as the Dell frame did not have a cut out for this.

Great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verry happy with it","review":"I ordered this on Thanksgiving day, 11-22-07, I rcvd it on 11-24-07, THAT WAS fast, no extra charge. MORE than enough connecters to connect everything I had with plenty left over. It also has a 6 pin pwr connecter for pcie video cards. Would be an easier install if the on/off switch was not on the back of this, as there was NO CUTOUT on my computers case frame for the switch, I simply ground it down with a dremmel tool. Other than that is is a simple install. It has 2 fans that run VERY queit. I bought this for an add on VIDEO card and also because my original Dell PSU was only 330w with a VERY VERY noisey fan of late. Now lets see how long the rebate takes. All connectors fit very well. Someon else though they might be a little snug, but if there is too much slack it is a trouble closing case back up, so I feel it is just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alta calidad","review":"No hace falta decir mucho, simplemente que soporta 2 hdd sata II, 3 DVD-RW, 1 GTS250 y todo con carga, es simplemente excelente, vale cada centavo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit was DOA","review":"I was very impressed with the build quality of this PSU.

Isn't it obvious? At least half the reviews here were written by the author himself! Check 'em out: no Real Name (tm) attribution, no other reviews written by the same person, and Google searches turn up no real person by that name in that city. And they all write in that same quirky, fawning style. Check out his other books on Amazon: it happens there, too. I guess he does it to counter negative reviews and to pump up his ratings.

Sorry, history of science is a small world and there are no Michael Bersteins in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and Disappointing","review":"This book is essentially a weak summary of the life of Descartes with a short chapter at the end about the \\"secret notebook\\".

It is not really that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable","review":"The book has many weaknesses. Descartes' mysticism is not well documented. He suggests that Descartes' work on polyhedrals is motivated by biblical numerology (p. 215), but then a few pages later reverses his claim, and says that Descartes didn't have numerological motivations afterall(pg. 219). He has some interesting information on Descartes and Rosicrucianism, but the question is not throughly explored.Also the book doesn't document its sources well. Its not a scholarly book for that reason. Much of the information/dialogue is based on Aczel's reading of biographer/hagiographer Adrien Baillet. There is reason to question Baillet as a source mainly because he wrote the biography 43 years after Descartes' death. Someone like Rodis-Lewis or Gaukroger wouldn't use Baillet so casually as a source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aczel's worst","review":"I've enjoyed several other Aczel works: Fermat's Last Theorem, God's Equation, Mystery of the Aleph, and I struggled mightily to get through this one, but it's just too dull. Blah, blah, blah, then this clown wrote to that one and said meaningless things; blah, blah, blah, these phrases from this ancient manuscript appeared in this person's letters, proving he was influenced by it. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading, inaccurate, dishonest; good *fiction*","review":"I can only corroborate what other 1-star reviewers have said. Under no circumstances read this book as a historical account of Descartes' life or adventures.The real problem here is that there is just enough truth to make the fiction seem real. You read it, and two years later forget which tidbits about Descartes you've learned from academic resources and which pieces have attached to your memory from rubbish like this.I hope one day the author re-writes this book replacing Descartes with a fictional character. It's a great and intriguing read - but a terribly falsity with respect to history.I also agree with others that exists at least one fake review here."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!","review":"This is the best Cabinet and Drawer Lock I have found, others fall apart this one is very sturdy.

However, one of our twin one-year-olds figured out within a few days how to slide the hook up and out of the mount for the removable hook version, so on the lowest drawers we have had to install the non-removable version.

The instructions are written for metered, digital loops, not continuous playing tracks.So, in all, if you record and mix/master \\"loops\\" and little songs, this software is excellent.

I also only attempted the big 'lotus bud' necklace and I ran out of beads early enough that I started substituting red for blue and green. I really think that if a company is going to sell a bead book/kit combo, they need to put EXTRA beads, and enough to make ALL the projects.The book (more like a booklet) that goes with it is decent enough, but it was a bit suprising to end up with a black and white book for making a colored bead project. It would have been easier to follow if it had been in color.The concept and the booklet are good, but the bead issue makes it lose major stars in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for kids","review":"I wish the beads were included as stated throughout the book.

I also have a wonderful and huge Tamrac camera & accessory backpack which I use when I have to take ALL my equipment with me. I was using the backpack on all of my day trips for quite awhile, even when I didn't need the extra lenses, because I didn't know there was a smaller solution for such a bulky camera with a good sized lens attached. Well, I found this compact Quantaray holster and it's PERFECT. This is what I use now for non-professional day trips where I only need one all-around mult-purpose lens. It really saves me from the backaches and gives me so much more manuverability. The case is extremely well padded on the inside where the lens part slips in. I have a bulky 28-200mm lens on it, which fits in there no problem and I think you could fit a lens up to 300mm in there comfortably if you were using that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great holster case !!!","review":"This holser case is excelent, I needed a case to fit only my Fuji S-2 Pro with a 12-24mm Nikkor plus either a 28-85 Nikkor or the small 80-200mm D Nikkor.It does what I need just perfect !It's a low key case that does not call much attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing examination of America's eating obsessions","review":"An entertaining, if at times slightly disorganized look at the history and current state of America's food fads and misguided obsessions in the name of nutrition.

But I must confess the impression that this was more a work of brainwashing and browbeating than a serious scholarly work. It does have some redeeming qualities, but with its inane rants and often poorly-argued assertions, the book does injustice to the quality exegetical work done by dispensationalists over the years. It gives good insight into the author's thoughts on dispensationalism, but should by no means be used as a general survey of evangelical hermeneutics."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better hermeneutics texts out there","review":"Though I am a dispensationalist and agree with most of Couch's presuppositions, I find that this volume is perhaps the most biased book I have read in my 4 (and counting) years of seminary. With constant barrages of emotionally laden assertions he shoots his arrows at straw men and gives zero credibility to the other side. If you have the choice of reading one general hermeneutics text, do not read this one. If you are required to read this book for a class... well... just try not to get too mad at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dispensational Propaganda","review":"I was quite mislead by the title of the book. While it would appear that Couch intends to survey hermeneutical methods, he instead creates a defense of conservative dispensational hermeneutics. But he doesn't stop there, Couch goes as far as to imply that an allegorical hermeneutic not only is wrong, but also a large contributor to the decline of the Church as a whole. Couch's book is very well written, but ignores the valuable treasures which can be found outside of conservative dispensational hermeneutics. I would recomend this book for anyone seeking to better understand dispensationalists and what they believe as well as anyone looking for a defense for pre-trib and pre-mil views, but to anyone looking for an unbiased perspective I suggest that you continue searching"},{"rating":"1","title":"The first review you see at the top is for a different book.","review":"There was an accident here.

This book muddies the past rather than bringing the Cathers into the light. If a reader wants to search out the myths this is a fascinating read. If a reader prefers accurate knowlege about heretics in medieval southern France, I suggest reading source documents, such as those found in Heresis of the High Middle Ages, by Wakefield and Evans, start with Peter de Bruis and Peter Waldo.

I found the content to be well-researched and the flow of the information was very smooth. The historical content explained a lot of things about how different cultures affected others and interacted with others through exploration and conquests.I did, however, feel that because this book is packed with details and facts, I had to rewind sections to relisten to them if I became distracted by something or if a stray thought popped into my mind. As much as I enjoyed this, I think it would have been better to have read the print version instead of the audiobook.Regardless of the media you choose, this book is highly insightful and worth reading if you're interested in world history, cultural interactions or world conquests.

I used the practice test to familiarize myself with the types of questions that would be asked on the test, being as this was an actual old praxis exam. The information that this guide contained on the subjects that would be tested can be found for free at the ETS-Praxis website. I found the best way to prepare for this exam was to answer as many practice questions that I could find, and then research the answers for the questions that I got wrong. I also used questions from both XAM special education study guides, the one for the cali test and the one for the praxis test. I passed both parts of the Praxis for certification in MD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't prepare for the 2007 test at all","review":"My wife just took the Praxis test this book was supposed to prepare her for. It suggests that legislation and court case decisions are an important subject that will be covered and the practice test does cover it. But guess what? She took the test and there was NOTHING like this on the test. She was shocked. Instead it heavily covered dissabilities and what would be the best course of action in the illustrated situations.It also didn't focus only on common dissabilities. Also mentioned were the less common ones like Mutism and Prader-Willi Syndrome. There may have been different versions of the test, so maybe she just was unlucky.

I'm not sure if I passed; the test dealt with severe disability syndromes, but I'm studying LD students. Will look for another book that is not so out of touch. Even the text book I used as recommended by a college (used in their intro SPED courses) was 8 years behind and had little material that was specific enough to be included on the exam. I was upset because I had studied a lot, and have taught a similar population of students at the community college level for over 10 years, so I should know something about the subject. VERY DISAPPOINTED. Not being up to date with current legal changes in Spec Ed laws was totally uncalled for.

Obviously the higher you can mount these lights the better and farther they will shine. Strong mounting and adjustment hardware, the rubber casing over the mounting hardware gives it a clean look.

This is a book that will attract readers. I can't think of anything more important.

You do lots of reps. of different weight training moves and you see results. Before each section, the moves are demonstrated and very clearly explained. It may not be the most fun to watch (no one in pink tights talking about a \\"step-ball-change\\"), but this will get you results. I appreciate workout dvd's that are clear and easy to follow and demonstrate the appropriate way to do each excercise. Alternating this dvd (along with a few other types of dvd's focused on the use of weights/sculpting exercises)with some cardio has really helped me make some great changes to my body."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome workout","review":"I won't make this too long.

All of the moves are very basic and you do a lot of them. The set is boring and the instructor is boring. I purchased this because everyone on the exchange wanted it. I did it once and put it up for trade right after I finished. Mina Lessig's One Minute Workout is far superior because you can up the weight and the DVD always randomly chooses your workout for you so you don't get bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I started to watch this video so I could be familiar with it before I try the workout. I was shocked to see how unhealthy-looking and skinny Jari Love is. And I am not a out-of-shape person who is put off by very fit/thin people; I'm normally a size 0 or 2. About 10 minutes into the viewing, I had to shut it off and have never tried the exercises because she doesn't appear fit, she appears almost anorexic which, as the title of my review says, I find disturbing. I'll stick with Cathe Freidrich; try her Muscle Max for a really good total body workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is going on?","review":"This is by far the worst video I've ever purchased. Jari Love walks you through a 5 minute workout and that is the only time she is in this video. After the warm up, it turns into an instrustional video where some random man will do a basic move (like a push up) and a voice will explain the move. They dont even do reps that you may perfrom to, they simply explain the move and begin a new move.This may be the style that some people want (I could see men enjoying this style), but I prefer to workout along with the instructer. I did not like this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but not for dabblers","review":"This dvd is serious about toning each muscle group. There are lots of repetitions, and pulsing- which are very effective and tiring. The work out is long, closer to an hour than 30min., so you need some time to do it. The woman who leads the workout is a little cheesy and annoying, but the workout is so good that I found it easy to overlook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"This is a great workout! I am not into weightlifting at all, but I'm trying to get in shape for my wedding (not to lose weight, just to develop muscle). I started doing only the introduction after doing a Pilates session. Perfect end to my workout! Now I'm getting stronger and have moved on to the other leg workouts.

My butt is so sore, I definitely feel the workouts the next day!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does as it says! Slims & Leans doesn't bulk","review":"I was always worried lifting weights meant getting bigger. I wanted to get smaller yet more defined. This tape has taken my body from flab to fab! Okay, not just this tape, I also use her other ones, but you get the gist! Jari's workout style is lighter weights (3-10lb's)and high rep's. I use 3,5 or 8lb dumbbells personally, and for me 8lb's kill! Not only do you get a resistance workout you also get cardio benefits as her moves incorperate multiple body parts raising the heart rate into your target zone. Typically I burn around 430 calories or so doing this. Each of her tapes has it's own style. This one is more focused on pulsing moves, where you really are tearing down that muscle and it burns! This and her \\"Ripped to the Core\\" I think are the ideal companions for strength training. Toss in her \\"Ripped 1,000\\" once a week, and woo-hoo your well on your way to getting slim & lean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense, Gets Results","review":"I think Jari Love is great. She motivates me greatly. I own all of her workouts, but this one I didn't like right away (hence the 4 stars), but once I found the right modifications for me it became a favorite. During the leg sections, I add upper body movements whereever it fits in, like shoulder press, lateral raise, biceps curls, etc.. During the upper body sections, I put on ankle weights and add leg side lifts, knee lifts, etc. This turns this into an extremely efficient workout for me burning lots of calories and getting my heart rate way up even though it's not cardio. I had been stuck on a plateau for a while using heavy weights only and this one got me past it. The muscle definition you get from this high rep workout is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Not the right workout video for me. Although the exercises are effective, the flow seems to go too slow. I lost interest quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good work out","review":"I am such a fan of Jari; this was actually the first Ripped workout that I purchased. The nice thing about this one is that your really focus on one area at a time, as opposed to doing the compound moves in some of her other DVD's. I actually alternate out this one with Ripped 1000 and it really works. I would recommend combining this workout with some cardio- it's a good workout, and you'll definitely break a sweat, but it doesn't so much get your heart rate up and doesn't work as well if it's the only workout you are using. Jari Love is my favorite, I would recommend Ripped DVD's to anyone- just bought another one, in fact!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to add weight resistance to your program - this is the one.","review":"I do lots of aerobics but lacked upper body strength. I wanted to add a weight resistance program to my work out routines to build strength not bulk up. This one was a good choice. The workout is interesting with great instruction. You can start with no weight or light weights and build as you get stronger. I already have increased to a little heavier weights in parts of the video and have only been doing this three weeks. This is a keeper and I plan to keep it incorporated into my workout routines at least twice a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I have been doing the Jillian Michael's workouts for about 9 months and wanted something equally as challenging but different.

I loved the three seasons that were out and considered it better than South Park. Now I loathe that idea. Seth Green not only killed his show, but made it painful to watch. I kept trying to give him the benefit of the doubt, but every new episode seems forced and then there is absolutely almost no plot line anymore. Every episode just seems to say the same thing; Seth hates Bush, Republicans, Christians, and is anti-military. Doing a show about those things may work once or twice...but every episode? I can't even watch the older series anymore, it's just so old and pathetic.

Its funny that the main reason the first and second vol DVD was so great is the very reason the recent ones arn't. These half seasons! I hope they take care of this.Also, the show it self is suffering. Stewie is now a homosexual; far from the violent devil he use to be. The show is not pushing any envolpe anymore. The jokes are old. They keep reapeating everything.

Vol. 6 was funny, yet a bit of a let down. It should be one season per volume. I like some of the special features, but almost a whole DVD dedicated to them, far to much. It is also a bit annoying that Blue Harvest is no included. Fox just wants to squeeze us for all the money they can. I would recommend this Vol. to any fan, if only to complete the fifth season, and for the 100th and 101st episodes.With the way the show is going, I doubt I will buy Vol. 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to Family Guy?","review":"family guy has become such garbage. i cant believe people still find it funny, its downright sad to watch what this once amazing show has become. they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas now, and im so tired of all the lame jokes they use to just take up time(chicken fight, conway twitty) seriously, you have roughly 18 minutes per show and that trash takes up atleast 3 minutes of it. ridiculous, ill stick to south park."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm ashamed of myself","review":"I haven't watched Family Guy on TV in quite a while. I just don't have time on sunday nights. After watching these episodes on dvd, I'm simply ashamed of myself for continuing to support this show. I used to enjoy this show simply for cheap laughs. But sadly, cheap laughs have been overshadowed by Seth Mcfarlane's agenda.South Park is a message show. The Simpsons is often a message show. But Family Guy has always been fast moving, dirty, and funny. Now it's fast moving, dirtier, occasionally funny, and preachy.I get it Seth. You're an athiest. You're a Democrat. You hate the government. Now let's get back to making people laugh. Or at least make an intelligent, substantial argument, rather than simply spitting in the general direction of those you disagree with, or making jokes about Laura Bush getting scraped.To the fans: IF YOU WANT THIS SHOW TO GET BETTER, JUST DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!! It's that simple. Don't buy vol. 7 either. I know I won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show","review":"Great show, yes, but charging so much for only 12 episodes reeks.

Family Guy continues to be a fun and brilliant show. This volume even includes the 100th episode, which is hilarious. Those who are fans of Family Guy and continue to be fans of Family Guy will love this new edition to the Family Guy dvds. The only disappointment is that Blue Harvest wasn't included on the DVD since it was the seasons first episode. Otherwise it delivers all the humor you would expect from Family Guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit Preaching!","review":"I have all the Family Guy DVD sets and have always enjoyed them.

Good transaction. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"American Destruction","review":"Ok, I used to LOVE watching Family Guy. The older episodes are the best. Back when the show was only humor and not rediculous political agendas. I understand Seth McFarlane hates America, but he should not allow his unamerican ideals to be put upon ignorant TV watchers who do not know any better. An episode recently made a comment about Laura Bush killing a man. Whether you are conservative, liberal, republican, or democrat, whether you love or hate George Bush, almost EVERYONE loves Laura Bush and to attack her is absolutely disgusting and this show should be ashamed of themselves. I cannot believe one of my favorite shows has turned into something with as many lies and horrible American destruction as a film by Michael Moore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I agree!

Not to have someone elses political reviews constantly in your face. I recieved this item as a gift. I have every season, however, the show has gotten preachy and uncomfortable to watch. What happened to good ol fashion stupid humor. I think all day. All i need is 30min of pure comedy and feel good entertainment. Now its like watching Brian's democratic hour.there are too many scenes with him. I enjoy the occasional stupid Peter moments. However, i tend to change the channel if its an episode with Brian in it. It was always kind of offensive. Which made it dunny cuz they made fun of everybody. Too bad.

So, I boudght a receiver, but I am not sure the subwoofer works right by itself (in the DVD setup, the subwoofer would receive and redirect all the channels from the DVD). As an entry-level model, it is thus not very useful: who wants to buy a separate receiver, which would cost as much as the whole entry-level system? Just look for a DVD home theater system with aux input if you like to use speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rubish","review":"This is the worst peice of electronics I have ever purchased.

Yet they fail to mention their own test parameters except in very vague terms giving us only total number of test subjects interviewed, less then 2,000!

Perhaps it's not the rollicking spirited style of The Three Musketeers but it's the sweet and yet sad fate of the duke's page that stayed in my head years after. It was a very surprising read - who would have guessed that the page would end up being a woman impersonating a man in order to stay close to her beloved Duke? I like it because it is so different than many of the other books that he wrote and I feel it is done very, very nicely. Mind you, there are a lot of war descriptions but if you enjoy reading Dumas and enjoy a unique little romance then I advise you to definitely check this out. This woman enjoyed it immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"the BAD review is true","review":"I bought this machine for its good value and features like the other positive reviews described.

What a huge mistake!Unless you have a lot of time to waste getting tech support and sending your machine in for repairs or replacements, DO NOT buy this computer!Right out of the box, the Wifi connection was broken like the other reviewer pointed out. Pls the frequent system errors causing unanticipated reboots is also true, these crashes/reboots cannot be caused by any viruses as they happened right after the computer was turned on the very first time and before any contacts of external files. Plus the longer the computer is left running, the more frequent these crahses/reboots appear. In fact, I had to rewrite this review because the computer crashes right before I was going to sumbit it!!!

Canon was so embarrassed about manufacturing this crap that they didn't even put their name on the back side like they always do! Both sides are blank and you can pretty much print on either side because this paper has no coating like the real photo paper.I've literally wasted my money on it. The only thing I use it for is making test-prints if my printer has been sitting untouched for a while. Unless you plan on using it the same way this product makes absolutely no sense.

This Canon matte paper is the worst I have used for quality photos. The printer produces a very dull print using this paper, but when I use matte paper I buy from a local Staples on the same settings I get a very nice print. I corresponded with Canon on this and they wanted me to try various settings using their program, but I got the same poor results. I finally gave up on this paper and cannot recommend it for quality photo printing even though it says on the package that it produces vibrant colors. In my experience, It does not.

I read a previous review stating that it drinks up ink and you can see that when your photo is printed. It left big ink spots on the photo that did not disappear when it dried. It's exactly as it would be if I put poster board in my printer, minus the slight shine. I take my own pictures of my son instead of taking him in and I am a huge scrapbooking fan, hence the reason I bought matte paper; it looks nicer behind a frame and doesn't get the same glare off of it and it looks a little more professional.

Having said that, this paper produces beautiful warm skin tone and brilliant white compared to the Canon Glossy II [which seems to have a greenish tint when compared side by side]. Love the fact that I don't have to worry about finger print. The only negative thing I can say about the image quality is that pictures appear to be overall darker than the glossy paper [especially in the shaded area]. Give this paper a try if you can get over the feeling of being ripped off b/c it feels like regular paper. Better yet, give Ilford Premium Pearl Photo paper a try and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Competitive price, excellent quality","review":"Canon photo paper works extremely well with my Canon i950 color printer linked to an Apple Powerbook.

I am a avid cardmaker and have used cardstock that is heavier weight than this photo paper. I think if it was a heavier weight, I would have liked it more.

John takes a character and surrounds him with family members who are oozing love, affection and support. He tries to teach us about our spirit and what life is about and how one man can learn through the experience of his wonderful family, the answers to the questions we all think about. How easy. The transition the character had to go through to discover the meaning of life was basically a light sneeze. I'd like to see John write a book where you don't have Grandma Rosie holding your hand and Mommy waiting for you to wake up to smother you with kisses. Most readers our looking for answers to Life's questions and look to these books for meaning because they do not have the Callaghan family at their every beckon to reassure them and give them a pillow of comfort about life.

This book did not hit the spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"a WOW book","review":"I really enjoyed this book, admittedly as a fervent John Edward fan.

While his other books are decently written, flow well, and are informative and interesting, \\"What if God Were the Sun\\" was a terrible disappointment. This novel is written in a decidedly juvenile style with one-dimensional, uninteresting characters, a distinct impression the reader is being spoken down to (or perhaps has recently been kicked in the head by a mule), and a thin and predictable plot which makes slogging to the book's end a bit of a groan and a chore. Had there been a remarkable message, keen insight, or a riviting inspirational relevation, the shoddy writing might be excused. Sadly, that is not the case here. Do buy John's other books, but skip this one. John, bless him, should stick to non-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for sharing.","review":"This book acts as a \\"primer\\" on the afterlife told as a simple family tale.

The book starts out in one century, ends in another with no segway or a rather confusing connection aside from love, to eachother. The first few chapters could have been done away with.

A sure winner by the author of JAWS and THE DEEP? Nope. This one had a flimsy plot, little character development, and an ending that seemed hurried. It's an okay read for a dull day, but this might be his weakest work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadism","review":"I finished the book but admit to doing a lot of skimming. The story is unbelievable. I did not appreciate the graphic violence. The main character is an utterly irresponsible father, which made me dislike him. The happenings on the Island are just weird--felt like it was trumped up sensationalism. To me the book, starting with the main character's researcher, displayed sadism. It may be one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot was not thought out, the action rushed, the son's mother dealt with \\"painfully\\". Ugh! I will not read another Peter Benchley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genre pulp and fun read.","review":"Pulled this from my shelf when I had a seven hour flight and by the time I touched down, I reached my destination and finished a greatly enjoyable book. It's fast paced pulpy fun that's loaded with action. Yes, there are major holes and unrealistic circumstances. But think Clive Cussler, not Tom Clancy and you'll be fine. Benchley gets your heart going in the right places and at the same time giving you some great trivia about the Bermuda triangle and pirates. The characters are likable and interesting and the decriptive writing is wonderful. Keep in mind this book was written in the seventies and it does come across as dated in some spots. A staple in a used bookstore, it's easy to find. Grab it. It goes back on my shelf for another go in year or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these bowls","review":"These bowls are wonderful!

Professor Albert Elsen. This book remained the most comprehensive overview of the work and themes of the Abstract Expressionist sculptor from New York City. Elsen's book provides information about the important themes in Lipton's constructed metal sculpture: flight, nature, plants, world war II and factory aesthetics. Elsen chronicles Lipton's career work through the 1930s to 1970. His discussion is a good overview of a major portion of Lipton's career by a major sculpture historian and scholar.

That fear was realized this morning when my monitor was blank and my office had a faint electrical fire odor. Shortly thereafter the computer shut itself down.

Instead of these airy philosophical renderings that we see in many management books today, the author shows his experience with the thousands of CEOs he's coached over the years.

This translation allows specific business practice so it can be applied for bottom line impact without having to waste time intellecualizing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Disappointing","review":"Maybe I expected too much. I was hoping for a work as impactful as Sun Tzu. Instead of allowing the reader to interpret and philosophize, the author made a well-intended but misdirected effort to force the code into specific business principles and issues.

The song, by Michael Gore (Lesley's brother, and composer of the film FAME), has only previously been recorded by Betty Buckley (who starred in the show on Broadway- Barbara Cook created the role in London, and can be heard doing it on a bootleg recording of the show).In any case, Jon does a wonderful job on the song, although some of the lyrics have been changed to accomodate it as a ballad disassociated from the show.

There are a few I've never heard before but they aren't bad either. The only problem is the way it's mixed the CD is essentially one long song and all the selections run together which causes problems trying to rip it to play as MP3's on an iPod since a lack of quiet between selections confuses the ripping programs. Windows Media Player does a good job of separating the songs but it records in WMA files, not MP3's. One solution was to record each CD as one large file. Our dance music station in Phoenix went off the air last year after 6 years so now it's just CD's and the internet.

I loved the Southwest unity here where the script shows Cali, Arizona, and Texas. There are many tomboyish girls and butch women here. Maybe androgyny is celebrated or understood in \\"cholo\\" culture, but this dynamic stands out and no character ever discusses it. Maybe I had a defective copy, but many actors' voices could not be heard. Really, you'd heard background music, one person talking, and another person's lips just moving.

This book was a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth be told!","review":"In this book, Denice Jones makes it clear that she's not just kidding. She really wants us to believe in his \\"ghosts\\". At what cost? Sure, she makes lots of money selling us this, but what about all of her victims?

It seemed very basic and amature. But I kept reading because I was curious and must admit that the story kept me interested. I tried to keep an open mind throughout and thought that maybe it could have been possible that these things really happened to this family. The part that blew it for me was towards the end when it just became too unbelievable. I wont say when as I dont want to give away the story for those who wish to read this.

Michael supposively does see \\"spirits\\" but doubt he is posessed.

Why hasn't this story been given full-hour coverage on TLC, Unsolved Mysteries, The Discovery Channel, etc.? Why haven't Dr. Dave and Dr. Sharon from ... been over to take pictures? My brother lives in Manchester, CT; he's never heard anything about this. This would have been great fiction, however, had the writing been better.

I must inform you, as I don't feel my insight is valid being to me this book was so far fetch. The three insignts turned to 7 and each person who read this book agreed with me. There is just no way this family went through this claiming a true story. If and I repeat if it said fiction it would be exceptable.

The ending was incredibly stupid and so was the thinking anybody would believe this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I have read many \\"true account\\" books on hauntings, this book just seems unbelievable. It seems more made up than any I have ever read. Parts of it seem like it's been taken from movies like - \\"poltergeit\\", \\"Amityville\\", etc... It's just too hard to believe it's true and that Michael would continue playing or even sleeping in his room after experiencing some of the alleged things that went on in there.

Challenging the epistemological contours of traditional scholarship, Foote argues that the complex partnership between Shaw and his associate, Henry George, demonstrates the link between mid-nineteenth century reformist tendencies and the radical movements of the 1880s and 1890s.

Okay, the acting isn't that great, and the special effects are kind of corny, but even with the multi-million dollar big budget movies you see things that are just to far fetched. One look at the new version of King Kong and I need not say more.Ferrigno reminded me of the old 60's versions of Hercules starring the great Steve Reeves. It was entertaining and that's what I look for in a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I have no idea what went wrong. The cast seems like a dream: Lou Ferrigno certainly fits the bill (and he CAN act) but is terrible here, William Berger (star of numerous Italian Westerns) is given little to do but stroke his beard and Sybill Danning only redeems herself by the amount of flesh she has on display. The music is great, but is greater than the film it's playing for.

I turn out very good breads and I followed your recipe exactly.My heart sank as after I made the dough, and the sauce and then turned to assembly.Imagine my shock as a Brooklyn guy reading that you believe that Cheddar cheese belongs in New York Pizza. I followed through the recipe substituting the Cheddar with a bit more Mozzarella, and I can tell you that the pizza was terrible.We tossed it and went out for Chinese.You have no idea about pizza, and Cheddar in NYC Pizza proves it.

Peter Reinhart starts off with the story of his quest for the perfect pizza. In doing so, he takes us to sites of the pizza's origins in Italy where he cooks along side chefs in little pizzarias. Then Reinhart tracks the migration of pizza to America, where we learn about the contributions of New York and New Haven, CT, and then on to more recent contributions in other parts of the U.S. The second half of the book treats us to a variety of incredible and authentic recipies for pizza dough, sauce, and everything on top. Armed with this book I have held several pizza parties in my home and wowed many a guest with pizza much better than I can find in about 90% of the pizzarias around.

However, I find two problems with this book.As a person who really likes to cook I need to know things like the size of eggplants in his recipes. Why does he not indicate the sizes and types. We have many types, but there are two major ones. A large American ones and slender Asian/Japanese ones. Without that information, it's hard to make some of the toppings for puree and such. He talks very sweetly about his wife Susan roasting a bushel of eggplants for later puree. That is great, but what type of eggplants is she roasting? This is just one example. I had to stop from making eggplant puree because it was missing _that_ information.I don't know if it's just me, but I find this book a bit scattered. I have to move around throughout the book to make my first DOC Neapolitan pizza ie Pizza Margherita from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but","review":"I think this is a nice book, you enjoy reading it and you can imagine, live indeed, what author describes.

He tells how to write javascript but does not give you examples of how it should appear. He also tells you about things like applets, scroling messages, etc.. and dosen't give you examples of how to really write them, but then at the end of the hour he tells you've learned them.

For programmers knowing HTML and Perl (CGI), you will pick up on the concepts of JavaScript quickly. As you proceed through the book, it begins to lose some focus, but content is still valuable. Late in the book, examples don't match downloadable code, and some images are missing.

Nevertheless, humanity does need to wake up to some rather unpleasant and disturbing truths with respect negative forces and energies that plague Mankind at present. For more lucid, credible and helpful sources of information I recommend the following books:1) The PATH (by Esmeralda Arana): Describes the nature of the negative forces that prey upon Mankind and provides useful tools for fighting them.2) The Active Side of Infinity (by Carlos Castaneda): Describes what is going on with eloquence and credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear God!

She has seven affirmation statements that will set you free. I think she should have put the seven affirmation statements on her website, let everyone know them and say them, and thereby be free of evil.Also the way that they advertised this book before it came out -- all hype on her saying something so new and different - maybe to Lynn it was, but I've heard this before.I stongly do not recommend this book.

How did she suddenly leave the world of believing thought creates reality and we are one with Spirit to believing in the Presiden Bush cartoon of evil doers and evil forces and an external child like belief in a separate God on a throne above the clouds. It was kind of sad to read, like reading the journal of someone having a nervous breakdown. Most people's breakdowns don't get published though. Hopefully someone close to her will reach out and help her see the beauty of who she really is and there is nothing to fear \\"out there\\" from the \\"others\\" or the \\"evil doers.\\" Luckily, the \\"others\\" are just parts of us that we can work though not some boogie man force in Star Wars. Maybe she will get sober again and see that. It may be hard to realize who you are and have faith in the Divine when you are under the influence."},{"rating":"1","title":"What you believe happens to you....","review":"...is what the author has preached to us in the past. Because she so adamantly believes in what she is writing about in this new book, it will definitely happen to her. I choose to live the principles she wrote about (and which were not original material) in Excuse Me. She claims in the new book that this has never been in print before. That is not true, as you can find this type of programming in other books. We don't need anymore scare tactics. We also don't need to think that we are so special we are going to save the world. Herein may lie the biggest problem with this book. Seems like a rather grandiose idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre","review":"I loved \\"Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting\\" and couldn't wait to read this book. What a shock I got.In this book, Ms. Grabhorn explains how she suffered terrible pain and sickness for years following the success of \\"Excuse Me\\", and struggled to find the cause. It turned out that she was in pain because evil entities from outside our universe, called \\"The Others\\", were cloning all her internal organs in order to duplicate her.She apparently believes this to be true. I still can't believe I spent money on this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read, don't buy","review":"I had been inspired by Ms. Grabhorn's earlier works, so bought this sight unseen. Something bad has happened to Ms. Grabhorn's brain. Do not buy this book. Do not read this book, even at the library--mania/insanity is contagious. I don't know if Ms. Grabhorn has gone back to drinking, but there is the phenomenon of \\"wet brain\\" or the \\"dry drunk\\". Also, there's the problem of co-morbidity: you can suffer from two or more problems, such as alcoholism AND manic-depression.I don't know anything about Hampton Roads publishing (is it Ms. Grabhorn's own house?) but they should have known better than to publish this dangerous nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth taking the time","review":"It took me some time to get the courage to read this book.

The good thing is she shows you how to get it done."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is sad","review":"This book should be called \\"Excuse Me, I'm in the Depressive Phase of my Bi-Polar Illness.\\" The manic phase would have been her previous book \\"Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting.\\" Which is unfortunate because EMYLW was an excellent book, but this one seems to be a bunch of dark, psychotic ramblings.

Oh well, I guess it just goes on showing...never confuse the messenger with the message or is it the other way around ! Anyway, we all are (Lynn included) still working...excuse me...playing on perfecting all this positive stuff approach. And at times we just take a detour...;-)I gave the book one star because of its catchy title, not because of its content obviously ~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery Solved in strange \\"disappearance\\"","review":"Lynn has made a great contribution to the planet. As a Lightworker, when she speaks of moving on to a higher dimension, she may be alluding to one that includes a more refined body that transcends the third dimension. More capabilities, less density. I would be willing to bet she is having alot of fun while working on the grid. Far out but don't THINK about it.

I rarely read books that I want to toss right away, this is one of them.the message that we are being controlled by negative higher dimensional beings has a lot of credit in my opinion, but this book does NOTHING to convince me or anyone with half a brain of that point of view.avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad follow-up to \\"Excuse me your life is waiting\\"","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, as I mostly enjoyed Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting, and am now very disappointed.

I strongly recommend that you save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Rambling","review":"I was looking so forward to receiving this book, as I so enjoyed Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting, and am now so disappointed. Lynn Grabhorn must have had some very dark nights, as this is just ramblings and rantings. Not very clear, strange, but not in a compelling sense. She states that she wanted to get right to the point -- so why is the book 180 pages? Outside of the seven affirmations, I would not recommend this. I do not feel it was worth the money. I'm not happy with the hype that they used before the book was printed, stating that it was so very secret a subject that no information could be let out. Bottom line: see if you can get it out of the library for free and see pages 127, 154, 155 - say the affirmations - and get on with your life!

To each his own, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, What Happened?","review":"If you believe that you are the master of your destiny, then Do Not read this book, or do so with a light hearted touch. I found it disturbing and the exact opposite of her last book \\"Excuse me your life is waiting\\" which I loved. It seems that her problem started when doctors could not diagnose her illness and she became frustrated and went to a homeopathic practitioner who said that while she was not diabetic her organs were responding as a diabetic. So this \\"seer\\" put her on a diabetic diet and she got better. Wow, thats all the proof I need. I know when I drink a lot of pop or eat junk food I don't feel good as when it is not part of my diet, but I never would have thought that dark forces were to blame and not my diet. Sad to say but this sounds like dark fiction and is depressing to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone read Maya Cosmogenesis 2012?","review":"I just bought Dear God and I'm halfway through. It is certainly a slight departure from her previous book, but I'm trying to keep an open mind. Last night, I just made it thru her account of the creation and the 2012 date. I didn't give it much thought till today when I decided to look up some book called \\"Maya Cosmogenesis\\" that a friend recommended. It was eerie when the full title came up as \\"Maya Cosmogenesis 2012.\\" I have not read that book yet but now I'm curious as heck to see if there is a possible connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome back to victimhood","review":"They don't give an option for zero stars, so I am forced to give it 1, which is more than it deserves.I was a huge fan of EMYLIW, and was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, this book is in direct opposition to everything she said in that one. The major premise of EMYLIW is that we are NOT victims. Our vibration, controlled/determined by our emotions, is what draws the experiences of our lives. THAT book changed my life for the better. This one puts us back to being victims, and it reads, as so many have said, like the babbling delusions of a madwoman. If you are into victimhood, go ahead and buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass this one by.","review":"I don't know what happened to Lynn, but she comes across in her book as very troubled. It actually frightens me a little to think of people reading this book and taking her words at face value. Her information is derived from pendulums and unnamed mediums. She came to believe that she was under the influence of dark spirits who had great power over her.bottom line - even if what she says is true, anyone practicing bring good into their lives via the law of attraction wouldn't be very susceptible to these dark influences anyway.

Because his criticisms of park encroachers were caustic, witty and informed, it was to be expected that he incurred the wrath of those he rebuked. While Mr. Clary's sharp and eloquent voice has been stilled, despoilers of Golden Gate Park continue to clamor for buildings, museums, monuments, sports arenas, and facilities for special groups. The park needs defenders like Ray Clary to keep the land open, free and green for future generations.

Unless the structure you wish to research has a brand name architect (you know, John Portman, John Burgee, Philip Johnson, etc...), it won't be in here. And if it's a church outside the city center, even if it had a brand name architect, it won't be in here either. There's a heavy modernist slant to the book, and an inexplicable lack of coverage of Atlanta's important ecclesiastical and neoclassical structures, particularly outside the city center. Architectural historians and classicists will be disappointed, which is surprising considering that Elizabeth Dowling, classicist extraordinaire, was the senior consultant for the book. Perhaps a new edition can improve on these problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Letdown","review":"I suppose there was no way Green Carnation could match the brilliance of \\"Light of Day,Day of Darkness,\\" but one would at least hope for more than mediocrity.

It just doesn't go anywhere. Boy in the Attic is the same way, as are most of the songs. The songs just die, but not before the listener has to hear the whole thing. This cd is really not that different than hundreds of other \\"new metal\\" cds out there. It can pass as a Godsmack cd or any other band you choose to insert as one of the cutting edge (whatever) bands out there right now that are mired in mediocrity and uninventiveness. It's nothing new, and even worse, it's nothing that good. Frankly, it's a pretty boring cd without one really good song on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding.","review":"You can't really expect Green Carnation to come out trying to top \\"Light of Day, Day of Darkness\\", because, quite frankly, there isn't a chance in hell they--I should say he: Tchort--can do it, which is why I was thrilled that they/he didn't try to. This album is great in and of itself. It's melancholic; it's uplifting; it's soft; it's hard; it's a great mixture of sounds. This isn't an album for everyone, but it would be enjoyed by many, many people out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far one of the best albums I've ever heard.","review":"Blessing in Disguise is a great progressive metal work and is as good or better than other albums by Green Carnation.

The characters in this series needed a bit more fleshing out, it seems liked this animation was rushed. There is no real outcome to the story, even the \\"un-aired\\" final episode was unclear. This animation needs closure in order for the viewer to clear up any confusion brought up during the viewing process.

It turns out wine funnels are difficult to find in stores so I went searching on line. I had already bought my husband a carafe so I was worried about the funnel fitting properly. I looked around and read lots of reviews and decided on this one. We couldn't be happier. It works great with the decanter I bought and I think it would work with just about any decanter.

They attempt to deal with all this while trying to have a blast at their reunion get-together. There is a little raunchy humor and some nudity in this one, but I found it quite funny and entertaining. It was good to see the old faces from a 90's comedy classic all together again, and up to some of their old tricks. Their lives have changed since high school, but they still know how to have a good time. This is a film series that has a pretty funny current installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic piece of pie","review":"For those that love the American Pie series this is a fun trip down memory lane with homage to the raunchy, dirty, uncomfortable jokes that made us love the series in the first place. 4 stars because admittedly the plot and story could be a liiiitle bit stronger...ok a lot stronger.... But let's be honest, we're not watching it much for the plot.

For whatever it's worth, American Pie and it's sequels are like the John Hughes films for my generation. Raunchier, sure; but so is my generation. It was a fun watch.

Cannot watch it with your kids. Not appropriate for young kids.Movie is made of predictable bad jokes by adults who never grew up, during a high school reunion. But then what would you expect from this bunch? Not as good as the first two, much more dirty (in language and inuendos) than the first two movies. Really degrading to young women.Movie shows what really happens to people who don't get a real life and keep going to these totally unnecessary high school reunions. Get a life and put high school behind you. Stop thinking about the past and look into the future.

Albeit the fact that the reunion comes at a wier time and is explained away in a one liner and we all are suppose to buy inyo it the movie only had 90minutes to catch you up on your old favorite characters. It was innapropriate, raunchy, full of crude humor, and had the same feel this movie is famous for. Would it be nice to spend time eith the gang on a more mature level, sure.

The film itself was extremely funny and just a ton of Summer fun. The bits about the reunion were actually unneeded and many of the original cast members seemed to only be in the fiml as to say, \\"hey remember me? I was in the original!\\" However the main 5 guys had the same comrodery and fun that they did 11 years ago when American Pie 2 came out, and it seems like they never missed a beat. The movie was hilariously funny and nostalgically sweet, and is easily the best comedy to come out since the original Hangover. I look forwar to adding the Blu-Ray to my collection and watching it for years to come. I am also excited the film has fared so well at the box office and will most likely warrant another return to East Great Falls to hang out with the boys again."},{"rating":"1","title":"American","review":"was the worst movie out of all the American pie movies.

It nailed the feeling of the original movie and the characters were all played pretty well. There was definitely a feeling of nostalgia watching the movie and their age is pretty close to my own which made me more aware of the guys being older with their own lives and problems now. There were a few one liners that didn't go over well and a couple of slow parts, but overall this was a good movie. I look forward to continued reunions as the cast ages.

However, this album didn't feel like it was so much her anymore. A lot has to do with the band, but the melodies were much more Popish with only an inkling every once in a while of original style.Lyrics are still good and her singing has never been better.I'm sorry Erin, I won't give up seeing you and buying your cds, but I hope you will reclaim a bit of what is yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Set But Expensive Here","review":"I am not an SACD person, but this is an excellent set.

I was listening to rythmic but not necessarily melodic music (Bartok piano concertos, Mahivishnu Orchestra, Frank Zappa's Shut Up and Play ) and had heard about Shipp's work with the AntiPop Consortium. The reviews on Amazon[.com] led me to this one instead. I'm completely taken. The haunting solo peices reveal more with each listening and the horn work in the ensembles is breath taking. It's gotten me listening to Ornette Coleman again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Translator","review":"I'm very disappointed with this translator device. First ol all the backlight is to weak, for instance it is practically impossible to see the screen when you are in a darker room. Second, the search mode is too confusing, for example it is difficult to search a single word if it is not included into the phrasebook. On the other hand, the device has a helpful list of phrases which suits for differents situations and also the pronunciation of the sentences are perfect. So, as a general view the device is too limited if you are looking for a portable translator to use during the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WAS THERE, LOVED IT AND LOVE IT STILL!","review":"I was at this performance, so I'm severely prejudiced. I had not heard Marshall in person before and never Bruscantini in person, which was a great treat for me. Muti and Battle I knew as fan who went backstage at their performances and talked to them, got their autographs, if that counts as 'knowing them'....Araiza and Morris I heard many times at the Met, especially Morris from the time he started at the Met...like 'homecoming' that night in Salzburg was. Wonderful memory that I can relive with this dvd. So, yes, my 5 stars are biased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To what purpose?","review":"In several of the scenes in Act Two, the conductor Muti, larger than life, is superimposed upon the stage action, in some cases completely blocking out the singers. I found this disconcerting, particularly distracting as the opera is ending. None of the reviewers have mentioned this; if I had known, I should never have purchased this DVD version of the opera. I have never seen such disrespect for the performers, nor such disregard for viewers like me who want to watch the performance, not the conductor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.","review":"I have listened to over 600 different opera recordings in my lifetime on video and if I had to choose a video that had the worst sound quality and the worst balance of sound recording between voices and orchestra, this would be the one. This, like many opera dvds, was not a recording produced exclusively for dvd, but rather, a dvd recording re-recorded onto vhs with added menus and special effects. Muti is an excellent conductor and the emotion sparkles in this production but my ears were left straining to hear the notes of Mozart's beautiful opera. Avoid this recording like the plague and don't say that I didn't warn you. If you want a good recording of Cosi Fan Tutti to listen to, (I'm still looking for a good video recording) buy Georg Solti's recording with Michele Pertusi singing bass. You'll love it, I promise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Precise, fast moving, a gift to the senses","review":"Excellent audio recording, one of the best I've heard. Video also first quality. Unbeatable orchestra too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good performance, poor video quality","review":"Muti's performance is acceptably\\"Mozartian\\"- and the singers do justice to the roles. The production is what one might call \\"opera house standard.\\"However, the video rendition is atrocious - perhaps the translation from European to American video standards was \\"too much\\" - the images are \\"jumpy\\" and erratic- it's distracting in the extreme. Turn off the monitor and listen to the performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muti's Cosi","review":"It's important to realize what we have here. A very sophisticated performance musically, full of vitality, beautiful orchestral playing, and six superb soloists in roles that suit them well. Riccardo Muti is one of the leading Mozart conductors of the day, and his perfectionist and stylish approach, serving the composer totally, is an absolute delight. The production is stylistic, and pretty to look at. The live performance has an electricity which is captivating. 10 out of 10 !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice theatrical version. Poor picture and sound quality","review":"It seems some classic music editors are just translating the old VHS into DVD's. This DVD is like a VHS. You can't remove the subtitles. You will not see the technological advantages than a DVD can offer. The sound and picture quality is exactly the same as in one old VHS. What it is really nice is the theatrical version and the orchestra conducted by Muti. This is a four stars VHS but a one star DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could rate it higher, I would.","review":"This is a rremarkably subtle and accurate version of this difficult work.

Sad to see such ignorant reviews of this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than buying from pet store.","review":"I used this to Reseal a 55 Gallon long tank. I know that buying from the pet store will notallow me to reseal it completely due to the amount of silicone most commercial pet stores offer. Buying this is the same price,if not cheaper, of the overprice smaller tubes pet stores offer. Even after completely sealing my 55 gallon long tank, I still have about only less than 1/4 left.

The picture of the book is exactly as shown, but I guarantee you that the Translator is H.T. Lowe-Porter. Oddly thought the ISBN number is correct. So many reviews, how could no one as of yet discover this? I have Porter's & Luke's translations, I was particularly wanting Burke's. Burke's is suppose to be a superior translation.I am returning the book in disappointment, Burkes translation is harder to get. If anyone ordered this and the date inside does report 1983 with the Heller's Intro included, could you please comment here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little disagreement","review":"I love the story, but it must be pointed out that Aschenbach's love for the boy never constituted lust of any kind -- he never dreamt of sleeping with the boy. It seems to me a love for beauty which made him want to follow the boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting tale about the inner power of corruption","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest masterpieces of short fiction ever written. The style is simple, but the narrative is lush, subtle and deeply hauting. The end-result is one of the most quietly disturbing pieces I have read. Mann himself described it as a tale concerned with \\"corruption, and the voluptuousness of doom.\\" The protagonist, Aschenbach, a famous writer whose work champions reflected self-control, is ultimately destroyed by an overwhelming fascination with a child of unusual physical beauty. His obsession is apparently innocent, but its takes over his mind and becomes his doom. A testimony to the strange and destructive powers that live in us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful human drama of love and death","review":"To Venice comes Gustav von Ashenbach, famous writer. The city is gloomy and sultry, also infected with colera. But he remained, to lose himself in a silent admiration for Tadzio, beautiful polish boy. The figure of Ashenbach is a strange combination of professional rigor and attraction to the irrational. He will die alone on the beach. Far out toward the sea stands the boy, whose look is the vertigo that fascinated him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dreadful Translation","review":"This, the most famous of novellas (ostensibly ased on the death of Mahler), is given very poor treatment here; the wording, however, accurate, is clunky and graceless; while the price is agreeable the Thomas Mann is not; David Luke's version, in a Bantam paperback, is far sweeter, far more readable and should appeal to anyone named Dena from Toronto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homo-pedophile Stalker in Venice","review":"I had to read this for a literature course. In the beginning of the story, Mann provides some great insight into the creative process of art. Unfortunately, the main plot is about an older man's homo-erotic fantasies while he stalks an adolescent boy. I can only guess how anyone would find pleasure or catharsis from reading this. I found nothing interesting or provocative of thought in the latter two-thirds of this piece of work. Furthermore, I find the notion of romanticizing or intellectually exhalting the theme of this story to be a bit disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I see Venice from the description.....","review":"There is an operatic romance feel to the title \\"Death in Venice\\" written by Thomas Mann in 1912. Since I been to Venice, I really appreciate the descriptive details in the early 19th century; I too was on \\"the familiar ride across the lagoon, past San Marco, up the Grand Canal\\". They are just as beautifully described in the story as I remember seeing them with my own eyes. The stream consciousness of the main character, Gustav Aschenbach's trip to Venice, is truly a laborious art piece. I could only absorb a couple of pages per reading session. Luckily, this translated version by Stanley Appelbaum published by Dover publication is only 62 pages.I would recommend this book to readers who are familiar with Greek mythology and Homer since there are many of these references in the story. I am not sure I truly got the symbolism and its relevance to the story.Check out my other book review[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much less to this than I had supposed","review":"There is an old review of mine in this page that praises _Death in Venice_ as \\"one of the greatest works of short fiction ever written.\\" After seeing Visconti's film adaptation I realized that I had been quite wrong. _Death in Venice_ is actually a rather slight story of homosexual infatuation made to look like it has the gravity of the ages by Mann's skill at ellipsis. But the movie is forced to make it all explicit, revealing that the Reason vs. Emotion debate is in fact rather hackneyed, and that the \\"voluptuousness of doom\\" Mann speaks of is just an older man's obsession with a pretty little boy. My hat goes off to Mann as a stylist, but I am ashamed I was taken in by this."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant masterful writing","review":"What is not to be completely speechless with? This is the story of \\"a gray haired man\\" and his unusual, distant passion for a young boy. The descriptions of the setting are great. We get into the head of the main character in a brilliant manner as only Thomas Mann could take us. Astounding!!! As readers, ourselves, we experience the conflict, the desire, the overtaking of reason, and, the cost. This is one of the 50 books that ought to be read by every thinking person. The topic isn't for everyone, but, for those who can accept the topic, the writing on his obsession is magnificent!!! A++. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book, NOT the reviews...","review":"Death in Venice is a rare book that reminds the reader of his/her significance on earth.

It allows the reader to ponder upon the answers but in addition, it provides a semi-answer guide in the back, which even though it doesn't explain everything to the reader's satisfaction, it points to the areas in philosophy where such questions may be answered to a greater extent. A nice guide through philosophy organizing in a way the paths an amateur philosopher will have to travel to satisfy his curiousity about the world from the philosophical point of view.I recommend it for beginners in philosophy as well as hardcore philosophers with low self-esteem. 101 Philosophy Problems doesn't treat you like an idiot but at the same time it provides the basis for more answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER COOL BOOK FROM ROUTLEDGE","review":"Routledge publishes great books on philosophy for the general reader, and this one is no exception.

I found that the Zipp extenders didn't allow the pump to attach securely, so topping off the tires was always a two person job. Reviews of the Topeaks (like the ones here) suggest that pumps will attach securely. Sadly, this turns out to not be the case, and I've tried it with a number of different pumps. And the valves, once the pump is attached, will release nearly as much air as your putting in. I understand that some people have no problems with this, but if I were in the market again, I'd just buy 80mm tubes (which I have since done). I recognize that that isn't an option for people running really deep rims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear oh dear!","review":"I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to do so for this product.I have been through about 5 of these in the last few years, the latest pair went yesterday when I was about 5 miles from he nearest train station and i got a flat, bothe extenders failed and broke.

You want an extender with a machined thread, not a cheapo plastic insert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valve extender not a new valve","review":"was trying to replace the valve on my evos and thought this was a valve in itself. Why else would I buy this thing. It is heavy because it has a shaft the runs down the middle to engage the existing valve. for the extra weight gained over my zipp extenders I get the benefit of being able to let the air out easier.

A piece of clothing will also work.To insure that you don't have a a problem with inflation while on the road, be sure to wrap your spare tubes with plumbers tape before you pack them and keep a short strip of tape in your roadside repair kit for good measure.When installed correctly, this is a solid and reliable product.

Make no bones about it, they actively and willingly participated in the day to day activity of killing innocent families.It is probably better to do some research on the topic before reading this book, to get the most out of it. The book is well written and candid, my only criticism is it becomes a little repetitive at times.However getting convicted killers to talk for a book is a great coup, as most in Western Worlds are reticent to do so, or are not honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"This book is interesting in that it takes you into the world of those who killed during the Rwandan genocide in 1994. I've often wondered how a group of people can be handed a machete and sent out to kill. What was the motivation? How did it all start? What do we, as a society, need to be aware of so this sort of thing will not happen again? This book will help to answer those questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Murderers Speak","review":"The author interviewed in prison a group of friends,a seemingly ordinary crosssection of Rawandan Hutu farmers, who willingly and enthusiastically participated in the brutal extermination of their Tutsi neighbors. The book draws parallels with previous genocides such as perpetuated by the Nazi's and others thruout history. The killers seemed to look upon the massacres as pretty much of a job. With an added benefit often of rape and plunder. An incredibly disturbing, but true story. An interesting sidenote was the significant role played by radio broadcasts in inciting the mobs. Also, how The Church and U.N. and the rest of the world pretty much left the victims to their fates. Amazing as it may seem there were virtually no instances in which Hutus tried to save Tutsis who had been former friends. This whole dark blot on history must not be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better choices for the money","review":"I am disappointed at how poorly the flexible joints are made. They are much too 'loose' of a design...meaning that it most often won't hold the position you place it in.

And it's flexible joints are also too 'loose' to grab around a pole...it will just slide down. I bought a $6.85 3D battery/20 LED lantern from Amazon with a pivoting head, and it served me much better than this snake light.

I liked reading this book more than Grisham's last two novels. This book would make a good movie... ."},{"rating":"2","title":"country dr","review":"The quality of the CD is great and is all I hoped it would be.

I still love this book! It is a must for any Sailor Mercury fan! I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a pretty random collection of essays","review":"The first thing you should realize about this book is that it is not a systematic introduction or explanation of Nozick - it is merely a collection of about 8 articles interpreting and criticizing fairly narrow areas of Nozick's thought.The introduction or first chatper (don't remember which) provides a pretty good five page summary of Nozick's Anarchy, State and Utopia but the rest of the book is pretty worthless, pretty much like the journal articles you might expect to find if you searched for Nozick articles on JSTOR or EbscoHost or another online journal program.If you can read the first chapter in a bookstore go for it, otherwise you are probably wasting your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gliding Flight is NOT Simple","review":"This book assumes that you are totally familiar with origami techniques. I am not. For example, the design for the All Purpose Delta Wing model starts by stating that you have to begin with a waterbomb base. There is a reference to flip animation on page 146 (per the Table of Contents) as to what a waterbomb base is. There is NO flip animation, only a picture in the left margin of page 146. Do NOT purchase this book if you are seeking a \\"simple\\" set of instructions for making paper airplanes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Designes that just work","review":"At school we went through a period of building cheap balsa gliders, competing, at 3 in the morning, for long distance records. Would loved to have had the theory included in this book. The interest continued and I've bought a bunch of books but like this one best for actual construction instructions for flyable planes. Each design in the dart class, for example, had to fly a level 60-foot course and smack the opposite wall to be included. I haven't measured how far mine have flown but the distance is impressively far! His explanations of theory are clear and interesting but unnecessary for success. Most of the designs in other books seem overly complex works of origami. I wanted designs I could quickly fold and fly and this book filed the bill. On the other hand, I can also recommend the \\"Klutz Book of Paper Airplanes\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the average child.","review":"I was given this book a few years ago by my grandfather; my grandparents knew that I liked origami, electronics, and legos. It's an incredible book; I spent long hours folding airplane after airplane. My school administrators (the philistines) lumped artwork such as the AWACS with any other form of flying paper, and this caused much strife. This is a wonderful book; an ideal gift for anyone from a child of 10 who knows some origami to a college student. Having lost my copy years ago, I'm only replacing it now, but I treasure this gift more than any video game or radio-controlled car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest DVD I have ever purchased","review":"After viewing and working out with this DVD, I have to agree with the other reviews that were written. Her cueing is hard to follow and the camera angles leave a lot to be desired. I was able to complete the workout in its entirety with 3# weights but would not be able to perform this workout 4 - 6 times per week as she suggests because I would be tired of it after two workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"This exercise program WORKS!","review":"I have tried every kind of conventional exercise, walking, running, weights, in the gym,and at home. I have had personal trainers, purchased tapes and DVDs of all types, but never achieved the success I have with The Tracy Anderson Method. For a woman this is an excellent program. It is best, fastest and only, program that has given me a slim firm lean sexy shape. Do the workout consistently and see the results! For the first time in my life I am happy with my appearance. Thank You Tracy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Arm Workout","review":"This workout is based on many of the same principals as the Lotte Berk workout but really does add something unique. There is no doubt that doing these exercises on a regular basis will deliver the result she is promising, and that is the good news. However, the video's cuing is very poor and there are large sections where she changes directions and exercises without telling you what to do. I found this very frustrating. I am not sure why they didn't edit it differently and at least add a voice over to correct this flaw. I look forward to trying future videos from Anderson hopefully with more instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATED this DVD","review":"If you like to look at a DVD where the teacher is in love with herself, her own flexibility, her body, then this is the DVD for you!There is no \\"instruction,\\" it's just follow along at your own risk.

Seeing it in various magazines also nudged me into buying this workout and putting it to the test.I could not bring myself to do this video more than three times. I just don't like Tracy's \\"style\\" and found the video very unenjoyable.The two stars are for the arm workout, which you will feel working immediately. After doing the video a few times, my arms definitely look better.As a former belly dancer, I understood the concept of \\"standing abs\\", but Tracy's moves are so spastic that someone who is a beginner could injure themselves.There is nothing in this video to give your inner thighs a workout at all. Your butt will feel the leg lifts, but I have shorter and more effective workouts (Core Fusion) that I enjoy more for that area.If you like wondering \\"Am I doing it right?\\" due to Tracy's lack of cuing, this is the workout for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Workout that WORKS!!","review":"I have always been looking for a workout that actually does what it claims to do. The Tracy Anderson Method REALLY WORKS!! After doing the workout one time, yes I said ONE time, I saw definition in my legs, my arms were rock hard and looking sleek. I am not kidding. Now those kind of results did come with a price. I was so sore for the first three days of doing the workout! I literally couldn't raise my arms up, and my thighs were killing me with every step. No workout has ever kicked my butt as hard or given me such amazing results. I have been doing the workout for three weeks now, and I love the results!! You have to follow her instructions, though. A lot of the rotations she has you follow are different from anything you've probably ever seen before. But if you are willing to be faithful to her instructions, and do the video 4-6 times a week, you will see amazing sleek form develop, sexy lines, and graceful definition to your muscular structure. Her method really WORKS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout without the chatter!","review":"After reading the negative comments about Tracy's lack of verbal cuing, I had to respond.

You can't follow her she makes it up as she goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst workout dvd EVER!","review":"I am a very physically active person and I've taken a lot of classes over the years -- yoga, lifting, aerobics, spin and more. I also buy DVDs now and then to supplement my workouts. I purchased Tracy Anderson's Mat Workout as a supplement -- possibly to become more than that.This has to be the worst workout video I've ever purchased. Practically NO instruction about the moves, form, etc! It seems that Tracy is more concerned with playing vixen for the camera. I have a lot of purchased dvds over the years -- some I really liked and others not so much -- but I always kept them. I was so shocked and insulted at how bad this video is that I actually returned it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Has a great arm workout","review":"Her arm workout is challenging and you will see results if you do that section 3 times a week. It looks like its going to easy because the first part she was not using weights, but it isn't. You can add weights if you its not challenging enough for you. Her standing abdominal workout was for me worthless so I skip it. I found it to be awkward dance moves. The leg workouts are good with some awkward movements. The abdominal section is also decent. I do recommend the video especially for the arm workout. It is great for women who want to tone without bulking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sure","review":"Tracy is hard to follow. She doesn't talk much, so you need to watch her at all times. I don't like it. I am always little behind . It's interesting workout, but she is sort of dancing each move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks meaningful instruction","review":"I'm disappointed with this video. Because of the price, I read a ton of reviews, and I guess I failed to take seriously the ones saying that she did not provide adequate instruction (instead she seems to be quite enamored of her own dance skills). It's very hard to follow her moves because she rarely provides a cue, switching from one move to the next - and back - with nothing but her own dancing to indicate it. So, you must keep your eyes glued to the screen until you've basically memorized the routines. Perhaps if you have a dance background this will be totally fine with you, but my background is pilates/yoga, not dance, and I found it frustrating. I've just ordered The Complete Physique 57 Workout Kit 3 Disc Set With Ball and Pump with the hope that it will be more engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I really like doing this video. However, the only problem is that Tracy just does the movies; she never lets you know when there is going to be a switch in arm exercise or something. Also, there isn't a lot of explanation to make sure you are doing it right. She has a great program but does a bad job of \\"coaching\\". When you are doing the stretches (facing the floor) she doesn't indicate when she has come back up. It is that type of stuff that makes it difficult to use. However, it really does work muscles one doesn't realize they have."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"I have been using this 5 days a week and am seeing results! I can't believe it.I also had the same problems as Tracy. I too am 5 foot tall and it seemed that no matter how I worked out, I would bulk up and create problem areas instead of slimming down. This method works. I also have cut out bread and cheese and am doing cardio work. I lost 7 pounds very quickly! I feel fantastic and am happy that I am on the path to slimmer arms, waist and hips. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great dvd, for all fitness levels","review":"i don't own a fitness dvd so i can't compare this to another. however, as an active person, i find her perspective on exercise refreshing and the moves themselves challenging. it feels like a combination of pilates and dance, mostly. she seems to be less concerned with the specific number of reps (she sometimes says \\"five more\\" and does eight or 10 more) and more with variety. following her is not difficult, but it's not easy either - she doesn't offer verbal cues and i learned that a change in the position of her feet will oftentimes precede a change in exercise.the abs and arms are standout, while the leg/glute exercises are not as challenging. you don't need a lot of space or equipment for this program, which is always appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor teacher-poor instructions","review":"Although some of the exercises in this workout are good, Tracy is not a good instructor. She doesn't break down what she is doing. The standing abs is hard to follow. She just moves and expects you to do the same without telling you what she is doing. She does not know how to teach. She may be good an a personal trainer but she is not good in this video. You also have to watch the whole time when she is doing floor abs because she doesn't tell you when she is changing exercises. To be a good trainer you need to be a good communicator and she needs to work on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment!","review":"It took Tracy 8 years to put together the research for her \\"Method\\" and this is what she came up with?? I don't even know where to begin. It's not an instruction video, because she doesn't give any instruction! you have to watch her every second, but here's the trick: sometimes you can't see what she's doing, either because she's behind a chair or because she's in a contorted position on the ground with her legs behind her. Couldn't they have worked the cameras to show the exercises from more than one angle? This is a terrible video, and if I could return it, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible instructions","review":"The instructions are non-existent or unclear and for some of the moves Tracy does different reps for left and right sides, the sequence for left and right sides are also different. All in all confusing and although I was able to follow the sequence through familiarity, the inconsistent reps and sequence means I have switched to Brazil Butt Lift which gives clear instructions and far more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst DVD ever!","review":"It's all about her. If your eyes are not constantly on Tracy you cannot listen to know what to do next. She goes from one move to the next without saying a word. She does not give any instruction. It's her exercising and you watching. Speak up Tracy! There are sooo many better exercise DVD's out there. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"After reading about Tracy Anderson and how she works with Madonna & Gwyeneth Paltrow to rave reviews I was excited to order the DVD. I kept waiting for the instructions to start! This was the biggest waste of $30 I ever spent. The entire video is watching her do the exercises without her ever going into detail what she was doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"I wish she would give a little more instruction on the movements and when she changes position, but even with my confusion I could see a difference in my waste after only a few workouts. I will defiantly be buying the other dvds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wasn't sure at first, but I love this workout now!","review":"I love this workout now, but it wasn't love at first sight! The first time I tried it, I wasn't sure I liked it at all. It has a weirdly sensuous vibe (my husband calls it the pole-dancing video) and is hard to follow at first. It isn't cued all that well, and I wasn't always sure that I was doing it right. (especially the standing abs section!) It definitely takes some getting used to. I highly recommend doing the routine in front of a large mirror, so that you can watch what you're doing and make adjustments. That helped me a lot! I liked this more and more each time I did the routine and now it is my favorite. After just a few weeks I can definitely tell a difference in my body. Even more importantly, I really enjoy it and look forward to doing it! I am doing it 4-5 times a week and love the way it makes me feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!!!!!","review":"I LOVE this video!!!! It really gives you a workout! The muscles that get worked are painfull but in a good way> I have only been working with this for about 2 weeks and already can see a differnce.

It is the cheapest way to ship and after almost a month I still have not received the DVD.

I am still waiting to get the DVD and ordered it on August 29th."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a joke","review":"Good lord this girl is rediculous.

I decided to give myself a break for a month and my arm is feeling much better. This video is not safe to exercise with!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a JOKE!","review":"This is seriously the worst workout DVD ever made. I am so angry that I bought this!!! I would have given it only 1 star, but I'm sure there are women out there who having dance backgrounds and they might think this is a good DVD. I kept waiting for her workout to get better and it just didn't. If I could break it down for you: Tracy Anderson dances around in a basement fitness room (looking totally, utterly bored and trying very hard to look sexy & sultry). She gives you little to no tips on form, no motivation, nothing! You just hear the music and see her dancing around. Good luck trying to copy her moves in your living room. There are SO many other fitness DVD's out there that are better than this. To top it off, Gwyneth Paltrow speaks at the end, and talks about whoknowswhat. Then, Tracy tells you how she came up with all of this nonsensical garbage. GREAT! That will help me look so much better in a bathing suit!UGH! Terrible. What a WASTE of $30. Seriously, don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No info on the mat workout","review":"I have been trying to find out what type of workout this is. No info on it anywhere. I e-mailed Tracy via her website several times but no response. I think this is probably just hype since she trains the stars and have decided not to purchase it. Tracy, if you want to sell these workouts you need to supply some info. A clip of the workouts on your site would be great. I know these are not the same workouts you use for your upper crust clients but $30 for a DVD is alot to put out without knowing what your buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a Christian - reconsider this tape because of blasphemy","review":"Tracy is charming and her exercises are great. It is terrific workout. However, if you treasure the name of Jesus Christ don't buy this tape. For some reason she felt it was necessary to put music with lyrics in the background of her exercise tape. The music says \\"I am the Christ\\" and it is not talking about Jesus Christ. It is disturbing and repulsive for someone like myself who treasures the name of Jesus Christ. I considered working out and turning the music down on just that song, (It is the first song on the tape). And then I thought, Why would a keep a tape in my house that insults my faith. I threw it in the trash. It seems that everywhere we turn Jesus name is used in vain and derision. The last place I expected to find that the case was on an exercise video I bought at Costco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbest video ever!","review":"I am a fitness professional and have watched my share of fitness videos. This is the absolute worst video I have ever seen. She is just dancing with herself and throwing around little one pound weights. There is no way that Madonna is doing this workout. Very poorly produced and she is very unengaging and unenthusiastic. Big thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I have heard so much hype over Tracy Anderson and her celebrity endorsements from Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow. Her video is blah and the excersises are just repeat excersises that we have been doing since the dark ages with mega-reps. It's weak and as a teacher, I don't find Tracy Anderson all that motivating to watch or work out to. She's just another skinny blond who does excersise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best workout ever !","review":"This is the best workout ever ! You will really feel this working ! It is great !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this","review":"This dvd is terrible. I had no idea what was going on. TA didn't count reps and when she did, she miscounted. I got sucked into the hype. I'm glad I sold mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice ideas with little instruction","review":"As a Pilates teacher I always look for new ideas and methods. I take classes and I watch videos. Tracy is not instructing for the average person in this video. I found myself constantly watching her to try and figure out what she was talking about. If she was actually cuing it would be simple to follow her. But all she is doing is moving around and pouting at the camera. Yes she has some great concepts and movements, but she is teaching by her instinct not by practical instructions. She is very quiet while moving without telling the audience how to stand, shift, or align themselves. Nothing. I can see how she would be fun in a room; live. But when a person needs details from a video, alone at home, this video is lacking on the basic essence on instruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tracey Anderson's Method","review":"This DVD is a great workout if you can get through it entirely more than once. The workout is about 1 hour and it is very hard to jump to a specific section that you may want to do. Most other dvds allow you to pick a chapter or section in case you do not want to do the entire workout. This was very frustrating. The music was good but mellow. I am going to give it another chance but Im afraid it might end up on a dusty shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waist of Time!","review":"Just got this dvd and was so dissapointed. I can't believe people actually buy this. Do you think your body will look like her when your done? You'd have to starve yourself along with doing the video. Talk about bad instruction! She's all over the place, it's like she making it up as she goes along and doesn't let you know when she's switching moves etc. I really don't think that she even targets the muscles she's aiming for. I've done plenty of workouts and I can feel when I'm working that muscle. Her arm exercises just kill my shoulder, that's all, even though she says it will get rid of the flab underarm (triceps). She not in my opinion any sort of fitness person to follow she should be modeling with all the poses she does throughout her video. If you want a good workout try Gilad's Bodies in Motion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I bought this DVD at Kmart for $8 and thought it was going to be super amazing after all the rave reviews, but was letdown. Pretty much you have to keep all eyes on her because she adds her own flair and doesn't tell you when she adds a movement in the mix. You'll be doing one arm movement then she mixes up the beat/reps. Most workout DVDs coach you along the way with reps, she's pretty much silent the entire. I liked that she didn't stop to teach you a move then go on, but I also didn't like that fact. This workout isn't too challenging or too complex. I think she could have condensed this down to half an hour workout, not 53 minutes. It's not high-intensity-so that's wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I cant believe I paid $30 for this video! I recently saw it WALMART for around $20 - def not worth it to buy and it's not that great of a workout. Didnt see results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Method mat workout","review":"I loved it. Fun, different, makes you sore in places that typical workouts don't. I love that I'm getting rid of my big biceps and overly muscled thighs and becoming soft and feminine with lovely tone. If you're looking for the softer toned look this is for you. And if you're worried about that she did 20 on this side and 25 on the other then you're missing the point of this workout, and simply do the opposite side first the next workout. I also appreciate that she doesn't yak on and on so that every workout becomes the same boring conversation I end up dreading to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this DVD!","review":"The Tracy Anderson Mat DVD was the first DVD of hers I ever bought, and I am so glad I did! I've been doing it 5 - 6 days a week for two months, and my tummy is now flat, my arms are toned and no longer wobble, my legs are thinner, my butt is rounder and lifted, and my shoulders have opened out so I have better posture. I have had so many compliments on my new body, and it's all thanks to Tracy, and I've finally realised that cardio on its own just won't cut it. You need strength training too. I find the DVD very easy to follow and I love that she doesn't talk all the way through the workout. A must have! I'm 35, and I have the same body now that I had when I was 15. Win!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst instructional fitness DVD ever!","review":"I have had this video for over 2 weeks and it is so hard to get the hang of this, nearly impossible. Tracy and her supporters gave me such high hopes for it but there is literally no instruction with the moves and she doesn't give you any idea that she is moving onto another move until she is already into it. It is annoying and extremely hard to get your body into the propper alignment with no instruction on what (or why) she is doing a particular move. I would not recomend this DVD to anyone, which is a shame. It is too bad that I don't have bookoo bucks to pay Tracy to be my trainer, then I can see someone getting results, because she would actually be there SHOWING you exactly. But NOT with her dvds. I really don't know why everyone is giving these such good ratings. It is not deserved. Sorry, Tracy, please make a new DVD where you can take your TIME and TEACH! You really do a diservice to your decade of work by making such a bad DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Previous reviews were \\"right on\\"...","review":"Everything in the reviews that I have read were right. Her video has very little instruction, but the music is great. I am wondering about over training of the muscles too especially doing this 5-6 days a week. I'm skeptical that I'm going to get \\"teeny tiny arms\\" doing this workout.Without her instruction it's hard to know if you are working out correctly also. Thanks to everyone for such good reviews and this will make a good supplemental workout, but in the meantime I ordered Jackie Warner's workout tape, it has recieved 5 stars across the board."},{"rating":"2","title":"the results are amazing!!!","review":"this is hands down the best workout that i have ever done! i've been working out religiously for the past 14 years and have never seen results like these! i own an elliptical, had a treadmill, been to gyms, done pilates, yoga, lifted weights....you name it. in just 2 weeks of doing this mat workout 3-4 times a week with some cardio added in once a week my entire body has completely transformed. my problem areas are no longer problems anymore and i have never looked better! seeing these kinds of changes at 30 is really unexpected and i am so grateful that tracy put this dvd out. you have to give this one a chance...you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the Floor Work","review":"I really enjoyed the floor work but I wasn't crazy about the standing abs section.

Tracy moves from one thing to the next so quickly and doesn't even tell you what she's doing - This was hugely frustrating and her lack of instruction was evident throughout the entire hour of the DVD. There is a segment on abs and moving around your rib cage that is just ridiculous (I am a salsa dancer and have some experience with rib cage work)...but this was hilarious. Tracy is moving all over the place at different angles with her rib cage and she doesn't say a word to the viewer about which way she is going, preparing for what's next, etc. She just doesn't have a strong instruction component. I felt her personality was really introverted. She didn't really inspire or pump me up at all! I had this DVD week for a couple weeks, did the routine three times and just sold it on eBay last week. I think it's boring, but who knows - maybe it works if you stick with it. It just isn't the workout for me!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst exercise DVD ever made!","review":"The celebrity hype about this woman has created an unwarrented aura of desirability for her DVD's.I admit ~ I was drawn in by it ~ and spent good money for total rubbish!.she is the worst teacher I've ever seen .

Get into the music and feel your body- there is a reason she doesn't talk much- make your own connection and listen to your body!I have had such spectacular results, I wish I could post a before and after!

This routine truly gives your muscles a longer slimmer look - even more so than Yoga or Pilates. I bulked up too much at the gym lifting heavy weights, especially in my arms and back. I rotate this DVD with other routines. I still go to the gym but took Tracy's advice and only use low weight and high repetition. You have to change your routine anyway after 10 sessions so the muscles don't get used to it. I also took her advice about making dancing my main cardio beacause dancing hits the muscles from all angles. ZUMBA works well and is lower impact. Will definitely keep this DVD in regular rotation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"this is the worst exercise video I have ever used.

Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed in workout video","review":"I ordered this dvd after seeing her workout on the Oprah show. It is a hard workout to do. I wasn't impressed with Tracy in this video at all. She seems to almost be lauging at someone in the backround through the workout. Really kinda ticked me off. I didn't find anything funny about the workout. I was sore the next day, so it did work my muscles. I am not cordinated AT ALL and there are some moves that are rythm or danced based which I found difficult. She goes right into each exercise without much explantion or example. This workout is not for beginners. After beinf disappointed in this workout I did some research and decided to order The Bar Method and I really enjoyed this workout. The instructor in this workout explains each exercise and works at a good pace. You really feel the workout. I'm addicted to this dvd. It makes you feel so good afterward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Really, all I can say is I still haven't gotten through the first 3 standing leg exercises because it's not motivating and very boring. Overall, I'm sure the excercises are beneficial, but, Tracy does nothing to rev up energy and motivate you to finish. Also, there are times where she goes into a new position and doesn't tell you what she's doing. She obviously has a dancing background, but she presents the exercises as if you know what and how to do it already. Also, some of the stretches are definitely for a more advanced group, but that's never mentioned, so hopefully nobody hurts themselves trying them at home. If I can ever get through the whole program without falling asleep, I'll put my own music to the moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor instruction","review":"She gives no instruction-utterly narcissistic, just like observing, not learning. Waste of money/time. Also, very cheaply produced. All for her & her buddy, Gwen, who actually is good at sharing what she knows..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I'm a physical therapist and an exercise enthusiast. The method probably is effective if you have Tracy Anderson with you in the room otherwise it is poorly filmed(not shot from correct angles) and poorly directed. The mat ab work has the potential for neck and back strain. There are very few adaptations. Tracy needs to offer more instuction. It seems more like a performance than a teaching tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Terrible! The DVD I received was completely scratched and the DVD box was battered. I had ordered a new one, not used. What I received was not only used, it was abused! This damage was not due to shipping. It was obvious that what was sent to me was a defective product. I reported this as soon as I received it and haven't heard a word back. Needless to say, I returned it and didn't reorder. I hope others have a better experience, but don't get your hopes up like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay..um...yeah","review":"I purchased this DVD based on the fact that there were so many positive reviews, however, I should have done what I normally do and that is...go directly to the negative reviews. I was expecting to be sore the next day as the DVD promised and I was not. The music is horrible. the moves are really sexual and weird. I don't agree with some of her methods, for instance she talks against having any type of muscular tone and instead promotes just being skinny. What is the point of having a flat stomach without muscle tone? Having muscles, does not equate to looking like a man. Just look at Jillian Michaels, Michelle Dozois, and Amy Bento just to name a few. By the way, any of these women have great workouts that burn fat, strengthen, and tone. You need the balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible instruction","review":"I do not know whether or not this workout is effective, and I will never know because I will never try it again.

The floor ab especially, since you are on your back and have no idea what is next, unless you stop to look up! I liked that it challenged me with so many repetitions but not having a clue what to do next was aggravating! I will do it again but still don't like the LACK of cuing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout Option!","review":"This is an option for me on days I need a little variety. I weight trained 4 days a week and have used this tape on my cardio days. This really cranks your muscles on especially the legs workout. But other than that, if I was to do this 6 days a week, I would be very bored. I don't mind having muscles definitions larger than the message indicated on this DVD, and using weights no more than 3 lbs is suitable for this type of workout. I've weight trained for the last 25yrs and have never bulked up. As a petite person and to be teeny tiny isn't what I prefer. I've worked hard to have a certain look and I like my muscles definitions. I would never give up my training regimen, but this Mat Workout adds to my cardio routine. Would recommend if you have 60+ minutes a day. Most days I can only disciplined to 45minutes of hard training and have to go make money."},{"rating":"2","title":"kicks my butt!","review":"Great video!!!

It really kicks your butt, but it's so worth it if you can stick with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracy Anderson Mat Workout DVD","review":"I found that this DVD was better to watch through beforehand prior to doing any of the excercises as I found it easier to follow then. The arm excercises are a bit of a struggle but you really feel it working. It's a fantastic DVD for toning and working every part of your body. I would say that anyone from a beginner to advanced could use it as you don't jump about like an idiot. The music is good (Madonna ish)and you don't need much space, just some 3lb weights and a chair for balance. I have been doing it every morning for the past week and haven't got bored. Would really reccommend this to anyone and you too can have a body like Tracy!! (I hope!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very user-UNfriendly","review":"This video is certainly for advanced DANCERS! Tracy provides so little instruction that it is just frustrating. You just have to keep up, she give no instruction on how to position you body-it is left to you to try to figure it out. She is very dull and seems bored. Her expression rarely changes at all during the entire boring DVD. If you are not a dancer, don't get this DVD. It would be fine if she actually taught you how to dance and do the moves but she doesn't. This is by far the worst workout video I have ever purchased. If you are looking for motivation or inspiration any way, this is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout, but........","review":"If you can get past Tracy's need to pout her lips and the odd tendency to literally break out into club dancing mid workout, you will love the results! It is a great workout, that is not easy. I do see myself being able to do the DVD everyday, eventhough afterwards I am beat. It seems like my muscles don't stay sore for long and I am already seeing tightness in my stomach and arms after only 5 days. I think though, after realizing I like this type of workout, you may like the Pure Barre method and similar ballet type workouts. I think I am going to try some of those out. The one bad thing about the DVD production wise is that you can't start the DVD on Abs or Legs or Arms you have to sit through and do the entire series. Where some days I want to do cardio and abs I feel guilt just watching the DVD to get to the abs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to workout dvd collection","review":"I'm already quite fit, but this workout did provide a challenge. I wasn't sore the next day, but my body was invigorated. If you are not already in pretty good shape then you will find this this workout to be a BIG challenge. There are lots of repetitive small movements to create muscle exhaustion. And if you aren't a naturally gifted mover you might feel clunky doing this workout. Especially the standing ab series where there is little verbal instruction, just visual cues. I do this video on weekends after a cardio workout, as Tracey recommends. Some people call her extreme, but she's just being honest. If you want really amazing results, you need to put in the time. Too many people in the U.S consider walking - or whatever other silly things that don't cause you pain - exercise. If you want to get fit, it's going to hurt a bit, and require some real effort. Does Madonna look like a wimp to you? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I got suckered into buying this","review":"I am completely opened minded to new workouts. I read about Tracy and her workouts and was excited to give it a try. I can't even begin to describe how disappointing this workout was. Very little cuing on her part. She frequently changes hand and feet position with no instruction. She does this standing ab series that is near impossible to follow. The arm series was good, but, NO stretching or break in between that series and the next which uses the same muscles. The lying down leg series, you have to be a contortionist to follow. Seems to me that this whole DVD was for Tracy to admire Tracy. I may be wrong, but, there is NO way for a beginner or even someone, like me, who has been exercising their whole life to get much out of this. Tracy recommends doing this DVD 4 to 6 times a week. No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay Attenttion","review":"OK, I do like the legs and arms of the video. However, the stand up abs work is just crazy, she just tells you to follow along, she can't be serious!! Tracy goes so fast like she is dancing in a club, you can not keep up to it, and she tells you that you will eventually get good at it... OK Tracy. The problem that I have with this workout is the fact she goes right into another position WITHOUT TELLING YOU!!! Are you kidding me????? You don't count while you are doing it, and if I am supposed to be doing these correctly then I should not be looking at the TV set. Tracy just does what she wants like I have been working out with her for years. It is almost like she hates the cameras. It aggravates the hell out of me she does not talk you through the video enough. She should make a better version of this, it is not fair that we pay the money for this and she does not talk enough through it. She may be a good trainer, but she NEEDS training on how to make a workout video.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good supplement to your exercise routine","review":"I have the dance aerobic dvd,and it is a good supplement to your normal cardio workout of treadmill, running, bike, spinning, or elliptical.

I have three kids and my body was in o.k. shape but I could never get it to where I was happy with it no matter what I did. I tried pilates, yoga, spinning, step. None of them did much for me and they bored me to no end. Tracy is the best and this video is incredible. I love that I dont have to leave my house. Someone said they needed more instruction from her and that she doesnt talk enough. I disagree completely. She tells you just what you need to know and its very easy to follow. I can concetrate on the work and not her talking to much. I cant say enough about how much I LOVE this video. I would love to take her class. I hope she comes out with more videos.

I can't say it is the worst workout dvd I've done yet there were some definite negatives. Her cuing is essentially nonexistent. She looks painfully bored throughout the dvd. Also, it is clear she has no background in being a certified personal trainer given some of the moves with the weights were straining my neck so not exactly safe. I've made my own variations. After doing workouts with excellent cuing by people who clearly have the education and experience to demonstrate they know what they are talking about (Gunnar Peterson, Cathe, Joni Love for example), this dvd is a supplement, not my end all be all dvd to workout with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I really enjoyed this workout, its amazing how much you can hurt using little or no weight.

It will kick your butt! It may take awhile to complete the entire DVD. It works as long as you are committed to working out every other day.

I do recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I do not even know where to begin. This woman barely talks through the whole video so you must keep your eyes on the television at all times to see when she switches movements. Half of the time she is just in her own little world dancing around and not giving you any direction. The ab workout is not for anyone with a bad back and there are no modifications. I am not an expert, but I do not think that these are safe movements the way she is just swinging the weights around. Did I mention the music in the background is awful! Don't get roped in because of the stars that use her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly Different","review":"I go through a gym burn out phase every couple of years and this came along right at a good time for me.

Please read the negative reviews before purchasing (unless you're in the size 0 to 2 range)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misnamed Workout","review":"This workout is approximately 56 minutes long; only about 15 minutes or so are actually done on the mat, i.e., supine, prone, or on one's side. Apparently because she is standing on a mat while doing exercises, Anderson considers it a mat workout.The workout portion of the DVD is not chaptered (or at least the one I have isn't) which makes it as tiresome as a video tape because you have to speed through it if you only want to do certain sections of the workout.Instructions are minimal. While executing an exercise, she changes what she's doing at will (e.g., her arm movements) and mostly without any warning.The standing ab portion of this workout is laughable and seems useless, especially considering the poochy look of Anderson's own stomach.Overall I found Anderson's demeanor annoying and the exercises nothing special, unusual, or particularly effective. I have found better results in less time with the Exhale/Core Fusion workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD was scratched and froze in DVD player","review":"I liked the first 12 minutes of the DVD; unfortunately, the DVD was scratched when I received it (even though it came wrapped in cellophane and was 'new').

Tracey does not say when she switches exercises most of the time, so you constantly have to be watching the screen, even while on the floor or when your head should be down.

She also provides physiological information which she states as fact which is complete rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"It really does shape up your muscles without bulking you up.

I really like idea of the accessory muscle workout. It really got my heart rate up and by the time I finish I'm soaked with sweat.

I was excited to see that Tracy Anderson has a \\"Mat\\" workout as I cannot stand and weight bear for long periods of time. This DVD disappointed me as most all of it is done standing up, weight bearing on the feet. Looks like an awesome workout, hope to be able to do it some day. But to call this a \\"Mat\\" workout is a serious misrepresentation of what it's about. From watching it I would give it a five as a workout... but I'm being generous giving it a two star because it does not deliver what the title says. Love Tracy Anderson... wish it really was a mat workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for beginners","review":"This is my first review. I have been doing this mat workout for over two weeks and still can't get through the whole thing! I do as much as I can. What other people have said about the lack of cueing and instruction is absolutely true! However, all this being said I have seen results! I have lost about 8 inches in 2 weeks! I would recommend her post-pregnancy workout. It is a little easier and she explains more about what she is doing. Then come back and get this workout. I now have both and the post-pregnancy video is more my speed for now, even though my last baby was born 8 years ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad instructions.","review":"Tracy Anderson is not very good with telling you the next move, it's more like watch and copy. Unlike other trainers like Jillian Michaels, she actually give you step by step instruction and really explains the next move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I just got and did this workout yesterday. I'm 28 and yoga instructor. I really like Tracy's video which reminds me a lot of dance class mixed with aerobics (some moves) and Kundalini Yoga exercises. The video is not too long (I think around 45-50 mins) so I can do it twice in a day or at least squeeze in a day however I wish she had a little more narration to let you know that she has moved onto another exercise along with a different camera angle(like during the ab exercises) to show which way she is moving. But all in all, it's a nice change with some challenging control since she is changing it up a lot so you can't get used to the repetition. Add some ankle/wrist weights and this would be killer!! Would recommend for someone who wants to exercise/tone their body without all the equipment or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"good exercises/bad instructor","review":"I just finished Tracy's mat workout dvd and although I liked some of the exercises,I found her method to be less than perfect. I spent more time watching than doing because she changes exercises without telling you. For example during her standing abs she moves side to side then back to front then all around without a word. There didn't seem to be a count of any kind . I pretty much had to watch her dance in place. Maybe once I learn her routine I will like it better. It take a long time to do her mat work and I've had better workouts, targeting the same muscle groups, doing yoga. It's not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to learn to give direction","review":"I have many of the Tracy Anderson DVDs and I like the workouts (steer clear of her dangerous diet!), but she needs to work on giving direction. She will switch legs in the middle of the exercise and not say anything. If you are on all fours doing the workout, it is impossible to watch her the whole time. Her dance cardio is VERY hard to follow. She changes her movements constantly without giving any direction, by the time you catch up she's moved on to something else. I'm sure when Gwyneth Paltrow works out with her one on one, the instruction its a far superior experience, but for those of us trying to follow at home it leaves a great deal to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"knees hurt so bad!","review":"I was first really enthusiast about this video and has been doing it 6 days a week during 2 weeks but i decided to stop as my knees hurts really bad, i have troubles going up the stairs and walking...

It only works exactly two muscles in your entire body: your butt and your shoulders. Personally, I do not have 60 min every day to do only that and never even get my heart rate elevated. The ab workout is an absolute joke, really, you are supposed to get abs by shaking your midsection left and right a couple of times? No wonder that she does not have much muscle definition herself, her body is no inspiration, at least on this workout. I may use this as a supplemental workout on days when I feel tired and don't want to challenge myself too much, but again, 60 min of that???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous, dated, Ineffective","review":"This is without a doubt one, if not thee worst \\"fitness\\" dvd ever made.

She basically moves around without telling you much of anything. Just when your ready to do one movement, she switches to another without telling you and also, isn't breathing important?

I'm 48 years old and have those trouble spots that Tracy talks about and hope that with some time I will notice some good changes. I gave this product a 4 only because it is sometimes hard to follow - you have to keep your eyes on what she is doing - She doesn't talk a lot and I like that part - the music is not annoying and somewhat soothing.

I found I was starting to get a bit too muscley so have stopped my classes and don't even go to the gym now , I do this each day and get at least half hour walking - cardio, with a long hike at the weekend. I am at my perfect weight and am looking really toned I am well impressed, my arms are getting nice and slim, my waist is getting smaller due to the standing abs and my legs are changing shape very gradually I reckon you need to do it for at least 2 months to see a proper change my husband even does some of it with me.

I found it impossible to follow because there are hardly any cues. For example, in the warm-up, Ms. Anderson has you bend over and the only way you learn that you're supposed to come back up is if you're watching her. Having to crane your head up to see what's she's going to do next ruins the movement.I suppose if you have the patience to run through the video a few times to learn what to do before you actually do the workout, you'll like it. I wish I had that kind of time. I don't mind working a bit to learn some moves but this is just way too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tracy Anderson Mat Workout Review - not up to the hype","review":"I was extremely excited to get this dvd, and do like though it is not without its problems. The biggest problem is that Tracy doesn't give detailed instruction on the correct positioning required for the poses. This is further exacerbated by the fact that the camera angles are lousy, and shows her doing the excerices, from behind a chair! I am a yoga teacher and know how imperative it is to teach people correct positioning to avoid injury. Her uppper belly workout is far too advanced to teach without any instruction at all, but I think her leg exercises are easy enough to pick up. I also saw a separate video of her on YouTube where she says to up your repetitions to about 100 a day of each exercise. There is NO mention of this in the dvd. It's almost as if she's trying NOT to really let you in on her secret method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase!","review":"I am so happy I bought this DVD, it's great to be able to workout at my house and already start to see results after just 1 week of working out! I didn't think that it would be so challenging but I have to say that for the first 3 times I did the video I had to take breaks because it burned so bad! In the interview with Tracy she says that she used to have more of a gymnaists body with short stocky muscles and that's the way my body is shaped too. I am excited to see when I incorporate the dance video of how much more my body will change!I guess I'm a little puzzled on the responses that I have seen in regards to the lack of instruction for the video. I think the instructions are pretty straight forward and easy to follow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love it but...","review":"I think Tracy Anderson is fantastic and has really done well transforming celebrity bodies. However, I don't think her at home workouts can bring the same results.First of all, she does the routines unevenly and out of sequence. And secondly she doesn't even describe the movements or what to focus on as she does the movements. All in all, very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"I like this dvd...although i was expecting it to be a wee bit harder. The arm section is killer but I'm left with wanting more muscle soreness the following day (sick right? - lol) I like that the moves are \\"old school\\" lots of reps/ light weights and I do think most people will get good results. Especially good for beginners to intermediate levels. More advanced levels may want to add light weights to your ankles. Overall its a fun little video with a dance like vibe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves lots to be desired","review":"This video leaves a lot missing. There is no instruction on keeping proper form to start with. It left me with a sore shoulder for days and was definitely too intense for me. I would like to see the video divided into sections so you could pick out which body areas to work on. I will probably never use the video again and do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"I discovered Tracy Anderson's Mat Workout by accident back in 2008 and ordered it on impulse. Happily, I love this workout and enjoy the exercises, which aren't the same old boring leg lifts/crunches I'd been doing for too long. I totally agree with Tracy about avoiding six-pack abs (ugly!) and about not using weights over 3 lbs. I used to lift heavier weights and wound up with the same loose skin Tracy warns against.One thing I especially appreciate is that Tracy keeps the chat to a minimum. Too many instructors jabber more than is necessary. And I absolutely love the music she uses. It reminds me of living in Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for those with experience","review":"I did this work out for the first time yesterday and I am definetly sore today. There were a few exercises that will take some time to nail and she really doesn't give you ANY guidance on form so if you are inexperienced or just starting to workout this isn't for you. If you have experience with pilates or yoga you should be fine. I feel like if I do this 4 or 5 times a week with some added cardio I will get results. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tracy Anderson Method Presents Mat Workout DVD","review":"This DVD is excellent. I always thought that heavy weights were necessary to challenge the muscles. Boy was I wrong. Tracey showed me that by using your own body's resistance and repetitive movements these components are much more effective than heavier weights. Women take notice. If you want smaller arms, use nothing heavier than what Tracey recommends. I am so happy I listened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great challenging daily workout!","review":"I do this video workout 6x a week & like it because it is challenging & I can feel myself getting stronger. I LOVE that she does not talk very much (like annoying chatterbox Denise Austin)& the music is pleasant enough to deal with everyday too & not have to mute. I just bought the post pregnancy video after reading the great reviews just to have more variety because I plan on following this regime religiously for the next 6+ months to really get in shape & lose 10 pounds & tone up once & for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD content. The entire mat workout is a single chapter :(","review":"Tracy Anderson delivers a great tutorial of her method in the DVD. It's fun to do and challenging at the same time. I would recommend it to women who want to firm and not bulk. There is one minor annoyance in the DVD; if I want to repeat the arm section, I cannot go back to a previous chapter because the entire 60min mat video is a single chapter. In other words, I have to press down the fwd or rewind button to go back and/or forward. That makes repeating sections very inconvenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are going to LOVE this video!","review":"This video is awesome! Tracy has a sweetness about her. She tells you what to do, but she's not screaming over every exercise. I've noticed a difference in my arms in less than a week!If you want a lean and tiny look to your body, her \\"method\\" is for you! All you need are three pound weights, a mat and a chair from your kitchen! Thanks, Tracy for making your \\"method\\" available to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging workout","review":"I enjoy the workout. It is very challenging, especiallyThe standing leg workout. I'm still struggling with the leg workout, but it's getting better.It will be about a month, since I started this workout, and I can already see positive results.You'll need to stick with it to see a real change in your body.The arm workout is challenging as well, I personally love it.At the beginning it really hurts, since you're using the accesorie muscles.It will take a few times to get used to it. Once you get used to it, itGets better. Not for beginners I would say to must be mid way fit to be able toKeep up with the whole workout it's one hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout, requires minimal equipment","review":"Finally a good workout DVD that is simple but surprisingly challenging. I could not complete the entire workout the first few times I did it, but it gets easier if you stick with it. Even my athletic daughter struggled to get thru the first time. You will definitely feel it in your arms and thighs after doing these exercises! The only equipment you need is a mat (or towel), chair, and small weights. The only negative is that Tracy Anderson does not do a good job of vocalizing the movements, it relies on visual, so when you are in a position that you can't see the TV, it's hard to know when to change position. Eventually you learn the moves, so I still rate it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"effective and original","review":"This mat workout is innovative and effective. It's both a New take on old school exercises, and there are quite a few move you would have not thought of - and I am talking to fitness fanatics and instructors ad well. It definitely makes up for the boring cardio routine from the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD case arrived empty - no disc!","review":"I can't write about the actual workout because when I received the package, the case for the DVD was there but it was empty! No disc!! There is a lot of blogging about how Tracy Anderson has taken people's money but not delivered the goods. I thought that Amazon would be safer than ordering from her directly, but apparently it is all the same thing - Amazon processes the order, the TA people fulfill it. And apparently poorly. When I called Amazon, they said they are no longer offer this product. Could it be because they are getting bad orders from the TA company? Be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 month & 3 days after the order, still no DVD....","review":"I ordered the DVD 1 month and 3 days ago and I still haven't received it.Paying 36.43$ for a DVD and not have it yet is just a joke.Never again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video","review":"My wife loves it. I can see results on her with this video and cant on others + Tracy is hot. What more is there to love?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually beautiful, but woefully lacking in verbal instruction","review":"A visually elegant and physically challenging workout, but woefully lacking in verbal instruction. I'm not a dancer, so maybe I'm not used to some of these movements. I'd prefer more instruction than \\"just watch me and try to follow along,\\" especially for the standing ab routine and transitions where you're looking at the ground instead of the TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it ZERO stars I would!","review":"Horrible. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! A waste of my money & a waste of time. This workout is awful and so is she. DO NOT BUY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!!!!","review":"I purchased this DVD after my best friend boasted about it giving her amazing results. The REAL Tracy Anderson Method: Mat Workout should include 2 DVDS, not 1. This vendor is selling you nothing more than a glorified bootleg copy of the 2nd DVD ONLY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracy Anderson's mat workout","review":"This is a video I will do over and over again. I like the music. The only problem is that you can't go exactly where you want to with the dvd. It isn't divided into chapters so if there is a particular body part that you want to work you have to fast forward through the whole dvd to get to it. Other than that, I like it. It's a little tough to do at first but it gets easier as you get stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"gave me knee pain","review":"This work out is not for anyone with hyper flexabity in their joints. My knees started hurting after a week of doing the workout every other day. My knees now make crunching noises and are swollen - I feel like an 80 year old woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!!","review":"I'm so glad I bought this workout. It has a gorgeous balletic feel to it and just makes you feel so graceful after working out. The first part is a standing leg series with plies, etc and the upper body work is done with very low weights. As a matter of fact Tracy advocates that women never use anything heavier than three pounds, but despite the low weight you'll feel completely worked out. The second part is on the floor and includes lower body exercises as well as core and abdominal work. It's also beautifully filmed and the music is perfect for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracy Anderson Method Mat Workout","review":"Excellent workout. Noticable changes to physique in short time (within 2-4 weeks). Do the video 4- 6 times a week and you will be happy with the results. The workdout does take some getting used to since it is not like a typical class offered in a gym or other video."},{"rating":"2","title":"innovative and challenging","review":"I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews here. However I'm extremely pleased with this DVD. First of all it arrived 26 days before the estimated delivery date even though I'm in the UK and the DVD was properly sealed. I have already started doing it. The exercises might look easy but they are not. However, this makes it more challenging and for me it's important not to get bored. My only minor complaint is the abs section since I cannot master what she is doing (yet) and would prefer a bit more guidance. As for the lack of cueing I much prefer it to other DVDs where the instructors don't stop talking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I'm addicted to the Tracy Andeson Mat Workout! I think it is the best workout I've done in awhile and I'm a workout junkie! Love all the different angles that she hits the legs with. Wish she would tape live classes so we could get a new dvd every few months or so!! Would love to know how to become an instructor and bring her method to the midwest!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like it in spite of annoying goof","review":"I liked almost everything about this dvd. Some of the leg floor work can be a bit straining so be careful. The arm section will really tone up your arms just like she say's as long as you do it with some consistency. But theres a mis count in reps in the weight part of the arm workout that really annoyed me considering how much I payed for this dvd. It's not bargain priced. I mean, why wouldn't they fix that before selling the dvd? They have to know it's there. Other than that, the music is great and you will get great toning results as long as you do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is absolutely brilliant and really good at targetting your trouble spots. I can't reccomend this highly enough. It's quite challenging, but you can really feel yourself improving. I would also reccomend her post pregnancy dvd, I think I almost prefer it, but they are both absolutely fabulous. Her cardio dvd however I have not managed to get to grips with at all and that is truly not through lack of hard work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty hard core stuff","review":"Great DVD, really happy I bought it. Tough! First time I did it I couldn't complete the hour, it just got harder and harder. Haven't bought an exercise DVD for ages, would recommend this one, slowly built up to be able to complete it. Only improvement would be if the sections were broken up so that if you only had 20mins you could immediately jump into a specific section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly any instruction going on at all","review":"This workout is interesting but she doesn't verbalize enough. She changes what she is doing (often quickly) without cues and it's often not clear what she is doing specifically enough to follow. It is kinda of odd at times like she is doing the workout for herself rather than to teach. For me a lot of what she is doing is totally new and unfamiliar (I think that is part of her purpose - its her unique workout approach) so I don't have any previous instruction to fall back on as one might with more typical workout routines.I'm used to yoga instruction where you can focus on your own movement and follow basic verbal cues from the instructor and not have to decipher what is going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome workout","review":"At first I did not think much about the workout, but after couple of weeks of doing it everyday, my god - my arms and legs are starting to look awesome. I did not get sore and it did not burn as much as I was expecting based on all of the reviews so I was thinking it was not going to be that effective. Boy - was I wrong! I don't know if it is the number of repetition, sequencing or what but it really works - there really is a Method. My husband, who generally tends to be oblivious to these things, even commented on how \\"sleek and feminine\\" I have been looking. I am so glad Tracy Anderson rolled out this DVD and I found it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tracy Anderson Method: Mat Workout","review":"The dvd was what I expected from reading the other reviews prior to purchasing. I expected it to be dancey and little instruction. However, I was hoping to get something out of it, but found it really boring and uninspiring....almost like Tracy Anderson was just going through the motions in her mind....instruction was poor. Her moves are not challenging, so, no need to be intimidated, but cueing needs to occur. I could not even finish it...I found it that mundane and have not looked at it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this workout!!!","review":"This dvd is my \\"me\\" time. I actually look forward to doing it. I have 3 kids and a full time job. I finally found something that helps me unwind and get in shape at the same time. I love the ballet style moves and the music. I think if you have any kind of dance background or even appreciate dance, this workout will be fun. Tracy is not fake and perky, but she still manages to make you feel great without fluff. It is challenging enough to make you feel like you really are pushing yourself and workin it! I have never been this small since high school, and this is only the beginning. I'm only doing this 3 times a week and another 2 days walking/jogging. If I would do everything she says (cardio and diet daily), I would be doing a lot better. This by itself is changing my body. You either love it, or you don't. Everyone has to find the right thing for them that they enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm so sore","review":"The video is more challenging than I expected, but I love it. The only negative is that she doesn't give a lot of direction so you have to watch closely to see what she's doing the first few times. That said, the positive outweighs the negative as its a really great strengthening workout and surpassed my expectation for the level of workout I'd get from a video."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is really working","review":"I bought the dvd after ruminating on it for weeks. It arrived and I've been doing it for about 3 weeks now, not as often as Tracey suggests, about 2-3 times per week, yet I am still feeling and seeing a difference. I am a long-distance runner and I find me knees have hurt less because of the leg work, and my arms, which have been chunk-a-lunk all my life are getting long, lean lines - I feel firmer and more attractive. I won't lie, it's hard work, but it is something really relaxing and fun, I look forward to doing it.

Starting from square one, the book defines knowledge management, identifies the theories behind it, explains its critical components and examines implementation strategies and results. Of course, any book reflects its subject matter, so this one is thick with jargon and heavy with somewhat abstract concepts like open culture and continuous renewal.

This was so much more necessary in an earlier time than it is now.

Nothing unusual. The top half of the arm that attaches to the side of the fridge just snapped.I \\"repaired\\" it with duct tape. One day later, the bottom half of the same piece snapped.This thing is junk.UPDATE:The seller of this item, when I contacted them to request a refund, refused.

Hoya is known for making dirt-cheap, low-quality stuff. This is not to say this lens is total trash, and if you have a cheap Nikon SLR and just want a relatively inexpensive wideangle lens, this may still work for you -- although $200 is a lot of money in my book.

This is one of the worst kung fu movies I have seen and any fan of kung fu movies knows there are a ton of bad ones. I prefer bad '70s kung fu movies to this. It seems to have taken little parts and scenes from a lot of movies to make this one. I thought the picture quality wasn't that good, the plot wasn't original, and the fight scenes were done poorly.

Maybe if you could watch the movie in Chinese you might have lines of more than three to four words, but because I don't speak Chinese I have no way to tell you; however, watching it in English might give you the pleasure to enjoy lines of at the most two words.

Solar powered watches are great. It charges up easily by sunlight or even putting it under a lamp overnight. I have done several dives with the watch and it performed as expected. It is not my main dive watch, I use a Casio G Shock most of the time, but if you prefer an analog with a one way ratcheted bezel this the way to go. My only criticisms, and they are minor, are that the date is way to small to read, they should have just not had a date and it would be better with a more anti reflection in the crystal, also it is on the small side, around 40mm without the crown, as larger faces are the style now. This is a tough watch and I highly recommend it!For more information and discussion of Citizen divers go to watch freaks forum:[...]There is special board dedicated to Citizen Watches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just got this watch today","review":"I decided that I needed a new watch and this is the watch I chose. Having only worn the watch for a few hours I will update this review in a few months. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR AN OVER SIZED OR LARGER DIVER DON'T BUY THIS ONE. This watch is much smaller than I expected it to be. This watch can been wore to a suit and tie event or just to the gym. Real clean lines and easy to read display. The pictures with the measurements are on Amazon are very misleading. I looked up another watch that I have on Amazon to compare sizes between this watch my other watch. According to Amazon my other watch seemed to be much smaller. I was pretty surprised when I opened the box to see that this watch is the same size maybe even smaller than what I anticipated. Overall for right now I think I will keep this watch I do like how it looks!For looks it gets ***** I'll update the review later on this year on durability and time keeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"great watch for the price","review":"I like the size of this watch, the fact that it's solar powered is another plus.

Although I like to support the local businesses...a $100 bucks is a $100 bucks saved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"Bought one a year ago. Have been very pleased.Positives:Keeps very good time - within a few seconds after a year. Lots better than my old GMT-Master.Nice heft.Very easy-to read dial.Negatives:Small date window - you will have trouble seeing the date after you get to be an old guy.Band could be better. The keeper loops slide too far down and can be a (slight) pain in the backside.Overall:Great watch overall.Performance-wise, it compares very favorably to some of my watches that cost a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a dive watch - Stem and crown will break","review":"The stem broke off during a normal time adjust in less than a year. This is a very low quality watch, which should come as no surprise given the deep discount on Amazon. After my experience with Citizen customer service trying to get them to honor their warranty for this product, I would never purchase a Citizen watch again; Overall a very unprofessional company seemingly embarrassed about their goods. I subsequently bought an Omega Seamaster Professional and am much more pleased (though it was roughly thirty times more expensive), as it is a true dive watch. In sum, only buy this watch if you are comfortable throwing away $165 each year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, bullet proof watch","review":"Simple watch that seems to be bullet proof, accurate w/ no maintenance needed.

Only improvement would be to have the date indicator a little larger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tacky Depth Chart","review":"It's not clear from the photos but this watch has a white and yellow depth chart on the outside of the band that is pretty tacky. I guess it could be useful when diving but for an every day watch it looks silly. The face is also small, crowded and difficult to read. Overall I thought the watch had a cheap look in person. I returned it and got a Seiko brand one that is so much better in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value and performance again from Citizen Watches","review":"I've gone between a number of brands and always return to Citizen for the quality and performance of Citizen watches for the price or even compared to much more expensive watches.

Plus solar powered and with multiple timer settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"Received a 150 gallon tank that is around 10 years old and told it had a leak.

Most of the risk management books out there are too technical to be of any practical use. Allen truly focuses on the practice of risk management and gives us insights on how to be a truly good risk manager. Traders could benefit from his insights as well. I particularly liked his breakdown of linear vs. non-linear risks, and liquid vs. non-liquid positions. In terms of the practical risk management of options (vanilla and exotics) I haven't seen anything this clear and this comprehensive. The accompanying CD is an absolute blessing in order to fully understand the concepts like price vol matrices, etc. This should be a required additional reading for all students in financial mathematics/MBA programs around the world!

Problem is, most of the time now it doesn't work.I bought this to go under my desk at work to keep my legs warm. Initially this worked great, very warm, the oscillating portion was nice so that one side of my legs didn't just cook. It was wonderful. Now, the heater cuts off after not even 1 minute regardless of what setting I have it on. Even when I set it to ignore the temperature control and just blow a steady flow of warm air, it still shuts off. It has an auto-shut off safety feature for if the heater itself gets too hot, so my guess is that this regulator has malfunctioned and shuts the heater off after maybe 1 minute of use. It doesn't work if I set it for continuous low heat, continuous high heat, 65, 75, or 80 degrees...nothing works.It also refuses to come back on once this happens and I usually have to wait hours to try again, so this pretty much makes this fan completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at ANY price!","review":"I bought this heater to replace another dying space heater (Patton brand) that lasted for several years, and still mostly functions. We used this heater for around 1.5 months with several issues, however, when it worked it worked well (hence the 2 stars).The first issue we had around two weeks in was the unit would shut off and stay off, even when the room was freezing cold. It finally started functioning normally again after about a week. It worked for a while after this, but the oscillation would make a clicking noise when in use, so we stopped using it.Finally, I picked the heater up to move it, set it down on the carpet and the heater part of the unit broke free of the base (it looked like only glue was holding the heater to the base).

I applaud Symantec's fixing odd behaviors (non-invasive, such as strange 'quick' popups to handle internal routines, etc), and I appreciate their attempt at making the user experience more consistent and smooth, which they did, but the overall value of the product has dropped.

I have had 3 books on tape and several music CDs on it, which has lasted me several months of listening time during workouts.

I think I have about 300 songs on my current model.... loading the player is really easy (I use Windows Media Player), and the navigation on the player is a scinch. And it takes \\"normal\\" AAA batteries (alkaline or rechargeables). If you're considering the ipod shuffle, you should seriously consider this model instead.... it gives you a lot more features for a fraction of the price.My only suggestion is that Sandisk always include white earbuds instead of black ones, regardless of the color of the player itself (they did on the last 2 models, but not on this most recent one).

The ear phones are not the best; the type that hook on you ears are more comfortable; this cause some pain and irritataion especially when sweating heavily. The case that comes with it looks real flimsly but work very well and seals out the rain. The only negative for the case is the dificullty in removing the player to change the battery. That is probably a good thing as you know the play will stay in place securly. The buttons are great; very easy to use while exercising and very reliable in thier fuction.

If you own a Mac, you're probably better off getting an Apple mp3 player, but those tend to be a little more expensive.If you're looking for bang for your buck in the mp3 player category, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working","review":"I liked the price and the simplicity of it (no need for iTunes or other software), but mine also quit working after about 6 months.

I guess I'll try to spend a bit more on a higher quality product next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome gadget for exercise & daily activities!","review":"I purchased my first SanDisk m250 2 GB player for myself because I really wanted to hear my favorite music when exercising or doing general stuff around the house.

I had been wanting one for a while, so I decided to do some research and found out that this one rated better than the Apple's. That is what made up my mind on getting this one. It was very easy to get started downloading songs. The only thing I had a problem figuring out was how to switch it to the radio, but once I figured it out it's been a breeze ever since. I am going to have to get new earphones for it though, because the ones that came with it don't stay in my ears for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty players","review":"I had a 512 MB player that was acting up after 2 years.

It played well for the first two songs, but on the third it stopped 3 second into it. I turned it off and it did the same regardless of the song. I deleted the library and downloaded again, but the same results. I returned it for another. The second player not only suffered from the same problem, but also would turn off when dropped lightly (1 inch high). Eventually, it remained stuck 3 seconds into one song regarldess of attempts to change it. I returned it and instead got a Phillips 2 GB GoGear with FM radio. It suffered the same problem from one song, but it has reset and software to repair any problem with the player's software and the song now plays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I got what I paid for.

Once switched into MCT mode, I was able to copy files cleanly onto the player just like the Muvo, but it plays the files in alphabetical order BASED ON THE MP3 TAGS! Frak! Then I read that you can create a playlist to play the files in the order you want, but that didn't work either. The stupid thing just kept sitting in the settings menu and never playing. After 4-5 hours of wasted time I ended up taking a hammer to the thing just to relieve the stress. Total piece of garbage.

I can't put playlists on like I used to (by dragging my WMP playlists into the sync window). WMP says the files were synced, but there is no playlist there.The first time I had problems, I researched a lot on-line, and this is a very common problem (not being able to clear out your music and the playlist confusion).

It has been an excellent buy. My only complaint is that it does not receive AM stations (however, it does receive FM stations).I recommend this product for those people who want an inexpensive mp3 player, as an alternative to the ipods. For me, the Sansa has been a great workout companion. And unlike an ipod, this only cost me $25.Update (2011): I bought the product in 2008. Earlier this year (2011) it started turning off as a result of vibrations & shocks while jogging. Very frustrated.

It fits well in my hand so I can change music while I am driving and I'm not distracted. I use this while I do house work, garden, drive in the car, and while at work. I never have any problems with it. I use rechargeable Duracell batteries and always have back up ones charged. I've accidently left this player on in my car while I was at work and when I was driving home, there was plenty of battery life left, I thought it would have died. This is well worth the very low price, I only listen to music and this serves the purpose. Sound quality is great, I use sound blocking headphones that block out noise, so get great music quality. I've dropped it many times and it doesn't have a scratch on it. It would be great for kids too, the screen is easy to see and lights up well. The menu is very easy to navigate. I highly recommend this mp3 player. I like it much better than the Sansa Clip and it's cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been through 3 already!!","review":"We bought 2 of these for our daughters for Christmas a couple of years ago.

The problem it has is there are some .mp3 files that it just does not want to play. Those same files work on other mp3 players, Palms, and computers we have without a problem. We have deleted them off the device and tried again and the same tracks still do not want to play.I bought myself a Creative Zen V Plus about a year ago.

No idea why it has suddenly gone bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as reliable as my old m230","review":"I had a Sansa m230 up until recently. The thing was great, exactly what I wanted in an MP3 player - long battery life, drag & drop music loading, and quality playback. I had it for three years or so, then I dropped it one too many times and the display stopped working. I decided that since the m230 was so great and since the m250 had all the same features, more capacity, and was now less than what I paid for the m230 when I got it, getting an m250 was a no brainer.I'm sorry to say that this product is just not good. Even with the latest firmware, it locks up regularly, the randomizer plays the same song multiple times in a row, and the sound quality is worse than the m230s was. This player is a textbook case for a product taking a serious step backwards.So if you can find an m230 and don't need a lot of capacity, I could not recommend that player more. As for the m250, I have to advise you to stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sansa m250 Promises but fails to deliver","review":"I bought it and it worked right for some time.

I tried to exchange it through Amazon but the return center would not allow me to.I called SanDisk and they tried troubleshooting the problem. It turns out the thing is broken. They created a shipping label for me and I am returning it to SanDisk for a replacement. It sounds like this could have been avoided if I had downloaded their firmware updater on the SanDisk website.

I use a nice pair of skullcandy headphones, and the music sounds like it is coming out of an extremely old set of speakers.At low volume, there is this very irritating buzz that interferes with the music, probably because the MP3 decoder that the device uses is crap.Bottom line - The product sucks if you are used to listening to high quality MP3's above 128kbits. All of my music is at 256K or higher, and it just sounds like crap.

Is it cheeper to buy this and have it die within a day/month or just get an IPOD/Zune that will last you years and has awesome customer support. I will go with IPOD/Zune. This player is finally what drove me into getting an IPOD. I lost my music to many times to poorly designed, low quality players, enough is enough. All the problems listed here are the same problems I have experienced with this and nearly every sandisk player. It takes forever to copy songs, freezes, battary may charge when you plug it in or it may flake out within seconds after saying it's charged and you unplug it, it says songs are copied when they are not, the play order of songs is retarded, the controls are cheap and unresponcive, and this device is over all just garbage. AVOID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star because I never received it","review":"I ordered this MP3 player on March 24 for my daughter and have yet to receive it. I have been trying to contact Chitek Corp, the vendor but they don't respond. Amazon hasen't been much help either. This is the first time I have had a problem ordering from Amazon and I am a bit surprised at the lack of customer service. So, if I ever receive my order maybe I will come back and update my review. In the mean time my advice is to stay away from Chitek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product!","review":"I bought this mp3 player.

Both had the same problem. After only a few hours of use, they just froze, then the display just went blank and could no longer use it.The reason I bought it in the first place was because I didn't want to jump on the ipod band wagon. Well, after my experience with this hunk of junk I did, and I am very happy with my Ipod nano. Save yourself some time and headache, just buy an ipod nano =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"FALSELY INDICATES IT SUPPORTS AUDIBLE","review":"I bought this device to play audible format ([...]) books. It says right on the box that it supports that format..even comes with a startup membership to audible. WRONG.. I went to audible to activate the device and they told me that SANDISK FALSELY advertised that it supported audible. They have been waiting the flash codes and sandisk still has not sent them. I tried contacting SANDISK to complain and get direction but there was no response to my concerns.

DISAPPOINTED IN TEXAS"},{"rating":"1","title":"My old 512MB was better in some ways","review":"While I enjoy the increased memory for more music and the recognition of more file types, I miss the old buttons I had on my 512. Buttons simply offer more tactile feedback than the membrane areas (I guess that's what they're called) on my newer m250. Sometimes these membrane areas don't respond and the A-B function I bought this unit for?; fugget about it! It's very difficult to isolate small segments of music with the new membranes. This is very important for me to learn a piece of music by ear. If I had known about these drawbacks prior to buying this 'new and improved' model I never would have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor at bitrates > 256 K","review":"I've owned this Sanza for around a year now and I think I have discovered the problem. I purchase most of my music from Amazon and I've noticed that some tracks sound good and others bad. When it's bad you can hear skips or artifacts that I don't hear when played directly on my laptop. Then I discovered that when you press the round center button to get information on the track, if the reported bit rate is greater than about 256K these are the tracks that have problems. I suspect the decoder hardware in the m250 just can not support the throughput of MP3 greater that 256K continuously, so the skips are portions that can not be decoded in real time, and distortion is heard. I'm hoping newer offerings have better, faster hardware that will decode reliably at high bit rates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets all of my expectations","review":"It is my second sandisk mp3 player.

It always looked for track numbers (if available). Even if you sorted the files first in WMP.If you use WMP and keep everything in playlists, you'll be OK. But if you have various podcasts and songs you want to arrange in your own order of play, forget it. Your chosen order of play will be lost when you sync the songs.

I use it to listen to audio books while walking my dog or riding the lightrail to work in Portland, OR. I can easily plug it into my car's cassette adapter to continue listening in the car. My son has an IPod Nano and thinks it is the best, but I have trouble manuvering the Nano's controls and no problem with the Sansa. Since my family goes camping a lot, I like that I can change the battery and not need to plug my player into a computer to recharge. 2 GB has been more than adequate for me, but I would probably buy a 4 GB if I had to do it again. I had no problem with the software since Windows Media Player is pretty standard and the headphones are fine (except that the white foam pads got pretty grimy while I was gardening - totally my fault)"},{"rating":"2","title":"sandisk sansa m250 2GB mp3","review":"I have had this mp3 player for several months and I love it!!

I liked the small size of the player, and I found it to be a very handy little contraption. However, after 3 or 4 days of receiving the player, it stopped recognizing music, and it began to leave out letters on the titles of songs and albums (for example, Blue Oyster Cult would be displayed as Bl Os C, and Billie Jean would be displayed as Bil Jn) and it eventually froze on the opening screen and completely stopped working. I called Sandisk's customer support and was told of a method to use for resetting the Sandisk, which did NOT work. Please, don't waste your money on this MP3 player. I found it to be extremely poor quality and overall a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!!","review":"This product is horrible and frustrating and a giant waste of money and time. It stops functioning about every two weeks. None of the \\"fixes\\" I've downloaded from the web site have fixed the problem. The only thing you can do is completely reformat it, wiping it clean, and start over. Of course, you can't do this at the gym! Sometimes it won't communicate with the computer, other times it just won't play. There are much better products on the market. Save yourself and don't buy a SanDisk!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great When It Worked","review":"I'm here to \\"join the club\\". I ordered my first unit in January, it was GREAT... for about two weeks. Sadly, I liked it so much when it worked that I talked my friend into buying one. (Sorry, Malisa) Anyway, I sent it back and received another one. This one \\"froze\\" immediately and I had to send it back today. I talked to Malisa, and she had to send hers back as well. The big advice for the day is...IF you are going to purchase this item, make sure you keep your packing slip and all the packaging. Also, I'd play it ALOT... so that you can see if your unit is going to freeze up before your thirty days is up.Odds appear to be EXTREMELY good that your unit is going to freeze up, so if you enjoy gambling, and want to take a shot at it... I wish you well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy SanDisk Customer","review":"This is the 2nd. SanDisk product I've purchased and have had the same problem with and had to return for credit.

It is a nicely built unit but the interface is the worst I have ever come across. The software/firmware has a mind of its own and move your files to what ever folders it thinks the music or podcast belongs. It will break up the tracks from one CD and put them all over the place. Who in Sandisk thinks that they should decide where I should put my musics and how to organize my files. What a piece of junk as far as the software is concerned. Please read other reviews and comments. I should have read all reviews and negative comments before I made my purchase. Sandisk must change the software/firmware. From all the reviews I have read, I don't think they care."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice while it lasted","review":"I definitely enjoyed this mp3 player... for the whole 27 days it lasted.

The player is Great, i prefer using batteries, because the ones with the charging preinstalled batteries usually run out before 8 hours.Rechargable batteries usually last close to 12 hours.

So I just got my new device and and I'll have to see if it works longer than 2 months before I can make my final judgement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Product","review":"I bought my daughter the M230 and myself the M250. I am very impressed with the quality and user friendliness of this device. No more skipped CD's when I am on the treadmill and it's so small I can store it anywhere! It also comes with an arm band and a case. It's a cinch to upload my songs and delete them if I am tired of them. SanDisk is one of the higher quality MP3 makers and definitely worth the money. I don't need an I-Pod as this does the exact same thing, only cheaper. If I want to watch a video I will turn on the TV, I-Pod's are overrated anyway. SanDisk is the way to go if you want quality in an MP3 Player. The volume is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"SanDisk Sansa m250","review":"Sure the thing feels cheap, but it sure gets the job done. Plug it into a USB port and drag and drop in files, you're good to go. I use mine sorta like a Shuffle; just drag in 2GB of stuff and let it go random.

I was careful with it but it didn't last a full year."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Money","review":"After reading all the good reviews for this unit I was quite surprised to see it malfunction so badly. I loaded music on it with no problem. After listening to some songs I stopped it. When I turned it back on it won't do anything but say it's name. If I hook it up to the computer it says the tracks are still there. When I disconnect it from the computer it says that it is rebuilding the library. It continues to say that for a long time unless I turn it off. Removing the battery didn't help. The manual is a joke.The really bad part is that it worked so well at first that I ordered a second one. Before the second one got here the first one went bad. The second one didn't last as long as the first. There is no way I will buy another one. Only time will tell if I can get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent little player","review":"I've had this about a month now and performs well. Great sound, FM radio, voice recorder, what more could you ask for. I get about 16 hours of battery life per AAA. I've also dropped it a few times already and holds up well unlike my previous Rio Nitrus which stopped working after i dropped it.There is no software to install for Windows XP and its simple drag and drop. The navigation is straight forward you can play by artist, album, and other methods. For some reason though, it doesn't seem to recognize the track numbers in the id3 tag even though it sees everything else fine so it plays them out of order. I believe it plays it in the sequence you put it in the player.The FM reception is mediocre but the voice recorder is excellent. Also, the picture is a little misleading in its thickness. Its about 3/4 of an inch thick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back","review":"I bought this to listen to three things: cd's that I'd ripped to my computer, Audible downloadable audiobooks and NetLibrary audiobooks.I ended up returning the item after a frustrating experience with their customer service folks who were unable to fix my problems. I could download things sometimes, but the Sansa would index incorrectly. For example, the music will transfer to the sansa but it would not play. Sometimes a chosen song would play, sometimes a chosen song will appear on the screen in pause mode and would not get out of pause mode. When I'd go back to the play menu, all items on the Sansa would list with that song title.I'm quite technically inclined, so this wasn't operator error. Ended up getting the Creative Zen Nano Plus. It is working very very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Much Pleased with Sansa","review":"I was looking for a MP3 player with reasonable price and standard features. In the last month I bought Sansa M250 and since then I am heavily using it without any slightest problem.Sansa M250 met all of my expectations. I am so pleased with it so that I've already ordred for the 4GB-Sansa. It stores songs and provides the search capabilities by \\"Genre\\", \\"Album\\", \\"Artist\\", etc.. I can create my own playlist as well. Its recording capabilities is awesome. And its radio feature is exceptioanlly well - what else you want??Uploading songs to Sansa is very straight forward.Lots of folk complain about its contrast/backlight and the button areas - but it works very fine for me - everytime.I am giving this product 5+ stars. Don't fall in the trap of iPod, buy Sansa, use Sansa and live with Sansa!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 1st MP3- loving it!","review":"My first MP3 and am really pleased with it so far.

Already loaded several CD's and songs and tons of space left.Again, never used one before and feel like it was pretty straightforward how to use. I bought it after reading reviews here so thought I'd pass along to others what I found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good buy for the mone","review":"I am very pleased with my purchase of this mp3 player.

It locks up the player about every two or three months. I used to be able to go to SanDisk's website and download a fix, but now this player is not listed on the website. Do not expect to be able to use this player for very long. If you do buy it, format the disk, i.e., erase everything, once a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal","review":"This is a great deal for anyone who wants a light mp3 player for jogging. It is well made and sounds great. The FM radio works well also. I have read many negative reviews about the durability of this and I don't see what they are talking about. You would not expect to be able to step on this without it breaking but just dropping it would not likely reult in damage because it is so light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real good","review":"This is a very good product.

But, the previous one I had (1 GB) lasted only 18 months - then died. I hope for longer life from this one. Best features are:(1) Easy to update, erase, etc. -and-(2) It takes a single AAA replaceable battery; so if it quits, just pop another (rechargeable) battery in and continue listening [rather than having to wait for an hour or three to recharge a built-in battery in order to continue listening]. iPods and other brands should take note of this.The major feature that is MISSING from this palyer is a clock-calendar, which would allow the downloading of time-limited library audio-books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great little device, but no fast forward","review":"I was so excited to get this device for audio books. I was very disappointed when I started a book and found that if I stopped mid-chapter, I could not get back to my place. It's a big problem when the \\"chapter\\" is an hour long and I've listened to 40 minutes of it! I either have to start over, skip the last 20 minutes, or let it run and set a timer to pick it up at the right spot. Not very convienent.

IF it worked","review":"I LOVED this little player... so much that I tried three times to get one that would work for more than three weeks. They freeze on the start up screen, and there is NOTHING you can do to fix it. I enjoyed this player because it held roughly 500 songs, used one triple A battery, and was very easy to operate. Wonderful, lightweight, compact, and good sound... that being said, it could clean my house and balance my checkbook, but if it doesn't work it is essentially useless.Keep your packaging and receipt... and enjoy... cautiously.I had a friend who had to send hers back twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"For the first few weeks, it worked just perfectly. No problems at all. IThen out of nowhere I'm trying to play a song and the nothing is happening. I go to switch the song and all the artists and songs are listed as \\"Mechanix\\". Sometimes it'll freeze up completely or I'll get an error.Also, as I put music in, I'll get a message that the device is not responding. Once it does that (even once), it scrambles just about every song around into the wrong place. One song can be in 7 different places while others can't be found at all. I try overwriting the files, and that doesn't help. I'll delete everything and start all over, only to be denied.Now, to take the cake, it has gone from a 2 GB player, to a 700something MB player.

I could NOT get any menu on screen to browse for any more function other than viewing the current song. There is no way to use radio and recorder. There are two ways to turn it off: take out the battery or press Pause button and wait 1 minute. The Lock button works as expected and is not the cause of the problems I mentioned. I can load songs into it but can only play the songs one by one in the order and there is no shuffle play. SanDisk won't replace it becuase it's past the 1 year wanrannty period.

It was just past the 30 day Amazon return policy, so I'm sending it back to SanDisk and they're sending me a new one.They offered to replace it so quickly and based on the message board here, this seems to be a fairly common issue with the m- series. I noticed that the SanDisk support line no longer even mentions the m-series, only c and e. I wonder if they are doing away with the m's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little MP3","review":"I wanted an MP3 player for e-audio books.

He was completely happy with it until it froze after only one week of owning it. I did not realize this was a common problem with the product until my friend started having the problem and I searched for troubleshooting advice. The only suggested solution is to return it and get a refund. If the product worked properly, everything else would've been perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Little MP 3","review":"This is my third version of this product. Intitially bought the 512 mg. Then the 1 gig and now own a 2 gig. For ease of use and set up the SanDisk works great for me. Not to mention affordability! You don't have to spend thousands for an MP 3 player and be a slave to the I phenomenom."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The item does not work as advertised. I returned the first shipment. The return was painless and Amazon did a perfect job. The second unit acted exactly the same as the one i returned. I am unable to access the menu. I can load the memory from my computer and it plays back the songs in a random fashion over which i have no control.I DECIDED To KEEP THE THING AND USE IT AS WELL AS i CAN. I'll keep it until one of my kids wants an improved iPod and then I'll trade him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does everything I ask","review":"I bought a 512mb player for my son and liked it, so I bought this one for myself. Lightweight, uses only one AAA battery and has a radio. Controls are easy to get used to and the sound is good. I traded off the headphones right away for some better ones. It has become a regular training mate especially on long runs, where I have run it for five hours straight no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandisk Sansa M250 2 GB MP3 player","review":"I bought this to play audible books, not music. I find it difficult to manuver through, especially to bookmark my place. If I put it on pause to attend to something else for a minute, it shuts itself off in about 30 seconds. Then you have to wait about 5 mins to turn it back on again. I like my Creative Zen much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last long","review":"The Sansa Disk 2 GB arrived at the end of June 2008. By the end of February 2009, the on off switch stopped working. That is; the MP3 player simply stopped working. In addition, before then it repeated recorded segments in a pattern that defied explanation. This is not a good item and you should not consider it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SanDisk Sansa m250","review":"This is my 4th Sansa MP3 and I love all of them. They work well and are easy to load and navigate. I keep one at work, one at the gym, on on the lawn mower and one for everywhere else.Sansas use several different types of media, so there is no problem downloading to it. I would not recommend any other brand of MP3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"SanDisk Sansa m250 MP3 player","review":"Second Sansa MP3 player in two years that I've purchased that has quit working. Will not buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I received this as a Christmas gift last month. I really liked it a lot. I didn't feel the need for something very expensive or complicated, and this really fit the bill. It had a good sound, and was easy to navigate. After maxing out the song capacity @ almost 400 songs, it suddenly stopped working last night. It will now only turn on & off, with the message \\"finalizing update\\" on the screen forever. This is very upsetting to me, as I was very careful with it, keeping it in the plastic case & in a ziploc bag in my purse. Also, now that I think of it, I started having a little trouble with it turning on & off a couple of weeks ago. Sometimes, I would have to push the on button 2x for it to come on. Overall, I would not recommend this product to anyone, because it wasn't even worth the $20 my husband spent on it. I am very disappointed in this MP3 player. Now I have to save up for another one, when I was hoping this one would last me a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD SO FAR","review":"Was attracted to the battery replacement capability, and ease of loading. Was able to drag songs onto device without additional software. Have not completely loaded it yet, but am using it while on treadmill. Have not yet had to replace battery-probably have 10 hours on it at least. Using this more than my Nano and Shuffle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad mp3 player at a good price.","review":"I bought this mp3 about two years ago, when it was $90. The forward and backward speeds were very slow, not good for audiobook play. The recording volume is low. It broke in 1.5 years, so I cannot use the warranty. Now it is only $40. If you use it just for simple songs and prepare to throw it away after a year, it is pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again","review":"I used this MP3 player for less than 20 hours before it failed. After that the power would come on, but it would not boot up beyond the brand name screen. My Omnitech player with the same memory capacity and features for less than half the price is still going strong. I would not buy another product from SanDisk again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable - 2 for 2 failures","review":"I bought two of these for my daughters.

Pulling this thing out of the box it is about as high quality as something out of a cracker jack box! I had the same problem as the others with the weird alphabetical song transfer. I tried ALL of the suggestions on here--media monkey, changing the mode--NOTHING worked! The picture that is up here is completely deceptive. It makes it look like it's as deep as a cell phone. This thing may be small but it's also bulbous and the earphones are horrible. I can't say enough bad things about this product and don't understand how so many people can love it. They've obviously never experienced the marvels of the Creative Zen for which I coughed up roughly twice this but got a product that will last and last unlike this TOY that is completely useless to me that I'm sending back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Well, for a first time Mp3 player I suppose it isn't awful... but I wouldn't spend the money again on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Unlimited Song Downloading Subscriptions!","review":"The SanDisk Sansa M250 has an LCD display with a backlight, however it's often hard to read because of poor contrast. The Creative Zen V and V+ have a much brighter display, are much more compact than the M250, and can display color photos at good resolution (the M250 can't display any photos at all), yet they're also compatible with Napster-To-Go. I'd recommend either of the Creative Zen V/V+ models over the SanDisk M250.The Play For Sure designation for MP3 players, and its logo on this particular MP3 player, don't guarantee it'll work for a Napster-To-Go subscription. Fortunately, the M200 series of MP3 players from SanDisk (including the M250) do work with Napster-To-Go so you can legally download an unlimited number of songs to up to 3 PCs and up to 3 MP3 players in one household."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAPER WEIGHT","review":"I really liked the player until today when it \\"locked up\\" on me. The display is frozen and the back light is on. It doesn't respond to any buttons and removing the battery doesn't fix the problem. Basically, its just junk now.

Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"scandisk sansa m250 2 gb","review":"we are very pleased and this is the second one of this kind in a different color. I would greatly advised for others to enjoy the fun of this mp3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Value!!","review":"Sandisk players are the best. I currently own 3 different units ranging in capacity from 512mb to 2gb. Loading the music is very easy and the playback quality is superb. The only drawback that I can see is that selecting a specific song for playback can be time consuming, but I usually just let them play randomly. Considering the low cost, the simplicity of use and the good sound quality, this unit is an exceptionally good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't even need a bra!","review":"This is my first MP3 player, so I do not have anything to compare it with, but I also had no idea how to use one, and have found it to be really user friendly.I read a lot of reviews because I wanted an MP3 player that was inexpensive (I am mostly just listenting to it while I exercise.), easy to use, and would hold up decently. CNET gave this one a good review, and most all of the Amazon reviews were very favorable, too.I have had it for a couple of weeks, and for being TOTALLY clueless about using an MP3 player, this has been really easy to figure out. It was easy to load music on, easy to use, and the FM radio even seems decent. It even came with a simple case and arm-band so I don't have to stick it down my bra while I exercise!! I am very happy with the SanDisk Sansa!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive","review":"Works as is designed and well at it as that. MP3 player and FM radio work well . The only negative is the lack of a built in speaker which would be nice to check your voice recordings from time to time such as I had with another brand.Simple to use also so it get's 4 out of 5 stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"can power on","review":"Can't power on. Freezed at beginning. Computer can't recognize it any more. Recorded voice is very low. If you buy it, prepare to throw it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move on, it never worked well and finally froze","review":"This is my third mp3 and I went the cheap route with this unit. I got what I paid for. The sound was so so (not very loud), the controls weren't good. But what drove me nuts and ultimately this unit against a wall was the software. The way the files were stored and the navigation caused a lot of scrolling. Then it started to freeze every once in a while. Then the unit just stopped working. I could have sent it in but for 35 bucks, not worth the time. Save yourself the headache and skip the Sansa m250."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different","review":"We first heard a cut from this album on the car radio, seemingly caught between stations. After spending a full minute trying to tune it in (and possibly causing some vehicular damage along the way), it dawned on us that it already was. The music on 'Segundo' is atmospheric, seductive, captivating and strange. Juana Molina is, oddly, an Argentian comedian/musician with a beguiling whisper of a voice. But it is her talent as a producer which dominates this cd and makes it a unique and pleasant listening experience. Complex and compelling rhythms and melodies, a dream-like wash of acoustic and electric instruments, and a torrent of Hollywood sound effects from barking dogs to crying babies. The fact that we don't understand the language (except for an occasional jarring sprinkle of English) allows the spell to be cast that much deeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minimalist and touching","review":"Having grown up in Argentina where Juana was well known as a brilliant TV comedienne back in the 90s (something she's put behind her a few years ago for good) I didn't know much what to expect. What I found was a sweet record, made of descriptions of small moments and characters. I think this is what Banana Yoshimoto would sound like if she made music: intimate and revealing of the small touches of bliss and loss in the ordinary motions of everyday life. Whether describing a small auditory revenge on the owner of a dog that never ceases to bark (\\"El perro\\"), recounting the anticipation of a mother's visit (\\"La visita\\"), sending an egotistic lover packing (\\"Quiero\\") or wondering who is going to mother her child when she's gone (\\"Quien\\"), the small moments in this CD (greatly realized in her small, mellow voice and the looping beats and bare instruments that provide her background) add to a beautiful recount of daily existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lil project","review":"Well i fell in love with my truck over again.

I've heard \\"Airlock Homes\\" tune on Rhapsody and it made me look up the name quickly. Wow, what a strange mix of influences and sounds this band has. Lots of electronics, but all have unique sounds and melodies. Whoever plays drums and bass on some tunes do it just right too. Whatever style it might be, you have to check it out for yourself if you into musical adventures. I also liked \\"Power Clown\\" and \\"maim that tune\\", some tunes on those sounded like classic already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystal Clear Saturation of Upbeat and Downtempo Talent","review":"What a nice piece of work this is.

Using the warm water method also works well for cleaning the mouth and inside of the cheeks.We also use them to clean her teeth with slightly cold water, careful not to touch the gums.Lastly, when only a small amount of liquid can be swallowed, these are perfect - dipping them in ice water or a mild juice, and then placing it on the tongue, so our Mom can suck the liquids from the sponge.The handles are long, and being plastic they hold up well. Each swab comes in a small wrapper, and we often snip off the ends of several to have them ready when needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dentips","review":"I ordered dentips for my daughter and her friends when they went to Canada.

Then he introduces Media, an assistant with disturbing moe overtones. In the tenth episode Media starts school and Behoimi and her find a bunch of bombs and make a creepy innuendo.Amazon again failed to do a rating.

Would be nice to have the back panel labeled.A couple of the knobs fell off within a few days but can be fixed if you're willing to epoxy them on forever.The taps for the bolts to secure the mounting brackets, on the sides of the unit, are teeny tiny and stip out pretty easily.

Anyone could have done her role in Children of the Corny IV: The Gathering, and it won't make a farthing of a difference. It's a terrible film on so many levels. What was incredible is that it is no different from all the horror films made the last decade yet Children of the Corny IV: The Gathering was rated by the viewers very lowly whilst the others made more in box office and were highly rated. To me, they are in the same league with one same enduring aspect: crap. Basically, people are killed in various ways, there isn't a sensible plot to speak of, deaths are gorier than the one before, and soul and feelings are nil. Boring, if you ask me.

Their still-in-print, important books here get written and discarded in single paragraphs, while they fret and moan for pages about infidelities, despite being alleged proponents of free love. I don't know if this is who/how they were, but it's disappointing to read about and boring to me. Weak women mooning over men isn't a particularly interesting plot to me.

Unfortunately, this book should be rated \\"X\\" because there is not only a lot of sex in the book, it is very graphic and detailed. And its focused on bondage and domination and in one case the savage multiple rape of a teenage hooker by the main character. The politics of the book would be labeled \\"right wing\\" but only by the neo-communists of the world.

Won't buy Ringo again, he's been slowly sliding out of acceptable bounds in my mind, now he's crossed the line to where I don't want to support him at all. I picked it up on the basis of his name. having read him before i was disappointed but not totally surprised to find the content but those who haven't read him before probably didn't expect to get what they got.I can disagree with someone politically and still enjoy their work, but then I can disagree without the absolutist categorizations of those who disagree with me too.

I think this is meant to be over the top, with a cartoonish protagonist that doesn't help people out from a sense of duty, but because he likes to kill and he likes to bang hot broads. ( Ringo not only tries to kill every bad guy in this book, he tries to kill liberalism also ).Do not go into this expecting character studies or moral journeys, you will be dissapointed.

If you are a John Ringo fan this won't be what you expect. All of John's books have had Hero's you could like or root for. Not in this one. The main character named Ghost is basically a retired Seal who dreams of and throughout the book becomes a Rapist. The book has three sections of action separated by what seems like brochures for Dominance, Sadomasochism and rape. This guy actually enjoys hurting women I found him to be totally despicable. Prince Roger or Mike O' Neal would make short work of this guy. The three action segments are totally unbelievable as he single handedly wipes out hundreds and saves the country and then the Pope from nuclear weapons.

The sex and violence Ringo warns about don't particularly offend me, but where previous work had some reasonable depth of drama and human perseverance, this story reads like a Young Republican's fantasy. Some of the political spin was so bad it read like an election ad. After finishing \\"Watch on the Rhine\\" and going to this book, I couldn't believe it was written by the same person. The next time I see a new Ringo book I'll wait for reviews before spending my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad compared to the author's other works","review":"I have truly enjoyed most of Ringo's other works -- especially the Prince Roger series and the Posleen war series.This book, however, was truly bad unless you happen to be a Ghengis Khan conservative and you hate women. The plot revolved around unbelievable action scenes interspersed with explicit, often sadistic sex scenes, and frequent political diatribes.I am hoping this book was an aberration and that the author returns to his earlier style in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy! Main character is a child rapist.","review":"About two-thirds of the way through the book, the otherwise-sympathetic main character violently rapes and then sodomizes a 15 year old European girl. The violence of Islamic extremists and the sex between consenting adults earlier in the book were well within tolerable limits, but I was shocked when I realized what was happening in part 3 of the book. I had to sit and think for a moment about what I had just read. As much as I enjoy military fiction by an entertaining writer, I realized that I consider detailed descriptions of rape and sodomy of a 15 year old girl unacceptable, EVER. At a minimum, this book should be \\"Adults Only\\", and be considered a XXX book not to be sold to children or teenagers. I threw the book in the garbage and I will never read a book by John Ringo again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I kind of enjoyed the first third of this book. The hero was likeable and the humor was biting. Being ex-military in a pretty liberal city, I fully empathized with some of the sentiments expressed. The denouement of part 1 was fun, even though total B.S. Imagine fighting a defensive action against overwhelming odds from an underground fortress accompanied by 48 beautiful naked co-eds! Part 1 would have gotten 3.5 stars from me.That's where the story should have stopped. The rest of the book lacks in humor and properly belongs in the pages of the Penthouse forum. Ringo expounds more than I ever wanted to know about S&M; in part 2 in a storyline with no plot whatsoever. Part 3 is not much better -- again little to no plot. Our hero is always right by virtue of his \\"spidey sense\\", and includes an entirely unnecessary graphic rape scene on the part of the hero.This is trash. Ringo can do better. Now he has to prove it."},{"rating":"1","title":"degrading....","review":"This book is cheap, sleazy trash. Its degrading to women with all the rape that is in it. Don't purchase it...you'll be wasting your money.Gave it one star only because I HAD to give it something. My choice would have been no stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hero is a Rapist?","review":"Being a retired Army officer, I understand that, for some soldiers, the violence that it is necessity to apply to be an effective soldier can cross the boundaries into one's private life. That given, it is never acceptable or condoned. To have a hero of a novel denigrate the young women he rescues as ignorant, mindless liberals unworthy of his sacrifice, spend a second episode of the book in gratuitous S&M, and then have a violent rape of a prostitute by the HERO in the third episode begs the question as to Mr. Ringo's motives and/or attitude toward women. I loved his marine SF series, but I'm deeply disappointed in his latest offerings. Very disturbing stuff from John Ringo. If he's trying to make a point, I took it to be that he has issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT FOR THE WEAK","review":"This book is awsome! If you like the military, have been in the military, or know people in the militarty weather they are in the Army, Navy, Airforce, Marines, or even the Merchant Marines (and I mean KNOW know people) then you will love this book. Granted some parts are out there because it's not PC but when you've been through training (even a little bit) you will appreciate all that goes on in this book and will find it funny and true (even though most people don't want to admit it). Lots of blood and gore, sex, funny incidents through out the book. This book is definately not for the faint of heart. It's tough and raw (just like real life). It's an easy read and I can't wait for the next two books to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusion","review":"I love the whole series, \\"BUT\\" when I search for the series by 'Series Title' I am getting two different titles. Like Mike, I like things simple. Is the sries' title \\"Paladin of Shadows\\" or \\"Ghost\\" after the first book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are some things you just don't want to know ....","review":"John's local to us here in Atlanta and I've met him. But after reading \\"Ghost\\" I'm afraid I wish I hadn't. He's exposed some maggots that I don't want to think were crawling around in the brain of someone I've met.His character's casual acceptance of the right of men to \\"buy\\" women who are trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation is pretty disgusting in a man who has two daughters. Yes, we know this sort of filth goes on, but for a man who has daughters to write about it casually and accept it as pretty much as an OK thing .... UGH.John, between the crapola of \\"Cally's War\\", the cardboard cutout characters in \\"Looking Glass\\" and now this - you've probably lost a fan. I doubt it matters to you much, but I certainly won't recommend you to folks - at least not without spelling out exactly which books they ought to avoid at all costs. Now could someone pass me the mental soap please?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"HARD CORE literary PORN and a tremendous disappointment. Anyone that derives pleasure from reading the violent sexual acts (consensual or otherwise) portrayed in this book should seriously consider therapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some odd choices","review":"Picked up a copy of this with a gift card for my birthday and buying another few for christmas. If you like paramillitary fiction this is a good book with Ringo's normal flair for describing combat scenes. There are a few scenes that stand out as unusual for Mr. Ringo involving some heavy B&D sexual scenarios. While no worse than the sex in the kushiel books or some of anne bishop's it seemed a little out of place for a writer who normally does sex scenes off camera. Except for the 20-30 odd pages which seem from another book one of my favorite books of this year and one I shall be gifting to a few adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a collector's item...","review":"I did something with this book that I've only done one other time in my life of reading (literally) hundreds of books - I took it back to the store and got my money back. I've been (and will remain) a Ringo fan, but this book celebrates the worst sorts of human depravity, treating the degredation of women as \\"different strokes for different folks.\\"I love a good shoot-em-up, and conflicted heroes are the most realistic kind, but publishing an apologetic for \\"controlled\\" (I'm really searching for an adjective here) B&D; as a healthy expression of human sexuality by sandwiching it between 2 stories that show the evils of it being out of control is very disturbing. It is not what I have grown to expect from Ringo or from Baen. I hope they will not stoop this low again."},{"rating":"1","title":"some liberals like guns","review":"Setting aside that the anti-hero is a self-admitted rapist, he saves a bevy of naked women from radical islamists, one of whom is so overcome she promises to tear up her liberal credential and forever vote Republican! As he is saving them he shouts that he ought to at least get oral sex for it. What a guy. Oh, and he only wants real news to learn of his exploits, you know, Fox. Since I already bought it, I'll use it for target practice. I'm thinking I'll use the Glock."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"Easily one of the worst novels I have ever read. Terrible writing and story. A thoroughly unlikable \\"protagonist.\\" Just reads like the worst kind of slashfic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I was lent this book by a friend from their collection because they thought I would enjoy it. It's not science fiction or fantasy like most of the books I enjoy, but boy were they right. I have since decided to read more military fiction...and more books by John Ringo because this is anything but dry or boring, I got swept up in the action and thrills. This is a book that I was actually able to read in the car without noticing things going on around me (that's a huge compliment as I usually get motion sick)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way different .. not to most readers' taste?","review":"SPOILER ALERT!!I've enjoyed Ringo's other books (Council Wars, Posleen War, Empire of Man). This one *started* well enough: discharged SEAL witnesses college kidnapping and saves the day. After that, though... he ends up in witness protection and acting as an off-the-books agent, and while waiting for his next assignment, is spending WAY too much time for my taste picking up young lovelies to act out his bondage/domination fantasies on.I understand he said this was a book he felt he had to get out of his system. Fine. But a *series* of them? Sorry, John, not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch","review":"If you are a John Ringo fan based on the Posleen and such books as that. You are in for a shock with this one. Starts off well enough, but wow goes to where I put my copy, the garbage, in one hell of a bad way. Absolutely no reason for the graphic evil he depicted here with no warning on the cover or elsewhere. Most of us like a little sexual story now and again, but sexual evil, nah, do not need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Could Have Been A Contender","review":"The first book in the Paladin series, this is less of a novel and more of a collection of short stories. This book has the potential of being very good military fiction, except that it is plagued by the authors daemons.The good parts include interesting characters, somewhat interesting situations (in the case of the first and third stories), and a clearly expert grasp on military concepts.All this good is happened by the gratuitous and fairly deviant sex throughout the book. The second story is so bad it reads more like a penthouse letter then a short story.The book was clearly written from Ringo's inner voice, and it makes me never ever want to meet the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"ghost: a pale reflection of john ringo's talents","review":"I've always liked John ringo's hard-edged military sf -- his ability to talk in realistic terms of what it means to be a soldier and blend that with a skillfully-created future. so I was diappointed that this book was not sf. but I was even more disappointed in how shallow and one-dimensional this book is. True, the main character has character flaws. But they are so superficially described, it's like the hero is a caricature of a \\"real\\" person. The terrorist plot that kicks off this story is really dumb and makes no sense whatsoever. Ringo's less-than-one-dimensional portrayal of the press and \\"leftie liberals\\" and, yes, of conservatives too, may be a super-hawk Neo-con's fantasy, but not for a thinking person. There are much better SEAL/specops thrillers out there. don't waste your time on this dog of a book. I expect better from this fine author's word processor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written action/porn","review":"This book is one of the worst I've ever read - and I read a lot of books. It is an action/porn from the sick mind of radical conservative, with scenes of killing Osama bin Laden, nuking a Middle Eastern nation, and the protagonist raping a young teenage girl.Avoid this book. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have GOT to be kidding me.","review":"Wow.You have GOT to be kidding me, right?I was sorely disappointed with this very misleading book. The book started out GREAT, but suddenly the entire story ends before I even reach the middle of the book! Next thing I know the next eleven chapters read like THIRD-RATE EROTICA with THE WORST DIALOG imaginable, care of two stupid bimbo co-eds from Planet Valley Girl.If I wanted poorly written erotica, I would have perused the EROTICA section, not Military Thrillers. The four other unread books by John Ringo I just purchased last week go BACK to the bookstore. I am getting a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying.","review":"I usually enjoy John Ringo's books, so when I saw this I bought it. Big mistake. If you feel you have to read this, borrow it. Chances are you'll enjoy the first 50 pages or so, which are pretty well written. From there on, the rest of the first story is laughable but marginally okay. The second is a complete waste. And by the time I got well into the third I gave up the Ghost. Assuming there is a second book in this new series, I won't be reading it. The sex in this is over the top weird and if you like that, great. I didn't. But I bought this as a good action novel, and it wasn't. The other reviews have pointed out the problems, and I won't repeat them; they're too numerous and I don't want to give this novel more of my time. End of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"inconceivable","review":"This book does have some fun action. However, the attemptto combine S&M; with 18 year olds girls and doom-type head shots, and completely unlikely events- i.e. randomly running into 2 nukes, and a plethera of terrorists within 2 year period, JUST doesnt work.The book is an interesting attempt at porn-terrorist-slaughter,but its not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sex.","review":"Have read all the books published to date. Loved the plots and story lines. Finally through them all out (Yep, tossed one paperback and two hardcopy) as I realized as I was re-reading them, that the somewhat graphic sex (Dominance and Submission, and Harem Girls, etc) didn't really add to the story but sure promoted things I just don't like. The March Upcountry series with David Weber had boys and girls, and talked about sex, but was what I consider more normal for SciFi, and was not graphic, did not promote \\"alternative\\" sex. So while I enjoy the James Bond nature of the novels, I really can't recommend them to any of my friends, and wouldn't recommend them to anyone younger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn Alert!","review":"I feel betrayed by the author and publisher. I enjoy John Ringo. But there was no warning that this book was going to describe in great detail the hero practicing domination sex and rape AND the women liking it and thanking him for it. Anybody who says they enjoyed this book \\"for the articles\\" is vainly trying to look sophesticated. Its just male fantasy about doing anything to a woman's body without relationship or consequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good, the bad, and the disgusting?","review":"I generally am a fan of the Posleen Universe books, and I was blind-sided by this novel. It started out O.K., but after the initial novella, it degenerated into something other than an action thriller. I'm not decrying the entire book--just the wierd transition to a pretty graphic and brutal sadism/masochism/dominance/bondage trash novel in an unexpected turn. I like the posleen universe a lot more. A really sad 2 stars for this one, based on the opening third of the book, which redeemed it from a \\"no stars\\". I think I'll skip over any more \\"Ghost\\" sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's different and then there's are you kiddin?","review":"I read Ghost for the SpecOps plot and violence and enjoyed the first part of the book. I don't mind the right wing fantasy, I didn't even mind the explicit sex in book 2 but I seen it done much better in keeping with a storyline and much better dialogue. I guess I gave up when the hero of the book resorted to rape. I might have cared, not condoned, but cared about the darker antihero if there was some reason pertaining to the plot but there doesn't seem to be one.The book reads like a Mack Bolan story with some very explict S&M;/rape fantasy thrown in for no reason other than the author felt like it.Too bad KILDAR( book2 ) looked promising. I'll pass..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new favorite","review":"I'm one of those readers who don't mind sex in her fiction. That aside, Ghost is **such** an over-the-top, male adventure fantasy that I just plain enjoyed reading it. Sure, Mike is an anti-hero but he's honest about it and doesn't angst about how un-PC he is that he's a breath of fresh air.I've read John's other books and enjoyed those as well, but Ghost now ranks as my favorite of all his series (displacing the Prince Roger series he writes with David Weber) to date. More, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your usual Ringo","review":"I'm a big Ringo fan and love a good shoot'em up.But this was totally different from any prior novels. The first novellette had the usual great action sequences but I had trouble stomaching the detailed rape-torture-murder of the kidnapped coeds.The second novellette told me more than I wanted to know about bondage and domination with a nice little firefight tacked on the end.The third featured the graphic rape of a teenager ((multiple times, multiple orifaces with an unlubricated condom so it would hurt more-very charming)) by our \\"hero\\" who was taking out his frustrations.I waded though the whole mess due to the car wreak fasination of it all but this book is NOT going in my permanant collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sicko","review":"This right-winger's wet dream has the hero blasting liberals, slaying Arabs and playing sicko domination sex games with barely-of-age college coeds. He takes a break from that to rape a prostitute and put down the French. If this thing represents the author's personal fantasy world the man needs to get himself to the therapist right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost: Mission Debref","review":"I found this book highly entertaining and an enthralling read.

I've read Ringo's earlier books and enjoyed them. I bought this book expecting something similar. Boy, was I wrong. The character is weak, the stories (it would be a mistake to call them \\"plots\\")unbelievable, and two-thirds of the book is deviant sex. If you're into bondage, S&M, repeated rape, etc., go buy something at your local adult book store. They'd probably do a better job on the sex, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I'm usually a fan of John RIngo, so I bought this book without really checking out the plot line. Caveat emptor!This book is quite a depature from his usual style of none-to-little explicit sexual content. I could have lived with the dominant/submissive sex scenes, but the rape scene near the end of the book was way too much!! This book isn't about a hero or good old american boy -- it's about a rapist. I'm not sure that anyone could accurately describe this as a \\"fun read\\" or \\"manly adventure tale.\\"If you're an NRA-loving, politically-conservative misogynist this book might be for you.

I didn't at first, when all I had heard were the low points of spirit they're gone, but then I heard Sung Tongs and went nuts, it is a great album. Then I got Panda Bear's album and loved that and have since purchased almost ALL OF THEIR RECORDS and the ONLY ONE THAT DOESN\\"T STAND UP IS THIS ONE.

The videos are interesting, amusing, a good pace, fluent (with no english) which are all pluses. My kids, all of them, like the videos but cannot stand the music and the booklets are useless.

You can go to the gun show and get these 2 for $20. If u want a good knife spend your money on a Benchmade knife ! Trust me its worth it when its the last knife you ever will buy!

I finally decided enough was enough, so I paid a bit more to get these Gold Toe socks. They're worth the price -- very high quality and will last a long time. They also keep their shape and don't sag or stretch out after many uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gold Toe Socks","review":"Great socks! Never understood buying expensive socks until wearing my husband's gold toe socks. Had bought them for him since they have the bigger socks for a size 13. Used them for my boots & fell in love! Well worth the money! They don't cut into your legs & they don't squash your toes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just alright....watch the sizing!","review":"I am lukewarm on this book. I like the variation of yarns and patterns. However, some of these socks are very small for an adult foot. For the Whitby sock, she calls for 51 inches in a fingering weigh yarn. That's a mighty tight fit for even a slender to normal adult ankle and foot. I had to add ten stitches until the gusset and then decrease them. I've never had to do that before with a sock pattern in 20 years of sock knitting.Make sure you measure your foot/the intended recipient's foot before you knit a sock from this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"socks to pass down from generation to generation............","review":"Beautiful book full of socks from around the world. Different yarns-excellent directions. Great book to curl up with your yarn stash and start knitting. These projects will be passed down from generation to generation and everyone will marvel at them, truly a history lesson as well. Great book as all of hers are - thanks =:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for on the go knitters","review":"One of the reasons I knit socks is their portability. This book is easy to use on the go and sturdy enough to stand up to travel. I was particularly impressed with the chart of yarns in the front of the book. I started with the first pair and although I changed the color scheme, I have gotten many complements on the socks. The one drawback I found was that it seemed to assume a certain size sock and only after I realized that was I able to get the correct size. I see a long journey for this book as I travel this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful sock patterns.","review":"This is a good book with beautiful patterns for socks. The problem for me is that these patterns are too complicated for me at this time. I am a beginner/intermediate knitter and I am not ready for the stitches it requires to make these socks. I have made other socks but I don't feel that I am at the level it takes to tackle some of these projects. So for now the book will sit on my shelf until that day comes when I am ready."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very User Friendly","review":"I love this book! There's a pattern suitable for every taste! And I especially like the yarn chart in the front of the book; it makes it easy to subsitute yarn for any pattern so that I can use whatever I have in my stash instead of having to purchase something specific for the pattern."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit tough\`","review":"I was hoping this book was more \\"portable\\" (aka traveling) but in fact it's about socks named for travels. Nice format with the spiral binding but the patterns use charts and find charts harder to use. They are also not the simplest of patterns. I guess some people want the challenge but I was expecting a book of patterns to use WHEN traveling, not ABOUT traveling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The title should read *for the Expert traveling knitter*. The socks are very complex. There are no patterns using circular needles, which, if you are knitting on the road, are much less bulky and awkward. Also, the book itself is very thin but quite *tall* - not easy to fit into a traveling bag, although maybe they were thinking it would be going into a suitcase where thickness would be the issue. I was disappointed because there were no projects i could do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"New to knitting, I am rather reluctant to venture into new patterns. However, this book is well written and gives easy and clear instructions. Lots of information that helps untangle that skein of instructions that can often be so cryptic."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Sock Book","review":"I have been addicted to knitting for about 6 years now, and have picked up most everything from books. This was the first sock knitting book I tried out. I had no problem knitting my first sock with the instructions from this book -- it was a little scary reading the instructions, as I couldn't visualize how the instructions could work. But I followed them anyway, and lo and behold it worked! I'll probably get her vintage sock book, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely patterns, but too many mistakes","review":"I like the patterns and the spiral bound format, but the book contains way too many errors, and either you scribble on your copy to correct them or you'll have to print the corrected pages from the Interweave website and attach them to the book. Interweave really need to sort out the quality of their books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for sock knitters","review":"This was the first book I bought while learning to knit socks.

This is a \\"printer\\" in name only. It takes at leat 6 tries to print a simple document because it jams EVERY time. Clear the jam, and you have to start the print job all over. Need an important document for work or school? You better start attemptimg to print at least a week before you need it. Oh, and you should only attempt a print job in day-light hours because this thing is loud enough to wake the dead. It goes through ink quite rapidly. Interesting, considering how seldom it actually prints anything.And scanning? Forget it! I've had this thing for 6 months and it still won't scan. The photo quality is awful-I get better pictures from an old Xerox copier.I gave this one star only because that's the lowest rating Amazon has."},{"rating":"1","title":"This model is no good.","review":"I own a Lexmark X5270 and love it. Unfortunately, it does not have a stand-a-lone fax capability, so I eagerly looked forward to getting the X7170. It prints a lot faster than the earlier model and has a document feeder, but it refuses to scan and comes with defective software (graphics programs couldn't acquire an image). After 4 hrs., tech support was no help. The buttons on the machine didn't work properly and even using the software on the computer was a hit or miss proposition. Do yourself a favor and look at another brand until Lexmark can get its act together."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"This printer is a waste! It looks good but the quality is horrible. It's loud and slow, especially the fax. Lexmark printers are poorly manufactured. After trying to get my last one repaired I found out from a Lexmark customer service rep that most printers don't last much more than 12 months. And instead of repairing them they just replace the printer. That should give you an idea of the quality. If you buy this make sure you get the 3 year warranty because you'll need it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for this price range!","review":"For the price, this machine is excellent. I bought it primarily for the fax machine, and having a color printer, copier and scanner is a bonus. Everyone wanted me to get a laser, but I have a laser printer, and all I really needed to do was send a few faxes and just didn't want to spend $400 for that. I haven't had any trouble with this machine. I was surprised the color copies look so great and it has come in very handy. Ditto for scanning.If you have huge demand for color or printing, you probably need a bigger machine. For a small home office or for personal use, this is a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"pushy to make you buy ink","review":"A warning comes up when the ink cartridge is low telling you to buy a new ink cartridge and delaying printing for 15 seconds. Even if you are making a print using only black ink and the color cartridge is \\"low\\" it will delay printing. The thing is, there are at least 50 copies left when it calls the cartridge low on ink, so you spend most of the life of each cartridge having to suffer long delays in printing. The support staff is in India and is no help at all. They tell you to buy bigger cartridges or clean the contacts, or other silly things, but are no help in advice for turning off the stupid warning. Don't buy it, they are greedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"X7170 Piece of Junk","review":"this printer runs great till you have to replace a cartridgeyou will then receive an error message which is IMPOSSIBLE to fixthe Lexmark website is of no helpapparently this is a chronic defect of this modelNO MORE LEXMARK printers for me,this one is going in the trash"},{"rating":"2","title":"well im hooked...","review":"got my set and loved it.i cant wait till the next box set.if your into Romance and Comedy check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writer","review":"James Clemens is a wonderful author.

He also writes as James Rollins writing books with a more sci-fi feel, but just as great to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT series","review":"I LOVE this series because it has all the right steps that make a great series.

It starts off with practice test(s) to identify what areas you are strong and/or weak in. From there you then study the material needed to actually pass the GED. It cuts out all the hassle,(what the competitor books suggest when having guidelines to study all subjects.)The material is easy to read and makes knowledgeable sense to the everyday person. Not only is the material in the book itself great but the price is also!

I bought it in preparation and for inspiration on the walk I plan on taking next year.Simon and Mick, by my estimation, didn't backpack even 1/3 of the Pyrenees... they taxied it, bus rode it, hitchhiked it, but surely didn't do much walking in it. Simon even admits this towards the end of the book.Humorous at points, but a disappointment for the most part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Bright & Versatile","review":"This is a light which makes use of the latest lighting technology: a single, high-power Luxeon-style LED. This is what $100 tactical police flashlights use. It's energy efficient and never burns out. The mounting system is great, quick release works well. Also works well as a regular flashlight. This is bright enough for urban riding, it illuminates the potholes 50 feet away on a street with no lights.Cons: Uses one CR123A battery, which is only reasonably priced when you buy in packs of 12. Not as bright as the halogen lights with external battery packs. Plug for external battery pack seems silly.Overall, a great light for urban visibility and reasonable illumination."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE battery life","review":"I love the look and brightness of this light but you may get 2 dozen uses if you're lucky on each $8 battery.

The stand is designed well for cord management. It's also very solid and the adjustable hight is great too. It also has an indented space for paper clips and pens and junk.Now the down side, the built in speakers suck horribly. They must be really tiny because they sound all super tinny.

The clarity is awesome, pictures and videos are displayed in vivid detail and color spectrum is just awe inspiring. There are multiple settings but I have never touched them, right out of the box this monitor set its self up, just turn it on and go! The added bonus of a two socket USB hub on the side of the monitor just adds to its great functionality and style. Just plug it in to your computer and now your ready to plug in any USB device on your desk without the wires running everywhere. Plus it has built in speakers but I like my volume turned way up some times and my desktop speakers and sub-woofer complete my system where in my opinion monitor speakers never really quite cut the mustard. This is really a great monitor and one of the best for this kind of money. If you are thinking or double thinking this monitor, just buy it and try it, you'll love it guaranteed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - Great Price - In Great Condition","review":"I am so happy with my decision to purchase this monitor using amazon.com.

My GOD it is truely a thing of beauty. I have it in portrait mode beside my laptop and have the desktop extended across both screens. The ability to have a *.pdf open in the portrait mode means you can see about 1 and a half pages at an easily readable resolution. And with word open in my laptop screen its easy to make notes on the *.pdf in MS Word. Its also great for having two applications open at the same time each taking up half the screen, with a third application open full screen on the laptop. A real productivity booster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding monitor; just get the right drivers...","review":"This monitor is outstanding. The flexibility from the base is valuable and the ability to tuck the keyboard under the monitor is nice.The picture is outstanding with no significant ghosting that I can see on my games and clear/sharp text.I did initially have to download the drivers only from the web and installthem twice before the sharpness was at an acceptable level, andI followed the advice of others by not using the installation cdand downloading the HP software for the monitor, which has some bugs.Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase and amazon was thecheapest place I found on the internet..And, as with all hp piano black finishes, the sides of the monitor havea propensity to pick up noticeable fingerprints, so I keep a thumbsizelcd cleaner on my desk and use it every once in a while..Other than that, I cant imaging getting a better 22 inch monitor..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flat Screen!","review":"This is one amazing flat screen. I added it to my cpu in a dual monitor setup. I had previously bought a View-sonic 22\\" screen. The 2 just do not compare. The HP totally blows the View-sonic away. In detail, brightness, contrast, flexibility, and price. It looks great, the screen is easy to set up, the buttons are easily accessible. It comes with software to tilt and rotate the screen. I don't usually like HP products, (hate all the \\"Bloat-ware\\" they load with their software) but this Screen should not be passed up. The Price cannot be beat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value 20\\" monitor","review":"Bought this based on other favorable reviews I am very pleased so far.

Everything is absolutely crisp and crystal clear. Colors feel extremely vibrant. There are two things, though, that make this monitor a cut above the grade for me: 1.) HP did an outsanding job packing and shipping my monitor. I've had many monitors that are supposedly great monitors get to my house and not work due to being damnaged during shipment. The HP w2207 did not have this problem. 2.) I really like HP's stand for this monitor. You'll find many other monitors that have the same great image quality as the HP w2207 but might not have the same quality of monitor stand. Great monitor. Would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP W2207 22inch Widescreen","review":"Generally an OK monitor. However for Photoshop the images are far too bright and are not representitive of the print. I've tried to adjust the settings but have had no luck. Possibly an LCD monitor calibrator would help. It has a lot of light bleed around the edges with a dark screen, but doesn't bother the image as far as I can tell. This monitor is connected as dual monitors with my Dell 19 inch which is much more accurate and compares well with the print. Actually in my case a monitor with 1000:1 contrast ratio is counter productive while a print is generaly 100:1 on photo paper.The high gloss screen is not a problem with my room lighting.Currently I use both the DVI and Analog inputs on two computers. Just a bump (twice} on the menu button switches the input.Edit: November 2012. Still going strong. My Dell 19 has died and replaced it with another HP a 24 inch."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP w2207 LCD monitor","review":"Exceptional Screen, good response time, Great color, and very ture clors if you are into photo editing. DVD's also look great.It not only has excellent adjustments for height, tilt but the screen can be rotated 90 degrees as well. This is a big plus that you will not find in monitors of this price.Just watch the back lighting and this monitor is almost the best on the market.The HP w2207 LCD Monitor would be perfect, if it had a better refresh rate, even if it was 70hz.Overall I believe his monitor is one of the best I seen and a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy monitor.
