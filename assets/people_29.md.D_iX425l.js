Loosely based on the life of Mas Oyama (Sosai), founder of Kyokushin Karate, it is an enjoyable watch, especially for those who practice Kyokushin. It is not, however, all fighting and training. A fair amount of the film focuses on Baedal's life before training in the mountains, including a love interest.The movie is in both Korean and Japanese. English subtitles are available. The only downside is that in the options submenu, the languages are not labeled in in English, so I have to fish around to see which of the five subtitled languages is English (I think it's the third).On the whole a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME.","review":"THE ACTING IS POOR. THE PLOT IS SILLY AND RIDICULOUS. It is stated in the movie that the American soldiers that liberated southeast asia from Japanese tyranny in world war two were more evil than the Japanese army that conquered and subdued south east asia in world war two.

I agree with a lot of other reviewers and think that Bond of Hatred is the best of them, but there are a few others like Damiano's return, Jess's Promise, The Reluctant Husband and the Contaxis Baby that are also great. Because there are so few left for me to read, I decided to start reading some of the ones I wasn't sure about and this is one of them. For more than 90% and I think it was actually 95% of the book, the H and h absolutely hated and hurt each other deliberately. I was skimming a lot because I couldn't bear it anymore. In a romance, you do want to feel that there is actually a bit of love.

Bad acting all around really hurt this movie.. hell, even back then I knew it was bad acting. I just sat around making jokes about this movie with my friends, which is about the only thing you can do with this movie, unless you want the tradition to continue and make your kids watch it so they can grow up and wonder how they ever sat through this movie and not laugh themselves stupid.

Its not Casablanca or Citizen Cane, it's Howard the Duck! Of course it's not going to have an ingenious plot. It's supposed to be campy and unbelievable! The same people who critizise Howard love Star Wars Episode 1 which was a far inferior film despite its big budget special effects! The bottom line is that the Dark Overlords scare sheepish Hollywood moviegoers and so they put on Spider-Man because the Green Goblin is less intimidating and the special effects are much more up to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"is there nothing sacred?","review":"well...i remember seeing this a gd while back....and i remembered it was pretty funny at times....not a laugh a minute....but a gd flik. well it was nice seeing this again. howard shares the same kinda dry wit that hawk eye from mash has. im discounting 1 star because they edited out howards condom scene....kinda takes away the mysterious nature of the romance between the girl and him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic 80's movie","review":"I have to give this movie & this DVD 5 stars because I'm so excited that it finally got released on DVD.

Basically, what I think happened was this; someone dared George Lucas to make the most ridiculous movie ever made, and Georgey was probably drunk, so he did it. This movie is wild!! Howard has so many hysterical one-liner puns about being a duck. The scene at the end with the dark overlords of the universe is possibly the funniest thing I have ever seen.

It's a great example of the problems that arise when you try to translate one medium into another. Still, it has its charms, and it means well. I gave it two stars, because the film is a fun way to kill ninety minutes, especially if you have some friends over and give it the Mystery Science Theater treatment.

Take it from this \\"hairless ape\\", you could do a lot worse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Lucas' worst...","review":"Pretty bad,even considering the satirical comic book is essentially unfilmable. The idea of Howard in the completely phony looking duck suit was,to say the least,a bad idea. Something animated,along the lines of Roger Rabbit,or Mr. Limpit,would have worked better,but the script is horrendous in any case.I only give this 2 stars since Lucas has done numerous movies which are even WORSE,for example,the last couple of Star Wars movies.Howard the Duck was a pretty strong signal that Lucas was just a hack."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME DUCK","review":"While the movie is entertaining in that 80's kitschy kind of way, judging it on its own merits....it's hard to find any. The styles, the synth-pop, Leah Thompson in panties--these plusses don't outweigh the minuses. What makes the DVD worth it is the featurette, where we find that there were technical challenges to get Howard to look like....a dwarf in a duck suit. At one point, Gloria Katz, the co-writer, says the film is just a silly movie about a duck, not an exercise in existentialism. There's the very reason the film failed--the comic book was EXACTLY an exercise in existentialism! The comic was all about Howard's alienation in a world he never made! Sorry, Gloria--you GOT IT WRONG!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies","review":"I have owned a vhs copy of Howard the Duck for years.

But I liked the movie, I sat there with my mouth opened just laughing through this hillarious movie.Sometimes you just want to see a movie that has no \\"practical\\" meaning, other than just to get a laugh, to see what people are thinkging when they write a script. To me this was just a fun mindless movie.The performance by Jeffery Jones as the guy taken over by the evil overlord just cracks me up. He is funny, he pulls this off brilliantly.Look, if you want to just have fun watch the movie. To many reviewrs look for \\"substance\\" in a movie and if they cannot derive any \\"substance\\" from the movie they don't like it.

I would suggest you play this in either a DVD player that can upconvert to 1080P or a PS3 where the picture and sound quality is so much better because of the use of HDMI.This movie is surely an 80's classic cult film that I know I watched when I was still about 9 or 10 years old when I had my parents rent it on VHS.

This is by far the worst movie ever written. Worst plot in Hollywood history"},{"rating":"1","title":"fluck the duck","review":"this movie is too dark,too violent and too dirty for a PG/kid's movie.The human actors mainly Beverly & Phil are morons at best.The special effects are just as bad as the effects from The Angry Video Game Nerd.The appearance of the Howard The Duck is so unconvincing I can't stand to look at it.The chase scenes are super boring.It's just as bad as Under The Cherry Moon. I give this film a -0 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh the biggest flop that destroyed careers","review":"I remember watching this movie when I was a kid. As a kid I didnt really know what to think of it, other than it was weird. As an adult I look back on this movie and...LAUGH! It is right up there with all the other ridiculous 80s movies like the Friday 13th series.This movie is at or near the top of the worst movies of all time lists on several sites Ive been to, including MSN.Heres the story: Howard the duck who lives on a faraway planet gets to earth by way of a dimensoinal gate created by a new scientific experiment gone awry and he must find a way to get back to earth before evil cosmic emperors use the same gate to get into earth. Its not possible to come up with a plot any worse than that. And I can't believe they are actually releasing this movie on DVD. As if having to wallow thru another 80s slasher flick nowadays (Freddy VS Jason) wasnt enough.This movie destroyed careers and is symbolic of many rididcoulus 80s films. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are people smoking?","review":"Most likely one of the worst films of all time, and it even beats Battlefield Earth for stupidity. Lucas (who always talks about how he's got big ideas outside of Star Wars) seems to flop on his face on everything he does that is not star wars.This is not a film I love to hate, or is so stupid it's funny. It's just stupid. The only merit this film has is the end sequence with the stop motion animation.I can not believe the crack addicts who are giving this Garbage 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Howard The Schmuck!","review":"I watchted the movie Howard The Duck on cable and even though I have liked my share of silly, campy movies I really didn't like this movie and thought it was horrible.

I like Lea Thompson though and I'm glad she was still able to continue her acting career after this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money! This one's BAD news!","review":"Worst movie of 1986, worst movie from George Lucas, worst movie I've ever seen, and worst movie in motion picture history. Save your money! Adding this one to the library could lead to spontaneous bouts of bad fortune (divorce, bankruptcy, employment termination). Howard the Duck should be renamed to Howard the Yuck. Do yourself and your loved ones a favor and stay away from this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE DUCK IS A DOG","review":"Look. Howard is not funny. He is not entertaining. The one liners are for insomniacs. The only things this picture has going for it are the music score (the background music, not the rock band) and the animation at the end. The rest is a buttock burner. Stay away from this one and add two hours to your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Happy","review":"I still haven't received my movie and I tried to contact someone through email and I can never get a response.

Another bad Marvel adaption with not much going for it. Sure it has Lea Thompson but the film sans rhyme and reason which is what lead to negative reviews. I must admit there is some unintentional humor but not enough. Although this flick isn't the worst Comicbook adaption. (Captain America is far worst) This flick is still lacking. Good special FX,a few mildly diverting moments and unintentional amusement raise the entertainment level a notch. For those looking for a good movie are well asvised to give this one a pass,Those looking for cheesy moments and those who love to mock the 80's are advised to check out the flick. But only to mock it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downright horrible","review":"Just simply one of the worst movies to ever exist! Bad acting, bad costumes, bad dialogue. I am surprised to know that Lea Thompson, who played Lorraine McFly on Back To the Future was on this piece of garbage. This movie has really tarnished the good name of George Lucas. Stay away, and if you must watch it, see if TNT or TBS might show it."},{"rating":"1","title":"nasty","review":"this movie is nasty the whole way through the movie this duck and this human woman fall in love with each other. at some scenes the two sleep together i believe. that love is the whole way through the movie. plus Howard gets his chance to go back to his planet.

I can't begin to describe how awful it is, how excruciating it was to watch the film. Even my seven-year old son seemed a little bored by it.Truly, truly, awful film. There are so many better films for kids, for example, E.T."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, unfunny jokes","review":"This movie is supposed to be a comedy, but I don't think it is funny at all! The jokes are repetitive and annoying. How many times can you make a pun with the word \\"duck\\" in it and still expect everybody to laugh? Every other line in this movie is a duck joke. If you see this movie for rent at your local video store, do yourself a favour----duck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I saw this movie a long time ago on tv. And was hooked. I thought I must have this movie. The next time I found out that it was going to be on tv, I recorded it. Then sometime later, the tape got wrecked and it was un-watchable. For awhile I looked and looked for this movie and could not find it. Then looking at a music store one day, I happened to find it. Even thought it had been quit a while since the last time I had seen the movie. When I watched it, it was like I just saw it yesterday. It made an impression on me from my childhood. I never watched the movie for good acting, special effects or anything like that. I watched it just for the sake of watching it and enjoying it. In my opinion, I think if you go about analyzing movies all the time. You are going to miss out on some great movies. Because their will be somthing about the movies that you won't like. And you won't give them a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"Yes finally in the process of turning a VHS collection into a DVD collection I ran into a roadblock...No Howard the Duck!!

You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time!","review":"I have waited 23 years for this - I actually have it on Laserdisc.For those who slam HTD I say Try Watching It.This is a very funny movie with pretty girls, silly animatronic ducks and some pretty decent Rock Music by Thomas Dolby.The extra features are very good, from the Interviews with the cast and crew, to the compliation of trailers and 'making of' featurettes.The only thing missing is the MTV music video, which debuted on Halloween 1986, with Elvira Mistress of the Dark as guest VJ.Some of the jokes are quite subtle - which is why you have to watch it OVER AND OVER AND OVER.Please enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now people we need to get over it.","review":"If nothing else this should be released on DVD as a \\"B-Movie cult classic\\" Now I'm not going to say it should have won an Oscar but for goodness sake this movie is fun if nothing else...come on it had a naked duck with nipples. That's pretty cool...You know Lucas is just making us sweat and will bust out a CG Howard before you know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howard the Duck","review":"I guess there is nothing more to say about this movie.

Of course, it is not the only one movie DVD from 80' with region lock. Why are the people in entertainment industry so stupid..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Know Quack-Fu!","review":"At first recommended by a friend as one of the funniest movies he had ever seen, I went out on the hunt for a copy of the now-deleted 'Howard' and was lucky enough to finally purchase a copy last week. Why was I recommended this? How is it funny? Set back in the 80's, this dated tale of a cigar smoking, Booze ridden duck who is pulled out of his world (which publishes a magazine called 'Playduck') straight into the bed of Lea Thompson and has the cheek to be too embarrassed. Landing in Cleveland, Howard teams up with Thompson's Rock chick and crew and sets out to fight the evil Dark Overlord. To list this movies good points would be a task in itself, as its inept script, don't care attitude acting and cliché plot, it was no surprise that this little light was quickly blown out. A poor excuse at film-making in every angle, but the only problem is that its stupidly addictive to the end. Hence two stars instead of the dreaded one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Howard is so awful it's embarassing!","review":"I've read reviews calling this movie a \\"cute little story\\" and \\"good if you like B movies...\\" etc. The thing is, this was the most expensive movie made in 1986! George Lucas spent a fortune making it and another fortune in marketing and advertising. This movie was a DOG!It was poorly written and poorly acted. The film was just a sorry attempt by Lucas to scoop up some more box office cash. Couple that with the fact that it was the most expensive movie of the year and all you're left with is a pile of trash.If you want to see a \\"cute\\" movie, see something by Disney. If you like \\"B movies,\\" go check out Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. But whatever you do, do not spend a penny on this lousy movie. It's truly a waste of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much","review":"For a VHS copy of this movie, you cant actually charge $20 when its not worth more than $5. I also liked the movie, but never read the comic, Ive found this movie for .10 CENTS on ebay, and you have the audacity to sell it that high and rip people off. You can also get it from Hollywood video for $2.99. People that waste that much money are really dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"not, it's not misunderstood","review":"Sadly, NOT a cult favorite or a reviled film that deserves a new look.

There are depictions of duck breasts (like human breasts with feathers), alcoholism, near constant violence, implied bestiality (between the duck alien and a human girl), etc. The film takes all these elements too seriously for you to write it off as knowingly stupid.. making it just.. stupid.The special effects were mildly impressive, but given how George Lucas helped out in the making of the film, could you have expected anything less? Perhaps this film was the first mainstream warning that Lucas wasn't good for anything else besides THX and Industrial Light and Magic anymore. Next to the Star Wars Christmas Special of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was alright....","review":"To be honest the film had pro's and con's but I gave it 5 stars for Lea Thompson, considering she as a hottie in this film, and I liked her anyway when I was a pre-schooler (like, when this film was released) but watching it now is totally different being an adult I am now, in other words this movie is a dud, it's not as entertaining as it was when I was a child, I gotta say this though, is this where Tim Robbins started his acting career?

Ronda Rich writes in a voice that puts you right there in the garage with her. You laugh with her, cry with her, and learn life lessons with her. You learn intimate details about the heroes of NASCAR and you gain new outlooks on life through their humor, courage, loyalty, and friendship. This is a compelling book from start to finish and one that you will finish more than one time. It is a cookbook of salty, sweet, and bitter recipes of life. As such, it is a book that you will keep forever so that you can refer to it again and again. It is a rara avis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Job","review":"At the end of the book, Ms. Rich thanks us for giving her our time to read the book. If I were sitting in front of her right now, my response would be \\"How could I NOT?!\\" I've just finished the last pages and plan on starting it all over again tonight.When I got the book, I expected an inside view of the sport that I'm passionate about. I got it. But I also got more. Yes, Ms. Rich writes about the history of NASCAR and the history of specific drivers but that's not all she writes about. My Life In The Pits isn't just about NASCAR as a sport. It's about real life; about life's lessons and what you do with them. It's a challenge to rise up and be all that you can with what you have. Ms. Rich delves deep into her inner self and candidly shares that part of her with all of us. My copy is filled with little sticky notes of sections that touched me in one way or another, parts that I've already started sharing with other friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"What a Great Book! I am a diehard NASCAR fan and I thought My Life in the Pits would just be about racing, but it is much more than racing. It is about having the courage to follow your dreams. Ronda tells about the side of the drivers most of us never see. About how big their hearts are and how much they do to help people down on their luck. She is a great storyteller and some of the hilarious stories had me rolling in laughter. Ronda's stories about the racing wives and the agony and heartaches they endure brought a tear to my eye and a new level of respect for them. Even if you are not a fan of NASCAR this is a must read book. I highly recommend it to both men and women of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bargrooves Back on the right track.","review":"As the colors series of Bargrooves albums comes to a close with Azure, it appears the Bargrooves series has at last found its groove again.There are so many of these collections now that I was beginning to think the Bargrooves theme was becomming tired with several of the more recent albums lacking in the smooth, seamless funky mixing of tracks that was more apparent on earlier albums such as the exceptional Metropolitan album.There is a strong theme running through both CD's although CD2 appears to be the better mix and turns out to be a pleasant surprise after a slow start.Lets hope the new 2007 releases in this series keep up the good mixing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo, Ms. Spangler","review":"Catherine Spangler does it again! Reading Shadow Crossing is a wonderfully exciting adventure. The characters are rich and vivid. The unfolding relationship between Celie and Rurick is done masterfully. I couldn't wait to read a page so I could turn to the next. Ms. Spangler seems to effortlessly take you in one direction and then, once you think you know where you are going, take you in a completely different one. If you enjoy futuristic romance this is a must read. Shadow Crossing is well worth the read. Bravo, Ms. Spangler!!

I have an extra large (think nearly commercial) kitchen sink, and it takes only a tablespoon to produce enough cleaning power to make it through a family meal....dishes, cups, glasses, silverware, utensils, and pots and pans. I rarely have to add more of the current Super Degreaser formula.The only thing I can really say against it is the fact that it also degreases the hands after washing dishes.

Quite the contrary- it is horribly laid-out/edited and looks like someone never proof-read it for layout/format. It is even difficult to discern where each chapter (section) ends and the next begins (yes, it really is that bad). I haven't noticed any additional or different content in this book (despite what the title and description of the book elude to), when compared with the regular version.Einstein's original [translated] content in the book is in fact all there, and intact, and naturally quite good, but this edition of the book is just a poor quality reprint. If you are interested at all in this title/topic, simply buy the regular version, \\"Relativity: The Special and the General Theory\\". It is a proper version of Einstein's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Science?","review":"I am more interested in biology-related science, but someone recommended this book. I enjoy reading these 'popular' works by great scientists and this one did not disappoint. While you need an understanding of physics to read this book, the information within explains the concepts very well. The math does get more complex towards the end and was confusing to me.I have not read the regular edition vs. this one, so I can not comment on the differences. While some concepts were difficult to understand initially, I recommend this book for people interested in science (whether this edition or another edition)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who typset the math in this thing?","review":"I realize that this is a layman's version of the theory, but couldn't someone at the publisher really take the time to typeset the equations correctly? They don't make any sense and they aren't set up right.Also, although this is translated from Einstein's German version, there are books that better explain his theory of Relativity. He wasn't all that good at it. However, it is an inexpensive alternative for my research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly edited","review":"So poorly edited (I is intended generally to be 1 in many equations) that the reader is distracted by typos.

We can believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad to see this movie!","review":"I don't like this movie because the format of this pcture is not full screen and I have a 50'Plasma TV and it is horrible to see a movie like this...I would try to return you this movie because it's not fit for a HD TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrival - 3 stars...Arrival II - junk! NOT PG13~~ RATED R!","review":"...these two movies are distinctly different, and only Arrival I is PG13. Arrival II, however, is rated R and contains an unecessary and EXPLICIT SEX scene with full frontal nudity during and after. This had nothing to do with the movie plot and since it was already an enormous flop from the first one, only tended to degrade it worse. If these were separate movies, I'd keep one and trash the other. As it is, I'm stuck for having bought them as a dual dvd. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sound for Arrival","review":"I was dissapointed at being unable to hear the movie. There was no audio to the movie, hence, I was unable to view it.

The acting was horid, and the plot was, hmmm, what was the plot? The ditsy blonde co-star just grinned or giggled the whole time their lives and the world was in jeopardy. Unbelievable. Muldoon simply cannot act, as you could gather right from the beginning of the movie where it was obvious he was forcing himself not to look at the camera. On the other hand, if you like really Bad movies and enjoy picking up on the screw-ups, this one's for you (although not up to the caliber of Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOUBLE YOUR FUN, DOUBLE THE BADNESS","review":"Well, what can you say about the Arrival. The original is a mindless and unintentionally laughable alien flick with enough bad acting (probably giving too much credit) to scar its viewers for weeks. You've got to admire those effects too, credited to the prodigy level minds at Live Entertainment, so what if their isn't an ounce of original thinking, that obviously didn't stop anyone. The Arrival II, the shear evil waiting to deprive you of a relaxing evening. I'm sorry, but if you walk into a video store and see the Arrival II, there should be a little common sense that this movie is a completely bogus. Would you rent a film called \\"The Revenge of the Ninja Cyborg Mnutant Warriors From Beyond the Solar System part X?\\" As they say, the reason why the Arrival II is #1 on the direct to video charts, you can never underestimate the stupidity of the American public."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad, it's good","review":"I saw this movie the week it opened in the movie theater. It was so laughably bad, I went back again to view it with several of my friends. Since then, this has become my favorite bad movie of all time.The Arrival is the kind of film that makes perfect fodder for bad movie nights with friends, or were it made in the early 60s, an incredible episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Truly horrendous acting, a weak script, lack of directorial anything, cheesy special effects combine to create a truly awful B-Movie much in the same vein as \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" or the original \\"The Posideon Adventure.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker","review":"I saw this by accident on FiOS. What a stinker. Plot is awful. Characters thin. Effects cheesy. \\"Sets\\" phony. The very idea of buying this on Blu-ray is laughable. Sheen is a joke. He should stick to what he knows: one-line sex jokes, hookers and beating up his wives.This is a third world-produced \\"film\\" that should have gone straight to video that I'd perhaps buy used for $1 at a garage sale, and then throw away to save space. This makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look plausible.Man am I glad I saw it on a backwater channel and didn't put any money out on this turkey, even as a rental. There is no doubt why it failed at the box office. It would have failed at 2:00 AM on Syfy channel.If this is what passes for good sci-fi, y'all have a pretty low threshold for quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest waste of 2 hrs in my life!!!!","review":"The only reason I watched this movie was because it averaged 4 star rating. What a joke. Horrible acting, horrible plot, horrible characters.

The box states on the back a widescreen and standard (full screen) format for The Arrival but I can't find a standard format anywhere on this disc!2. Also and more important is that you don't want to pay the extra for The Arrival 2 because they have boxed it together with the first one because it would not sell on it's own!

Charlie Sheen was just over-the-top, I expected more from him. If you want a good alien invasion movie, \\"Independence Day\\" is MUCH better than this. If you want a good \\"contact from outer space\\" movie, \\"Contact\\" blows this one out of the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Sheen's best","review":"I really liked this movie, Sheen stepped out of his usual roles and played an intelligent man in search of the truth. Great little twists and turns throughout the film. Two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best alien movies out there","review":"I've been reading a bunch of lists of the best 10 sci-fi movies of all time and not one poll mentioned this movie. This is a shame because this movie is a believable look at one man's \\"conspiracy theory\\" of aliens taking over, and creating havoc to the GreenHouse effect. I think that just goes to show how little exposure this movie got both at the movie theatre and in rentals. (This came out at about the same time as that joke Independence Day). This is by far Charlie Sheen's best acting performance, as he plays a semi-paranoid satellite watcher who believes that we aren't alone. This movie has enough realism to give it integrity and enough mystery to make it a fun science fiction. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing a believable alien invasion movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Sci Fi Flick","review":"This movie came out about the same time as Independence Day - and it is MUCH better. Fantastic plot, fantastic acting, fantastic conspiracy flick ... and pretty good special effects! You will LOVE this is you are an X-files fan, Star Trek fan, War of the Worlds fan, or if you're into really go sci fi movies. It got 2 thumbs up when it came out, but didn't have the advertising budget so it didn't get a lot of attention. But what a fantastic price!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Those who gave it 4-5 stars must have been playing a practical joke?","review":"As there were lots of 4-5 star reviews, I thought this might be worth a try.All I can figure is that after wasting 2 hours on this movie, those who rated it high did so in the spirit of \\"misery loves company\\".This was just a HORRIBLE movie. Grade school acting, amateurish special effects, ridiculous plot, and a script that was disjointed.OK, so spoiler alert: Why did the aliens, who had this amazing terra-forming technology have to use scorpions to kill their enemies???Charlie Sheen is PATHETIC in the film - unless it was supposed to be a comedy, in which case he was BRILLIANT.It's two hours you'll want back. It's too late for me - but save yourselves before it is too late - not from the Aliens, but from the god-awful excuse for a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a mediocre sci-fi time killer","review":"I, as a Vangelis fan, bought it simply due to some name confusion (The Arrival + Vangelis = completely not relevant CD) and MAINLY the 4 star review at amazon. After watching it I realized this is really just a TV-scale sci-fi movie. Low cost production with one-actor show. The story was barely interesting but the acting, special effect, and script were just mediocre, not really to the standard of big screen.Some claims this is a movie that should receive better review than Independence Day. Not so at all in my opinion. Not even compare with the special effect, just by the \\"effort\\" put in the movie and the acting alone, ID was way better than this movie. I found Sheen's acting was exaggerating and less convincing.Since I was lured to buy it due to the review, I would just like to provide another data point to help people make better decision than I did. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Cogitor","review":"So the aliens have videotapes in their outdoor security cameras, instead of inside a building.So the aliens have such poor security that anybody can stroll into and out of their \\"secret\\" facilities.So the aliens disclose their plans in front of a camera.So aliens freeze solid when sprayed with a little liquid nitrogen.So Sheen took up about 90% of the screen time.So the special effects were dated even when the movie was released.So the aliens have knees the bend the other way.So what!I long for the verisimilitude of Buck Rogers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised !","review":"After reading the other reviews, I almost did not buy this DVD.But I am glad I did, in spite of all the criticism, I think ARRIVAL 2 is a GOOD picture, perhaps even better than Arrival 1.The high speed car chase, the scenes at the nuclear plant and the attempt to project the hologram in the theatre provide as much suspense as you could possibly want in any good movie.I recommend this DVD to all science fiction fans and I can't understand why it has attracted so many negative comments !I hope they do an ARRIVAL 3 !"},{"rating":"2","title":"$8.00 or $13.00","review":"Why would you pay $13.00 for arrival 1 when you could pay $8.00 for arrival 1 and the piece of junk arrival 2 ??????????So don't watch the piece of junk !!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sci Fi","review":"This is a Science Fiction lovers dream. It has action, suspense, aliens, giant bugs, a mad scientist/tough guy hero, and an extremely good story line.The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the slight dated feel.

It is true that it goes on smooth and easy. You apply it with the pen and then smear it over your lips with your finger tip. However, the color wipes off easily even after letting it dry for over 15 minutes. I kept doing tests to see how long you had to leave it on before it would not wipe off, but even my 30 minute test did not work. The color still wipes off. I'm disappointed because the colors are really pretty but the stuff just won't stay put. I have to keep reapplying it all day long.

They were men of stealth, sabotage, and concealment. All this bullshit about them being Killing machines get far to much attention from fools. I am american, But I am fascinated with the actual ninja. I am sick of this Bull shit where they put an english speaking person in a ninja scene. It is old, and should be dead.

Alot of the other bad reviews pretty much covers in detail as to why this movie sucks but man Isaac should've used Scott's talent in martial arts a WHOLE lot more than the POS fight scenes he was in.

I was trying not to laugh while watching this because it was really ridiculous. The ninja costumes were great and some of the fight scenes were cool but the story and acting were really bad. Plus at times felt like a live TV broadcast. I guess they didn't have time or budget to use better filters in post production. Overall, it was like watching a live action 80's cartoon with way over the top stories and villains. I loved those 80's cartoons and the ninja movies of that decade, and this film seemed help me live some of those memories. But overall it was really hurried and poorly done. I found it hard to make use of my \\"suspension of disbelief\\". I wouldn't buy it for $15 but it's good to rent for the giggles. Ninja Assassin was much better movie. Better story, acting, and action."},{"rating":"1","title":"COOL cover!, BAD Ninja film!","review":"I ONLY gave this movies 2 stars instead of 1 because of the cover!! OK, is not bad as Black Ninja but is certainly NOT good as Ninja Assassin.First of all, this is not exactly a ninja film, is more like a karate film. The good guy is always fighting the bad guys with his modern clothes until the ending when he decides to dress up as a ninja (the one in the cover) so he can fight the bad ninja. The only ninja that fights during the entire film is the bad armored ninja that kills a couple of good guys with his stealth sword and pistols.Of course, the fights were so-so, the acting was terrible, and the story was predictable.The only goodies of this movie are the blood and gore (which was kind of cool)and the fight at the end with the two ninjas fighting other bad guys and themselfs. Note: The final fight scene wasn't THAT long.P.S: In my opinion, this movie is very similar to the Transporter movies but without car chases, less budget, and with a ninja concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"First of all I want to say this movie was super awesome!I don't care about technical details, I watched the movie and loved everything about it.I definitely will watch it again sometime soon... 5 stars because I can't find anything I don't like in it ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing evil about this book is buying it!!","review":"I almost didn't review this book because I have difficulty giving it even a single star, or as Mr. Toland would say...one, single star alone by itself.

I am not saying it's bad, just it's not worth this price to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was OK, but have definitely tasted better...","review":"The delivery was quick, so that's a plus, but I was dissapointed with the coffee itself. Like other reviewers here, I had my first cup of Blue Mountain coffee in Jamaica, and it was amazing, so I had pretty high expectations. This coffee was just too dry and bland for my taste. The coffee shop where I used to get my coffee in Chicago, My Soul Cafe, recently started selling their blue mountain coffee online, so I will never purchase Reggie's again. There is definitely better stuff out there, and probably at a better price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry as a Bone","review":"Drinking Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee in Jamaica is a treat - it's fantastic coffee.

The author, though he has decent ideas (albeit very outdated), takes so many tangents, his point is never clearly made. It's like listening to Grandpa rant on about everything and nothing. I consider myself a very logical \\"scientifically minded\\" person. Much of Fuller's ideas of history of humanity are logically thought out based on his understanding and experience although it is not all necessarily based on sufficient scientific/ archeological evidence. So it's difficult to differentiate between which is credible mainstream theory and personal philosophical thoughts. I think the book has some wonderful ideas that apply especially to today's society. It's just a shame that the book was written so poorly and the train of thought was poorly organized. By the way, the Dymaxiom house is a horrible, unsustainable invention. That's why only a couple were built."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best History Lesson Ever!","review":"This guy has an unusual writing style that takes some time to get used to, so not an easy read. I thought it was one of the most concise history lessons you could ever receive, it covered most of the history of man and his theories are quite plausible and well reasoned. He doesn't get it all right, probably because he is an absolute idealist and he is also quite self-indulgent. If you skip the boring parts where he talks about himself, you could learn a great deal from this book by a man with an exceptional mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful book","review":"very useful book ,but it took a long time to get this book...hahaha never mind.still a good book.worth to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy reading, but worth the effort.","review":"This is a book you can't speed read, to say the least. You have to sitdown and go slow. And then re-read it a time or two to properly graspwhat the author is trying to say. I admire Mr. Fuller but sure don'tagree with everything he says--or even most of it. But I still considerthis book worth reading; if you like heavier reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"keep an open mind","review":"While reading this book I felt that it was possible that the form of the book and the ideas within were at odds. I almost wish Fuller might have reinvented the Book to somehow suit this thought process and logic which seem to work best if mapped out in a less linear manner- more geodesic if you will.This book will cause you to question nearly every aspect of the world as you know it, from economics to geology. In fact, you might even gain an appreciation of just how important one is to the other. You may even find yourself in awe of a man with a scope of history (and the future) rivaling that of Marx."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad Buy","review":"really a good idea for a N America Campaign.

Opera in June 1999. I had watched the N.Y. Met video tapes, and read up on the four operas, but Cord's book gives extensive background information to help you understand the context in which the operas were created and first performed. The S.F. Opera was selling this handbook to its patrons and it turned out Professor Cord was sitting two rows ahead of us. His enthusiasm, love, respect and knowledge of Wagner are clear.You can read the book before attending or, if your prefer, after the experience to clarify questions and insights you have had. I recommend it as a wonderful starting point for anyone exploring Wagner's Ring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty promising start for a true talent in jazz.","review":"This is a good album. Tia was much younger then and it shows that she has room to grow but this is still a good album. The sound of the band is pretty coherent but the vocals hurt the album and take away from otherwise good performances by the band. Otherwise, this is a very good debut album and it carries the promise of bringing young blood, energy and perspective to the jazz sound. Tia Fuller brings a fresh voice to a jazz world that needs it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothe your soul","review":"In this interesting book, the authors investigate the religious significance of water and the art of spiritual bathing in various cultures and through many time periods.

The book contains many impressive full color photographs illustrating spiritual bathing in 15 cultures from around the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dozens of Fantastic Goals","review":"This DVD is a great summation of the 2006 World Cup. It includes all the goals, but almost nothing else.One of the biggest attractions of this DVD for me is hearing proper commentary by informed, skilled individuals which is far superior to the commentary we had to listen to in the U.S. during the televised matches. The other strong point is the many angles from which each goals is shown. The DVD also includes the 10 best goals and the 10 best saves.The only weakness is that group play is a single chapter: You have to fast-forward to get to another group's goals. I was also concerned with getting my money's worth (given the relatively high price of the DVD), but I ended up watching it several times in the first couple of weeks.Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"2006 World Cup","review":"All the goals from 2006 World Cup are included on this DVD, but only a few of the penalty kicks shootouts are included.

I could not figure out how it got there or why I didn't remember much of it. Well, I figured it out pretty quickly. The female lead looks like she forgot to take off ghoul makeup and put on wrinkle cream or any other makeup. I mean seriously she looks so weathered that it pretty much ruins the movie, which otherwise is generally entertaining.

All that's missing is Ice-T and Coolio in space, that would be cool. Seeing them in space, trying to stop the astroid...that would be cool. No, nothing of the sort in this thriller which just doesnt thrill, it gives off bad acting and kills Coolio (Batman & Robin) off in his cameo. Suzy Amis doesnt even look like's she trying, Ice-T is himself and Peebles doesnt even give off enough juice in his role though he has some moments.

Just caught this on TV1 tonight. First off, there is some above average script writing for a low budget film, and the gun effects are nice as well. Some of the characters are interesting, but the plot is a bit hokey (gangstas and asteroids?), and Suzy Amis appears to be recovering from a hang over. Totally uninspired performance, her lines are delivered as if she were rehearsing rather than actually \\"acting\\". Better casting and better direction needed. The Coolio death scene is about as uninspired as has ever been put on film. I kept yelling at the screen \\"Hey, Mister Director, were's the passion!\\". In fact, this film's biggest flaw is the flaw most grade B films have: A director who does not force his actors to display a sense of urgency. When Suzy is told the world is going to end, her reaction is similar to being told you forgot your change at the convenience store.

This volume was regularly used in my preparation for each message. I found as before the wisdom and insight of Dr, Macarthur to be very helpful in presenting the flow of Peter's epistle. Additionally Dr. Macarthur pastoral heart is clearly seen in this volume. But as always the usual complaint of his wordiness was again a problem to me. I own 90% of his NT commentary series and have used 90-95% of them in preaching or teaching situations. So I believe I am a fair critic of his work in this series. Dr. Macarthur has a real problem with cutting to the chase many times. If that isn't a problem for you great.

Lo and behold, I find it is not currently available to purchase. Now I wish I had recorded it for my enjoyment anytime. I am going to add it to my wish list, and hope that Amazon will have it available soon. This is a wonderful movie, but it is not for children. Nothing indecent in the movie, just adult conversations with Cindy trying to find out why her husband (he gets murdered at the beginning)was seeing a prostitute; she thought her marriage was perfect. Cindy and Markie (as the prostitute) start out disliking each other, but by the end of the story they have become friends. Some of the situations they find themselves in are hilarious.

Also if she had lost any of that outfit the rating would have went to R pretty fast. If you want to see something well written, funny and you can just sit back and enjoy then this is it.

They fill the rest of the book with explanations of charting, and other technical analysis, and there are many other books that do that much better.

The stories delve into the past and then shoot to the future. A psychiatrist whose aim is to change her clients finds herself the one changed. The last survivors of earth's desolation depend on the mercy of aliens, and a young girl finds within herself the power to avenge the wrongs done by those who torment her. One story in particular stands out as especially haunting- the opening story, Beauty and the Opera or the Phantom Beast; as you might guess, it deals with the Phantom of the Opera- leaning more towards what the internet would term Christine - Erik shippers- but be warned- it's not all roses. That story, if no other, makes this a book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dore Lectures on Mental Science","review":"Anyone familiar with Thomas Troward has probably read The Edingurgh Lectures.

The albums head-boppin' beats along with her melodic voice makes this album probably one of the best comeback albums of the year. My only problem with the album is that it lacks strong ballads that fans have come to expect and love hearing from her. I personally felt that her vocal range past songs such as \\"Imagine\\" and \\"Love Me\\" were missed with the ballads on this latest album.

On this album I was very impressed with the music especially for her more upbeat music. And teaming up with Soulshock & Karlin is good, because her music doesn't sound like someone elses nor does it have alot of samples which makes her style original. For my personal music taste the only drawback is that there aren't enough ballads. If she had at least 2 more I'd be happy.

The film suffers from bad make-up, low rent special effects,and some very poor acting. There is nothing scary in the film and nothing erotic except for alap dance scene between the two female leads which is hot for a little while.

Dialogue is minimal, sound effects are sparse enough to be jarring, and most of the movie plays like some victorian goth kid's fever dream. The combination of minimal sound and beautiful and atmospheric visuals make for something very unique and unsettling. Definitely worth watching.Hard-core vampire fans should be warned: despire the title,this movie is more of a haunted house story than a vampire story. If you're dying for vintage bloodsucking, you should probably check out that other 1931 vamipre movie. You know, the one starring the Romanian guy from Seasme Street."},{"rating":"2","title":"Criterion's Vampyr is so... delicious","review":"There are many other reviews about the contents of this set, but I wanted to chime in with my recommendation. Everything about it is well planned and executed: The texture of the box and selection of photos on it. The book. The subtle, but effective menu design. The choice of subtitles. And Vampyr itself improves with each viewing. For such an old film it's still wonderfully unsettling with many images lingering about... like a shadow. The cumulative effect is just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Transfer Of A Great Classic Horror","review":"For anyone interested on the history of horror, this film is a must. Carl Dreyer has a unique style of storytelling and filming that stands apart from all other filmmakers. I have other transfers of this film, but the Criterion version is the best. A viewer will notice some spots and blotches left on the film. Criterion does not clean it up completely. From reading the write-ups of previous Criterion transfers I own, I gather the reason they do this is to preserve the version in a state that would be very similar to how it would have looked in the theatres when it was released. They would not have been pristine. The technology was not advanced enough and, in this case, a viewer in the early 30s would have noticed some spots and blotches still left on the film.

The image transfer is nearly unwatchable (as is true of the VHS cassette), with extensive grain and artifacts. The sound is muffled and garbled, with persistent loud hissing; most of the underscoring and some of the dialogue are lost under the noise. The English subtitles -- which cannot be turned off -- are large and intrusive.The only bonus feature on the disc is _The Mascot_, an unrelated short subject by the stop-motion master Starewicz. (Imagine what would happen if the Brothers Quay were dropped into the 1930s, and you'll have a good idea of Starewicz.) It's a great short. Unfortunately, its DVD transfer is even worse than the main feature's.Dreyer and Starewicz deserve better.

With no coherent story line or identification of the characters, and with its disconnected jumps from one scene to another, this viewer was left completely at sea.The Criterion release adds a screenplay book and a smaller booklet about the film and its history. The special features on Disc 2 are also interesting but neither these nor the commentary provides much clarity about what is going on.Criterion did what it could to render the poor-quality film elements viewable, but picture quality is only fair.

The book is about a bunch of people in a small town who all do seemingly pointless things, in which characteristic they are closely mirrored by the novel's plot.My main problem with the novel is that it is simply not enjoyable. The author inserts so many witty ovservations on nature and 'creative' media (police reports, diaries, astrology columns, etc.) that at a certain point it becomes more of a scrapbook than a novel. This may be creative, but it doesn't make for a good read. At the same time the book is so packed with metaphors and similes that it becomes absolutely claustrophobic.All in all, can't recomment this book - it's more effort to read than it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I picked up this book after seeing it on NPR's list of summer/beach books.

I thought it would be an etheral story of the thinning of the veil between our World and the other side. I am almost halfway through and I just cannot keep reading. I feel like the author is trying so hard to show her skill at beautiful prose that she forgets her story. It's boring, very confusing, and unfortunately did not live up (for me) to the wonderful painting used on the cover. Being a wonderful writer is one thing, but there is not a gripping story here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I Miss Something?","review":"After hearing praise for this book, I decided to read it. The first line was intriguing, so I was patient at first. As I read chapter after chapter, I kept wondering - when is someting going to happen? It was boring and I felt like there was no connection between the characters, though maybe thats just what the author wanted you to think. The book certainly did not live up to the first line, or even the back cover, for that matter. I felt cheated, and the only part that had any excitement was the last few pages! All in all, it just seemed like a bunch of normal people in a small town going about their daily lives.

It's not the picture on the cover, though. One tip, if you do feel intimidated - make notes to keep track of the different characters, and try to read it in big chunks. Also, enjoy it for what it is, a collection of images and ideas, not a plot-driven package. Life is messy and sometimes 'stories' should be, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully Written, But Too Remote and Inaccessible","review":"The Thin Place is beautifully written, but I can't recommend it. The novel is too remote and too inaccessible.Because I appreciated Davis's craftmanship, I plowed through. But while I admired The Thin Place, I can't say that I enjoyed most of it.For those who want a thumbnail, think Thornton Wilder's Our Town with much of the likability stripped out. Davis crafts several characters who arouse sympathy, but because she has chosen a broad palette, they don't stand out sufficiently to make you care about the novel as a whole.My two stars are for Davis's prose. Had her prose been less luminous, this review would have been one star and I would have branded the book unreadable. Like other under-whelmed reviewers on this site, I agree with the poster who felt that a novel that demands so much work of the reader is more of a household chore than a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thin Place","review":"Could not get the plot or purpose.

I wanted to take the book apart, cut out paragraphs and chapters and paste them back together in a different order to find a cohesive story.

It is a fragmented mess of very short chapters that don't follow any path of coherency. If there is a plot, I could not discern it. Worst of all, none of the characters \\"breathe\\". They are sketches, defined by their different sexes, ages, names, backgrounds, but they are not visceral in any way. Author Davis stands back and only observes them. Maybe there is a point to all of this, but I'm sorry---yawn---it is lost on me.Everyone mentions that it is hard work to stay with \\"The Thin Place\\", but if I have to labor that much to enjoy a book, I'd rather mow the lawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like \\"fat free\\" tastes","review":"I picked this up after seeing Bookslut cite it as one of the year's best reads.The brief premise for the book sounded ok so I took a gamble.Half way through the book, which was pathetically slow going, the only \\"thin\\" thing going on is the plot. Not that there is one.Davis seems to get some major names dropped in-line with hers, so maybe -although doubtfully, I'm missing something. Or maybe she just swung and missed (big time) with this particular novel and her previous work is (at least) good. Although I'm not excited to give it a try based on this vapid effort. The occasional well written line and almost vaguely interesting characters (with no story though) but hardly worth a gamble. Or a dead tree.All in all an unreadable book that is hardly the best of anything, let alone a stand-out for a year's worth of books. Try Simon Ings' _The Weight of Numbers_ for the *easy* winner of that prize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not another story","review":"Amusingly, the flap copy for this book says that it is \\"about Mees Kipp...\\" Rarely does the copy writer get it so wrong. This is not a story, and certainly not \\"about\\" any one character. As other reviews have pointed out, it's a sequence of observations on or by different characters in a thin little universe bounded on all sides by a larger universe, or several of them. Hardly a new idea, but presented in a contemporary idiom and very well done. The book is a joy to read for its wry humor and its evocation of pity for the pitiless. It's my bias, but I think authors that try to delve into the psyche of animals come up looking a bit silly (_so_ sensitive, so new age) Davis barely manages to escape that. I could do without out it, but she brings it off better than most."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"Kathryn Davis is one of my favourite authors.

Some teenage girls, dogs, badgers, old diaries. I listened to the audiobook for about one and a half of the CD's and then gave up on it because it was not holding my interest. There really was no plot per se, just a whole bunch of different little anectodotes which seemed to be only loosely connected to each other. It wasn't meaningful to me. I didn't want to continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a strange and glorious book!","review":"Had me enthralled the whole way through. Every time I had to stop reading it, I immediately wanted to reenter this lush tapestry. Boy, can Kathryn Davis write.

It keeps you wondering where it's going...and really, in the end, I wasn't all that satisfied as to where it took me. It seemed to end abruptly, and, for most of the characters, not at all well, so actually I felt like maybe the town these folks lived in was cursed, as there were no good endings for anyone, from the 1800s schoolmarm on up to the present day characters. What I did like was the unusual format, the chapters emitting different voices, even a dog's! I give it only two stars because if I wouldn't read it again, that's the rating it gets, and I wouldn't read it again. I will definitely pass it on to my reading friends, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragmented and Slow","review":"I really thought that I was going to enjoy this novel but instead I found myself looking forward to it being over. After 200 pages, I still felt like I was reading the introduction and waiting for the real story to begin. I did not care about any of the characters and I found the story to be boring. On a separate note, I have absolutely no idea how the cover art fits in with the story because none of the drawn images figure into the story. I wonder what the purpose of that was? I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful","review":"What was i thinking? i actually had this in my wishlist and got it for christmas.

This book is a real push, and my main guideline for reading is pretty simple: if I don't look forward to getting back into it, then I'm not enjoying the book and I probably won't finish it.Why are so many writers trying to be \\"quirky\\" these days? Doesn't anyone just tell a great story anymore? When Mees revived the man on the beach, I honestly had no idea what it was she was doing. Where was she putting her hand? In his mouth? Somewhere else?

At that time she was the most famous wild and single girl in the music world (now she is a very more respected artist), you can see how she prepares for each concert, all the commotion involved, how the crew becomes her family and how fame can be a prision sometimes. Film mostly in black and white is a representation of how a tour is and all the elements involved in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Document for Madonna's Times","review":"16 years after this documentary was released, and Madonna is still with us. Has anything changed? She's had kids, maintained musical mastery of her work and kept on chugging.Truth or Dare is a very well made 'fly-on-the-wall'document that has not dated in my opinion. Then, as now, Madonna was ahead of the curve in doing this. Her chameleon like makeovers make her a more riveting subject. And as an icon for her time, she makes for great tv. The slice of life approach integrates well and viewing it 16 years later - it's as fresh as it ever was. Better than the Osbournes.One thing is I always wondered what happened to the director of the film: Alek Keshishian. They should consider doing a follow up.PS - Blond Ambition was my favourite Madonna tour on video, and I hope they release it again on DVD. This release features a few performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"It's a good thing Madonna has so many sheep-like fans who pay for her to live in her own fantasy world where she is important. An hour and a half of self-delusion is enough for even the most rabid fan. The gay dancer isn't even in the 'human being' category, humans have backbones if I remember my biology correctly. With over the top stage performances with the males wearing the traffic cone bras, to seeing guys French kiss each other, this has it all. Sure Madonna flashes the camera, but only after she announces that her father used to get in bed with her at night and have sex.The last five minutes is a tribute of hilarity. Madonna is walking around in seclusion as a narrator announces how 'deep' and 'how dedicated to her art' she is.This was nothing more than Madonna pumping up her ego. The parody was better, check out Julie Brown's 'Medusa'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This films shows that Madonna is a talentless spoiled brat.

If you are a Madonna fan, this movie is worth having just for the great concert footage, especially because the Blonde Ambition tour footage has not been widely released. I also appreciated the backstage footage. I was surprised at how candid Madonna was at times regarding problems with her show- whether it was content or technical problems. I found it interesting that Madonna's main concern was \\"Did you like my show?\\" She is always the consummate entertainer. This movie is an interesting look at a multi-faceted and colorful performer- on and off stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna in High Definition!","review":"Sound and Picture is Great.

He loves to go to the family farm and sit on all the different old tractors and ride them with his daddy. But, this 27 minute video didn't even begin to show much of anything. Just a couple of tractors riding through a dusty field chewing up some corn and wheat straw. The video promises to show you cows being milked and bales of hay being made......where? We saw cows but no milking machines. We saw square bales of hay being spit into a trailer but no show on the actual making of them. I was so disappointed in this video. People that love it have no clue that they aren't even seeing anything. How about a longer video with \\"Big Bud\\" and more combine action? 30 minutes is just barely long enough to get a tractor warmed up where I come from."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXACTLY what we were looking for!","review":"My 22-month old son is crazy about all types of transportation and machinery but has a particular love for tractors. I ordered this video on a whim and am thrilled with his interest in it. We've only had it for a week or two but my son asks to see his \\"tractor bideo\\" probably ten times a day. He loves it! The video contains footage of all types of farm equipment, both up close and from a distance. It also shows children feeding calves from bottles and explains how milk goes from the cow to your cup without too much explanation--just right for a two year old. There is not a lot of talk in the whole video--just lots of tractors, combines, balers, and cows. Being suburban family, he never sees this stuff outside of a video--it's exactly what we were looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty [boring]","review":"This video offers an extremely superficial view of the duties of tractors on the farm.

There is a basic breakdown of what a pitch is but little concrete information is given about the process or strategies involved in making a successful pitch. The excuse is that you cannot capture the essence of a pitch in words. If this is true, why write a book? A large portion of the book is dedicated to plot summaries of popular films and TV shows. While some of this is useful, in order to illustrate the format of a treatment (a written precursor to the pitch), it feels as if this was done to get the book to a publishable length.

I was surprised how they jump in and out and have a hard time staying on the right track. I might need them looked at and pay for them to be aligned.All in all, I'm happy and will have a nice ride for a year or two. I probably won't buy a bike online again.

The cheap mechanical disc brakes on this bike are no more powerful than a standard rim brake, and will rub no matter what.

The single wall wheels will buckle or bend if you ever hit a rock or curb. Go to a bicycle shop and ask for help finding a bike that will best suite you.

Unfortunately, this DVD does very little to help you play like Albert. Very little tab and what tab there is is of a few simple licks you already know. Albert's obviously a nice guy with a great attitude, but leaves a lot to be desired as a guitar teacher. This DVD is almost entirely Albert giving his thoughts on pedals, playing style, gigging, etc. No tab of his cool runs. Only the most beginning player will benefit from the limited tab here, and only advanced players who like to learn without tab will benefit from watching Albert play a little on the DVD.

The author has a great talent for description, but abuses it in the extreme. He will use paragraphs to describe a scene, when a few lines expertly written will get the reader there much more enjoyably. There was so MUCH description, theological references and red herrings in the text that it put me to sleep quicker than reading a text on trigonometry. But, I persevered, as I was interested in what the 'beast' would really turn out to be. The finale was underwhelming in the extreme. We are supposed to believe that these people have walked in hell and come back out.

However, the key ingredient missing is the fire, the energy, that made their past efforts so much more enjoyable. Also, none of their tracks stand out (no distinguishing features), a result of repetition and lazy electronic tamperings -- most of the songs are drowned in guitar strings and computer beeps.

A lot of the songs are good. A couple are great. The SOUND is what's missing. Technically, the guitars sound like they were recorded direct instead of through cranked up amplifiers.

That said - the new album: I can you could listen to this album only once and give it a lukewarm review - which probably is the case with most of the critics (like Rolling Stone magazine). Granted - it's not as easily accesible as \\"Villians\\", and yes the sound is a little scratchy in a few places - but the more I listen to this album the more I appreciate it. The lyrics and vocals are top-notch - every song on the album takes you somewhere. The guitar work is awesome - but you have to listen harder to get it. I love the inclusion of Craig Wedrin (of \\"Shudder to Think\\") as a backup vocalist. (Check THOSE guys out if you really want to blow your mind!).

Just like every other tvp album, there is a great variety of songs, each telling a story, and each one makes you want to find out where it came from. There are some stunning melodies, and Brian Vander Ark's voice is so well suited to a sweet ballad like \\"kiss me idle\\" - and \\"half a mind\\" is a brilliant song, and one I'm sure a lot of people can relate to.

Come on guys, how bad do you think we are going to feel for your pain of stardom?? With the \\"big name\\" producers on this record, I'm surprised at the sub-standard quality of the production (at a nice cost I'm sure).

Gwen immediately responded to Luke with undeserved harsh animosity, judging him without knowing anything about him or having the facts straight. Gwen was so quick to assume the worst about him (she was also too quick to have sex with him, especially while proclaiming to dislike him so much).

The fact that all it took was Huck's loving attitude to convince everyone around him, is almost an insult to all Twain did to make this great American novel convincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Adventures of Huck Finn","review":"I bought this movie for my daughter and it was full of scratches and the movie would freeze every couple minutes. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie for all ages","review":"I marvel at Elijah Wood's talent....especially in this movie. No matter what age you are, it is entertaining, and wonderful acting from all characters.It doesn't take too much thinking which is refreshing sometimes! I have seen the VHS made for tv version a lot and I can't wait to own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't improve upon perfection","review":"As others have said before me, the movie was not created to be identical to the book. But the movie, of it's own device, did have depth and complexity; humor and drama. It maintained much of what we expect to see in a movie about the infamous Finn, with a few unexpected twists thrown in for good or ill. Courtney B. Vance and Elijah Wood were a charming pair. Wood earned critical acclaim for his incredible ability to embody a character even at this young age. Ultimately, the writing, the acting and the fact that it was based on such a solid story to begin with pulls this movie together as one of the better products from Hollywood. I think it even does more honor to the novel than other versions of the story I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unlike the book","review":"This movie is very unlike the book. It is not nearly as funny or as heartfelt as the book and also lacks many major events. The events it does include also are changed for no clear purpose. Elijah Wood is cute, but he is also a great deal younger than the real Huck Finn was supposed to be. I would not reccomend it to either teachers or students who are looking for a version that follows the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Business","review":"If this is for the movie I purchased. Its one of the best family, down home, good movie. Today there is too much of the \\"sex sells\\" thing going on & promoting it.

Can't ask for more.Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Adventures of Huck Finn DVD","review":"This is a great movie and follows the book very well. It moves quickly so you have to watch carefully to catch the one liners and scenes that match up with the book. It was a great movie, one that I couldn't stop watching! It is full of action and the acting is great and captivating! My high school English class loved it also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Adventure of Huckleberry Finn","review":"The movie is pretty good overall. Even though it took out some events and character originally happened in the novel by Mark Twain such as Tom Sawyer, but it generates most of the important events to the movie. The movie changed the ending by shown Huck Finn got shot instead of Tom Sawyer but I don't think it affects the overall quality of the movie. This movie has a lot of strength, it contained great pictures and identical environment to the story in Mark Twain's novel. In addition, it also make most of the characters identical to the novel, Huck,Pap,King/Duke, and Granger/Shepherson all looked as what I expected. However, Disney did a bad job presenting Jim to the audience. To me, Jim in the movie did not reflect Jim's real character in the novel because there shouldnt be any slaves in the 1800s who wear earings. Overall, I have to give Disney the credit to show The Adventure of Huck Finn in video, I think a few mistake from the movie is understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best commentaries on John I have ever read","review":"As a pastor, I have nearly 30 commentaries on the Gospel of John but this is the by far my favorite. It is a great balance of academic scholarship and pastoral application. This is a great commentary for both the scholary study and personal devotional reading. For those of you who have not taken Greek, don't fear: the Greek is transliterated into English so you won't have a problem with pronounciation. For those of you who plan to do academic & scholarly work, this volume is already available as a Logos Libronix download so that you can easily cut & paste with the automatic footnote/endnote feature offered in Libronix.The only problem with the commentary is that it's companion for the last half of the Gospel of John has not yet been released. When the second volume is released, it will likely be the most useful commentary set on the Gospel of John that is available. I give this my hightest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Commentary","review":"I am using this commentary to prepare a Bible study in the Book of John and I absolutely love it. The references to other parts of Scripture are very helpful. MacArthur explains the Bible with the Bible, in other words every verse is linked to other verses in the Bible.Also, there are several historic references and explanations on what some words mean in Greek and Hebrew. The best thing is that this commentary is very easy to read and understand.You do not have to be a teacher of the Bible to appreciate and use this commentary. As I said, it is very easy to read and understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"scientific discovery","review":"The process of scientific discovery is rarely highlighted in movies.

I was excited to purchase Volume 1 for my daughter's birthday. These books are wonderful. The stories are short and easily understood while they remain true to the culture and beliefs of Japan. Both my daughter and I enjoy these stories during our reading times and I highly recommend them to others trying to give their children a multicultural education."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbed down for Western kids","review":"I haven't read ALL the stories in this book, but sadly, the authors have tidied up the elements in the original folk and fairy tales to make them \\"suitable\\" for young readers. One example, in the classic tale The Monkey and the Crab, originally Monkey kills crab (in this version Monkey just kind of injures Crab); and in the original, charmingly, one of the friends of crab that ambushed Monkey was a cow pie! The cow pie is just sort of left out here. I would LOVE to see a collection of translated classic Japanese kid stories with the warts left where they are!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good book for kids","review":"i wouldn't rec. this book for children...the stories are violent and kind of terrible...cutting off tongues, stabbing eyes, fighting ogres, etc. i guess there are some morals to be learned from the stories which are good...but i would never buy this book for a friend!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and entertaining cultural exchange","review":"As a small child I lived for three years in Japan. Before we moved overseas, my mother bought me this book, I suppose to encourage an interest in Japanese culture.

Now my husband and I cannot wait for Saturday and Sunday, so we could go to the park and play. Sometimes we play in our back yard, but then we use birdies from the regular set because we do not have too much space, but in the park we can find flat large size surface and play. If you decide to buy the speedmington, please notice that \\"bag set\\" comes with very convenient bag, while the \\"fun set\\" looks like does not have a nice carry on bag. I believe it was a great \\"investment\\"; if we will play regularly, then we will be feet even more; it's definitely diferent then just a workout in the gym. For us the best speeder is which comes in red color with the yellow end. It flyes differently then regular \\"birdie\\".

The free advice Dr. Dave gives on that website was invaluable, particularly the 30 and 90 degree rules. Both were concepts I was intuitively aware of, but never understood from a physics perspective.When I saw that Dr. Dave had a book coming out, I knew it was going to be just what I always wanted. From simple tips for fundamentals to the physics behind complex ball effects, this book has it all, and makes it easy to follow. That fact that it's all grounded in math and physics makes it even more appealing. And the clear, concise writing style and understandable diagrams are icing on the cake.I'd recommend this to anyone who loves pool and wonders why the balls do what they do. Personally, I'm going to browbeat both of my pool teams into buying copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pool shots improved greatly","review":"My husband ordered this book after we got our pool table.

BEWARE......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully crafted version of \\"Emma\\"","review":"The most recent BBC adaptations of Jane Autsen's novels have been a bit of hit and miss (very disappointed with the latest \\"Persuasion\\"), so I was very pleased to find the new \\"Emma\\" a complete hit. From the casting to the locations to the costumes to the music, this is a true delight. My husband even loved it! The extras on the DVD are also a plus. I loved the interview with Sir Michael Gambon (Mr. Woodhouse), and found the discussion about the music fascinating.I was especially pleased with the chemestry between Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller as Emma and Mr. Nightly. And Ms. Garai has such an expressive face that she made Emma both a comedic masterpiece and a real person. Michael Gambon seems to be making all the rounds as the elderly British gentleman of choice recently, but I hope that we see more of him. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was so disappointed in this version of \\"Emma\\" on Masterpiece. Being broken into three parts, I was hoping it would be of the same caliber as A&E;'s \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but that was not the case. Jane Austen's carefully crafted dialogue was dumbed down into a bland, modern-day screenplay that frustrated more than entertained.From language to posture to expressions, the true essence of the characters, from Emma to Mr. Knightly to Harriet, was completely lost. As other reviewers have mentioned, the 1997 version with Kate Beckinsale is infinitely superior (though too short) in its authenticity, and that's the one to which I'll always turn when I don't have time to turn to the book itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enjoyable version of EMMA","review":"Truly the most enjoyable version of EMMA; perhaps not the most faithful recounting of the spirit of Jane Austen's work, it was most pleasant to watch. Ms. Garai is an excellent actor and this was her best work.I look forward to seeing more performances by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurrah!

Way to go, Romola, Jonny, Michael & BBC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yay, more charater development","review":"I didn't buy this, but I watched it on PBS Masterpiece Classics. It was really good. There was character development, you really get to know what's going on in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 stars; disappointing","review":"If you would like to watch a period film with nice production values, one or two good actors, and a plot reminiscent of Jane Austen's novel \\"Emma,\\" you might be interested in this BBC offering. If you would actually like to see a film of the novel \\"Emma,\\" I suggest either of the two 1999 Emmas, with either Gwneth Paltrow or Kate Beckinsale as the heroine.Not recommended for those who value faithfulness to the spirit of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming adaptation","review":"Maybe it is not by the letter but this adaptation is simply charming.

Better than Gwyneth's version, in my humble opinion. Well done BBC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rendition!","review":"I like Emma, and I was happy to find the BBC version. I enjoyed the cast. I'd buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I agree with most of the other reviews. If you love BBC and the recent Pride and Prejudice movie, this is a good choice.I do agree that it was a bit slow in the beginning and middle, especially as you're waiting for problems to resolve and for Emma to be reasonable already, but it was fun and pleasant.Other versions of Emma I've seen make Emma seem a bit too mean-spirited, and I thought this version struck a good balance of making her just naive and a bit self-centered, rather than actually snotty or mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Jane Austen","review":"I enjoy reading more than most people but I often have a hard time getting through Jane Austen's written work. This book-turned-TV-series (although it felt very much like a rather long movie when watched back-to-back) gave me a much better grasp of the characters and the culture of the setting. Mr. Knightly was perfect and you'll definitely laugh with Emma and cringe at her mistakes.Very wonderful show."},{"rating":"2","title":"for true jane austin fans...","review":"This was different than I expected...kind of a strange beginning and generally more light-hearted than other Jane Austin movies. If you are a true Jane Austin fan I think you will enjoy it because it does seem to follow the book more closely than shorter versions. It does seem to move slower in comparison to Pride and Prejudice which I think is partly due to the diversity of characters and that they are not as intertwined as other Austin classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Emma adaptations I've seen!","review":"Emma has never been my favourite Jane Austen novel. I tried to read it, but I couldn't get into it. I've seen a number of adaptations, but I found them (mostly) boring. I have trouble keeping all the characters straight, especially since some of them have taken different names (Frank Churchill is actually Mr. Weston's son, for example). When I started watching this, I was as confused as ever. But I kept watching, hoping that I would be able to get everything straight in my head. By the time PBS aired the last of the three parts, I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.Good casting, fine scenery, and gorgeous costumes are things I've come to expect from BBC productions of classic works, and Emma didn't disappoint. After seeing this beautiful adaptation, I may have to rethink putting Emma at the bottom of my list of favourite classic stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling","review":"For an average television production this is adequate. Beautiful costumes, beautiful settings, adequate acting. But as a televisions adaptation of Emma by Jane Austin I am simply shocked that this program has received so many good reviews. Why? The story does not adhere to the book. There is so much artistic license that at times I think that the writers have no sense of the spirit of Emma at all. The characters are not true to their literary nature. I could go on criticizing but I actually don't enjoy putting the creative efforts of others down. If you are looking for an entertaining period drama this is great. If you are looking for Emma you won't find her here. The writers are primarily at fault. Then the Director. Then the primary actors... in that order. If this were any old period flic I would give it a three star rating. As a adaptation of Emma by Jane Austin I wish I could give it a zero... a one star had to suffice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mimi series","review":"Great rendition of the book, if you love the movie Emma, this series is a must! The characters were very believable, the setting well portrayed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful series!","review":"I have not read the book, but I love period movies. This mini series is very beautiful. I cannot believe I had it for over a year before I watched it. Highly recommend!! Cheers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I can't get enough of these types of period dramas, but unfortunately, this portrayal of Emma didn't do anything for me.Romola Garai as Emma was not good. I found her portrayal of Emma as mostly vapid and annoying, although she is certainly beautiful in a luminous way. Johnny Lee Miller was much better as Mr. Knightly. Unfortunately, there was ZERO chemistry between the two of them.Watch the Gwyneth Paltrow Emma-it is much better all around with better acting performances and chemistry between the two main characters.Makes me appreciate BBC Pride and Prejudice even more when you see how these movies can miss the mark like this one did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully entertaining","review":"I'm quite a big Austen fan, and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I've read all of her books, and seen all of the movies, and this one was one of the best adaptations I've seen. I thought they did a great job bringing Miss Emma Woodhouse to the screen. Every single character is played so well, I felt myself being pulled into the movie. They did a great job casting perfect people to play each role. If you're an Austen fan, whether a huge fan, or dabbler, give this one a chance. You'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"will not be adding this to my BBC collection..","review":"I am so lucky to have viewed this overated production on Netflix, Before buying it and adding it to my BBC collection.What went wrong BBC?..even Michael Gambon could not save this dissapointing mess.

To my surprise, the movie turned out to be an enjoyment. The story is cleverly written and well acted. Emma enjoys match-making and works on finding suitable partners for her sister, her governess and her new best friend. What she does is make a mess of things and almost misses out on love herself.Snuggle up and enjoy this movie with your sweetie....and please, pass the popcorn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"Wonderful acting, Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller are just incredible in this Jane Austen classic. His rendition of Mr. Knightly would have to be my favorite. Also, I like that in this version, the relationship between Emma and her father is more thoroughly developed, you really feel how much they love each other.The rendition of Mr. Churchill and Jane Fairfax was also well acted, not my favorites but they did an adequate job.All in all, a beautiful version!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emma Lusciousness","review":"I really enjoyed this Emma. The music, especially, is spectacular. We'd love to get the sheet music for this.I appreciated the little extras the movie shows from the childhoods of the three children. They added some extra insight into the lives of the three. We also get more of a feeling of Mr. Knightly schooling Emma than other renditions.This was a delightful rendition, although my daughters think Mr. Knightly is too short and young-looking. I love how he's portrayed. And Romola Gerai does a smashing job as Emma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellency and Delight","review":"This movie caught my eye because of the previous satisfaction I have had with other BBC Masterpiece movies. In purchasing \\"Emma\\", I can surely say that this movie was one of the best renditions that I could have added to my collection. The actors capture each of the characters of Miss Austen's work in a flawless, captivating, touching, and highly entertaining manner. I wish to give this movie more than 5 stars. Divided into 4 parts, I simply could hardly wait to begin the next episode. The video clip is good, but the movie is a million times more than that. I cannot stress how enjoyable and quality this \\"Emma\\" is. Buy it now, and you will never regret your purchase. \\"Emma\\"- to be cherished always..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Remake","review":"Sorry, Ms. Garai, this is almost a complete waste of time . . . Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow have said all that needs to be said. This version interprets the heck out of this thing, and adds a lot of dialogue to clarify their interpretation while cutting much of Austen's (superior) dialogue . Harriet's voice is grating, although they do develop her character more than some of the other versions. Emma constantly echoes Gwyneth Paltrow's portrayal--not surprisingly. I do like some of the points they make and some of the contrasts they draw: Emma's childhood fate, Miss Bates' poverty. All in all, though, not worth it. I would highly recommend either of the '97 versions over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the humor?","review":"This is the most humorless Jane Austen adaptation I've seen. Wonderful comic characters such as Mr. Woodhouse, Mrs. Elton and Miss Bates are rendered boring. Pales in comparison to the Gwneth Paltrow version, both in casting, music and wit. I've enjoyed Romola Garai in the past, but here she overacts -- constantly making faces. The location photography while pretty, has no particular style. Biggest complaint: why is this spread over four hours? Hopelessly padded. Johnny Lee Miller is no Jeremy Northam. This production is only adequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"tlgable","review":"Imust apologize for giving Gweneth Paltrows version of Emma a bad review. upon lookingat the DVD again I find it was the version with Ramoli Garai that was so poorly done.She seemed confused at times and looked as tho she couldn't remember her lines veryquickly.The older version with Kate Beckinsale was the best in my opnion. Shebrought credibility to the times it was set in as well as a sauciness that was delightful.I have not seen Gweneth Paltrows version. However If something isn't broken, why try tofix it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emma","review":"A friend recommended this to me and I'm glad she did. I've always been a fan of Jane Austen and this was a good interpretation of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done","review":"Love this version of Emma. Well cast, true to the book and beautiful to watch. My preteen and I watched it together and both enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved this version!!","review":"This is by far my favorite version of the movie. Absolutely loved Johnny Lee Miller as Knightly! and Romola is a charming Emma. Unlike Gwyneth Paltrow (whom I love)Romola was the right age I felt for Emma. She brought a \\"immaturity\\" to the character that Gwyneth didn't. The age difference was more obvious between Johnny and Romola. It was closer to Jane's written characters. Johnny portrayed Knightly with his usual class he brings to every character he plays. He had an ease in the character, like it was meant for him. He had little facial expressions that wereadorable in dealing with Emma. Saw it on TV and had to have it for my collection!It is worth buying if your a Janeite!!! Bravo to the cast! I should of course mention the awesome Michael Gambon who plays Emma's father, Mr. Woodhouse....he is so amazing! I'm gonna watch my copy over and over!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Emma - Badly done, Emma, badly done","review":"I have to say that Emma is one of my least favorite Jane Austen Characters to begin with. She is not especially sympathetic and in this version I am most displeased.First of all, Knightly (Johnny Lee Miller) is way too young - isn't there supposed to be a 15 year age difference? It looked to me like the producer's wanted a good looking actor instead of staying true to the story. That brings me to my next point - the dialouge. It seems that the screenwriter has decided to make changes that were un-necessary.The best versions of all of Jane's stories are the ones that stay true to the entire story. In the case of Emma, the version starring Kate Beckinsale is far better.This movie is watchable, but if you have read the book and have seen better productions, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute show","review":"I love anything Jane Austen.

Good acting and editing done by the Bbc America."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best Emma out there!","review":"totally a great rendition of Emma. this is the forth adaptation of Jane Austin's fun packed novel that I have seen, and it was definitely the best. I used to like the A&E version, but the all around superior actors and time spent on this film surpassed my best expectations of yet another attempt to portray the fun loving people in the tale accurately. As an avid Austin fan, Emma is probably my favorite story, and this movie was even better then the book I felt. Great job BBC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful...until Emma turned to a watering pot!","review":"Watching through the first 2 parts of Masterpiece theater, I was convinced that this was the best Emma ever. However, the ending left me with much to be desired. Was Emma crying when Mr. Knightley was trying to confide his feelings to her? And then bursting into Mr. Knightley's study, sobbing that she cannot leave her father to marry him. Emma was such a strong character in the beginning, I don't understand why they turned her into a watering pot in the end. Perhaps it was that time of the month for Emma or the writer?I still watch the movie over and over again, though I always cringe and try to stop myself from fast forwarding at those parts. Other than that, I love Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller's portrayal of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Austen in Name Only","review":"The arc of the plot is Austen. The names of the characters. The outlines of their relationships.The verbal subtlety, the character detail, most especially the dialogue, are NOT AUSTEN. Terrible, heavy handed and clumsy version of the novel. The Frank Churchill sub-plot of the novel is vastly expanded - and not in a good way. Jane Fairfax is insipid. Elton and wife are not at all amusing.Were Austen alive, she would probably ask that HER name be taken off the credits.IT\\"S THAT BAD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She's silly.","review":"I like period pieces and Jane Austen, but Emma leaves me cold.

Mr. Knightly has always been my favorite of Austen's male characters, so I'm picky about who plays him, and JLM was spot-on. I'll admit that Gwyneth Paltrow was hard to chase out of my head as Emma, but after just the second time of watching this, Romola Garai has easily replaced her. And Michael Gambon as Mr. Woodhouse - classic!! Such a great performance by the entire cast!I also couldn't have been happier with the fantastic adaptation of my favorite Austen novel! I've watched it over and over again since it was on TV, and ordered it here on Amazon the first moment that I could! Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"Loved this mini series!

Though events are somewhat out of order, or rather you learn the information about the characters a little out of order, this version is close to perfection. Add in the charming Edmund from Mansfield park, Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley, and who can help wanting to watch this mini series over and over. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great everything!","review":"It's lovely to see a Jane Austen story given the time it deserves instead of being squeezed into less than 2 hours. All Jane Austen's should be British miniseries.Romola is a bit too exuberant at times as Emma, but is still believable as the character. Jonny Lee Miller is excellent - the best Knightley I've seen yet. The rest of the cast is all excellent, the costumes and design are perfect. The chemistry between Emma and Knightley is subtle as it should be and very believable.This is an absolute delight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The wife loves Jane Austen","review":"Again, I bought this movie to shut the wife up. She has watched this movie repeatedly and I only needed to get up once to change the disc for her lazy ass. But again, it shut the wife up for hours as she watched the movie. Well worth the value.Wife says it's a very nicely done version of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I can't get enough of these types of period dramas, but unfortunately, this portrayal of Emma didn't do anything for me.Romola Garai as Emma was not good. I found her portrayal of Emma as mostly vapid and annoying, although she is certainly beautiful in a luminous way. Johnny Lee Miller was much better as Mr. Knightly. Unfortunately, there was ZERO chemistry between the two of them.Watch the Gwyneth Paltrow Emma-it is much better all around with better acting performances and chemistry between the two main characters. Haven't seen the Kate Beckinsale one; must be better than this one.Makes me appreciate BBC Pride and Prejudice even more when you see how these movies can miss the mark like this one did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emma","review":"I could barely get past the the half way mark of this insipid tv show.

The casting, I find flawless and the screenplay dialog was natural and organic.

The cast is perfect, Romola Garai is perfect as Emma Woodhouse, Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley. I gave it four stars because the very end is not enough pomp for four episodes.

As an avid fan of Jane Austen I have found Emma to be the least liked by myself of her works . This version was a quite a find, well scripted, well acted and a pleasure to watch.

Although Emma in not my very favorite of the Austen collection I still enjoyed it very much. I liked Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller's performance very much. Michael Gambon as Emma's father was a good choice as I felt that some of the other performers who played the part were very annoying to me. I would recommend this version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"McGoorty","review":"I can't imagine anyone wanting to write a book about this man.He was nothing but a vulgar,lazy,lying alcoholic.Half of the things that he says are nothing but B.S.For instance,Chicago police officers murdering suspected gangsters @ black men for 200$ a pop.I could go on @ on but you should get the idea.Save your money.As for me, I am going to line my cats litter box with my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The tale of a life wasted","review":"Danny McGoorty was a gifted pool and billiards player.

It shows the vivid life of a pool hustler/hobo/drunk/real person that was in his prime in the 1920's-1950's. If gives a real sense of McGoorty and his life in what apear to be his own words. He also shares extremely colorful insight, his opinion, into several famous and well known professional billiard players and World Champions of his era. It is full of real life experiences during those times; however, the language and crude tone are very vulgar.

The only thing taught in the first 4 lessons is: \\"I can (or cannot) speak Thai\\" or \\"I am (or am not) from America\\" Up front it seems to be promising, given the number of tapes and lessons, but in realty you are no further along by the end of the 4th lesson as you were at the end of the 1st.

I studied Indonesian at night school for 2 years and it took me till the end of the first year to feel confident in using it in real life. Just listening and responding to the Pimsleur CD's while I drive has given me a good working knowledge of the language in a reasonably short time.

NOW, There are only 10 lessons that leaves you short if you want to continue. That means after 10 days, you are just past the beginner stage and you have nothing else.

I needed a CD-only option, as I was using them on my daily commute. This eliminated most of the audio+computer options like Rosetta Stone. While I learned some basics from these CDs, they weren't worth the time I committed to listening to them. Essentially, almost all of the lessons teach you language that would be helpful if you're an American businessman trying to pick up a local woman in a bar. If that doesn't fit your description, I'd avoid these CDs.

I always felt it necessary to study all aspects (reading, writing, speaking) of a foreign language. However I did not have time for a University class. I picked up Pimsleur Thai and I love it. It is much easier than I had expected.I am on lesson 6 of 10 after 2 weeks. I don't know the expected amount of time per lesson but I end up listening to each one 3 to 4 times before moving on.If you have never learned a language or this is your 10th, Pimsleur is really easy to use.As the other have mentioned it would be nice if there was a comprhensive Thai."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough to start","review":"First of all, Thai is in my opinion, an incredibly difficult language to learn. But Pimsleur does an excellent job of explaining the different tones and giving practice with them. And the subject material was relevant: (How are you? I would like something to drink, I can speak Thai a little, etc.) The only negative thing I have to say is that I wish they would have spent more time on numbers and the buying/selling process; since I spent alot of time haggling with the local merchants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Program - Lacks Basics in the Beginning","review":"After completing lessons 1-11 they still had not covered basics like \\"how are you\\", \\"my name is\\", numbers 1-10, \\"how much is this\\", etc.As the other reviewers state the way that these cd's are structured and build from lesson to lesson is great. I like doing them, they're not boring, and the way they remind you of recent lessons really helps you remember.But -if you won't complete them all before going to Thailand you will need another short CD of basics.I'm surprised that this wasn't mentioned in the reviews, but as other reviewers mention many of the reviews for this item are actually about a different set of cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective teaching/learning method, but....","review":"The 10 lesson Pimsleur Thai is pretty good. The teaching/learning method is very effective and fast - Just make sure you follow their recommendations (be relaxed, alert & fresh and dont attempt more than 1 lession per day, make sure you do a lesson each day).There are two comments I would like to make:(1.) The 10 lessons don't cover a great deal, but they do give you some very useful language 'mechanics' that you can use to construct other basic sentences. It would be good to have maybe 30 lessons.(2.) The emphasis is on \\"Try to say X...\\" and then you say it. This is good, but needs to be balanced with listening exercises as well ie. \\"What is Jim saying?\\", then you listen and translate back to English.It is still worth the money. My Thai friends were impressed by the speed at which I picked up these basics. That is due to the teaching method."},{"rating":"2","title":"a gratifying read","review":"There is much to be said for this account of Aaron Smith's harrowing experience among pirates who terrorized the seas during the early nineteenth century. Captured and forced to work as their navigator, Aaron walks the reader through his daily activities and the many thoughts and feelings that he experienced during his ordeal. His observations, internal and external, are keen. His descriptions seem winningly quaint, the way only true historical writing can. He also provokes the willing reader to examine a very uncomfortable and 'timeless' truth: if a captive does not placate his criminal tormentors, he will be killed; if he placates them too much, he may be identified with them and tried as an accomplice when rescued (apprehended?) Mr Smith takes us to scary places in both his world and ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"not alot for the champions","review":"Note to the producers. Usually the people who buy these sorts of things are the winning teams fans who want it for their collection.

You might want to have some content on their games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give the film a break!","review":"I do not own the DVD, saw it last night on HBO, and thought of going online and buying it to watch it with my family, huge Italy fans. Remember this was one whole month of the worlds finest teams playing against each other, so trying to squeeze all that soccer into a 2hr film would definitely result in a lot of things being left out.

Go Italy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yellow card","review":"Michael Apted's film of the 2006 World Cup Finals is bizarre because it doesn't include footage of the two best goals of the tournament (Joe Cole for England against Sweden and Maxi Rodriguez for Argentina against Mexico). Also, there is extensive video of matches that were dull while no footage of the best match of the tournament, France's victory over Brazil, is included. Zidane's performance against Brazil, where he almost singlehandedly controlled the entire match, is where he demonstrated that he is one of the greatest players of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did they leave out the best stuff in the tournament?","review":"How can you miss the signature play of the Tournament? Maxi Rodriguez goal of the tournament was no where to be found, instead they spent wayyyyyyyyyyyy to much time on other games. This video was poorly crafted, the narration was slim, and there was too much dead air. I watched all the games, I didn't need to see them again in their entirety. What I needed was a summary of the tournament from the group stage through the elimination rounds. Many elimination games were missed and that was just sad. Fifa should take a hard look at this video and create another disk of highlights to cover the ones that were missed. A prequel is in order.Oh and by the way, I don't need to see EVERY yellow card in the Portugal / Netherlands game. Come on.

Brosnan's narration was banal, insipid, completely scripted and rendered in a state of boredom... he must have really needed to pay some bills to agree to put his name to this wretched production. It was produced by Sony, who couldn't, it seemed, care less about how to make a soccer/football compilation.the gold standard for these type of films is set by Reedswain, and this falls so far short, I should have demanded my money back as soon as viewed it (actually, as soon as I viewed the first half of it)... don't bother, there are other good ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"The FIFA 2006 World Cup Film","review":"I cannot watch the product I bought, because I think it is produced only for the non European market.

It is difficult to understand how such a exciting sports event could produce such an underwhelming product.The commentary is sparse to say the least. Almost all actions (literally) are not commented at all, and often you have no clue about who the players are (unless you are a true expert...). There is close to no soundtrack. Most of the action is filmed from a really annoying low angle that makes it almost impossible to appreciate depth of field. About 20% of the movie shows unmemorable actions. Some of the best goals of the tournament are not shown at all, and some non-memorable matches are given way more time than they deserve. An example: we have to see ALL the innumerable yellow and red cards of Netherland-Portugal.It is hard to understand how FIFA could produce such a sub-par product. You can find much more exciting extracts on YouTube. Really not recommended, not even (or maybe especially) if you are a soccer fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I loved this dvd, in fact I watched it tonight just because of how great it is. The footage is very clear HD and they seemed to have caught every great play from all the best possible angles. Its a beautiful and minimalist representation of the 2006 World Cup. Pierce Brosnan's narration is very short and rare...only commenting on a few plays when needed. Its unbiased and shows everything that I could want to have seen/remembered from the World Cup. The final game may not have been the full footage as some might expect but I have a dvd for that.I simply love it. great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not seeing most of the goals is frustrating","review":"I am a little bit upset about not seeing many of the goals scored in the tournament.

This means the threads were not rolled on to the screw in the threading roller. Using the picture on the box for assembly there is no way the spikes can reach the soil due to positioning of the wheels. With the wheels removed full penetration appears to be achievable.

The basis for the story is two wizards placing a bet on the barbarian's survival. Eventually, the bet comes back to haunt them and they, in addition to Sunbright and his newfound companion Greenwillow, must try to right the wrongs caused by the bet.Creatures abound in this one -- dragons, pit fiends, hordes of Nine Hells creatures, etc. It's a fun read, but don't look for much character development.

Beautiful for a Rainy or Snowy Saturday afternoon with a bowl of Popcorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Improbable","review":"This movie isn't really that bad, but there are too many improbable and doubtful aspects in it. For one thing Tracey plays Wagner's brother, although he looks more like his granfather (when this film was made Wagner was 26 and Tracey was 56 and looked 20 years older). Also, the feats of physical endurance are so overdone to seem almost ludicrous, even for a nineteen fifties film. The ending was OK, but I couldn't figure out why Tracey's character would bother claiming the looting of the airplane as his doing to save his brother's reputation (since they were the only two up on the mountain he could have just not mentioned it at all). But despite all these faults, the movie isn't that bad.

While many just seem to teeter on confusion while attempting to find a concrete resolve to their poetic disadvantage, some simply put pornography to verse. Contemporary or not, poetry should be respected. Not slaughtered.There are a few poems sitting with me still (check out Brett Axel, Tatiana Sanchez, Magnus Johansson, and Kerry Iona Dempster).

As a good source of information on the runes of the ancient Germanic peoples it is a total flop.Von List made much of his interpretations of the meanings of the runes out of whole cloth. He lists eighteen runes as his futhork (which we know never existed before his writings) based on the eighteen runic formulas within the Havamal. As we have discovered since (and was probably known in his time) these eighteen stanzas in the Havamal are not associated to just one rune, but to a series of \\"bind-rune.\\"If you are looking for a piece of history, I highly recomend this book.

She's completely self-centered and shallow, can't be bothered to think of tomorrow, and is happily living off her rich uncle's hefty allowance.I enjoyed the first third of the book when I found Sally Jay's silly and immoral lifestyle somewhat interesting, but as the book wore on, it became a chore to finish. She's a pretty unlikable (if not odious) character, sounding more like forty or fifty than twenty, and the way she just floats from adventure to adventure seemed not only irresponsible and pointless, but sad.I can assume this was quite shocking when it was published in 1958, but by now it's all been done before and better by the likes of Bridget Jones.

The main character had such a 'pop' to her that she was instantly relatable, and as I got older, I never forgot this book.

Our heroine, Sally Jay Gorce, is totally clueless in a sad sort of way. And although I suspect her flip dismissal of a near-rape is a relic of the time, I just couldn't pass over it as lightly as she did.

It's written in a chatty, breathless tone, which was entertaining at first. But about a hundred pages in, the chattiness became almost senseless, irritating babbling. It would have been a better book had the narrator interspersed her story with some witty insights; but sadly, she's not bright enough for that. Sally Jay has a few genuinely funny moments in this novel (the disastrous dinner with Teddy, Larry, the Comtessa, and cousin John comes to mind), but they come at the expense of the other, lesser characters, who become caricatures as portrayed by the narrator.

Salinger himself can seem slightly dated nowadays, in that his language belongs to a specific period in cultural history, and this book is dated as well, with the added detriment that it is not Salinger. It's not a bad book per se, but rather is a good example of what a young author, having read Salinger, would like to produce in perhaps too great and enthralled response.

Really like Treat Williams in the title roll, but would have loved to see Tom Berenger in more than just the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUCKS!","review":"This movie is one of the worst in cinema history. Not only is the acting awful and it has a banal plot, it is another U.S propaganda, a story of a fearless american x-soldier who goes into a violent school, beats the gangbangers there, a beautifull woman- teacher of the school falls in love with him, the school guard-former soldier too-likes him and helps him immediately(in exchange of a toy the teacher gives him for the collection he makes with souvenirs fron the vietnam war!). It's a film which disgustingly disses the gangs,although the gangs are a side-effect of U.S system and one shouldn't put the blame on them, an untrue demonstration of reality, a so in-your-face projection of the perfect american hero much far from reality that it underestimates our brains. I'm disappointed that Guru accepted to participate in a film clearly propagandistic"},{"rating":"1","title":"A vacuum of the brain","review":"This movie was so bad that I felt that brain cells were dying every minute that I actually payed attention to it. Horrid acting, from \\"who were those guys\\"? This is a sad sequel to a great first movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MEMORIES!","review":"I remember watching these Spiderman episodes as a kid when they originally came out, and they really bring back some great momories. My two little girls love them! The color and transfer quality look superb on my HDTV plasma. I noticed that some of the later episodes were NOT cleaned up, however, as a few people already mentioned. The sound was also very rough on some random episodes that were not cleaned up - maybe they were locked in the vaults too tight! My only other critique is that through the menuing system that was set up, you are forced to watch the episodes continiously as they run together, even if you pick out one single episode (they just keep going from there). The packaging was FIRST CLASS, and befitting a collectors set such as this. All in all, a great set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad animation but a great series with good stories","review":"The animation is ancient, laughable, almost impossible to look at at times. But you know what? It was still good ol' Spidey, the way you knew him. The stories were good classic stories without all the junk that was written in the 1990's. I highly recommend this as it shows the roots of a classic superhero cartoon and the stories which made him timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real Spider-Man cartoon","review":"FINALLY!!! After only being able to see parts of this series on DVD with the new Spider-Man cartoons it is about time they released the whole series. That is why I am giving this boxed set sight unseen 5 stars. It has nostagalic valued for some of us. Remembering when we were kids watching it and the original Fantastic 4 cartoon (maybe they can bring the 60's FF show out on DVD too.) on Saturday morning TV in the 60's. Yes kids Saturday morning used to be the time when children would watch cartoons till the afternoon. Now it is just for local news.

WHEN I WATCH MY COPIES, THE PICTURE IS JUMPY AND UNSTABLE AT TIMES, ALMOST LIKE A VHS TAPE WHEN THE TRACKING IS NOT PROPERLY ADJUSTED. I HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT AT TIME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE PICTURE SEEMS TO LIGHTEN AND DARKEN, FADING IN AND OUT. I HAVE VIEWED THESE DVDS ON OTHER PEOPLE'S PLAYERS AND T.V.'S AND HAVE NOTICED THE SAME THING! I KNOW IT'S NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE HARDWARE, IT MUST BE THE DVDS. HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD ANY PROBLEMS?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ORIGINAL CLASSIC SPIDER-MAN CARTOON!","review":"Anyone old enough to remember this classic cartoon has fond memories of it! Even with the static animation and multi-used action shots, it's better than any newer version of this iconic super hero. What I remembered most about it, was the hip, swinging music soundtrack and the fact that the characters look like they did in the comic book. This DVD set will let you relive those wonderful times in spades! The 6 disc collection has every episode on it and most of them have been remastered to look pretty darn good! So put on your favorite jammies, grab the Cocoa Puffs and get ready for a blast from the past!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Spiderman.","review":"If you remember watching the classic Spiderman cartoons after school growing up and loved it, you have got to get this DVD set. The animation seems a bit low budget compared to today, but most of it is really great. The old 60s style music and great characters make watching these great fun all over again. My four-year old son loves to watch these with me. If you're a fan of the old series, this is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"less than a buck per cartoon","review":"Nostalgia rules.

Yes, the episodes where spidey goes underground and swings past the same stalactite 47 times in a row is there, but hey,nothing a sugar rush can't make you ignore.The quality is there visually but I believe the way the box set is built (slim cases taped together) will soon cause it to fall apart.

Simply put, this show has alot in common with shows like Speed Racer and Gigantor. If you grew up watching it, you know the animation is rough but the stories are excellent fun. I've read others' reviews here who say their kids don't like it. Well, sorry, but this show wasn't made for their kids. The same way I won't listen to rap, I don't expect today's kids to get it. This show has too much charm and is too upbeat to be understood by today's society that likes dark, serious moods. This is why I will sum this review up by simply saying, if you are in your 40s or 50s, and grew up watching this show, it's as great today as it was back then. However, if you buy this set with the intentions of having your kids like it...Well, do you like rap, or Britney? See what I mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"SPIDER-MAN 1967 Cartoon Still A Classic!","review":"Greetings, I just watched the Spider-Man 67\\" Collection episodes and I was blown away. They are exactly as I remembered them when I was a kid. In fact, they are actually better since they are digitally remastered and the color is enhanced. Nothing at all was changed from the opening credits to the closing credits. If you want to relive those days gone by and bring back those childhood memories this collector set is a must. I knew one day it would be released in my lifetime. I love it so much I am buying another set just to put on the collector shelf! This is definitely a must buy. Get em while they last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not so great","review":"I don't like it because it is old fashioned. It has no violence, scary scenes, or bad language.

Sadly , it holds 10 episodes . It still may suffice as background noise, however, if you wished , but I think even big Spidey fans would have difficulty calling these even slightly decent.That said , however, this is still a good set if you enjoy Spiderman . The voices are well cast and there is enough entertainment in the remaining episodes to warrant a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched Discs","review":"The show is good, but the packaging of the discs leave the discs scratched. I ordered this item and 4 out of 6 discs were scratched. I returned and received another through amazon and 3 out of 6 discs were scratched. This is not amazon's fault, this is the manufactures poor quality of how the disc rests in it's case. Where the disc lays there is a small pimple bubble when creating the disc rest so when via shipment the disc slides on it and scratches. I bought this dvd again at Costco and the same issue, 4 out of 6 discs were scratched.The show is great for a collection though, unfortunately the manufacturer produced poor quality packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some bloopers to watch out for!","review":"I loved these cartoons as a kid. A lot were on the Wee Willie Webber show in Philadelphia. As an adult I can see so many flaws. I'll list them for your amusement.1) The store in the opening scenes is first seen as JEWLERY (no typo by me) store...in the next swing by it is spelled correctly as JEWELRY.2) Unless spiderman has several suits and changed them in mid flight there were many errors in continuity. The spider on his back (looks more like a tic) sometimes had six legs, sometimes eight...in some very long shots, 4.The spider on his chest was sometimes the same as on his back, or a more spidery-looking version.3) In many episodes, Spiderman would see trouble at Point A, change into his suit, swing all the way through New York to arrive at Point A again???4) Many scenes were borrowed from other episodes and thrown in making you think you saw that episode before. ex:mole people episodes.I guess this is why cartoons were meant for kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Spider-Man DVD Set Ever!","review":"This DVD set is amazing. It has all 52 classic Spider-Man episodes. With the cool booklet as well. Almost 20 hours of Classic Spider-Man. This is perfect for all ages and this is a must have for all Spider-Man fans.

When she first saw Spider-Man swinging through the city on his web line, she gasped \\"Wow!\\" and wished she could do it too. Not as fast-paced and engaging as newer superhero cartoons like Kim Possible and Teen Titans (both recommended), but also less violent, still good for this age group. I enjoyed these cartoons as a kid too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Collector's Item","review":"Wow, do these DVD's bring back memories.

I have watched it several times and my only critisism is that I find myself screaming at the screen, \\"Get over yourselves\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"This movie was awful. I kept watching it because I thought eventually it was going to get better but it never did. The plot: two men abandon their wives and children to find themselves, but really all they are doing is chasing young women in the tropics. They carry on a \\"three-some\\" relationship with one woman. One guy continues travelling, the other finally goes home to his family but in all his arrogance suggests to his wife she's lucky to have him home for as long as he stays.

Can someone please help me figure this one out!?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected.","review":"I liked this movie better as it went along. I, too, am not very happy with the way my life has gone. I guess that if you are self-satisfied, then you probably won't like this movie. But being who I am and where I have been in my life, it touched me deeply, particularly with its mournful Leonard Cohen songs in the background and its sad twist at the end. I strongly disagree with the reviewer who thought the presence of Terence Stamp's Buddhist monk and the story line of the building of the tower were extraneous. I see this story as the two main characters' search for an earthly nirvana, and the tower is a literal construction evoking the movie's title. I bought this movie because I am a big fan of Billy Petersen, and he gives really fine performance here, worth an extra star. (But I'm so glad that he's keeping his clothes on in his current role as CBS's top CSI, Gil Grissom.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little clunky, but interesting nonetheless.","review":"Yes, this could be described as a cinematic exploration of male midlife crisis. Yes, it is very difficult to explore deep philosophical ramblings with any great success in a popular film format. And yet. Somehow, I found myself caught up in the story, predictable as it might have seemed. Excellent performances, sometimes riveting dialog, wonderful soundtrack, beautiful locations... and a sexual threesome thrown in for good measure.Definitely worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few times played","review":"Seemed excited when she opened the box, but as far as I can tell, my daughter has not played this game much.

There is a lack of attention to detail in the way things fit together.My biggest gripe is the the alignment hole that the guide plate fits into is not perpendiclar to the belt and the disc.Which means you need to adjust the screws on the bottom of the plate whenever you change from belt to disk.Then the 4 holes for the dust scoop do not align with the 4 threaded mounting holes.In this modern age of CNC machining, one would think this would be a simple task.The unit is made in Tiawan, but smacks of early Chinese lack of quality.So far it has sanded well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice company to dinner","review":"Estupendo concierto para disfrutarlo solo o con amigos .

While watching this DVD, I tried imagining Ms. Krall as a Seattle grunge rocker, and I'm just so happy that she took the musical road that she did.Compared to some recent recordings, her piano gets a showcase role, especially in the first part of the set. Everything is spot-on, perfect, sometimes TOO perfect. If I have a criticism, it is that Ms. Krall rarely takes chances musically. Her arrangements are all immaculate, but sometimes I would trade a little polish for a little spontaneity.Please don't misunderstand: this is a beautiful recording - better than her last few CDs, and well worth owning. She's plays tasty piano and her vocals are great. I just wish she would let it rip sometimes, the way she does in \\"I Don't Know Enough About You\\".But this is the complaint of someone who still loves this recording. The reason I give it 4 stars is that I can't give it 4 1/2. Worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performances by All","review":"I really bought this DVD to see Anthony Wilson play, even though I have heard Diana, I wasn't moved to buy any of her CD's. I am now. The swinging, up-tempo tunes swung hard and the ballads were...well, beautiful. Anthony and his blonde Byrdland just kills it with tone, taste, and hyper-swing. All the musicians are world class players and none disappointed, all can REALLY jam. Usually I'll buy a DVD and have my finger on the search or fast forward button, replaying the \\"good\\" parts. Almost all of this is the \\"good parts\\". Maybe just a little of it made me want to ride the elevator when the violins came in, but over all this is one of the best DVD's that I've ever bought.

This is the way music should be enjoyed! The Dolby Digital 5.1 track is stunning, the clarity and depth are wonderful. The camera work is equally brilliant, always focusing on the musicians' talent.Ms. Krall's performance is an impossible combination of polished perfection and down-to-earth personability - nightclub intimacy with the grandeur of a large scale concert.This is a must-have, no questions needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Got Her Under My Skin","review":"The performance is spectacular...I can't stop playing the dvd. The song selection is right on the money. The photography is probably the best I've seen in terms of live perfomances. My only disappointment is the sound quality. Before I go any further let me tell you that I played it through my large screen TV in stereo mode. Very soon, however, I will hook up my newly purchased Sonus Faber Concertinos where I am sure that I will get a much better sound..in stereo mode.

That's jazz but I did find it very pleasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good DVD","review":"Very good item. DVD received in time and in good conditions. Recommended for those who love vocal Jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz singer goes mellow","review":"There aren't very many music concert DVDs available playing standards rather than rock and other contemporary music. The best part of this record are Krall's five backup musicians. They are excellent, especially Anthony Wilson on the guitar. Diane Krall's singing and piano are very good too, but the selection of songs was on the slow and draggy side. All in all, this is the best DVD of popular standards that we have ever found.

Her choice of tunes was appealing, with most of them being old favorites - but presented with silky smooth new arrangements.The whole performance was enhanced by the caliber of her supporting group.Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"This is an amazing live concert - I didn't realize before how good a pianist that Diana Krall is - very tasty licks - the group of jazz all stars with her are great and the orchestra really brings nice support to the concert.I think my favorite is Bacharach's \\"The Look of Love\\" and this is performed live and included in a music video in the extras.Looks and sounds pristine (any chance for a Blu-ray version for us?)You will love this DVD - everyone that came over during the holidays commented how much they liked this concert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding showcase","review":"Diana does great with all the members of the band, great production with good takes from the musicians and a very great atmosphere in the Olympia at Paris, Diana makes his best in artistry, I recomend this DVD if you like good, but I really mean good jazz!!!, a production that we don't see very often in this days, the sound quality is great with DTS encoding, also does justice in stereo mode, really a masterpiece of contemporary days with excellent quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like being at a concert.","review":"Overall this movie is excellent and a visual treat, like most reviewers say. I have all of Diana Krall's audio recordings (CD's) and thus cannot help comparing her singing and musical backup with her earlier audios. Musically the audio records are in better form and voice than this live concert. They probably should not be compared however; a live concert movie is an event by itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krall is Great - VIdeo on Demand Version of this DVD Isn't","review":"Had I been paying closer attention, I would have noticed that the amazon video on demand version of this excellent performance was 60 minutes, as opposed to the 130 minute listed running time of the DVD.

The musicianship is top notch. Her drummer and bass player are her heart and soul, her keyboard interpretations are good night club fare. As for Diana Krall's singing, she essentially does the same song in different keys with different melodies-- her breathy style and limited range work well for the torch tunes but some of the spunkier standards demand more... something. After about 7 or 8 tunes, I'm pretty much done with her. But, this is an excellent sounding DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana Krall - Live in Paris DVD","review":"I watched and listened to this again last night and was emotionally moved as always by the incredible talent of Diana Krall. \\"Maybe you'll be there\\" and \\"I've got you under my skin\\" performances are nothing short of genius.

It frequently disconnects even when no one is touching it. Anyway, the drive doesn't load up and continually clicks or it freezes after booting Windows. As a result, I need to use their old cable until I can find a replacement.Final note: I would suggest buying a cable with two USB cables at one end or the Y-cables as these are made to provide enough power.

He's very creative and dynamic in person; unfortunately none of that translated into this film. The idea for the story isn't bad, but the plot and dialogue are almost never funny. I might have smiled a couple of times. Mainly I was bored because I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters. None of this was cutting edge. None of it was original."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Ever Made? Perhaps.","review":"There is nothing to like about this movie. The plot is idiotic, the characters are not even one-dimensional, the acting is low caliber, the soundtrack is like torture, and it is not funny. This is not even a movie you love to hate. This is a movie to simply hate. Picture the result if you were to give a group of not particularly bright high school kids a camera with the instructions to shoot a movie by the end of the week.

I didn't know what to think, but I saw it again and fell in love. This film whether or not you hate it; makes valid points throughout the film. One of the quotes is \\"Family is another word for censorship.\\" I love family films but I agree with the statement. Does the MPAA rate movies correctly, sense the late sixties they have been bestowed privileges to rate movies. With all that aside its a brilliant film, some parts are disgusting and may be too crude for younger viewers. For the most part \\"Cecil B. Demented\\" is an \\"A\\" class film, in this critics mind. I suggest renting the movie first or finding a friend with good taste to watch the movie before purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melanie Griffith's Finest Moment","review":"The cinematic pairing of John Waters and Melanie Griffith is a match that has been waiting to happen- the master director of \\"Pink Flamingos\\" and \\"Desperate Living\\" presents the mainstream actress a role of a lifetime and shows what a hilarious actress she really is. The premise of terrorist fimmakers naking their own underground film with a kidnapped mainstream actress not sounds outrageous, it kind of makes sense in a film community delivering products based on computer games or sequels to films that weren't very good to begin with. John Waters reminds us all that there was once a blossoming underground film industry,and Griffith reminds us that not every actor has to win an oscar to be cool. Stephen Dorf also makes an indelible impression in title role, and it's great to see cameos (although they are not long enough for my liking) of legendary dreamlanders Mary Vivian Pearce and Susan Lowe. In my book, an instant classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demented movie makers","review":"This film is not so bad that it's funny. This is so bad that it's terrible. Aimed at 14-year old males, hung up on masturbation, in love with four letter words, and needing a lot of action every three minutes, the movie fails to be entertaining, enlightening, or even credible. It's soft porn for the masses. It's a clinic on bad acting and witless direction.I watched this miserable flick on the Independent Film Channel the other evening, again marveling at the lack of quality programming those people come up with. If this is what film has come to in our time, we are sinking faster than anyone imagines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage still smells like stank the next morning.","review":"I know that if my garbage can is lined with a scented bag, the insides still reak of yuck.

Demented. I understand that my foulness of this horrible film will be a flame war for those avant-garde, art house, belly churning, curtled milk type, Grindhouse-praising 'as-if-it's-the-next greatest-thing-to-sliced-bread' groupies, however if you are a die hard john waters fan, what's there not to love??

THERE IS A REASON THIS MOVIE WENT STRAIGHT TO VIDEO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen & John Waters Rock!","review":"Stephen rocks in this movie and that's good to see compared to his latest unsuccessful releases. He's demented and devilishly sexy just the way he needs to be. His portrayal of Cecil will not only have you laughing your head off but you'll find yourself impatient to see what happens next. He leaves the entire cast in the dust except for Alicia Witt who put in an equally interesting and terrific performance as Cecil's pornstar girlfriend Cherish. Stephen brings charm to this role and it will remind his true fans of his role as Deacon Frost in terms of sexuality and creativity. Stephen is a gifted actor and though Cecil B. Demented isn't the best movie at times, it's Cecil himself that carries it along. Definitely the best John Waters flick too and I definitely think Stephen and John should reunite in the future.

But what did we need this poor effort for? This record was obviously recorded in a hurry because it really is dreadful. The lyrics are less than a-not-very-good nursery rhyme, the vocals are often horrible and the track listing and production disastrous. \\"Deepest Of Hearts\\" must be the most ridiculous song ever recorded and attempts to recreate the dance fever of \\"La da dee\\", such as \\"Surprise\\" and \\"Good Lovin\\" give you nothing but a headache.

This is a role-playing game, where you are Pepper, a Lego kid on Lego Island. Basically the point of the game is to walk around the island talking to the Lego people who send you on tasks and give you various things for your work. Such things as items, Lego pieces and trading cards, which hold no importance, its just a picture of a Lego character. Also, you can discover mini games, like a Lego skate park, Joust and a few classic arcade games that are fun. For the older more cynical gamers, avoid this game, but if you are a parent that wants a game that inadvertently teaches your child about good citizenship and being kind to others, pick this up.

So I was really happy to find out this game came out on PS2...I liked the game, but there was to much loading, it drives you crazy! So why do you think the all powerful Xbox will be any better? It will have as much loading as the PS2 version. So save your money and wait for it to come out on GameCube, which is the fastest loading new system availble.If you don't have GameCube then get this(and edure the long loading), or sell your Xbox and get the best system out, Nintendo GameCube."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll give you the real facts about this game.","review":"Crash is a game where the goal is basiclly to get through each level and defeat the bosses. The graphics are a little better than the ps2 version. Also there are 30 levels and many vehicles to controll. After you defeat the fifth boss you could try getting all the gems and relics. That's what makes the game more interesting and last longer. Plus the loading times are much faster. So if you're an old Crash fan this addition to the series should be quite fun especially because you can play Coco fully, not just on vehicles and because of the new vehicles Crash can controll. If this is your first time and you like games with simple rules yet are fun and challenging(Not to challenging to [upset] you..., yet not to easy to get you bored), then get this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, Fun, Family Game","review":"Crash is almost a must-have on the Xbox.It's fun for everyone in the family (my 7 year old played it without a problem - but younger kids may not be able to).

There's almost no learning curve.It's just plain old fun!If you liked Fuzion Frenzy, and you don't mind single player games, then you'll like Crash.Some complain that it's graphics aren't breakthrough - but they are certainly sufficient for you to clearly see what is going on.The only real complaint: I wish there were a 2 player mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash Bandicoot The Wrath Of Cortex is the colest game ever","review":"...This game is real cool the graphics are great,sometimes the camera angles trick you but you can hadle it right?Another thing is crash gets to ride cool vehicles from a crop duster to a giant robot suit.You can also use crash's sister coco in some levels and control her like crash.Some levels are frustrating and are hard to pass.Crash gets one new power tiptoeing so that nitro boxes that explode if you make sound wont blow up.Now I will tell you neo cortex'es scheme he makes a strong bandicoot named crunch powered by the evil masks of water,fire,earth,and wind.I tell you you should get this game it's really cool...you will have a lot of fun I promise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ew","review":"I got this game with an Xbox a long while ago.

There aren't many frills and the graphics are a few steps above N64 but the camera angle and controls are fairly easy to master. There isn't a two player mode (which would make the game better). You can save after every level that's a plus, and there is crashes sister(?) Who you get to play some levels with.

We all loved and appreciated Bob and the people with him. This DVD will only give one a very brief look at his performances. Apparently this is a copy of his tour that was edited for release to the TV audience and trying to get 8-10 stops in to an hour was just too much to be really good.

Then the problems began, I am now in the fourth call with technical support, over an hour so far among the three calls. There is apparently an unresolved problem in using the Mind Station with a cable modem and perhaps other parameters of my system. I have used the Mind Station with a dial-up connection on someone else's system and it worked fine. The problem has been turned over to engineering but I have yet to hear from them.My conclusion - as a stand-alone Turbo Twist Spelling is okay but lacks the customization that really connects it with the child's school environment. If you have a dial-up connection that you can use for the Mind Station, you will probably be satisfied.

And like SNL (during the \\"bad years\\") many sketches don't know when to stop and run out of steam before the creative and surreal transition to the next one.

Bob and David have put together a collection of comedy skits you could never see on SNL or any other network TV station. Only on HBO could you possibly find Mr. Show, which pokes fun at rednecks, Catholics, British, battered wives, African-Americans, homosexuals, drug addicts, senior citizens, musicians, and politicans all on the first disc alone. It's controversial and highly offensive, and I loved every minute of it. For those who are easily offended, you're better off sticking with the network stuff that is tightly regulated by the FCC so as not to hurt your feelings.

While it is slightly better than SNL (Bob Odenkirk, the co-creator of this series, rarely got any of his sketches on the air while he toiled at SNL, so this show was the result), it still isn't particularly funny. The only sketches I liked were the \\"burger\\" commercial in Season One, the Iguana sketch (Odenkirk plays an Iguana very well), and the Jesus Christ Superstar parody is really good (though not particularly funny...just well shot and edited, it feels almost like a tribute). But other sketches drag on and on (particularly the infomercial parody), and many feel forced. The repartee between Cross and Odenkirk doesn't really work well either. I tried to get into this show, but just couldn't. Sorry..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its alright","review":"I bought this due to reviews and word of mouth. A few of the sketches are hilarious. The rest I watched without so much as a smile. from what I hear, all the good stuff is in the third and fourth seasons. So buy this so they will put out the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 3 just announced!","review":"Mr Show, possibly the finest comedy series out there, is finally letting its fans sink its teeth into the dvd version of SEASON THREE! I've been watching the third and fourth seasons (by far the funniest) on my pc for a while now and happy to learn that I can stop squinting at my monitor and finally catch them on the big screen. Halleluiah! Now if they'd just announce season four...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Show","review":"This is probably one of the most over looked and hilarious television shows of the 1990s - if you find yourself questioning what the rest of America finds so funny about Full House, when shows like the Ben Stiller Show and Get a Life get cancelled, than do yourself a favor and buy this dvd! Commentaries for each episode are almost as hilarious as the episodes themselves -I guarantee more laughs on one episode than on the entire run of Suddenly Susan. Buy this DVD now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still holds up","review":"Not many shows hold up when you see them years later. This is one of the exceptions. Great episodes. High quality. No complaints what-so-ever. MR.SHOW is one of those wry pieces of humor that worked...much like the book THE DISTURBED WRITINGS OF ADAM COCHRAN or the movie THIS IS SPINAL TAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE","review":"As someone who has personally spent a lot of time both watching and writing comedy, I can say that, without a doubt, this is the best-written and most well-performed sketch comedy of all time. All of the writers are fantastic, Bob and David are an unbelievably well-constructed comic duo, and the supporting cast (most especially the absolutely brilliant husband and wife pair of Tom Kenney and Jill Talley) are out of this world (and all seem to be having a good time with cameos this summer. Look for John Ennis in Eight Legged Freaks and Jay Johnston in Men In Black and Tom Kenney is the Professor and Narrator of Power Puffs).All in all a very well-timed DVD to own (you will definitely want to see the shows live tour and currently shelved movie Run Ronnie Run after watching it. And you will understand why EVERYONE is talking about these guys). You will be a big gushy fan within hours of getting this DVD!Buy this. Then buy Wet Hot American Summer. You'll own everything that is funny. Ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny!","review":"A friend told me I should check this out, so I did. It's really good! Bob and David move seamlessly between live (in front of an audience) and taped segments. I knew this model would work well when in the first episode they were on stage and talking to different versions of themselves in the audience. Definitely a unique model of television. Highly recommended if you like sketch comedy and mild ridiculousness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Show First Season - Alternative Funny!!","review":"Not laugh out loud in many places, but brilliant with regards to what I would call \\"cerebral\\" humour. Very interesting and provocative. Plus, you get to see early footage of the dawning careers of Jack Black, Jeanine Garofalo, and of course, David Cross & Bob Odenkirk. Was hoping to see some of David's stand up stuff in video form but was happy to see the infamous Ronnie Dobbs' entrance into comedy reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good media to make life long references to...","review":"It took me a few weeks after watching the original Mr. Show (when it was actually on HBO) to refer to the various skits on there and laugh. It just grows on ya. It got to the point where a was totally out of control laughing after about the 7th time watching some of the skits. One has to kind of slide into the style of these guys. They're not politically correct and may offend someone...somewhere....I guess. It's worth watching though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Show: The Complete First and Second Season","review":"I usually laugh at just about anything. I even liked \\"Joe vs. the Volcano\\" and \\"Tenacious D.\\" This was the rare occasion that I did not laugh at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Show Has A Television Show for DVD","review":"Well finally make it happen! Mr. Show becomes a DVD, to show you all of its episodes. First Season, also Second. All of great skits that one has become to love have on this DVD.For those who have not enjoy Mr. Show, contain much jokes. It have itself some of the funnier jokes on television in many decades. Take yourself for example the poop jokes. Take it a funny time for TWO!Some much people are to have enjoy Mr. Show. I take sometime an episode to myself for a watch episode. Makes itself one for a laugh, especially for me. That makes a good deal for price, especially with two episode.Two season? Be forget it for a great deal of itself.Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah!","review":"Horrible. Oh, Dear Lord, Mr. Show is absolutely horrible. It is like all of the worst, most un-funny Saturday Night Live sketches strung together. And we're hip. Mildly drunk, but hip ...it was so bad my head hurts. No really. I kept trying to pretend it was funny because I was told that it was supposed to be. My husband, on the other hand, just held his head and sobbed like a little girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST BUY","review":"Mr. Show is a must for any DVD collection. If you have a brain and love to be politically incorrect, you'll love this. \\"What to Think\\" is the best episode on the DVD, especially the GloboChem skit. I cannot wait for the rest of the seasons to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very encouraging","review":"I'm with the last reviewer. This devotional is more discouraging than anything. It is also full of \\"shoulds\\" for people going through infertility and made me feel guilty for feeling sad and upset. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone seeking encouragement or a salve for their soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"encouraging devotionals!","review":"Wonderful book to read when you need to pick up some encouragement, hope and even humor on the subject! Devotional format is great when you are looking for encouragment and comfort. It is like picking up a hot cup of tea to soothe your soul. Wonderful for someone going through infertility, as well as anyone wanting to learn how to support/understand someone going through infertility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call us to praise with energy and rejoice","review":"I bought this album more than thirty years ago. It was fantastic at that time. More incredible yet is that after all this years the music still sound very modern and all that work done to complete it, amazing. I love specially \\"All creatures of Our God and King\\", beside others tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rape and Stockholm Syndrome on road to romance?","review":"There aren't many words to describe this book. It had the makings of a great story which quickly degraded to kidnapping and rape of the heroine by the 'hero'. These rape scenes were described in meticulous detail, all with the heroine succumbing to the charms and wiles of the hero. And of course, she 'falls' for him. All I could think of was this writer had a major bondage issue and fantasized about rape as an exciting way to spice up a boring love life. I'm sorry ladies, but there is nothing spicy, exciting or fulfilling about rape.I searched through the story and it seems that each encounter between every man and woman began with rape. Rape of young women, rape of elderly matrons, the holding of women in brothels...it defies description.I'm sorry, I won't be reading any of this author's other works. Rape is rape and it should not be enshrined in a romance story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I've read this author before. And this was one of her best books I read of hers to date. It was a long story, 500 + pages but excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reference Book","review":"FREE-LANCING: A GUIDE TO WRITING FOR MAGAZINES AND OTHER MARKETS is one of the most useful textbooks that I acquired as an undergraduate journalism student. It provides clear and understandable descriptions of types of writing (personality profiles, roundups, reviews, travel writing, etc.) as well as good tips on how to get published (marketing, querying, and submitting your work). The many sidebars give good illustrations of what to do and what NOT to do. This text is a practical and down-to-earth textbook, especially valuable for freelancers who are new to the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Rock Albums of the 1980's","review":"Without a doubt, this New York singer-songwriter is one of the great underrated rockers of our time. This album is his best since Ghostwriter (1977), another pop-rock classic that unfortunately never made it to CD from vinyl. In any event, his rock anthems on the CD like \\"R.O.C.K\\", \\"Mystery Kids\\", \\"True Confessions\\", and \\"Jump Jump\\" are as good as any by Springsteen. A rock romantic, his lyrics are timeless and classic. Playing this album - now 20 years old - one would think it was recorded in the new millenium. Fresh, smart, great rock n' roll from a largely unrecognized talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"96 Tears","review":"Late one night while searching through the cut out section in the Amazon.com web site, I stumbled upon Garland Jeffrey's \\"Escape Artist\\". I cried \\"96 Tears\\" when I found out that there were no copies avialible because Mr. Jeffrey's voice is the closest thing to Elvis Costello's that I've ever heard. His cover of the ? and the Mysterians song is one of the most gut-wretching versions I've heard in a longtime. Mr. Jeffrey also drags his listener through rough voiced songs like Mystery Kids, and Jump,Jump. The lyrics in both of these songs and the rest of the album take you back to 1980 when you had a feeling of hopelessness and lack of understanding due to the current world events. We knew music was fun and New Wave was gaining more respect in America and Mr. Jeffrey's songs put a song and a sound which was agreeable to the main stream. Find the album and become a \\"mystery kid\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape Artist - Maybe an acquired taste, but a very good one.","review":"There are a lot of musical artists that are an acquired taste. Garland is clearly an acquired tasted. If you like any of his music, then you have to have \\"Escape Artist.\\" You might find you like one of the other albums better, but this is a stunning combination of all the sophistication and the power that mark Garlands music. Rock, reggae, soul, garage, he has it all in this one place. Superbly written songs, musicanship to be awed and singing that stands up to anything in these genre's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best First Book Available on the Subject","review":"I found this book enormously helpful. It contains most of the classic recent papers on vagueness in the analytic tradition from Dummett onward, plus a little pre-history, a few small curiosities (the papers by Tye and Machina, for example, seem to have been included mostly for their novelty value, but I found them both interesting and worth the effort) and a very comprehensive introdution that covers most of the main theories of vagueness that contemporary philosophers tend to find most plausible. The issue of vagueness is slowly coming to attract the same intensity and vigor of debate that the issue of analyticity did in the 1950s and 1960s, and this makes the value of Keefe and Smith's work almost impossible to measure. If only more anthologies of recent work in philosophy were assembled this carefully and intelligently!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new, just great past stuff! Five stars for the great","review":"Maná's music and style are great but they are in the middle of their current tour; so instead of a new album we get this assemblage of past material. Though it is all prime material and a very good CD for a Maná neophyte, it does not even have one new song; which would make die-hard fans drool for it. It would have been nice if it included those Maná rarities that are found in other artists' albums; such as \\"Celoso,\\" \\"Fool in the rain,\\" and \\"Corazón espinado\\" so as to have them all in a real Maná album. For true fans this CD would not add anything to their collections so this is certainly not for the person that has all previous Maná material. If you are going to get into Maná, it is best to buy the real albums as you miss out a lot of great songs with this sampler. Nothing new, just great past stuff!

Even in the .NET world, this book will be useful. All the COM components out there today are not just going to go away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I regard the first edition of 1977 as a classic commentary on Revelation. If you already own the first edition it is not really worth upgrading to the revised edition (1997). For the scholar Mounce has been overtaken by the much larger Beale. However for the student Mounce is still one of the best commentaries available, I used Mounce more than any other commentary on Revelation I owned in the 1990's and I would recommend it.Note: Among 7 recent scholarly commentaries on Revelation Mounce is the fourth most cited author.End note: Since I wrote this review in 2000 Osborne has been published (2002) and I would now put that at the top of my list for students. However, Mounce is a good deal simpler for those studying Revelation for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Classic","review":"This is another classic video calendar, a must for the calendar collector, and it features a lot of stunning playmates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect book for children and a good lesson for adults","review":"This book is a perfect illustration on what a pure gift a child is and how innocent a child's heart can be. It teaches a few good life lessons and also incorporates a small amount of language from Ethiopia.

This book is a must have for any child regardless of color, it is just a simple yet valuable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice pictures","review":"A beautiful Ethiopian folktale.

The graphics were really beautiful, the colors bright, and the music and words were clear and enjoyable. Unlike some of the other games put together featuring Disney movies, you can see that a great deal of effort was put into making this game. I found the it to be very engrossing. Once I began playing I could not put it down and also the passwords are short and easy to remember. The only downfall of this game is that it's not very long. However it is something that you would want to play again and again. All in all the one word that describes Disney's Peter Pan Return to Neverland is Fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S BORING AND IT REALLY SUCKS","review":"The only good thing about this game are the graphics. Other than that all you'll see is a pile of crap covered in radio-active material. Almost everything about this game is really bad. The missions are laughably bad(Example: while flying, keep the children at your side or you fail the mission), the flying controls really suck, the combat is clunky and very unreliable, and characters are very annoying. Not even kids should be allowed to play this travesty unless it's a cruel punishment for doing something bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!

The Graphics are really good, but the game play just didn't appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Father's Story","review":"This book is was written by my father -- an interesting man who has lived an extraordinary life. He somehow harbors little or no hatred for Germany even after the Nazis destroyed his good life and part of his family. He seems to have made his peace by focusing on the good that some people did for Jews even during the madness of the Houlocaust. The story itself is interesting -- e.g., being a member of the Kindertrasport to England; traveling for 10 weeks on a Japanese ship from London around Cape Horn to Shanghai; living outside the Jewish ghetto in Shanghai, while his parents lived and suffered in it. Yet, my fathers' reactions to all these experiences are just as if not more interesting, and I don't think I'm saying that just because I'm a psychologist and he's my father. My father is proud of this book and the story it tells and, in my opinion, he has every right to be. - Marc Riess, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology, Middlebury College; Vermont"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welches soft fruit snacks","review":"This is the best soft fruit candy snacks I have ever had.

On their own, some of these tunes are dispensable, but the overall effect is pleasant, a whiff of nostalgia and some new pop that sounds the way candy tastes. The Time Of My Life is a terrific song, performed with emotion by Medley/Warren, and I also love Hungry Eyes, by the always-underappreciated Eric Carmen. The oldies always deserve a listen, and the Mickey/Sylvia tune gained new respect, and a new audience, via the playful scene from the film. Though Time Of My Life is essentially the radio version, and not the extended, \\"dirtier\\" mix from the film, it alone is worth having this record for; the rest are mostly additional bonuses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product was defective.

It seems that the publishers of this new edition wanted to give it the classic antique look, as it is so famous. Although the cover looks nicer than the older edition, inside it is a different story. The typeface in the inside looks like it was typed with a typewriter a century ago, and is therefore very hard to read, even to those who are familiar with Hebrew. Also, the fact that it is arranged by word root makes it harder to find the words in it.

I agree with other reviewers that BDB requires a fundamental knowledge of Hebrew. If you already have a familiarity with Hebrew, and if you enjoy deep reading of the Tanakh, BDB is an essential resource.As an example, I used BDB to research the etymology of the root \\"bet-kuf-resh\\". BDB led me on a fascinating journey that led me eventually to Psalms and the Shulchan Oruch! At the end of it I had a fair amount of good material for a devar torah.I have one reservation on BDB. As with many of the older lexicons, BDB was written before the discovery of Ugaritic (i.e., prior to 1930). Study of Ugaritic etymologies has added enormously to our knowledge of obscure Hebrew words.

The use of infra-red film disturbed my thinking process of starting from the physical appearances which should show as it is.I feel, the use of infra-red is good for sculptures and structures, not good for ground, trees and sky.

It examined Welles' career not in light of Citizen Kane but through his Shakespeare projects. This cast Welles in a very different light for me.Welles tried to make Shakespeare accessible. To him, Shakespeare should not be something in a glass case at a museum. Thus he kept shaking up the Shakespeare plays he adapted. And critics hated him for it. His film of \\"Macbeth\\" in particular got raked over the coals.The book shows how Shakespeare was regarded in American culture in the 20th Century and how Welles tried to shape that attitude. It is a slim book, but it gives the reader very much to think about in an accessible, jargon-free way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lords Of The Realm II: Siege Pack (PC)","review":"Lords Of The Realm II: Siege Pack (PC) was a pleasant surprise find for me.

Maxwell asks readers to savor his chapters on the essential qualities of a leader a little at a time. He suggests reading one chapter a day like you are taking a vitamin, to give the lessons time to sink in with practice. Each of the 21 traits he cites stems from a basic value leaders can use to guide their actions. This follow-up to Maxwell's useful 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership is a thinner book in every way, though still nicely thoughtful. We recommend it as a source of inspiration for self-growth and reflection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I bought this book on Maxwell's reputation and when it arrived it was little more than a pamphlet of cute little anecdotes you could get via email chainmail. This book appears to follow a standard format of Maxwell's and he tries to use what has worked in the past. It can't make a leader and doesn't offer substantial instruction or insights.Each chapter gives a short story that attempts to highlight the leadership quality of the chapter. Shortly thereafter a few self-examination points are discussed that nearly anyone could hvae written. This was truly useless and disappointing.At best, it may wet the appetite to go learn more from a non-Maxwell book or serve as a conversational ice breaker at professional development courses. As a stand alone tool though, it is of little value to anyone who knows anything already about leading people."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could've gained more insight from a nap.","review":"........that \\"tag\\" is actually a bit harsh on my part........this really isn't a \\"bad\\" book (i.e. one that's full of errors).....it's simply a book filled with cute little truisms that basically anyone who reads the Wall Street Journal 4 times a year already knows.Maxwell is really a \\"Christian\\" writer who writes these little overblown pamphlets. Technically, not religious or prosyletizing in nature, these little books smack of old-boyisms that are tired and have been re-hashed ad infinitum. If you're a young, junior level mid-manager, get it, read it.

Put it in your CD player, close your eyes, and feel yourself transported to Andalucia, to Seville, you can almost picture the flamenco dancers performing as you clap your hands, you can hear the gypsy guitar players... I discovered Merce on my last visit to Madrid and believe that this is one of the best flamenco albums ever. A great mixture of latin passion, traditional flamenco guitare sounds, and a modern feel as well. This is the real thing from Southern Spain, where Flamenco was invented. Great for parties, for creating atmosphere, even for learning Spanish, but perfect just for listening and letting the CD take you to Spain."},{"rating":"1","title":"While the Leor may not be awesomely enlightened, they do not need to be boringified","review":"I was feeling really uncertain about picking up this book after the last one with the Leor subplot. The thing is that they are an interesting if not particularly likeable species. I hated Lani with a passion in her earlier appearances, so while she only shows up a few times in this one, they were enough to color my entire perception of the books. Basically, by the end of the book, the writer is getting rid of all the alien 'barbaric' parts of the Leor culture. If you will allow me a nerd moment, it just like that DS9 did to the Ferengi. Ugh I hated that. While the relationship between Jenna and Arion is sweet enough. They never seem to really learn to know each other so their relationship is a bit lacking in depth. I basically skimmed it to get to the end and see to what extent the author would ruin the Leor. She does a pretty good job of it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it.","review":"As with all authors who write books in a series some are better than others and you hope for the best each time a new book comes out.

Wow, is all I can say and kudos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be Missed!","review":"SHADOW FIRES was the first book I've read by this author, and wow, was I sorry I'd waited so long! I read the book in one unstoppable sitting, and it stayed with me for days.

This novel is unlike any other I've read in the genre, and I can't say enough good things about it.If you've never read this one, rush to buy it! You won't be disappointed! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor!","review":"Up to now I've been enjoying Baxt's Hollywood mysteries, but this particular one was written extremely poorly. It was disjointed and made no sense. And Garbo seemed like a cardboard cutout - there was no life to her at all. The premise was a good one - espionage in Hollywood after the bombing of Pearl Harbour, but it went absolutely nowhere. It was so unmemorable that I don't even remember the names of the lead characters who were at the heart of the conspiracy. I do hope that the others remaining in the series get back to the old format that the first four books had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under rated Gem","review":"This game is a classic that wasn't really heard of. A game that was unfortunately released at a time when bigger named games were released. Controls are a bit of a hassle to get used to, but once you get accustomed to them, the game is great fun.

You wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Controls and Bland Storyline Make This Game A Miss!","review":"Let me first say that this game is better than State of Emergency although not by much. The controls are absolutely horrible. I found myself spending more time trying to make jumps and climbing down ladders without falling and dying than actually fighting. The enemy characters are generic and are not the brightest enemies in the videogame world. I think those ghost on old-school pacman and the Mad Gear thugs of Final Fight are a whole lot smarter. And the main character's girlfriend is very annoying perhaps more annoying than the controls. The storyline is right out of some low budget cheap ripoff made for television [stuff] you'd see on the scifi channel too often. I suggest renting this game first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"retarded","review":"When I saw this game, I thought it looked interesting. I was wrong. The plot is as basic as they come, with very little in the way of surprises or twists. The controls are clumsy at best. It also seems like you have to hit everyone 20 times before they die. Seeing that they made the weapons look amazingly like light sabers, I feel like a baseball bat would probably kill the enemies faster. Overall, a terrible game that should be rented at best, and only if you've beat every other game ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter crap!","review":"Name says it all. This game is not challenging, predictable, and is at times more vague than Bush's sobriety. I had to purchase this game for a class.

I was one of two people in my group to finish the game. Don't waste your time and money with this game. It's not even good to play stoned.

There are much better games out there than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good","review":"I enjoy this game, and i don't like games much. It does has a weak plot but it is good one.

The author does not have a correct science based understanding of punishment or reinforcement, but he is often correct in his application of training techniques.

With an ensemble cast which includes April Grace, Whitman Mayo, Orlando Jones, Ja'net Dubois, and Anthony Lee, this is a marvelous film and it is filled with powerful performances from this cast.The movie is heartwrenching and the music is equally phenomenal in its depiction of life in the deep South.

Most modern biographies of Elizabeth rake her over the coals for her famously dithering and constipated decision-making process, but Strachey makes a good case for indecision as a political weapon, and cites this quality as part of Elizabeth's genius. The relationship between this hugely complex 70-year old queen and the magnificent but deeply flawed earl is dissected factually and emotionally. An amazing achievement. Jill Masters has a beautiful, silky voice and brings real poignancy to this subtle work."},{"rating":"1","title":"O MANNN","review":"I never really liked the Pastor Troy's style.

On one hand, it's an enjoyable kids movie that's somewhat entertaining. On the other hand, it sends a very negative message to our youth. It's all fun and games until halfway through the movie where Dodger gains mutant powers from eating a toxic banana after sneaking into a government bio engineering plant and decides to use his powers for evil rather than good. Eva gets sick and Dodger decides to rob a bank to pay the medical bills. Jean Claude Van Dam is a special forces agent working to stop the monkey in time (I think he's a pretty good actor). There is a plot twist that's somewhat good but I won't spoil it here.

Thora Birch leads the cast with Harvey Keitel as the villian.Feeling neglected being saddled with a baby brother and new step-father, a school girl, Birch, desperately wants her own pet to love. Her agony is compounded when her parents deny her wish and tell her she is too irresponsible.Walking home one day she is adopted by a monkey that has run away from his villianous keeper. She secretely keeps her new pet, learns to care for him, then eventually discovers the monkey brings her troubles - Keitel has taught the monkey to steal and wants him back.Thora has a great emotional range and will cause you laughter and tears.

But, here we get two of the best episodes in this phenomenal series, in a presentation that far outshines their previous life on VHS. Who could ask for anything more?I&#65533;ve always loved &#65533;The Copper Beeches.&#65533; Its gothic setting and the hammy performance of Joss Ackland as the mysterious employer help to overcome the weaknesses in Conan Doyle&#65533;s plot, while &#65533;The Blue Carbuncle&#65533; showcases the methods of Sherlock Holmes better than any other adventure.The casting, as usual, couldn&#65533;t be better. A young Natasha Richardson joins Ackland in &#65533;The Copper Beeches,&#65533; and the masterful Jeremy Brett triumphs, yet again, as Sherlock Holmes.We can only hope that MPI will release the entire series on DVD.

If there had been Academy Awards in 1920 then Lon Chaney's incredible performance would have been a top contender for Best Actor. The Extras on this disc are nice as we get to see the actual costume that Chaney used to create his legless performance as well as a very early one-reel performance in which he plays the bad guy.

For anyone seriously interested in the work of \\"The Man of a 1000 Faces\\" this edition of THE PENALTY will be worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lon Chaney","review":"Lon Chaney is perhaps the ultamate method actor. Were Marlon Brandow gained weight to play a part Lon Chaney endured great pain to bring a role to the screen. The comparison is a valid one. However, similarities end as soon as they are made. Brando begain about forty years later than Chaney. Lon Chaney was creating new faces for himself, reconfiguring his body, and selflessly allowing the character and performance to eclipse his own personality in the \\"Nineteen Teens\\". A method actor allows the charactor to be paramount. The \\"Leading Man\\" type actor to which we have become so acustom to allows his own cutness, handsome apperance, or affible nature to obscure a part.

The story line is also weak which really makes this an all-around let-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"end this game","review":"Maybe i'm just stuck on nostalgia, but there is no way this film is a proper sequal to Highlander. First of all, it is too inconsistent & pays no respect to the original film or to Connor Macleod. This films storyline is almost as pathetic as Highlander 2. There is no purpose for it & its plays out like an extended episode of the tv series. The title \\"Endgame\\" which suggest the end of it all, is nothing of the sort as it is obvious that there are still immortals left. The character of Duncan is play like a lost soul, & the character of Connor (the original Highlander) is butchered. This film is complete blasphemy to the original. The one star I gaveit is based in the touching scene between Duncan & Connor. It is the one decent scene in this film. There can be only one, but this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate bad reviews but..","review":"First of all, let me say that I hate bad reviews. Reading them bothers me when I think of all the hard works that goes into a movie. Having established that, I still have to say that this movie is a stinker. It is to the original Highlander, what Lambert's version of Beowulf is to the original Beowulf... somewhat of a mockery. The original Highlander movie is a work of art. The sequels, as well as the series, in my opinion, not only dilute the original story, but are inconsistent to an impressive degree. Its like each one was wrtitten by a guy who had only heard about, but never actually seen the others. In Endgame, the beloved memories of the fierce Kurgan and good ole' Ramirez are once again trampled. There is yet another \\"ultimately evil\\" enemy and, of course, Conner's 400 years worth of sword skills are totally inadequate against him. Ramirez would be spinning in his grave. Beam this one back to planet Zeist with the rest of the nonsensical junk. Ouch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I missed the movie in the theater and when it was released only on DVD, I just went ahead and bought it on video. What a mistake!! Although it did bring together the original character with the series characters, I was not impressed. Actually it was awful. To have Connor admit defeat and Duncan accepts that is ridiculous. Thank goodness it was the end.

Although good, some things were just confusing or not consistent. Case in point, the fact that in the series it was mentioned that Duncan was never to marry. Of course, it could be that he married Kate/Faith before that prediction was made.The whole Connor/Rachel story totally confused me.I did enjoy the movie despite these confusions and look forward to another HL movie.Changing the ending in the DVD was a bit disappointing.

This film is utterly unbearable! The only redeeming features are some attractively misty location photography and the tiny metal crosses on one character's shoes. Am I clutching at straws? You bet, but unlike the makers of this unbelievably awful pile of sludge, I'm not yet plumbing the depths of REAL desperation. The writing, direction and acting are abysmal, and I was begging my co-viewers to stop the DVD player well before the supposedly exciting finale. Appearing soon in a used DVD bin near you!

But Even after the horrible sequel and what I think is better termed a remake with mario van pebbles this one is even a further departure from the original. The premise and mythology that made the first movie so extraordinary has been perverted to the point of making me sick. Not to mention the fact that each one of these movies seems to forget that the one before it ever happend. I liked Adrian paul but the \\"we need more bad guys\\" premise to make a bigger sequel just doesnt play in a movie based on single combat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"This movie is pathetic. I consider myself a fairly big Highlander fan and I felt deeply insulted after watching this seemingly hastily-thrown together slop. I walked into the theater expecting it to be more of a guilty pleasure intended only for true Highlander fans, but I walked out just feeling dirty. The television series on which most of this \\"sequel\\" is based appears much better produced/directed and with a comperable budget. This is a horrible way to \\"end\\" the series and leaves a very poor taste in my mouth after the cancelation of the tv series and the semi-watchable Highlander: Raven series. The only reason this gets 2 stars is because it's not quite as bad as some of the earlier attempts to continue the series on the big screen. This movie might actually be more entertaining for non-Highlander fans simply because they won't be groaning throughout the entire movie watching and agonizing over what could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not necessary","review":"To all those who have never seen the Highlander series before, just watch the oiginal and stop there. Both sequels try to start a new saga, but the fact is that MCloud won the \\"Prize\\" in the first Highlander.

Well there is battle and our hero wins out and the cave collapses.. Cut to 400 years later and an archaeological team discover the cave and the sleeping immortals awaken, their clothes still in pristine condition after all the centuries, must have been sprinkled with pixie dust.

Even his scenes are so reminicent of the first film it made us groan when watching it in the theater.It had some interesting concepts, I think they would have been better served to have this a \\"Prequel\\" to the first film instead of a sequel. And they should have made a stronger attempt and crafting a different villian instead of trying to capitalize on the excellent character of the Kurgan!See the first film, watch the TV series(an alternate timeline where Conner and the Kurgan's fight was not The Gathering) Both are much better than either of these pitiful sequels. Even the Highlander TV series movie was better, it had some weak spots but it was far more interesting than this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again...","review":"Let's face it, the first movie was the best and will never be equalled. The t.v. series was also very good, and I liked it a lot. But this movie was a waste of $6. I don't think the editing could have been any worse, totally choppy, and cut in to the continuity. As far as the acting goes, Adrian Paul looked lost, and Christopher Lambert looked to be in a great deal of pain. (And what ever happened to Paul's character \\"laying down the sword\\" at the end of the t.v. series?) I would love to see a t.v. movie with Adrian Paul as Highlander, but please no more theatrical releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is that smell????","review":"I'm happy that I simply rented this dvd. If you've only seen the television series, you may enjoy it, but it doesn't stack up to the best episodes there. If you're a fan of the first movie (where Connor killed the Kurgan and won the prize) and hated the following two sequels---then you'll hate this one too.Not to ruin anything, but the plot was pretty weak, the acting was sub-par (execpt for the series regulars, who were as good as usual), and the special effects were only so-so.I loved the tv series, and this movie bridges the series to the big screen, but to sacrifice some of the best characters from the original movie was a bad idea and in bad taste.This release gets 2 stars only because I made it through the entire thing before feeling completely let down.Have a nice day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great effort after a couple of stinkers!","review":"I loved the first Highlander is was smart, well put together and exciting. This fourth movie is no exception after a couple of really disappointing sequels. This movie seemed like a longer TV episode of the series, with bigger, better effects.

The movie itself, unfortunately, rates no more than two and a half. But this two-disc set is a treasure trove. We have a new Producers' Cut of the film (*not* a Directors' Cut!), and an earlier Rough Cut for comparison. Plus a running Audio Commentary that can be played with the Producers' Cut, a Behind-the-Scenes Featurette, a feature on Special Effects, and three deleted scenes. Especially for those of us who saw the theatrical version and remember the differences, it's a delight to evaluate all this and decide how *we* would have pieced it together.And as to the plot holes that inevitably still exist, that's what fan fiction is for. This film not only inspires it--it can become an obsession!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Davis-Panzer -- You DID it! A Highlander-Endgame overview","review":"Finished watching the DVD at 1:30 am 2/20/01EST. I almost didn't blink throughout the movie -- the pacing was great, the transitions logical, the continuity much better.This was more the movie we were all hoping for -- Yes, even in my sleep-deprived state, there were things to nit-pick (some parts too long, some parts too short -- for me -- not necessarily other folks!!).After seeing this version, one wonders what was the rush by Miramax to get the movie into the theaters -- to put an inferior (and badly reviewed product) out there defeats everyone's purpose. This movie would have made you a lot more money!Anyway, in toto, this was terrific!So, to paraphrase Professor Higgins in My Fair Lady:\\"Today, old boys, you DID it, you DID it, YOU DID IT! I didn't think you could, but indeed you did!!!\\"Congrats!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on your mood.","review":"The main thing about Highlander 3 is that is looks good. The photography and camera work is good, the locations and sets/lighting are excellent. The FX are also pretty impressive although not that inventive.The best way to watch the film is to be slightly drunk and a bit tired. That way the visuals are more impressive and the story washes over you. The fact that it makes no sense with the first film and doesn't explain itself anyway won't bother you to much. I got the impression that the original script had interesting characters (Macleods son, his sons' guardian and the police man) that were cut out to concentrate more on the action and up the pace. But the result is a mess. I also think that the original script was more romantic than what ended up on the screen. Even with the messy plot, the film could have got by with more rounded characters and a slower pace with better build up to the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"People don't get it.....","review":"Several people reviewing this film don't seem to realize this film actually has nothing to do with the first film but is meerly a film based on the TV series where the Kurgan and Conner did not fight for the prize but it was just another Immortal duel! Geez comparing this to the first film is like apples to oranges. I loved the first film the subsquent sequals do not exist in my mind. BUT THIS FILM IS NOT A SEQUAL!!! If you watched the series and liked it, I did, you will like this film, I did. Is it great cinema? No. Is it the fabulous acting? No. But then neither was the series so get over it people and just see the movie for the fun of it as modern sword and sorcery camp! *SIGH*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highlander:Endgame lets get ready to rumble!!!","review":"I thought that this movie was pretty good then I got the DVD version and saw the early cut of the movie and loved it. But what I don't get is what happens to Conner I mean what happens to him then what happens to the timeline of Highlander 2 I just don't get it.I like the uncut sceens to whoever reads this I sugest that you buy on DVD than on VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highlander Endgame","review":"Okay, I am a new viewer to the Highlander saga and I am totally enchanted by the movies and the series. I haven't found the second and third movies yet but have seen the original and end game and was captivated from beginning to end. From what I've seen, continuity isn't the greatest but do I care? No, the action was more than enough to compensate for that. The swordplay in this movie has much improved from the first movie and also an improvement over the series. If you're going to watch EndGame, in my opinion, you must see the first Highlander movie first and even watch some of the series to get a feel for the characters and the traits that they each bring to this movie. That's crucial to find out how both these characters tick. My definition of a good movie is if I cry, it's worth watching...I cried.Looking forward to seeing more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This movie was a pretty good movie. UPS:Good battle scenes,good acting and decent specia; effects DOWNS:Plot is only mediocre,dialouge is semi cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"If you are a fan of the first movie, don't bother with this one. This is not just full of plot holes, it has plot craters. The WWII orphan Conner raises, is killed in this movie, when in the first movie we last see her as he says goodbye to her as he goes to the last fight before winning the prize. His place is destroyed, and the biggest crater of all is Conner is killed. Hold on there, he was the last one, he won the prize. The plot problems are so big the movie becomes annoying, and the total disregard for the stories that have gone before borders on insulting. This was a hack job of milking more money out of a beaten franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highlander 3 - aka the movie that should never have been!","review":"Ok, if in the very first movie, Connor MacLeod has defeated all of the immortals, and has received the \\"prize\\" as it were, then where do all of these other immortals keep coming from? If they really wanted to do a three-part movie, may I suggest not killing off all of the bad guys in the first one? Happily, I did not pay money to see this movie - if I had, I would have demanded a refund! To top it all off, the second Highlander movie also featured more immortals coming out of nowhere, when supposedly they were all dead. Makes you wonder what those writers were on when they came up with the script, doesn't it? I highly recommend NOT purchasing this movie - you will have wasted your hard-earned cash on trash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highlander-Endgame","review":"This was a great movie. The creators incorporated characters from the movie series and the tv series. They explain many events which occured in the first movie and events from the television series. When these events occured, viewers said,\\"O.k. So that happened. But why?\\"This is a movie that can be watched many times over with the same excitment as the first time watched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget Connery and Van Peebles, They Say This Is Last One!","review":"Didn't they say that the Final Dimension was the last one? Well, anyways, this one was good, even though it was nothing relating to the original ones. Adrian something stars as the \\"brother\\" of Lambert, the immortal who travels across time, and together they join forces to battle the evil Kell (Bruce something). There were some scenes that were not added from the theaterical trailer but this one was a good one, but there might be another one supposidly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Ishtar and Highlander 2 put together!","review":"Could this possibly be the worst movie ever? First off, the swordplay in highlander is generally laughable, but that speaks for 99% of all such films that rely on \\"hollywood showboating and theatrical swordsmanship\\" rather than real historical techniques. That bieng said I won't hold that against this thing that some say passes for a movie. Secondly, Is it really a movie or just a really long episode of the crappy tv series by the same name. Thirdly anything with that sissy other MacLeod from the tv series should not be viewed by anyone. The crappy second Highlander movie was far far far better than this trash and that says a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are the Same","review":"I saw Highlander, The Final Dimension for sale and I bought it. Thank goodness I didn't open the package as I noticed that one of the scenes shown on the back of the package looked just like one of the scenes on the back of Highlander III, The Sorcerer. Gee, it would have been nice if they had either kept the same title (I thought it was a whole new movie)or made some reference that it is a reediting of Highlander III, The Sorcerer. You can't even find the initial release date anywhere on the package for The Final Dimension. I give it a 1 rating, not because I don't enjoy the Highlander films, but they should make it clearer that this is not a \\"new\\" Highlander movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are kidding Right!","review":"A glorified TV episode with a few special effects. Potential was there to really crank it up but they just fall short. One would think that after 400 years you would amass a wealth of knowledge and talent. Speak many languages, blend into different customs. They should have done this on multiple locations with different fighting styles of different cultures. Guess I should start writing my own scripts. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the first one","review":"I've only seen a few episodes of the TV series, and I've seen both sequels. I have this to say: STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL. It was fine until people tried to capitalize on its cult success and tried to make sequels. If you're not prepared for a bigtime headache, created by trying to figure out the continuity of the show and the films, then just stick with the original. It's much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"This movie did nothing for me. I will always be a fan of the first but not this one. Highlander 2 on the other hand. I really enjoyed Highlander 2. But for those of you who don't like it check out the Highlander 2 The Director's Cut Renagade Version. It makes more scence. then the The Quicking. Getting back to this movie. I thought it also was very violent. After Kane kills a man he likes the blood off his sword. He is a sick cookie in this movie. Stay away please it disturbed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"gift","review":"happy to have this to complete my collection. love the movie and am happy to have purchased it here. great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Endgame","review":"Endgame is the fifth movie in the series. i like this movie because it has Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) and Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul) in it. But it does have a sad twist to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother watching it unless you are a Highlander fan","review":"I am a big fan of Highlander TV series, and I like Highlander movie one and three. That didn't help at all, I still think End Game is a bad movie.I can see why this did so bad in the box office. You need to know the movie and the TV shows very well, or you'll be confused. I wouldn't mind that if the overall movie is done well just for fans, unforturnately that's not the case. Relationships underdeveloped, scene of Duncan and Connor's fight too awkward emotionally, and the plot is not solid enough.Despite that, there are still three reasons to watch this DVD- Cool action scenes (great sword fights), Connor & Duncan together (yeah!), and the extra features & earlier cut of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst sequels ever....","review":"If there was a movie that you could give a negative rating to....this is one of them. The entire highlander francshise could have taken a different turn from the first movie - which is a cult classic and spectacularly done, but no.Hollywood has to make money of it somehow. So we end up with trash. This movie has so many logic plot holes, and passing the torch from Lambert to Paul? Terrible idea. Since Paul is not really a worthy immortal. Lambert on the other hand, played Connor Mcleod with style and panash. Paul is just....boring. Lets hope they do not do another sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"belive me, this movie bites","review":"i am not so much of a fan of the hihlander series, but the firts movie i realy enjoyed...and this one its so bad i had to see it in two separate times, the \\"bad guy\\" its awfull and it looks like its from the tv show...in fact the WHOLE MOVIE ITS LIKE A TWO HOUR SHOW!!! it has no ending and poor actors including cristofer lambert who is just to old to be and inmortal.theres only one true and good hilander movie and it was made in 86."},{"rating":"2","title":"Y Connor,y did you have to die!!!!!????NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!","review":"...This is the only seqaul in the series that i liked.I think that this is almost as good as the first one because everything is almost the same,only flaw i see is to many flash backs.The only thing that keeps me from giving this movie 5 stars..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A return to glory for Highlander fans","review":"As a huge highlander fan I jumped at the chance to by the new film ENDGAME. It is a fantastic movie with insights into the early years of Connor Mcleod and Duncan Mcleods immortality. There is more depth into Connors past and the special effects are brilliant. Although it doesn't quite follow the films before it or for that matter the series starring Adrian Paul, I feel the that the film was well written and produced. This film really is a must for any Highlander fan, the fight scenes and swordsmanship are remarkable.The ending of the film I feel was slightly controversial but it was probably the best way to end it.It's just a shame that this film is not on release in the UK just yet, so go out and buy a NTSC playback VCR and buy this film.FANTASTIC!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"There can be only one\\"/ The mother of the \\"Highlander\\" saga","review":"I loved this movie. I am one of the biggest Chris Lambert and Bruce Payne fans around. Bruce Payne really made this movie for me .I loved the fight sequences, even in this day and age the sword fights are timeless. I thought Adrian Paul did a splendid job also. I was so hurt when the legendary Colonel McCleod was taken out of the picture because in my opinion he really would have set \\"Endgame\\" off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this more...","review":"I am a Highlander fan and I liked this flick infanitely more than the other sequals, but it just didn't quite make it. The concepts are interesting and even \\"cool\\" and I did have some guilty pleasures, but who let those bad-guy motorcycle guys in? That, and several other lapses of sillyness just punched holes in the good points of the film. Typically, fans will like this flick better than two stars, but not love it. Non-fans should stay far away and might rate this in the turkey range. Still a helluva lot better than some tripe in theaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so High, lander...","review":"I remember seeing the trailer for this film, absolutely certain that it couldn't be much worse than the second sequel.Isn't it just like Hollywood to surprise at will?Not only was it worse than \\"The Quickening\\", it insulted most die-hard fans by the blatant re-scripting of the first film, and the uninspired casting of Mario Van Peeples as the main villain. There's a difference between over-the-top and conducting a seminar on hammy acting, and his performance fits the latter in this case.The high points, if any, are the ... uh... naughty scenes involving the incredibly beautiful Deboragh Kara Unger, but the rest of the film is a bore. You'd do better to skip this and check out \\"Highlander:Endgame\\" if you're in need of a Highlander fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"A True Disappointment","review":"Being a tremendous fan of the first Highlander film (especially as a Queen worshipper and follower of Sean Connery)The sequals have all been a disappointment, this one in particular. I was hoping that this film could sort out the timelines throughout the series, but no, they have caused even more confusion - where on earth do the Canopy and the explanation about Aliens from Outer Space ideas fit in - and at that time where was Duncan?. Did they shoot the Continuity Director at the end of the first film? Haven't the writers and production teams seen the previous movies? If you don't try to connect this film with any of the others then it may have deservered 3 stars, but from someone who likes to make sense of a story, it was lucky to get 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stay away from this movie!","review":"I was hoping that I'd find more negative reviews for this movie here on Amazon. Hopefully, I can aid in the effort to set everyone straight.This was a horrible movie. I rented 'Dungeons & Dragons'(2000) the week before and ejected the DVD from my player and returned it to the rental store after only 20 minutes of view time. The only reason I watched this turkey was because I loved the first movie so much.I'd like to point out one thing that I haven't seen anybody else say yet. At about the 30-minute mark in this movie, they started showing flashbacks. Now you'd think that with 3 previous films and six seasons of television episodes to pull from, they'd have plenty of good flashback material. And yet, in Highlander 4, we had to endure flashbacks of something we'd JUST SEEN 10 MINUTES AGO!!!!Bottom line, it seemed like some writer's 9 year-old child came up with the idea for this movie, and after only a few rewrites, we were presented with this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flogging a dead horse....","review":"They should have stopped after the original. The first in this series of three was superb. It had an original story and some great action sequences. Number two was a load of crap (no pun intended). The third wasn't much better. It seemed as though the people that made this flick were trying to rehash the great stuff from the first movie but were unsuccesful. Save your cash and time. This one's a dud. If you like the TV series give \\"Highlander: Endgame\\"a go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as one would think","review":"I didnt feel this movie was good at all, in fact i felt it was a huge dissapointment. I reccomend even if you are a highlander fan rent it first. See it for yourself, then decide on it. I disliked this highlander the most. the first was great and the rest seemed to go downhill. This one was wrock bottom. But dont take my word for it, rent it and see for yourself"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the original, but it tried, but not really","review":"All right. Watch the trailer. It is so much better than the movie. The trailer has all the good parts of this movie. There is nothing that great about this movie. There wasnt enough scenes in the past. I felt the lighting was terrible. The parts in the present looked so cheesy. Mario Van Peebles cant act at all. The girl in the movie is hot, but she couldnt act with anyone in this. Just watch the trailer folks. NO Sean Connery, no nothing. NO Queen music. Nothing. Very dissapointing. That is all I got to say about that"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highlander fan","review":"If you are a true highlander fan --you will love this. If you are new to the game you might be lost.

For your money you get something the length of two television episodes and with exactly the same format, lots more blood,greater violence and some nudity being the difference.I mean, the series had to have a lower budget than this thing yet it was still much better. Save your money watch the TV show if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross Disappointment","review":"I loved the first 3 and own all of them on DVD. If given this one, I'd throw it away.

Connar won the prize in the 1st movie and asside from immortals teleporting in or being frozen for a long time I don't see where all these other people came from?"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, invalidates all the other movies","review":"This movie would be wonderful to anyone whose experience with Highlander is nonexistent, or solely through the tv series. The action is good, the story is good. However, the end completely invalidates all other Highlander movies ever made. In the first Highlander movie, it is made absolutely clear that Connor Macleod is the one left standing at the very end, the Last immortal, the winner of the prize. The other movies follow. However, in this movie, a prequel to the first movie, Duncan Macleod kills Connor, long before he could win the prize. Therefore, the other movies can't have happened. The writers took a good series and ruined it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm, where does this fit in the timeline?","review":"If you haven't seen any of the other Highlander movies, then you will like this one. It's not a bad movie really. It just doesn't fit in with the established timeline for the Highlander story. We know, from the first movie, that Conner wins the prize. However in the world his death at the hands of Duncan fits into THAT, I have yet to figure out. My friends and I were sorely disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the 1st if not better","review":"I had missed the chance to see the movie in the theatres so I spent half a year waiting for it to come out on DVD. As soon as it did, I went out and bought it. I had been watching the series for a while a few years ago up until cancellation, and now it plays re-runs on Sci-Fi Channel, and I try not to miss those. The series was always awesome and brought back the better feel of how and why the immortals were on Earth, not the alien BS that the second one brought about and the vague and pointless reasons a third movie was made...but End Game just basically brought Highlander back into \\"The Game\\" so to speak as far as a genre goes. You shouldn't have to watch the 2nd or 3rd movies to have to understand End Game, but the first movie is helpful...and some knowledge from the series as well. A must-have film for any sci-fi action fan and definitly for any Highlander fan. There can be only one...and this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure garbage and lies upon lies","review":"This is my first review of anything. I found this movie to be an honest piece of garbage. Conner MacLeod appears to be totally different from the original movie. He is aloof, shadowy and distant. He won the prize. How the heck are they still fighting Immortals. Why couldn't the dummies who wrote this film had some sort of continuity with the 1st film?They could have made a movie by placing it between events in the first film. Any true fans of these films must agree with me. I am not one to nitpick on minutiae (spelling??) but this is pure nonsense. Duncan kills Conner?!, c'mon what kind of bullcrap is that. I'm going to try to send this back and get my money back. Why didn't a review explain this blatant contradiction?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no pit deep enough ...","review":"... where to drop this. Unbelievably bad sequel of a cult movie.

Watch the first Highlander movie and forget that sequels even exist. Although this one isn't anywhere near as pathetic as Highlander 2, it's still pretty bad. Connor was the last immortal left at the end of the first movie. He won the prize and was one with all living things. Therefore it is completely and utterly ridiculous that there could have been any other immortals left on Earth. The movie also has no originality to it at all. It is pretty much just a remake of the first Highlander. So like I said, just watch Highlander 1 and stop there. Trust me. You won't be missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"whimpy,whimpy,whimmmmmmpy!","review":"where did they find this schmoe lambert?why did they settle on him?how did this become a franchise?the best thing about this is that it must end sometime!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No constancy in the movies","review":"1st movie Connor Macleoud becomes the last immortal 2nd movie really pushes the story line, but if you ignore little details it follows 3rd follows the original polt this movie Connor Macleoud gets killed by another immortal which goes beyond the whole consistencies of the movieI know the time line and the tv show has problem with timelines but the general storylines still follows.Also the great special affects in the commercials are not in the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oweh My Head Hurts...","review":"Endgame makes no sense whatsoever.

All you who have seen the first one know this. I dont say that the first one is better, but it is.You do get to see some flashbacks from the first one in the beginning, but thats just to show us that this one is supposed to be a sequel. Not that it is, as i said. All the other immortals were dead, but now suddely macleod finds more of them...how? no explanation.How about the movie as it is..... Well the evil one is played by Mario Van Peebles, which does a good job, and the good guy as alaways, Christopher Lambert, who is also good. The fight scenes should be more brutal and much faster. why do they draw out everything? The swordplay scenes should be short, fast and well choregraphed instead of being outdrawn and quite boring.

It completely ignores everything that happened in the original film except when it is convenient for a flashback.Even if you can ignore the awful script, the unexplained appearances of unknown characters and plot elements (unless you have seen the TV series); you still won't believe what they do to the story in the name of continuing their franchise.Endgame?

They sure have a way of getting me hocked after hearing a song for the first time. Most music takes me a while to get into it and then I quickly get bored. Not every with the boys of Tonic. This CD is so awesome!! I'll wear it out and have to get a new one before month's end. Do yourself a favor - get HEAD ON STRAIGHT. If you aren't a Tonic fan, you will be. And if you are a Tonic fan, you STILL will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent Tonic CD","review":"I think this is a very good CD.Tonic sounds as good as they've ever sounded on \\"Head On Straight\\", although it's only moderately different from their other albums.Some songs like Roses, Liar and Irish(bag pipe guitars?) are rockers, and most of the other songs are typical melodic relationship power pop that Tonic puts out(Ring Around Her Finger is my Favorite of those), Come Rest Your Head & Let Me Go sound a little different to me than what Tonic has done in the past.It's all excellent stuff from talented musicians. Head on straight and head and shoulders above most of the mediocrity and junk that rotates on the radio.If you like Tonic you probably can't go wrong with this CD and if you aren't familiar, but like melodic pop/alternative rock , check it out.Dishwalla's \\"Angels Or Devils\\" and Tonic's \\"Head On Straight\\" are truly 2 of the best adult pop/alternative rock CDs that I've bought in the past year or more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pensive Tonic","review":"Though not as aggressive as \\"Sugar\\" this recording nonetheless offers up a quality effort featuring more than a few dynamite tracks (what this fan has come to expect).

I loved the previous two CDs -- in fact \\"Sugar\\" is maybe my favorite CD EVER. This is not in the same league with Sugar and Lemon Parade. I find the songs to be whiny and silly. The lyrics don't really make sense -- and since when does Def Leppard sing back-up for Tonic? The backing vocals are the overproduced, lush, Mutt Lange type vocals. Yuck! How many times do I have to listen to Emerson Hart begging his honey not to leave him? \\"I'm keeping my head on straight\\", \\"I don't want to be alone again\\", blah, blah, blah. I don't think this CD will do as well as the previous two. But I'll wait patiently for the next one.

However, to the 18 year old who's enamored of the lovesick lyrics on this CD -- yes, you're right -- most of the CD appears to be about Emerson Hart's screwed up love life. There are several problems with this: (1) I don't really want to pay money to hear a guy beg his wife to take him back for an hour, and (2) in between the begging and whining, the lyrics don't make much sense. When I hear the lyrics, \\"Give me love/Give me fascination/Give me strength that I can save my relationship\\", I actually cringe. I love Tonic. I'm proud that they were nominated for Grammy's. But for the life of me, I cannot figure out why it was for this CD. It's alright. I listen to it sometimes, but it's not their best work.

A very easy read, this book teaches the novice photographer, like myself, to customize camera settings in order to take more professional pictures. It goes beyond the automatic, pre-set modes without getting too technical. It explains very understandable language how different settings, apertures, and flash modes can affect the outcome of each image.

The book begins with a tour of the camera controls and features. Following that, the book gets into information fundamental to those not familiar with manual photography as it relates specifically to your Nikon digital camera. My previous camera had been all automatic, so I found this information very valuable. While other reviews have complained about the production value of the book, I've found that the pages are loaded with information.

Not a fatal flaw and the fitting provided with the rack masked the appearance of the lift. The only thing that kept me from rating 5 stars is the length of the cord. In most bathrooms under current building codes, there's considerably more distance than 6 feet between a normal towel rack location and a power supply.

The first third of this novel contains some of the best prose that Fleming ever put on paper. It is rich in detail and thoroughly engrossing. It is a true delight to read and savor. As the novel enters the second the third it still remains engrossing but seems to lack some of Fleming's usual drive and coherency. The final third falls below what could even be considered commonplaceness for Fleming. Fleming seems to have just given up on this project at some point and just finished it out to get it into publication. Yet THUNDERBALL remains one of my favorite Fleming novels.

The bad news: the rest of the book. There's no discernible plot. A mystery should mystify. This one airily dismisses its opening ploy (the disappearing hiker) and discloses a murder only through the testimony of a single witness - if Qwill (or Koko) does any detecting, it's not evident here.

So today I read every review I could get my hands on for this book, and finally decided that it would not peak my interest and would probably only leave me in the dumps if the various sub-plots were not knotted neatly. So I decided to pass on it. Maybe Ms. Braun will recover from her slump or will develop some other twist for the series. Maybe the publisher WAS to blame for this \\"unsolved\\" mystery and lack of \\"parts\\" to be played by the hero's sidekicks. For whatever reason the book was not accepted well, I do believe that Whomever it was that allowed it to go into print as an UNfinished product needs a serious reprimand. I will await the next book by Ms. Braun."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK effort, not as good as some of her earlier works","review":"I've read all 21 books in the Cat Who series, and found this one to be a bit of a disappointment. I think the \\"surprise ending\\" is out of character with the rest of the series, and is kinda stupid. The book is a pleasant enough visit with your favorite Moose County characters, but not much else happens. (Qwilleran doesn't solve anything in this one!) I think Braun is coasting on past successes-- she certainly didn't strain herself on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"Lilian Jackson Braun's series has become so \\"cozy\\" that the recent books are almost devoid of elements of mystery altogether--they've become chatty little books about a group of people and their pets. Some of those people I could do without: Polly is the most insipid invention an author could conjure up, and considering the number of times the skinny Braun reminds us that Polly is size 16, I suspect that even the author is contemptuous of her creation. The only public socializing Qwill does with Polly is eating dinner, which doesn't actually surprise me. And the amount of boozing that goes on is hilarious. Can't people in Pickax City visit one another without having a drink to get through it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big mistake reading this book","review":"The author does not get to any point in a timely matter. The end of the book is rushed to the point where many of the mysteries are unsolved.

But I borrowed it from the library (not being able to afford first editions as Qwill can), and even that was disappointing. There is very little about Koko and Yum Yum - if I hadn't read all the other books in the series I wouldn't appreciate the small tidbits about their personalities here. It was like \\"been there, done that.\\" Qwill is becoming a bore with his only interests being in homespun activities that even people \\"400 miles from everywhere\\" never would think of doing. The one bright spot in the book was the absence of that sickenly sweet, insipid, bookish, and weak-hearted woman-friend, Polly. I personally wish the heart attack a couple books ago had done her in. Ms. Braun. Please return to your beginning allure, mystery, and documentation of the cats. Otherwise I'm switching to Brown's cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best, but read the rest","review":"I have read almost all of the Cat Who... books, and this one was clearly the worst of the bunch. The plot was unexciting, the detective work on Qwill's part was absent (another character basically spontaneously reveals what happened), and the ending was completely unrealistic and totally out of character. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do read Braun's other books in the series: she is an awesome writer. Unfortunately, this one fell far short of my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT CD set as listed","review":"Very disappointed, this is NOT a CD set, it is audio cassettes. I was so excited to finally be getting a new Lilian Jackson Braun book to listen to, and it comes in cassette, not as listed as CD's, not practical in today's world and a huge waste of time and money for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Response to other reviews","review":"Another reader asked if those of us wondering what happened to the backpacker read the ending. The answer is of course we did but we also know when you find a dead body burried in the sand you don't dismiss it as natural causes in the end of the book. (Sorry for ruining that but really the backpacker doesn't even feature in the story.) I also agree that the Cat series is like \\"eating comfort food\\", or \\"visiting old friends.\\" LJB provides a nice light read for those of us wanting to get away from the real world for a while but I think to claim the loose endings exist because Qwill is exploring his beliefs gives LJB too much credit for literary talent. The fact is leaving those loose endings is simply messy writing. I am looking forward to the next book because I like the characters but I'm also hoping it is better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book had major plot problems","review":"I think this was one of the most disorganized LJB books I've ever read. This story focused on the lives of the citizens of Mooseville and their obsession with UFO's and kept Qwilleran from doing any major detecting. His famous moustach tingled teasingly several times but nothing ever came of the premonitions. In fact the \\"mystery\\" was convienently solved by the sudden confession of a friend of a friend.Koko was equally disappointing. True, he did uncover a dead body whose death was left dangling like a fish hook with no bait. The clues he gave were blatantly obvious and a 3 year old could have deciphered them quicker than Qwill.All I can say is the esteemed author must have been under deadline pressure or having personal problems to have written such a messy story. After finishing this book I was left wanting. Wanting to know what really happened. My advice is if you like the characters go ahead and read this book but its not a story for mystery lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it should have been!","review":"Having read all of LJB's \\"Cat\\" books this one was a big disappointment. I love her books and always eagerly await for the next one to be published. Unfortunately in this one LJB leads us around town with no destination in mind, no interesting characters to discover and nothing to show us except \\"sand.\\" The only mystery here is \\"who is wrote this book and why did they bother?\\" I know LJB can do better unless the \\"green men\\" have taken her away! Koko would never push this one off the shelf for a read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mystery without a mystery","review":"I was disapointed in this book- it was like she was sick of writing this series, and especially sick of the mystery part of it. The mystery details were lacking and incidental while Quileran plodded through his vacation with no conflict but a prolonged boredom. Koko should leave him and find a new master, one who is more active."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat Who...missed the boat!","review":"The previous reviewers seemed to be in two camps - those who thought that this book was great and of the quality of the previous twenty, and those who thought tha Ms. Braun missed the boat. I'm in the second group. What did happen to the backpacker? Who killed him and why? Who burried him in the dune? What mystery did the state investigators cover up? Koko didn't find anything of interest except a body. What was the deal with the postcards - that wasn't developed at all. And what was the idea of Koko looking at stars? The UFO thing wasn't developed either. The whole book didn't pull together. The cats didn't get enough time and Qwill didn't deduce anything. Sorry, but I want my money back. I will still be looking forward to the next book, hoping it will be \\"catty\\" and clever like the first twenty."},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly disappointing","review":"My first thoughts on Ms. Braun was for writing this was of extreme disappointment. Though I have never read any of the other \\"Cat Who...\\" books, the fact that there were 22 previous to this was some encouragement... that was quickly lost. The story is almost a straight narrative of events, nothing more detailed or fascinating, and the characters were dry and boring. Though reviews of her earlier books give me a bit of hope that at one time Ms. Braun was a better writer, this experience may have put me off for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great One!","review":"She has done it again. In his latest (released) case, Qwill hooks on to a mystery that has a supernatural edge. One of his major features changes, and it kind of makes you look twice at the night sky. Add this to your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst yet.","review":"I am a big fan of LJB and Qwill and Koko. Although I did not enjoy this one. The plot was not there nor the humor. I have read all of The Cat Who books at least 6 times and listened to the tapes more. My favorite is The Cat who Played Post Office. PS Please do not give Qwill a dog!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read her earlier books in this series!","review":"As a long time fan of Ms. Braun's, I found it very difficult to finish reading this book. I truly believe she now has a ghost writer and not a very good one at that! The dialogue is stilted and awkward. I heard back in the early 90's that she had a contract to produce something like 10 more books and I wonder if she found she had to hire someone to do this. To me, her books began to go downhill with the Potato Mountain escapade. It ended abruptly and the remaining books in the series were a disappointment. I've loved this series and the wonderful characters in Moose County but from now on, I'll just reread the ones I enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I used to await Braun's new \\"Cat Who\\" books eagerly so I could snap them up at the bookstore, but the last few have been somewhat disappointing, so I was content to wait for a friend to lend me her copy of THE CAT WHO SAW STARS. I am pleased that I did not pay for this book, and I'm sorely tempted to discontinue reading the series altogether.Actually, I am concerned about Braun's health. This book felt to me like she didn't have the energy to do anything more than slap together a few disjointed Qwill observations on rural life. There isn't even a coherent mystery to follow in this book, and it contains the biggest plot hole I've ever seen: the sleuth decides to just chalk the whole thing up to UFOs.This book can be enjoyed by only Ms. Braun's most die-hard fans, and I am sorry to say I no longer count myself among them."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELLO! Where is the Plot?","review":"I usually enjoy the \\"Cat\\" books but with this one I happened to notice that I was on Page 187 and still had no idea what the story was about. What a waste of time and money. I will certainly check the review before I buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Start with this Book","review":"As a big fan of the \\"Cat Who\\" stories I am let down by this story. Ms. Braun usually does a better job of describing the area, characters, and tying all of the story together. This particular book references UFO's a couple of times but only as a side plot. Also there is reference to people on the beach of the cabin who are not used for anything else in the story.I also missed the cats being more of a center of the story. Koko and Yum Yum are usually a major part of hte story. This time they seemed to be almost an afterthought.I usually recommend Ms. Braun's books with gusto, not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The mystery was missing","review":"I agree with the other readers that this installment in the \\"Cat Who\\" series does not come up to usual standards. A lot of extraneous loose ends and people are introduced for no seeming purpose, like the woman on the beach and the UFOs. The backpacker mystery is never solved, other deaths (although accidental) are glossed over as everyday occurrences, and Owen's death is confessed. The local color is interesting, but that's about it. The editing is also sloppy. Niagara is misspelled through the first half of the book. Yum Yum sits with Gertrude the Kalico Kat 5 pages before Qwill gives it to her. The 12 pairs of hands at Safe Harbor belong to 24(?) widows. The cats and Polly have become one-dimentionsal backdrops. It may be my imagination, but in this book Qwill the reformed drinker seems to ply guests with liquor (and no food) at every opportunity. Sorry, I'll go re-read an old favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"But what about.....","review":"I was just getting into the characters in this book and wondering how all of the facets of the story would come together when I noticed that the end of the book was nearing. I wondered how she was going to wrap it all up in just a few pages. I am still wondering. What about the mysterious woman? How does the missing hiker tie in? UFO's? The Sand Giant? What about...? What about...? What about...? Qwill never gave Polly the embroidery he had framed. I am more confused now than I was midway through the book. How did this ever get past an editor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat Who Saw Stars","review":"Surely Ms. Braun is not writing these books anymore. I was so saddened by this one that I went back and read earlier ones, e.g. The Cat Who Saw Red. There is no comparison. Ms. Braun's earlier Qwill is full of character as is KoKo and Yum Yum. In this one, Qwill is a characture of his earlier self, KoKo and Yum Yum are simply small details. Please stop writing, Ms. Braun, if this is your work. Don't diminish your endearing early work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"This is the first book I have ever read by this author and well ... I am very disappointed.

The others can't possibly be worse than this one, can they?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cat Who","review":"Not too long ago, i read another detective book that slightly trashed \\"the cat series\\". Being a cat-lover, i was somewhat upset because i do believe cats to be prescient. Lilian Jackson Braun never fails with the series. Q is especially divulging with his character, which i enjoyed because he seemed more human in this book. A few loose ends were not tied up, but all in all this was an entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not up to usual standards...","review":"Disapointing. Where is Koko's solution? Where are the clues that solve the case that we poor blind humans miss? I love the series, but this is the bottom... sure hope the next one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"STARS never made it off the ground","review":"I found the ending so incredibly disappointing that I re-checked the cover, to be sure LJB was indeed the author. Had she simply run out of time, so tacked on that messy and juvenile \\"explanation,\\" with the rider that Qwill is re-thinking his own disbelief? WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO THE HIKER? Why is Arch Riker so bi-polar in this one? The one high point, for me, was the explanation of home schooling, but otherwise... <shrug> Get it at the library; don't invest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the cats","review":"I've read all of the books in the series. After I read the first one I just kept going and read all of them in a year. I was very disappointed in the lack of including the \\"antics\\" of the cats. I have 2 cats also and enjoy reading about how they communicate to Quill. Hopefully her next book will enclude more about the cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is more of an outline than a finished work.","review":"Lillian Jackson Braun latest in the Cat Who series is a real disappointment. The characters have nothing to do, including Koko and Yum-Yum, and Qwilleren himself is reduced to exhibiting unprovoked anger and plodding aimlessly through town. This book is nothing more than a preliminary sketch and sorely lacks the polish and charm of Braun's previous works. The early books when Qwill was still Down Below are by far Braun's best writing and are true to the mystery genre. Sadly,this book doesn't even resemble the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This series is now running on empty!","review":"I've read all of The Cat Who books and enjoyed most of them until The Cat Who Saw Stars. It was not well written (awkward dialogue and set up of dialogue, lack of atmosphere). When I finished the book I decided to reread an earlier one (The Cat Who Sniffed Glue) for comparison. I found the older book to be a more interesting story with better dialogue, more colorful characters and descriptions, AND, (a drum roll, please) the mystery was solved at the conclusion! My suspicion is that the author is finally near the end of her contract to produce stories of characters and a place that no longer interest her and I can understand that (although I sure will miss Qwill's keen observations of country folk and mores). Good grief, even Polly has turned into a Stepford girlfriend!

It has the same things as the others: word families, roots, stories, and exercises. However, the \\"thinking with your new words\\" section is genius! It's the best exercise I've seen which aids one's \\"recall.\\" Having to take a description or phrase and narrow it down to a specific word instead of vice versa (determining a single word's meaning from the surrounding context) is the best way to add and retain/recall words to one's SPEAKING vocabulary (we all have one in addition to reading and writing). It's this part of our vocabulary which is the sorely lacking. I wish the authors would do a newer and bigger book with more words and with only this type of exercise (by the way, how could I get in touch with them to offer this suggestion?). We'd all be (like the Victorians who raised the art of conversation to unparalleled heights) a lot more eloquent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful way to learn new words","review":"This book taught me many new words that are valuable for everyday conversation. It is divided into different categories such as: number words, medical words, words from other languages, figurative expressions, etc. The authors give a definition and a sentence for each new word. They give exercises to help you master the words. The book also tells the history of some words which is often a good way to remember the word. However, sometimes these can get boring since they are all basically the same. I used this book to study for spelling bees, and I recommend it to students and adults alike.

The low price, high picture and sound quality and plethora of neat extras make this a no-brainer for any fans of these films.

There is only a brief passage or two to tie it in with the story arc from the books before and after. This is not enough to make you care about the secondary characters or the world they inhabit. I love Doctor Who and have read all of the books since the original Target books, but I had to work to maintain my interest in this one. It is important for the story arc, but not much else goes on to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space - The Final Frontier?????","review":"One word to describe this novel - BLAND. The subject matter is about two rival gangs of the 60's, the Mods and Rockers, taken to \`the future' by an alien race where they wage a war on each other that keeps going on and on and on. The \`future' environment they are in consists of buildings and robots and weapons you would expect to find in a 60's comic magazine. I'm thinking that the tone and subject matter of this novel would have fit better with a 2nd Doctor adventure rather than an 8th Doctor one. The characterisation of the Doctor and Fitz are great though and Compassion is hardly even in the book. But of all the other characters - they are just really annoying and frustrating.

All of the characters are richly drawn and real to life. Unlike many books written these days you really do not know how it will end. Will they admit their feelings for each other? And if they do, will they still in the end to back to their ex's out of guilt or fear? This book is a roller coaster ride that I highly recommend.

The only story line is that two women meet and fall in love and are hounded by both their ex-lovers. The two protagonists are nauseating, completely clueless and, it has to be said, not very bright. Quite clear that the author has absolutely no business sense, knowledge or experience. The peripheral characters are all one dimensional - either aggressive stalkers, mean spirited homophobes or overly sweet and self sacrificing.I just cannot believe the 4.5 star rating. Just because we're looking for lesbian based fiction does not mean we should settle for badly written (and I mean very badly written), shallow, boring pap.Buy this book at your own risk.

People either 'didn't get it' with this one, or just stopped listening after the novelty of the first album wore off.

Hypnotic and infectious, this one will get to ya. I want to hear it loud on a club sound system with the bass boosted! This one song redeems the entire album, despite a kinda cheesy intro and coda.

They are notorious for ending the release of a series after a season or two. Some real geniuses working there. I'm now stuck with partial runs of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Night Gallery, etc... and now Cannon. If you like to collect full runs of classic TV shows like I do, it's almost better not to buy the first seasons from Universal/Paramount in the first place.

Well, \\"Elmore Leonard's Criminal Record,\\" a 1993 BBC documentary shows us the man behind the curtain. Over a dozen of Leonard's novels have made it to the silver screen and if you wondered why his books seems so adaptable the answer is that the author researches his characters by watching videotaped interviews with cops, judges, bail bondsmen and the like. You also get the bonus of Leonard reading from \\"Killshot\\" and other favorites. This is one of the few documentaries on a contemporary writer that actually gives you some insights.

I bought this chair only 1 month ago thinking that it would be great to keep in the car but now I will not be using it anymore. What a waste of money. I can't even return it because I no longer have the original packaging. Don't waste your money. Buy the bulkier Fisher Price travel chair - I have that one and it works much better.

Anyway, as a harried parent of a toddler, it is ridiculous to have to worry about inflating a seat while your child is busy trying to escape from your clutches (especially when you are alone, as I am).

Highly recommended for traveling.","review":"I bought 2 of these to travel 3 weeks in Europe with my 2-year-old twins. They were the most utilized items since Europeans don't normally have high chairs for babies.The designer put a lot of thoughts into creating these booster seats. To inflate the seat, simply remove the plug from the cushion. To deflate, you sit on the cushion to \\"squish\\" all the air out. There are 2 sets of straps that tie to the back and bottom of the chair to keep the seat in place. A reviewer mentioned that her child \\"wobbled\\" in the seat. That just needs some manual adjustments to upright the seat and the child. The straps need to be tightened to keep the child and the sit in place.We were very pleased to have these seats with us.

No matter where I installed it or how I installed it that chair could flip around with my daughter in it. It actually did!2. It doesn't fit well in every chair. Depending on the dinning room chair size you will be able to use this booster or not.3. After constant use the chair doesn't stay inflated.Overall, don't waste your money on this booster seat!

It really only added a few inches to the height of the chair. We've never had a highchair at home; we've always used a Fisher Price Healthy Care booster (which we LOVE). That seat works great at local restaurants and friend's houses. We were looking for a light-weight alternative for international travel and found the First Years booster to just be too short for our son to actually feed himself. Might work well for a child at 2 years OR if you mostly feed your child (instead of having him/her self-feed with utensils or hands). Too bad because it is a nice little compact product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy","review":"I bought this seat when we went on a trip and I knew we would need something for the hotel (my daughter likes to be fed first thing in the morning).

Tucking the straps back inside when done is my only problem. It always takes a minute or two to get them to stay in the pockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Booster seat.","review":"I bought this booster seat after my 17 month old daughter simply refused to sit in her high chair and would want to sit with us on the table.

The first time we used it for a meal my son was able to kick his legs up against the table and also lean over the side to the point he would have fallen over. If i wasn't there next to him he would have fallen to the floor. Luckily I only spent 2 bucks on it.

I bought it when I traveled overseas and needed a small seat that would fit in my luggage and not take too much space. I was amazed how sturdy, easy to clean and safe this seat is. So you can have an idea how well strapped it is, my son was throwing a tantrun at the table when he pushed himself away from the table with his feet, the chair tipped over. He was still strapped and on place, he only fell because the chair he was on had a very light weight. We not only use it for eatting out but also at home.

The price is also great :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"We just did a 2 week vacation with our 11 month old twins with two of these. They were really invaluable as we visited different family and friends' houses and stayed in a hotel. We had no problem with the inflation. There were a few things about it that keep us from rating it a 5 star: the straps are not detachable for a thorough cleaning and there are no shoulder harness straps so the babies were constantly leaning all over the place making it hard to feed them, but we never felt they were unsafe. It was very nice that they were boosted up to table height, which several other seats we considered didn't have that ability. If you're going to use this for local use, I'd recommend a booster seat with a tray to help keep the babies in place and an easier feeding situation.

She felt VERY insecure it in, even pushed up to the table. She would cry when I placed her in it. Because it is not enclosed I think for the first time she could tell how high up off the floor she was. She is a great sitter but the side strapes are not very securing either, and at the tightest she still would lean over to the side. I think this product will be better for her when she is older, when she is able to almost sit like a big girl at the dinner table. I also do not feel that it inflates well, and sinks down towards the back, tilting her backwards. I do plan to keep this item for the future and perhaps I will review it again when she is older."},{"rating":"1","title":"not thrilled","review":"We bought this chair to use as an everyday booster seat for our toddler. I found it quite easy to attach to a chair (and remove and reattach when traveling). However, after only a short period of use, the chair became very lopsided and will not sit straight. We have a second one at Grandma's house which does the same thing. Also, the chair stains very easily and is quite difficult to clean. Crumbs are forever trapped between the seat and the back/sides. We attached the seat to our dining room chair, and the way the booster rubs against the wood removed the finish from our chair.Overall, this product is priced well, and would be fine if you only plan to use it once in a while. Now that our second child is ready for a booster, I'm looking for a solid plastic chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not great","review":"It was okay, but not the absolute best.

Two of Ali's greatest fights 'Rumble in the Jungle' and 'Thirller in Manilla' are treated like any other fight, with no emphasis on their importance in Ali's career.

Burns (especiallly) gives the performance of a lifetime at age 83, while Carney and Strasberg cemented their legendary status even further in this enjoyable film depicting what life can be like for three old men, and the sudden radical idea to get attention and have the time of their lives. These guys decide to rob a bank, and when the bank manager doesn't take them seriously, Burns fires a shot at the clock, thus sending a message that the elderly aren't to be taken for granted. The guys wind up netting a lot of money, but the thrill and adrenaline rush turns to stress which takes a toll on Strasberg and Carney, while Burns survives and goes to jail. This movie has humor, emotion, drama, and an overall human touch to it. I recommend this movie for those who want to see something outside the box. This is a very memorable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Caper Film for the Young and Old","review":"\\"Going In Style\\" is one of those rare movies that has a clever concept as well as a character-driven story. Burns, Carney, and Strasberg all give fine performances as three retirees who decide to spice up their dull lives by robbing a bank.This film proves that youngsters can enjoy a movie about oldsters when the characters in it try to find a way to feel young again.The DVD also has interviews with Art Carney and George Burns on the Dinah Shore show, which is very funny. I would have liked to see more features, though, like commentary by writer/director Martin Brest. Otherwise, a great caper movie for the young and young at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See!","review":"I really liked this movie. It had a great cast and a memorable storyline.

A woman, who has had a brief affair with a man supsected to be a left-wing terrorist is arrested by the police, who want to link her to terrorism as well. Despite the aggressive attempts by the interrogating police officers to talk her into submission and to strip her of her dignity, they fail to produce anything of value to their alleged case. The press, however, (symbolized as a sensation-hungry tabloid, modelled after the German daily \\"Bild\\") manages in a smear campaign to \\"indict\\" her in public.This is a very powerful, maybe a little bit outdated movie, where an incredibly great cast had been assembled: Angela winkler in the title role (she also stars in \\"The Tin Drum\\"), Mario Adorf as a police officer, and Heinz Bennent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum","review":"Tense, taut suspenser presents an object lesson on the nature of presumed guilt, and the corrosive power of the media, working with a police force desperate for \\"results', to virtually destroy the life of an innocent person.

Personally I can take or leave the remixes, but the two new songs make this a worthwhile purchase. \\"Coming up for air\\" & \\"Bring me back to your love\\" were both good enough to be included on the superb \\"Love this city\\" album but were left off because they are both love songs and Tim didn't want too many songs about the same thing.

However I don't think you can ever have too many love songs, especially if there as good as these two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Movie, but worth it.","review":"This Film does a great job of giving the viewer much insight to the other perspective: Fidel's. Also his motives, attitude toward the United States and his way of thinking. It is a rather long movie, but one must consider that the film must cover a large portion of history that is also very detailed. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD - COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER","review":"This is a well-researched and ambitious production. Good for those just getting into the Cuban Revolution, and also for those of us who have followed it for years. It suffers from choppy editing, a common problem of TV-movies. Mr. Martin's characterization of Fidel is basically sound, though a bit underplayed at times - when Fidel is wound up he's a real fireater and this is why his audiences endure those 3-4 hour speeches. My major criticism of the script would be the abrupt manner in which Castro suddenly announces \\"I want to build a Marxist-Leninist state\\" - before any relations with the USSR and its expression of commitment to him. This is completely unhistorical. Other things that I would have included as a scriptwriter were, in turn, not raised - such as his university activism - but I can understand time limits in trying to compress a dramatic life and subject into a two-hour screenplay. Overall an enjoyable production."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST COASTERS COMPILATION FOR THE PRICE!","review":"This 10-track A & M collection is a good buy for those of you who want the well-known broadcast versions of the Coasters' hit songs.

One of my favorite songs was that ridiculously silly \\"Barbie Girl\\" song by Aqua. I loved the song so much that I bought the single of the song (prior to their studio album). I really wasn't big on the remixes. I did like the extended version but Spike's Anatomically Correct Dub and Plastic Mix were repetitive and quickly got on my nerves. I have never liked dub mixes. They are pointless IMO. What I didn't like about Spike's Plastic Mix of the song was the repetitive introduction to the song but eventually once the vocals kicked in, I started getting into the song. Still I think the remix could have been done better maybe by someone like Tony Moran who manages to turn Celine Dion's cheesy \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" into a great dance song. Seven years later, I can't believe I liked this tripe but you got to admit that it was addictively catchy and hard not to sing along to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aqua Lover","review":"When i first heard the album version i thought it was cute and funny.

Obviously, she has no personal knowledge of Lincoln. Her attacks are based on hearsay and stereotypess of America. Like many English writers, she thinks we are all yahoos and cowboys. Someone should remind her that those yahoos and cowboys have been subsidizing England since 1916, saved it from defeat in WW I and WW II, rebuilt its economy, landed men on the moon and won the cold war. A recent poll showed that 45% of the English would move to America if they had an opportunity. Instead of attacking us, Morris should focus her ascerbic wit on the degenerate Rnglish royal family and landed aristocracy. and the feckless Labour Party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"What a disappointment. Hoping to gain some insight or, at a minimum, a different perspective on Lincoln, I eagerly began this short volume. Rather than finding either of those, I found a work without scholarship or particular insight, and with an annoying point of view. Morris' \\"search\\" includes a number of historical inaccuracies as well as several sheer speculations (Lincoln as homosexual) without citing them as speculative and without providing a scintilla of evidence. As biography the book is shallow; as travelogue it is colorless; and as commentary it is simplistic at best---condescending to the reader at worst. Morris must have phoned this one in as its quality in no way approaches his/her earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Telling About The Author","review":"Ms. Morris' American animus is a leitmotiv throughout the book.

Ms. Morris attempts to put down America and Mr. Lincoln with very scathing and pompous words throughout the book.

She states that she could not find a bookstore in Kentucky. Ms. Morris I have news for you. I bought this book in Kentucky, and believe it or not, at a bookstore. The bookstore thought so much of this book that I paid $2.00 for it. I wasted my money. This book should be used for firewood.

This one is very comparable to the $5 travel chess set you can buy anywhere in terms of useability. It may all be hand-made but the individual components are not weighted, not felt-based, have lathe-buds on the bases so they aren't even stable unless you sand them down yourself.This is a cheap set.

Witches are not normally the sexy seductress, but instead were the ugly crones who have no way to defend themselves. The inquisition stepped in to help bring about confessions, and without basic civil legal rights, the condemned was usually convicted through confessions.This movie shows the whole gamut of events. The sick child, the succubus, the trials, the temptations, and the trials. There are no real special effects, but it kind of amazes me that no other film has attempted to cover this same subject as this film does.

Nothing ever came of it and Ratoff died owning the rights. It later passed to former agent Charlie Feldman. When Feldman could not obtain the services of Sean Connery (still under contract to Cubby Broccoli & Harry Saltzman), he decided to make a spoof instead. His instructions to Terry Southern and the other writers was to \\"throw out the plot\\" -- inwhich they thoroughly succeeded. Large cast of well known actors, several different directors and an imprehensible waste of time -- even with Woody Allen, Peter Sellers and Orson Welles. For a completist only. If you want a spoof watch Derek Flint, Matt Helm or Austin Powers."},{"rating":"1","title":"1960s Train Wreck","review":"I think part of the attraction of this movie is its distinctive Sixties elements. So psychedelic, so mod, such intrigue. The music and clothes and sexy women.But CASINO ROYALE is a disaster as a film and a comedy. It's AUSTIN POWERS without the laughs.It's such a disaster that the star, the emotionally-disturbed Peter Sellers, walked off the movie and they never stopped the production. (Depending on which books you read, Sellers walked off either after his dead mother visited him in a dream to tell him to, or when Orson Welles mistook him for Woody Allen at an elevator and he ran off in a huff).David Niven is then forced to carry on the chaos as it noisily crashes to its climax, the kind of madness that would be much better used in BLAZING SADDLES seven years later.There are moments, but very few. Woody Allen's part at the end at last hits on the zaniness that should've been there from the start.Only for pure Sixties nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"No reason to exist","review":"Other than being a spoof of James Bond there is no reason for this movie.

It seems as if every time it can't get any crazier, some new unbelievable thing happens that escalates until that very strange fight at the end. While this definitely isn't the best take on the book Casino Royale, it sure is fun to watch. It seems like the kind of thing where whenever the directors had some strange idea, they said \\"What the heck!\\" and threw it into the movie. This is definitely a great movie to watch. Just be prepared for anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casino Royale DVD-original version","review":"This is the original version of this film with David Niven, Peter Sellers, Woody Allen and other very familiar faces. The film is nothing at all like the 2006 version which was very good. But Ian Fleming intended his 007 to be a non-serious serious agent. Excellent film and I heartily recommend it. My 20-something grandson is a 007 fan and he really liked this movie; had to have the DVD after seeing it on TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ill-Fated 007 Spoof With Few Laughs","review":"Originally intended as a Peter Sellers vehicle, \\"Casino Royale\\" (1967) became something radically different when the mercurial comic actor abandoned the project before its completion. Rather than throw in the towel, producer Charles Feldman threw away more millions to salvage the unsalvageable. Hence the multiple directors and numerous guest stars filling in the gaps left by Sellers' departure. The result is an extravagant mess. Sellers provides the best moments in this ill-fated 007 spoof - highlighted by the baccarat sequence with Orson Welles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's George Lazenby When You Need Him?","review":"This alleged spoof of Bond films is outright stuporous. Absolutely nothing works here. I found my attention waning while watching this film and having to pinch myself to stay awake. I think I drew blood. There are wall-to-wall \\"gags\\" here and none of them are funny. It took five count 'em five directors and three screenwriters to concoct this abomination and it shows. There is no fluency in the direction and the story is downright incoherent. The film's few saving graces is that David Niven and Peter Sellers escape with their reputations intact. There's a pretty good Bacharach-David score here but too bad it's not in the service of a better picture. Ian Fleming must be rolling in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the sound track instead","review":"It's a star-studded cast, but the story line lags badly in several places leaving the viewer wondering when the movie will finally end.

That much can be said for it. There are some scenes with Ursula Andress, especially, that are very funny, and the beginning isn't without its humor. However, in general it is a mess of movie; loosely constructed, making little to no sense, and, what is worst of all, not even all that funny. I had to fight off sleep to keep consciousness during the movie, something I almost never have to do. I actually got to the point where I couldn't wait for it to end.

BORING NONSENSE","review":"First they made a nonsensical movie starring Peter Sellers called WHATS NEW PUSSYCAT, sooooo they figured they could get away with it again only this time they could add the JAMES BOND moniker to the title and reap lots of $$ on an unsuspecting audience. This is the worse movie I have ever tried to watch, in fact I couldn't, I had to turn it off half way through. James Bond, what James Bond?? Stupid, not funny, not even silly, with no plot. Two of my guests fell asleep after 30 minutes of viewing. Don't waste your hard earned money on this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak Bond parody...","review":"\\"Casino Royale\\" is the most confused Bond film ever created. It is a comedy based on the first Bond book with a stellar cast, but an awful script and an excruciating runtime. It's hard for me to watch this film without falling asleep. So much of it fails to generate anything that could possibly be entertaining. There are occasional funny parts and a couple of entertaining moments, but the movie feels like an over-budgeted flop. David Niven makes a lousy 007 who is mostly bumbling and completely unbelievable. Ian Fleming is turning in his grave... but he does flips with \\"A View to a Kill,\\" which is worse than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash","review":"The unfunniest comedy ever made.

I knew it was a bad sign when I couldn't understand the plot as it was described on the back of the box! Woody Allen does the most he can with his 20 minutes of screen time, and I'll always watch Peter Sellers, but the film is just so confusing that these great performances are lost in a mishmash of bright colors and bizarre visuals. Stay away and check out the far superior Austin Powers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casino Un-Royale","review":"Spend your money on popcorn, not this film. The story is poor at best, acting is so-so, and the theme is awful. Sellers and Niven are much better actors than portrayed here. This is a horrible movie. Nothing to do with a \\"007 James Bond\\" type film at all. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required viewing for all 007 fans","review":"Even though this is a spoof of the ever popular and everlasting James Bond film dynasty, it is the first full length film version of the Ian Fleming novel. It is not the first time though that 007 made the American screen if you count the TV version of Casino Royale with Barry Nelson as 007. With three different James Bonds (David Niven, Woody Allen, Peter Sellers), in one film and some great Bond Girls, it add an award nominated Burt Bacharach music score (The look of love). Many of the film's actors/actresses were in previous or subsequent 007 films and one went on to play the most galactic villain of all time: Darth Vader.This film was indeed entertaining especially to see all the well-known actors/actresses all together in one film. None of the iconic James Bond film gimmicks or puns might disappoint the dedicated Bond fans; so I rated it a 4 instead of 5. but it has so much other credits to compensate for that. Read all those details here: [...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Pay Too Much For This","review":"I knew this was a spoof, but I bought it anyway since I'm a huge Bond fan.

We were expecting an actual BOND movie, with suspense, etc. And then we ended up watching this poor attempt at slapstick satire. It's \\"What's New Pussycat\\" warmed over. (And I don't even like \\"What's New Pussycat,\\" even though Peter O'Toole is my favorite actor.) I will say Herb Albert's theme song is brilliant, and almost worth the price of the video, alone. I love that theme song!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish!","review":"British comedy of the 1960s is pretty cheesy at the best of times, think 'Carry On...' but this one, Casono Royale, is just mindless pap. Sellers, Niven, Wells and Andress do nothing to uplift this trash for me. And oh dear, as that Woody Allen? It's so awful, it makes Austin Powers look GOOD! Long, overplayed sequences and gags so devoid of humour, they sound as though they were lifted directly out of 'The Goon Show.'

If you happened to be passing by a tv with this movie on, run away.Part 1, the stupid premise - more than one James Bond. Part 2, the part in Scotland - too long, too much talking, nothing happens, it degrades into a drunk fest. Part 3, the middle mess.

About half way through the movie it becomes so absurd that it is not funny.To make things worse this movie is upheld as the funniest spoof on James Bond.

People are actually upset that someone dared to make fun of James Bond. Give me a break how seriously can we take it after Timothy Dalton played 007 ?The history given in one review does lead you to believe some of this movie was playing \\"catch-up\\" and no it's not hilarious but definitely funny and as someone who has seen every commercially successful Bond including R.Moore, S.Connery , T. Dalton, P. Brosnan and G. Lazenby this is funny. You can definitely see \\"Austin Powers\\" in it as well as a few other movies, but one must keep in mind this is british humor so you won't be slapping your knee or falling off the sofa.Frankly, I have more of an issue with Daniel Craig playing the early Bond instead of some younger Brit, but he was excellent in \\"Layer Cake\\" so I guess we'll give him a chance although not thrilled with Eva Green as Vespa Lynd, she's no Ursula Andress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silliness can be taken too far.","review":"Great cast, cinematography, and great location shots in Scotland and England, but really - the movie is just TOO silly.

Yet it is surprisingly accurate (for a parody) when compared to the book of the same name-- especially in the card game scene.

It's not an action flick, but a bizarre and brainy spoof. Woody Allen (in his first film role) is the evil villian (?!). Towards the end he accidentally swallows an atomic pill of his own design. When he hiccups, little atomic smoke rings come out of his mouth. He has 100 hiccups until the pill detonates. Bizarre! This is really an ultra mod, whacked out, 1967 hippie flick.

It has a few catchy guitar riffs and thats about it. The singer has talent, but all of the band put together just doesn't sound that great. They abuse affects and all of the songs sound really similar to me.

CKY comes through with this in Infiltrate.Destroy.Rebuild. Through the entire CD catchy riffs from Darren Miller partnered with his tough sketchy vocals make every song amazing.This is very evident in Escape from hellview, flesh into gear, Inhuman Creation Station, and Attached at the hip. while the others prove to be in a state of melancholy, an atmospheric touch. But this enhances the quality of the CD and proves CKY to be extremly diverse. note close yet far as a nice calm end to the Album, leaving you standing in amazment at CKYs growth since Volume 2"},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd","review":"this cd was pretty well done. it has pretty good songs and it starts off with escape from hellview and thats an awesome song, but i would have to say that flesh into gear is my favorite song on this album. i think if cky made a little more harder music they would be alot better. i want to get there new cd and hopefully its better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"cky I.D.R. is the best album ever!","review":"This album is great.

Not only will you get a disc that you can listen to the whole way thru, over and over again, but you will be part of a vangard that aims to make a change in the music business. these boys don't take no for an answer, and thanks to that, you have a great package to listen to, read, and enjoy. i admit im a little biased, being so into cKy and all, but objectively, if you listen to this album even once, yer gonna want to hear it a million times. subtle nuances and unorthodox(for now)production techniques creep up from every sonic corner. theres more stuff buried in this album then the local graveyard. cKy's Infiltrate Destroy Rebuild...you'll fall in love all over again for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"The second CD of CKy shows a definite growth. These guys have managed to add wonderful vocal melodies and harmonies to their riff-based heavy music. It also presents a variety of different sounds, just as the first album did.

It's a CD that shows they are more than a group that makes music for skater movies, and it represents a step in the right direction for rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best band ever","review":"I honestly dont know what the hell al's talking about this c.d. is one of the best ive ever bought"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Results","review":"I'll start by saying before I heard this I had little to no interest in this CD, and by the time I was done listening to it I was hooked. Lyricaly this is a great album with great hooks and so on, and let me say it's unusual to find a more mainstream band that really knows how to vary it's instrumentals. The overall feeling of influence from Black Sabbath, Metallica and other great metal acts comes off really well. Only complaint is the Vocalist needs have more impact on his vocals during certain parts, otherwise great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent a must buy","review":"ok i had been meaning to buy the first CD but had no money and when i have my b-day i bought volume 1 i couldnt stop listening to it for days then like a week later i bout infiltrate destroy rebuild and it blew me away it was so original and kickass its impossible to stop listening to it YOU SHOULD ALL BUY THIS CD ITS WORTH THE 11.99 YOU'LL SPEND 5 stars excellent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for any rock + roller.","review":"From local legend to rock phenomenon, CKY is at the top of the charts, and it feels good to be at the top, because on the bottom it doesnt. The newest addition to the CKY series is by far the best production by the band and thought so by themselves as well. Along with the sick riffs and vocals, the purpose of INFILTRATE. DESTROY. REBUILD. is to change the current state of all the ...[bad] music that is being shoved down all of the youths throte by MTV. Join the cky alliance ... and be a part of the coming change !

After shopping around i found this album/dvd combination for 8 (around $20 USD) and i instantly fell in love with it. Opening song \\"Escape From Hellview\\" just blew me away, and intelligent songs like \\"Sporadic Movement\\" and \\"Attached At The Hip\\" surprised me from what i thought would just be a dumb spinoff (Cky is a sideproject from Jackass star Bam Margera). Best Moment is during \\"Sporadic Movement\\", when it goes quiet near the end, before lead singer Deron Miller croons \\"I am Sporadic Movement, You Are Sporadic....\\" then screams \\"A TRANSFORMATION!\\" and holds it for about 25 seconds!A Must Have for any rock or even metal fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IDR is a masterpiece","review":"cKy's latest album Infiltrate Destroy Rebuild is everything I expected and a hell of a lot more!there are no words to explain this album, from start to finish it is a work of geniuscKy is by far the most creative band today in a sea of bands who sound exactly the same"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to a new beginning...","review":"This is what \\"new\\" rock SHOULD sound like. I picked up this album on one recommendation I read in Blender when the album first came out, and it hasn't left my side yet. The songs are so well thought out and intelligent. They can settle your nerves or make you bounce off the walls, depending on your mood. If you only buy one rock album this year, this should be the one. This is a must have album.Standout tracks on the album are \\"Escape From Hellview\\", \\"Flesh Into Gear\\", \\"Attached At The Hip\\", \\"Sporadic Movement\\" and the album closes on a mellow vibe with \\"Close Yet Far\\".

The songs are mediocre and their lyrics are simple and childish. They need to quit preaching their superiority for they are not superior over anything.

NONE!It seems like those stuck on this program (Finale) have been using it for so long that switching to something new would be ridiculous, and I guess I can understand that because I was an Encore cross-over and it took me a long time to wean myself from that program... but I really had no choice.I gave several programs a chance, including Finale, but I'm musically savvy and not much of a computer person, so Sibelius was a dream come true.I think the best notation program is one that allows me to be musical, not technical. Musical = Sibelius. Technical = Finale. Choose the one that's right for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually Zero Stars","review":"Finale. Grrr. This software is badly designed. It is too hard to learn (I can't be that stupid, I did graduate from Yale). It doesn't make sense. It doesn't conform to straight forward software behavior standards that we expect like with Word, Photoshop, Pro Tools, etc. It looks kind of old and dumpy in the interface. Way too many buttons and toolbars and dialog boxes. Like the program itself, the Help is difficult to navigate and hard to decipher. There is a new version every year - but the usability doesn't ever improve - except for really simple things. (They added a \\"Start New Score\\" wizard. Oh boy!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy and Poor Value","review":"Finale 2004, even with the update, is incredibly buggy.Avoid it.

With maturity and age, so many social critics become more resigned to accepting things as they are, more inclined toward polite disagreement. Not Jarvis Cocker. He's been away for a while watching, sharpening his pen, and perfecting the art of the musical withering sneer. Every song on this release combines an underlying world-weary heartache with intelligent moral outrage and thought-provoking juxtapositions. Who else can get away with referencing Auschwitz and Frigidaires in a pop song to which you can't help singing along? It's unfortunate, though, that the song that most succinctly sums up the state of things (\\"Running the World\\")is the hidden bonus track on the US release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well!","review":"I bought 2 of these.

I knew that this product would provide an adequate thermal barrier between my notebook computer and my legs. I wasn't sure how much cooler the computer would run.

I would recommend this approach over any of the fan-based cooling pads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quietly simple","review":"Laptop heat, we experience it and the normal response is a fan-powered cooling pad. I wanted something that did not use power from my USB ports, was portable and quiet. The ixoft pad meets those requirements, simply place you laptop on the pad that's it! Any heat generated is absorbed into the structure of the pad, your unit stays cooler (mine seems to) and when finished simply stow the pad in you bag with the laptop. Additional advantages, the pad works with netbooks, laptops and also provides a cushioned 'lap desk' for the user who places their laptop on their lap. Try that with a rigid cooling pad, oh and don't forget those USB cables that tie the two together. I recommend this pad, it has solved my heat problem. Thanks, Termaltalke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I downloaded a core temperature module for the PC to evaluate the claim of this product. Several days of testing indicated that this product made no difference when used or not used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concept, but not as good as active cooling","review":"The idea of passive cooling is a great concept, but it doesn't work that well in reality. The i-Xoft basically acts as a pad to shift heat away from hot areas of your laptop, pretty much like how heat pipes work. It also makes your laptop bearable to use on your lap, as the underside is much cooler than the top.I have a Thinkpad T60p and it doesn't make it as cool as an active laptop fan. I guess it does lower the temperature of the CPU area a little and it's the only passive cooler on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good album by a ex spider from Mars.","review":"Mick Ronson was and will always be a great backup musician. He is primary known as the lead guitarist for David Bowie band the Spider from Mars. This all ended one night in the 1970s, when at the end of the concert, he announced to the band and the concert goers that he was disbanding the Spiders. After night he recorded two albums and backed up Ian Hunter ( ex of Mott the Hoople.) and Bob Dylan. Of the two albums that he recorded that bared his name; this was by far his best. The songs are upbeat and bouncy. He took his time recording the album and it showed. The best song on the album is Billy Porter. A song he wrote himself. Others he borrowed from Pure Prairie League and Lou Reed.If you was a fan of the British Glam period, this is a welcome addition to you library."},{"rating":"2","title":"fresh & clean rock","review":"mick never got recognize enough in the U.S. .

I wanted to believe that Mick could take his own work to the Bowie level (in hindsight - an unreasonable expectation).But, don't be mislead! This is a classic! Mick does exactly as the title states, he plays on his first solo record without worry. What comes out of it - a fresh sound, that was only his. In my opinion, he never got to the same level of workmanship on his subsequent solo projects.Cheers and Happy Listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"the medic: life and death in the last days of WWII","review":"I was disappointed in this book. Maybe I went into it with too high an expectation. I knew going in, it was a dramatized version of Mr. Litwak's experiences but I expected more insight into his job as a medic. there were relatively few scenes of his actually work. In that way, I would say the title is misleading. It really is a book of one man's army service in Europe during the later days of World War II. He seems to have disliked everyone he served with and Mr. Litwak has the right to be. there were more sex stories than medic stories. the Sgt. Lucca story I thought would help me gain more insight into the author. But it left me looking for more of an explanation of how Mr. Litwak really felt. Did he like the Sgt. or not? He seems to have been hurt by his death but I am not sure.Thebook overall does help one experience WWII from a more realistic standpoint. But a non-fiction approach would have been more of a contribution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your usual combat medic","review":"I was expecting a more in-depth analysis into the combat and mental condition of a medic, but what I got was a long drawn out story of himself. There was no connection w/ his fellow men and if there was, it was just a misconception. Basically, he just want to forget about the war, the horror, and the cruelty behind it. If that is the case, then why write the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Medic Review","review":"I personally feel this book was very interesting. I think it went into great detail of what Leo encountered to give you a mental image or what was going on. It was an easy reader, great for younger individuals such as myself. It was not only about war itself, but other events at the same time. It even included a little romance, which made the plot that much more enjoyable. I thought it was nice he included the letters he wrote back to home. This let readers know that he cares for his family and he ensures them everything is alright so they don't worry about him. Overall, I think this is a great book and I encourage everyone to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I never read far enough into the book to find the enjoyment that others have written about.

Personally, I was disappointed in the lack of emotional power in this book, which is what I was expecting from a first-hand experience of the front lines of WWII. Some of my fellow book-club-members thought the emotional distance was a coping mechanism, but it kept me from getting very interested in the book. I kept waiting for something to *happen*. I wasn't sure what the author was trying to accomplish with the book, unless it was a personal healing process.

Beautifully written, dialog that absolutely sizzles. This isn't an \\"inspirational\\" novel. No God beams or angels with flapping wings appear to hand Joel King a Hollywood-style redemption. Instead this book is filled with outstanding description, emotions, and characters that are at once poignant and so goofy and hilarious, they jump right off the pages. Sa'ad X.

Like real people, he makes you angry at times, he fails and struggles and times, he makes bad decisions along with his good ones, and he has you rooting for him in the end. He's a character who could walk off the pages he seems so genuine. This is a big book but not a preachy one, and the plot comes fast and furious but never seems contrived.

Anyone who likes Deveraux, Western romance, or time travel should give this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"most crazy book ever writen..but a no put down","review":"Jude have a way of creating a story...even if you dont like it you always have to finish it..Legend is really confusing..but yet i love it ..hey i dont know how to write a review or what ever..i just like to say that when i read a Jude Deveraux I feel like i am that person..Like Kady..i Feel like im Kady..but she was lucky..she found her veil guy...unlike me.....Jade"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Legendary Disaster","review":"Blah. That's the only word I can think of to describe this book. Not only unrealistic--yes, I know it's a time-travel romance--but it's not even somewhat believable to a reader with a broad imagination. Just skip this one and move on. You won't be missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit Disappointed....","review":"Okay, I liked the book at first and thought it had promise but somewhere it lost me. I just felt that 3 love interests in a romance novel didn't fit. I was hoping that she would fall in love with cole and then the point would be for her to go back to future and try to save him and then stay with him, or save him and find his direct decendant in the future...someone that may have looked like him, acted like him, etc....this I would believe. She kept saying that Cole was underneath Tarik but that didn't seem the case since they seperated the two characters. The whole thing with Tarik was disappointing after I already got to know Cole. And I agree with previous posts...what was the point of Leonie and Wendall....the fact that he slept with Wendall was a little creepy to me. The ending was just really a disappointment since I loved A Knight in Shining Armor. Oh well, better luck next time I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too Silly of a Story, Deveraux Has Done Better!","review":"I have read much better books by Ms. Deveraux. This was a silly story. The traveling back and forth between 100 years ago and present time became ridiculous and silly. Wasn't very grown up intertainment. There were a few interesting parts to the story but not enough to outway the silliness. I'm quite surprised by the good ratings given by other reviewers of this book. Did they read the same book?? If you want to read a good book by Deveraux that deals with time travel read \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\" and forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, but she couldn't pull it off!","review":"I liked the idea of this heroine being more voluptuous than what you normally see in romance novels. I liked the premise of the time-travel. I felt the author had an opportunity to show how Kady grew and became more confident after her experience in Legend 1873. I had hoped that she would have come back with a new sense of self. Unfortunately she just picked up where she left off. She waited six weeks to finally come to her senses. I couldn't believe the author wanted us to believe that after Ruth begged her to look into her descendants she would just come back to her life as usual. By the time she does meet up with C.T. Jordan in New York the relationship seems forced and completely unbelievable. This was the first book I have read by Jude Deveraux and I really don't understand why she is so popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I was disapointed with this one also. I have also read all of her books, and I don't know, this one was too weird. Maybe I am biased because I don't like time travel stories (though A Knight in Shining Armor wasn't bad)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different!","review":"This book was very different. It was intriguing and thought provoking. I don't think it is that hard to fall in love with 3 different guys! In a sense, it is only 2. Because the 3rd is the ancestor of Cole. It was good, worth the $."},{"rating":"1","title":"TWO DAYS WASTED.","review":"This is one of those novels that would have really worked better as two books. Not only did the heroine fall in love with two guys in the short space of a few weeks- while thinking that she is in love with a third- but the whole book is so bogged down with unnecessary characters and implausible plotlines that it becomes downright confusing at times. The author seems to have lost her sense of direction while writing this book and as a result, the book would have worked better as a farce than as a work of romantic fiction. It simply leaves too many questions unanswered as well as a very dissatisfied feeling in the pit of your stomach.And just who is Kady in love with anyway? Can you really tell?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful book not worth the energy...","review":"Absolutely horrible! This book if possible is even worse than a Knight is Shining Armor. I was quite surprised how bad it was considering some of the reviews it got. This book isn't worth spending money on, after reading it I'd rather have a refund. The main character falls in love with three different men and just keeps hopping around. I found it unrealistic and found myself disapointed when she didn't even end up with Cole. Don't bother to read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted this book to go on and on and on and never end!!","review":"This book was wonderful! I read it in about 3 days but that was just b/c it was so good I wanted to take my time with it,otherwise I would have finished it in a day! I absolutly loved the time traveling in this book and I loved when Kady finally stood up to her loser fiance. But, I was a little dissapointed with the ending ,I just felt with the book being so good that it should have had a spectacular ending,and it was by far spectacualar,still okay none the less. That being said,I'd still recommend this book to anyone and it is one of my favorites by Jude Deveraux!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was TERRIBLE!!!","review":"I'm amazed that so many people enjoyed this book. I was very disappointed by it. The best way that I can think of describing Legend is by calling it LAME and BORING to the highest degree. I am so glad that I borrowed it from the library and didn't waste my money on it. I would give this book zero stars if I could"},{"rating":"1","title":"An ok read, but lacking when compared to a Knight/Armor","review":"I started Ledgend fully expecting it to be a no put downer like the previous Knight/Armor. I was sadly disapointed. The book was not only confusing, but it seemed to jump from one story line to another and dragged in a lot of places. I definitly think that Jude Deveraux can do a lot better. All in all it wasn't a bad book, just not my first choice of an exciting time travel."},{"rating":"1","title":"And then the little boy woke up!....","review":"I am so disappointed in this book! Knight in Shining Armor was excellent. This book has more emotion and time spent on food than on the characters. I found the characters most unsympathetic, the romantic tangles unbelievable, and the time-skipping skips a few in terms of emotional credibility. If you want to read wonderful descriptions of food with emotional impact, read M.F.K. Fisher.If you want a romance that has a hero who is not a jerk, (either one), don't read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I read the entire 374 pages of this book and I would not wish this book on anyone. The writing is amateurish and the story is ludicrous. Jude Deveraux wrote a wonderful book when she wrote \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\". I like some time travel books but this book is not one of them. I could not wait to get to the end of the book but I read to the end to see how this silly story would end. Jude Deveraux needs to return to higher standards as she did when she wrote \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"URGHH I couldn't take it!","review":"I so did not like this book, too many reasons to count. Started off just ok, then got a little interesting, then bam very bad. Im a fan of Jude Deveoux's and other Romance and time travel books, however, this book was really annoying. Just when you think the book is going in one direciton it totally changes, and not for the better. At one point i tossed my copy across the room, my roomates still talk about it. it was just really frustrating and unsastisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you liked Knight in Shining Armor...","review":"you will definitely like Legend. time travel is the best when there is a hot guy involved! you will love elizabeth kady long. she is not your perfect woman, she is a REAL woman with a real body & a real personality & real problems and fears. a girl you can identify with for real! the story takes you on quite an adventure & you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the story line","review":"I don't read romance novels often, only when I want to get away. I don't know a whole lot of the authors, but Deveraux is someone I come back to consistently. My favorite book from her is Knight in Shining Armor, and I believe that Legend shares many of the same elements.The story line was very creative -- gave me goosebumps at several points -- good stuff. Strong humor, something Deveraux does very well. Kady was a likeable character, predictable for some of the book, but the story line made up for that I think. Lots of excellent twists and turns. It was definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual Time-Travel","review":"'Legend' was somewhat different than previous time-travels I've read. Our herione spent just about as much time in the present as in the past. It also was unusual to have a herione that felt that much for more than one guy. (you'll have to read it though to see which one she ends up with!) The story line was definitely unusual, and therefore, I enjoyed it for that reason. I can also say that the story definitely kept moving - it never got stale like a lot of stories do while the characters get to know each other. Also, this is one of those books where you can really see the herione \\"grow\\". She started out a little dippy (& blind!) but she really did grow up and take responsibility for herself, I enjoyed that. Yes, I think 'A Knight In Shining Armor' was better, but I was definitely not disappointed in 'Legend'."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I wouldn't even bother trying to describe the plot of this book because there really isn't one. The story drags on and the love scenes are unoriginal and dull, very unlike Jude Devereux. The main character basically gets transported to different times and places and her actions become very hard to distinguish. The storyline is very hard to follow and there is no climax. Overall, this book was a complete waste of my time and I was very disappointed with Jude Devereux's latest project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"A knight in shining armor was the first dude deveraux book that I read. I loved it and fell in love with time travel. So I rushed to get Legend and Rememberance. I read Legend first but I was really disappointed. I agree that the first half book was great while cole and kady were together. but as soon as cole disapppeared from the storyline, it's getting weird to see how farfetched it was to bring the T man and kady together. So many loose end with no answers. the wedding dress? It would definitely be a GREAT book if she concerntrated just on cole, ghost or not. Now I am afraid that Rememberance will turn out to be the same as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting at the beginning... but then it all falls apart.","review":"I really like Jude Deveraux's books, and when I first started reading LEGEND, I thought I would enjoy this one too. I was wrong. It started out pretty well with an occasional bump or two, but as I read to page 190-something, that whole business with the grandma totally threw me off. I had to read that section over and over again, but still didn't understand the whole thing. If Mrs. Deveraux had kept this book at a simpler level, it would have turned out much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The fonts in the ebook was of different sizes. I can't turn pages due to error. I contacted kindle help and was told that the seller would contact me to get the book corrected and reload. It's been almost one month."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but if you really want a romance...","review":"I'm still listening to Legend, about 3/4 of the way through. It's ok, but starts out really slow. Not sure how it's going to end. I actually picked this book up while I'm waiting on some others I have on reserve. I've been reading some of the other reviews and have to say, if you really want a great romantic/time travel book with some substance, read something by Diana Gabaldon. Better yet, listen to the unabridged audiocassettes read by Davina Porter -- They're OUTSTANDING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book, Now a Favorite","review":"I was lent this book to read by a friend and once I started to read it, I couldn't put it down. Ms. Deveraux kept me interested from begining to end. Since then, I have bought my own copy and have read it several more times, to many to count. To the contrary of what others have said, the second half of the book dealing with Tarik is my favorite. I tend to just read that part now. Kady is a very relateable character in her flaws and I can see a bit of myself in her. I found it interesting to see how she dealt with the situations that she was given. I do admit the part where Ruth Jordan enters the story is confusing, but if you can get past that part, it is worth the read. It is correct that the epilogue doesn't answer everything, but I believe that it's a highly enjoyable book to read. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"i want my money back....","review":"why make me fall in love with cole if he wasnt even the main character? how can u be in love with 3 different men? i dont find that at all romantic. i bought a knight in shining armor for only a dollar and that was one of her best. im surprised to say this but this will be my last jd book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Jude Deveraux is my favorite romance writer.

I'm writing this review simply to defends S&M, and two of the best (among others) songs on this EP. To say that hot bars doesn't flow it ludicrous at best. Bump this track in the summer time with your windows down and life won't get much better. Both of their flows are unparalleled. Granted, there isn't a deep message here; it is such a feel good song though. This track reminds me that everything is all good. Not to mention, when grouch is on the beat, there is rarely--if ever a disappointment. But that is just opinion I suppose. Maybe. Track nine, all I can do, is another S&M classic, with a solid message flowed eloquently over another dope Grouch beat. S&M, especially Murs can flow to fit any mood, they can always make you reflect, and feel good about most any situation. Basically, please be careful when writing CD reviews, there are reputations on the line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bangin!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This EP is tight. Grough really made some of his best beats on here. Also this was the first time I ever heard of MURS. When I saw it on the shelf, I finally bought it. It is good enough to buy and this is why:1) Slug & MURS make good chemistry2) Another Knight3) Suzanne Vega (The best song on here period.)4) Hot Bars (Braggin to da fullest)5) Short and sweet. No filler material.I know the album is kind of old now, but it's still official. It's better than Bubba Sparxx, excuse me Brother Ali.I know he's an albino Muslim of some sorts, but he sucks, FO REAL!!!!!Long story short, FELT #1 is tight.Peace!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD For LL Fans and Rhymesayer Fans Alike","review":"First things first. Slug is the illest MC to ever put a mic in his hand and speak to it. His intelligence that he puts into his music is amazing. There is none better. Add that with MURS, one of the in my mind, two elite members of The Living Legends(Other being Eligh) and you get an instant classic, whether it has 10 tracks, only 7 of which are \\"Full length songs\\" or 22. I would personally rather pay $15 for 7 tracks of influential meaningful music than pay even $10 for 22 tracks of 50 Cent smoking weed, Emeinem hating his mom, and Chingy \\"Ballin\\". In the end, the choice is up to you, make the right one. Support the real Hip-Hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I liked it the first time and watched it several times.

A charming script featuring a bright blue-eyed Goldie Hawn, an elegant Ingrid Bergman and a surprisingly dashing Walter Matthau. Diamond's screenplay sparkles with wit and keeps the emotional dynamics in constant spin. The small ensemble carried this stage play on screen with confidence and energy. Matthau excels again at dumbfounded facial gynastics while Ingrid holds together the love triangle and blooms in the end. A simple yet sassy affair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Comedy 1960s Style","review":"The story is about an easygoing bachelor dentist (Walter Matthau) living within a delicately balance scheme to stay single. His dizzy blond mistress (Goldie Hawn) has no idea he is not married and a failed attempt at suicide secures a promise by Matthau to wed.However, the situation is not simple. Actually, it is quite mixed-up and cooky, as Goldie Hawn refuses to be a home-wrecker, and Matthau must come up with a wife in order for Goldie to reconcile the matter. The dentist's secretary (Ingrid Bergman) poses as the wife and the storyline gets crazier.Set in New York City in the late 1960's, this Goldie Hawn debut appearance wins her The Best Supporting Actress Award."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good comedy","review":"As other reviewers have said, Leonard Maltin is absolutely wrong about this film. The comedy is very tight and well timed. The dialogue is the wittiest of any movie I've seen from the era. It does tend a little toward one-liners, but it doesn't matter because it's fall-out-of-your-seat funny. Ingrid Bergman is divine in a role you would never have expected for her. The signs of the times are ubiquitous -- references to \\"the Pill,\\" \\"hippies,\\" \\"squares,\\" etc., but the comedy is far from dated. The best aspect of the film is its unconventional plot. Romantic comedies are highly predictable as a class -- this one keeps you guessing. Puts even Neil Simon to shame. Highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silt bag works fine.","review":"I purchased the silt bag as an extra for my new polaris.

It's incredibly entertaining. The author makes the myths completely captivating. The price, though, is accuracy. He does take some liberties with the stories, and occasionally stops half way through--I think he did this with the myth of Eros and Psyche: he cut off at the bit where Eros flew away and the castle disappeared. No idea why, the next bit's the best. Anyway, it's a really wonderful introduction to Greek mythology, not dry in the least. I highly recommend it.

If it really bothers me, I'll wedge some paper into the gap to lock it down - it hasn't seemed like a problem so far though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"At first sight, it looks good but its quality is really poor (terrible).

The construction was good and durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"The only thing needed to be perfect were some slip resistant pads for the base of the riser so it would not slide so easily on my desk. They did include these pads for the laptop surface and they work very well. Otherwise, the adjustable height is great and the cord collector works very well. I consider this a bargain based on the price of most other units I looked at. My neck has been saved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for my needs","review":"This riser was exactly what I was looking for. I think the little shelves are pretty worthless so I just left them in the box and they went out with the trash.

Will not slip on desk. Elevates to a good height. Very good value. Keeps laptop cooler.Only slight complaint is that it does not save space all that much.It does, however, help cut down on wire-clutter with the attachable wire-gatherer on the back.As long as you are not looking for a ton of space-saving, this is a great riser for a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I was expecting something sturdier for how much it cost. At $30, I feel ripped off. It's cheap plastic and adjusting it is challenging for fear of breaking the legs.Thinking of putting a laptop on it? It's so deep that their little \\"stick-em non-slip stickers\\" will only touch one end of your laptop. Poor design!I do not recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Usefull","review":"This is an amazing product. I have been using this for about half a year now and I am going to keep using it.Design:-Has many different levels to adjust the height-Has two small detachable trays on the sides to put stuff such as your phone on there to charge-Made of hard plastic, and feels solid-Isn't wobbly or easy to slide on a flat desk-There's a bit of space under this riser so that you can fit items such as a calculator, or sticky notes.-It's fairly lightweight-Some cable management grooves in the back.Portability(doesn't matter too much for me since I usually just leave it on my desk):-Not portable, even with a suitcase-It comes in a box form and it takes up a lot of space-Does not take up a whole lot of spaceOverall, This is a good product for the price. I now fixed my slouching from before and now my neck doesn't hurt when I use my laptop.I would recommend this to people who don't need to take it with them, have a decent amount of space, and like different levels of height."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product, reasonable cost","review":"Works just as I expected and makes my life much easier.

It is an easy read and it is possible to take some good ideas away from it. I agree that our priorities should be God, husband, children, ministry, etc. The problem I have with the book is also in the husband arena. In one area she talks about submitting to your husband in all things, even very small things, like which lamp to buy. I found this hysterical - why would a man who loves you care which lamp you have? My fear with this book is that someone reads it and takes it all as \\"gosple.\\" You need to have a solid head on your sholders to be able to take the good and leave the questionable in this book. I do think that her husband advice probably works if you have a good husband but this advice could be very damaging to a woman who doesn't. This book is our Bible study book now and I'm anxious to see what the other ladies think when we get to the husband section."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"What a wonderful book full of wisdom and insight.

You'll find many insights to help you through your walk with the Lord as you aim to be the woman, wife, & mother who is \\"after God's own heart\\".I liked that she gave scripture so that you could look up the things she was talking about, and I found that this book will make you \\"straighten up and fly right\\" where you may find yourself lacking.You'll probably find yourself highlighting various parts of the book that touched on something you agree with or want to explore further.Do a sister a favor and gift her with a copy.

We had what many would consider to be a good marriage. As a stay-at-home homeschooling mom, my mind always seemed to be on my children...they were my job, my priority. But this book re-framed how I viewed my husband...he is the most important earthly relationship I have...and should be treated as such. This opened my eyes to look for opportunities to pray for him, build him up, remove any stresses that I could and to present him as a Hero to his daughters. When the kids are trained and grown, they will move on. He will still be here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"I loved reading this book. It has improved my spiritual life and daily life.

She shares her deep desire for her own growth and with her fluid and personal style, she invites the reader to dive into God's truth with her. It is an exciting adventure full of discovery and wonder at the beautiful design of the Creator and our personal relationship with Him. The study guides are put together in a very user friendly manner, whether for personal study or study with a group of women. Her Bible book series is very well done, but this book contains great beauty and is foundational to understand about a woman's walk with God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"I ordered this book on Feb 26th it is now Mar 29th and I have yet to recieve it.

No - I can be a Christian woman without all that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Christian Woman","review":"I have had a difficult time finding good, solid books on Christian living for women but this book is one of the few I have come across.

This book really helped me identify the areas of life that I needed to work on to be the woman that God intended me to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!","review":"If you are looking to be a godly woman... a loving wife and mother, then you must have this book. It makes you think, why didn't I see this or do this before? The author has such a pleasant, sweet style of writing. You know your family would be pleased if you followed her guidance. Do not even hesitate to buy this book. It was absolutely wonderful, no question."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE","review":"This is seriously one of the best books I've ever read (apart the Bible which is above all books). Elizabeth gives Biblical reasons for why we should do certain things and then gives practical advice/instructions. I found myself convicted and then inspired. She relates to her readers by sharing personal experiences and how she overcame issues and suggestions for you to do the same. I promise, if you read this book with an open heart that loves the Lord and doing life Biblically, you will NOT walk away empty handed. If I could, I would buy this book for every Christian woman I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a book for today's woman","review":"The book is to old to really do any good in this day and age.

(UNLESS) someone wanted to read 1/4 a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing Book!!","review":"In the midst of struggling in my marriage, this book has changed my life and is wonderful! I've reviewed 2 other books dealing with marriage and neither of them compared to this one. She gets right to the point, makes you struggle with some things because they aren't what we're used to hearing from society, but she challenges you, but everything is very Biblical. So everything she says is just coming from the Bible. Buy this book! It will change your relationship with God and definitely change you for the better of your marriage. Its about you changing, not your husband. Get this book if you want to save your marriage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! This book is dangerous!","review":"My mother in law gave me this book because she thought the title looked nice! I was in shock once I started paging throught it. I am a Christian woman in my 30's, raised in Christian home and I couldn't believe that this book was written in my lifetime. I found it downright disturbing. It is this type of legalistic thinking that drives women insane (quite literally sometimes!) To be so controlled by even a loving husband is unthinkable to me, but what if your husband is a BAD guy! God loves us and wants us to abide by HIS will. Want to know what to do? Get down on your knees and pray, open the bible and search, and yes, discuss things with your husband, trusted friends and family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding God's true design","review":"This book has changed my life tremendously! It lays out in an easy to read format what God calls each of us to do as women.As to the comments about it being a book on being a doormat, God designed us to be our husbands Help Meet, as stated in Genesis. Our husband is to submit to God and we submit to our husband leadership and guidence. Doing this creates a true, God designed marriage. Elizabeth gives great advice and examples of how this can be done.Personally before this book, I struggled with that idea myself being in my early 20's and being taught that women are equal; but when you actually try it and pray for your husband the way God has asked us to, not only does your life change, but the men in your life does as well.I have recently bought another copy of this book to give to my sister-in-law to try to teach her God's calling for her life, and would proudly and quickly recommend it to anyone else who is serious about finding and knowing God's plan for our lives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every woman should read this book!","review":"I purchased this book not knowing anything about the author or having heard of it. It is a GREAT book for any woman to read. It is inspiring and offers suggestions as to how to have the wonderful life each woman wants.

We walked out grossed and white faced. This movie had more toilet jokes than Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, Scary Movie, Freddy Got Fingered all put together. This movie had scenes that would offend anybody. Molly Ringwald swears all the time in this, nothing like her sweet 80s movies like 16 Candles, Pretty In Pink, or The Breakfast Club. She never swore like that before. The whole film did have a couple funny parts in it but was over all disgusting. Save your money! This movie was more than just 18A, it should be Restricted."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worse Movie I Have Ever Seen!!","review":"This is the most disgusting, depraved an all-around putrid move I have ever seen!!! I watch it full-though one time and it just got more and more disgusting and disturbing the later into the movie it got. The whole time, I wanted to throw up. Anyone who finds such ideas as moms and sisters wanting to have sex with their son and brother and a dad trying to pimp them off to him, teenagers being killed and mutilated in brutal, graphic and ridiculous ways, a young girl making out with a woman old enough to be her great, great grandma and having lots of thick saliva being strung from their mouths, or an entire family including parents, grandparents and children watching as a vibrator comes flying out of their teenage girl's vagina *funny* have some serious issues and should seek therapy right away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As tasteless as water...","review":"without any of water's redeeming qualities.I couldn't watch more than thirty minutes before I gave up. The opening scene, of a young girl masterbating with a vibrator when her family walks in, was bad enough. Why did this ... director also have her family pull the blanket off of her? So we could see how the out of control device was firmly imbedded into her private area?

The overall plot line is from Pretty in Pink but that is the best we get. There are all sorts of opportunities through out the film for funny side gags and other stories but the director and screen writers seemed to want to bludgeon the viewers into submission with too many potty gags.I ended up watching only about 55 minutes of the film before I hit fast forward on my DVD player in started skimming.

In practice, the director, uhm, how should I say this...is [poor]. He has absolutely no sense of COMIC TIMING, which is essential in a comedy.

It's fun just to sit back and try to catch all the references, as well as try to peg the oh-so-familiar songs.

I love listening to what people say in the backround of every scene. many of their lines put me to the ground. I just need to say, me being a minor, this movie is not for anyone who is over the age of 25. this movie is deffinatly aimed at kids my age, or inmature adults. I dont watch many teen movies, but iv watched a few, I wont catch alot of the parts in this movie where they make fun of other teen movies, but I still laugh. Bottom line, if you are between the age of 11 and the 18, youll get you kicks, or if you are an inmature adult. but if you are mature, and are moved out, then you will problebly think this movie is stupid, and wonder what happened to te real comedies."},{"rating":"1","title":"I laughed maybe twice during the entire film...","review":"I actually thought that this would be a halfway decent spoof. The previews were hilarious, but they also gave away all of the movie's funniest parts. Aside from a few scenes, none of this was even remotley funny. It was mainly very crude and offensive, and I am sorry to say that I wasted my time watching it. The film borrows it's plot from \\"She's All That\\", in which the popular jock makes a bet to turn the school nerd into the prom queen. From there on, theres nothing but filth. There were two scenes that I laughed at: a spoof of a musical number from \\"Grease\\", and the spoof of the Ricky Fitts character from \\"American Beauty\\". I gave this film two stars basically because the spoof of Ricky was just totally hilarious.If you certainly must see this film, I would advise you to skip it for now, and wait until the video/DVD arrives--or then again, don't bother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Another Teen Movie ROCKS!!","review":"If you grew up watching movies like Pretty in Pink and Ferris like me! then you will LOVE this movie!

If that wasn't great enough the dvd is stacked full of some of the best special features ever. including almost 20 deleted scenes that are all great, test your teen film knowlege quiz, short films, bloopers, original ending... this is the dvd that has it all!

Great entertianment indeed, revolving around the prom queen competition at the John Hughes University. The intrigue is very good, besides the intention to focus on Janey is just good. I particularly liked the beginning of the movie (which clearly sets the tone of the movies ), the secret ending too (incredible story about the departure ), and most other sequences anyway(the private catwalk ending under the staircase; the rebound girl pun , the hand job ; the ugly Catherine character etc.).In the middle of all that, Aerola is a special, unexpected bounty. Catherine really looks familiar to those who have already seen Cruel Intentions, she still wants to ave sex with her brother Sebastian (Jake in this movie).... As to Sandy Sue, she is really a likable and very pleasant character.Of course the quality of the images(and the sound) are outstanding from start to end.A joyful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"Most of the jokes in this movie hit, at least to me, and I am a member of its target audience.

When the movie came out, I remember the previews didn't exactly give off the impression that we were going to see such an incredibly twisted movie, but that's what we got here, folks.If you're a teenager you will LOVE the movie.

The premise of satirizing high school movies was a promising idea but Not Another Teen Movie turned it into a completely dreadful mess. The jokes you can see coming a mile away as it was this crude, vile, filthy potty mouth humor which is suitable for a fifth grader. The trailer for this movie was more entertaining than the entire movie itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well.........","review":"This movie just came on tv.....and I decided to watch it. This movie had a few funny moments, but not very many and despite all the references to the classic 'teen movies' that I love (Pretty In Pink, The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles etc.) I found my attention drifting in and out of the movie and I think I missed about half of it.I liked the cameo by Molly Ringwald, and I love that they used Paul Gleason for the 'Breakfast Club' scene (as he was in the original), and that's about it. The covers of some of the 80's songs were pretty good. But really, besides the few things I liked, there is nothing else good I can say about this movie. It was pretty lame overall.....not one I would buy or wish to see again or ever recommend to someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aims low, but what do you expect","review":"I saw this dvd the other day and I didn't really have high expectations so I wasn't that disappointed. The movie skewers most of the recent teen flicks and even some of the classics from the 1980's. The movie, pretty much follows the story of \\"She's All That,\\" and the few good bits in this movie center around that movie. The rest is mostly unfunny gross out bits that I expect are supposed to appeal to the late teen and early twenty something crowd. Honestly though I think even the target audience will cringe at most of those. I mean a couple of incest gags? A twenty something girl making out with an old lady? Ewwwwwww! The one orginal scene that had me rolling was near the end where the lead character explains to Laney what the future of there relationship would be. That scene alone gives this movie an extra star. There is a cameo by Molly Ringwald that is also cute. Unless you are in the mood for a teenage \\"comedy\\" that relies on grossout, I'd pass on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yup...Just Another Teen Movie!!!","review":"While it starts off well with its spoof (or remake) of American Pie's opening scene, Not Another Teen Movie does not manage to hold up. In fact, it has so little to spoof, it quickly becomes one of the films it's attempting to make fun of. That's never a good sign for a parody. If a comedy is unfunny, then what are the chances that its spoof will be funny? Not much. There are a few good laughs here and there, but definitely nothing we haven't seen before. Some cute references to teen comedies of the past do little to save this mess. This is a very lame attempt because every modern teen comedy has already become a spoof of the superior ones from the 80s. This is just a pointless attempt to cash in on the success of Scary Movie and it just doesn't work, which is a waste, because I felt it had potential. One of the few times I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come On!","review":"Come on seriously. Its like its a movie begging to be bad. It is even worse, if possible, than Scary Movie, which was at least semi-funny. I mean I guess I can see why you might watch it, if you've seen all the movies that it spoofs (which is a lot, although the plot basically follows She's All That), but its really just disgusting. To be honest, if you like this kind of of thing, you might enjoy this but its just palin stupidity if you actually want to see something good.(Oh yeah, one thing I like was that this movie features Good Charlotte, which was kinda cool)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aptly entitled","review":"Well, I had low expectations for this movie, and it delivered on that.It might have been a clever flick, but instead, the makers insisted knocking off a scene or two from about every \\"teen\\" movie in the last 20 years. Therefore, it looks like a mass fingerpainting of a movie, tied together with a few gags.Unfortunately, all the jokes are just plain uncreative and offensive, either disgusting, perverse, or racist.Save your money and see one of the \\"original\\" teen movie, which are usually cleaner and more creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I thought it would be!","review":"I hardly ever buy a movie before I view it, but I thought that this would be a great movie, so I took a chance. Never again will I buy a movie without seeing it first. There were very few funny moments, and for the most part, it was just dumb. I love most of the movies that they used to make fun of, but they really didn't make things funny, at all! This is definately a movie I would watch before I waste money and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not another teen movie","review":"Not exactly as funny as Scary Movie but very close.If you're looking for a comedy that just doesnt throw out any funny thing they can think of as in scary movie 1 and 2,then you want this movie.There are laughs in every second that will have you rewinding again and again"},{"rating":"2","title":"This millineums 'Airplane!'","review":"Yes, the writers ... the plot-admittedly, 'She's All That'-as did the zuckers in Airplane!

This movie was so funny I was almost rolling on the floor in some places. The movie is initially a spoof on teen flicks such as \\"She's All That\\", \\"Varsity Blues\\", \\"Can't Hardly Wait\\", and many others. The movie was well acted by the whole cast. The jokes were very well written. The movie contains amusing cameo's from Melissa Joan Hart and teen film veteran Molly Ringwald. This movie for everyone who has seen the teen flicks from the past 15 years. They don't only spoof ones from the past 3 or 4 years they get them all. Funny and well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non Stop Laughter","review":"This is the most hilarious movie i've ever seen. Way better than scary movie 1 or 2. I did not stop laughing after the first scene till the end of the movie. If the comedy wasn't enough the movie is full of topless scenes, definate 5 in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too disgusting for it's own good","review":"The DVD quality is nice, good selection of features and Manson's video is great. The film was written with some humor, exposing elements of dumb teen movies and thrashing them well. Though it was too sickening, too gross with a poor ending, it just wasn't funny enough. I especially dislike seeing it in Widescreen format, as it's just not artistic enough to justify (sorry, WS lovers). A lot of detail cannot be seen on most tvs, I have a new 27\\" and WS just isn't suited for films of this type, unless you're watching on a comp or 16:9 tv (which aren't so numerous). They should have included both versions on two discs or made it dual-layered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Another Teen Movie","review":"I think you guys are taking this way to seriosuly.

Normally parody movies amuse me to no end but this one was simply appauling. It takes a great deal of effort to offend me, but this film did emmensly!It's title and previews suggest that it is a funny teen movie however this movie is definately not for teen's at all, aside from the enormous amount of bad language, the sexual content alone makes this film closer to an X rating then it's soft rating of R. To be blunt, to rent or buy this movie you have to be eighteen, and I wouldn't even get this for my seventeen year old sister because it is so appauling!Parent's beware, your kids might want to see it because of the misdirrecting previews but believe me, unless you want the facts of life poorly explained to them through a movie that most parents have discribed to me as soft porn you definately do not want to get this for your kids...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Cannot Believe This Movie Ever Saw the Light of Day","review":"Not Another Teen Movie is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. This moive tries so hard to be scary movie it's just sad. Basically, what they are trying to do here is out-gross scary movie and rake in the profits that scary movie did. They succeeded in out-grossing scary movie and the result was just plain gross. Not Funny at all. Let me say that I liked Scary Movie a lot so let me put the speculation to rest that if you liked scary movie you will like this. That is wrong. Dead wrong. This movie is just plain embarassing. It's embarassing for the cast and the writers and anybody else who had a hand in this travesty.There were 3 or 4 funny parts that made me chuckle (hence my one star at all) but overall, if you own this film, you should bury it with a shovel then bury the shovel.Overall, extremely poorly written.

The first half-hour is pretty damn funny, but the movie starts to lose momentum as it runs along, until it runs out of steam entirely by the end. Gotta love that naked foreign exchange chick (played by a sexy Cerina Vincent, who has a body to die for), though.

It is so hysterical like when that guy is trying to get that girl to like her so he sings a song with her name. He sings Jenny's Got A Gun so everyone thinks that she has a gun. The cops come and start chasing her and soon zap her. Another funny part is when she gets a makeover and she is walking down the stairs and she puts her foot on one step and it cracks and then the whole staircase falls on her and she falls into the basement.

The topless scenes and most of the biological function scenes were totally unnecessary. I think some of the funniest parts were bringing in references to some of the classic 80's teen movies which most of the audience (who were under the age of 20) really did not get. My friend and I (teenagers of the late 80's/early 90's) seemed to be the only ones in the theater who GOT all those jokes. I think the movie was OK, but only for the few, selective good laughs.

I waited until it was on HBO, and I have to say that it was the most painful 80 minutes I've ever spent in front of a television screen. The entire cast is absolutely horrible, once again proving that as long as you have a pretty face you don't need to have a teaspoon's worth of talent to be in the movies. The movie follows the \\"She's All That\\" format pretty closely, and every time it tries to go into another movie it only confuses the viewer more. My advice? Go to the dentist and ask to have four of your teeth drilled at once. Even that is better than sitting through this pile of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst spoof movie I've ever seen","review":"Just because you parody other movies doesn't automatically make it funny.

Throw in the obligatory sinister midget and sundry unemployed freaks and... Weee're in business!

The first portion of this movie is consistent with what I have come to expect from the series. I feel that Lynch could have made this setting the focus of the entire film. Sadly, he did not.The latter portion, dealing with Laura Palmer, mostly just put into pictures what had been revealed through conversation in the series. I feel this was a mistake: it didn't contribute much that was new, and defined scenes that should have been left to the imagination.That being said, if they re-release this with the 2 hours of extra footage (with some scenes from the first part of the film) I would buy the FWWM dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"It ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the cast that is every director's wet dream.Chris Isaak is a nice surprise.

Excellent cinematography and haunting music. Not Lynch's best, but excellent nonetheless. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lynch is like that","review":"A) If you've had very little experience with the series, you're more likely to like this film. It is much more connected to Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive (and stylistically forms a trillogy with them the main recurring elements being a deranged voyeuristic male and a starlet that keeps changing from blonde to brunette).B) Fire... leaves you with a strange sinking feeling of redemption. The only experience comparable was the last major car accident that I was in.C) It is terrifically beautiful.I also want to mention that the documentary is the most Lynch-ian thing I've seen and I'm amazed to hear his \\"fans\\" say they hate it. Non-linear, subjective, and very very funny while also illuminating and ironicly dark. That's Lynch and the documentary in a nutshell."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Product of Drugs, Without the Drugs","review":"It occurs to me that David Lynch is the only director that can truly scare me, and he does so without cheap, jumpy camera shots. Or drugs.I can say that I have NOT seen but two episodes of his TV series, Twin Peaks, although, I am aware of his other works. My point being: One does not have to see the series to appreciate the movie. If you have not seen the TV series, don't expect to GET anything, as little as you would otherwise, I'm told.As stated closely by another: Don't walk into a Dali exhibit and expect English countryside. Treat this movie, and any other David Lynch movie the same. His characters are among the most real that unreal can get, and Fire Walk With Me is no exception.

Lynch has had final cut on ALL his films except Dune, and so they all (except Dune) can be properly called director's cuts. FWWM as it stands is the version Lynch supervised and approves of. It's true that a lot of scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, but that's how movies are made. A rough cut is first assembled using everything, and the director and editor whittle it down from there. That said, Lynch has expressed interest in including the cut scenes in a FWWM DVD, but only as separate extras.

I think as a Twin Peaks fan, I would have appreciated a sequel too, one which resolves the tension of \\"hero become villain\\" in the very last scene of Season 2, as well as the problem of Leo Johnson left with tarantulas hanging overhead courtesy of Windom Earle. The reference in \\"Fire Walk With Me\\" to \\"The good Cooper is in the lodge and can't get out\\" suggests that there might have been a solution coming???

ARRRRGH ! New Line get a grip and Issue a new version NOW !And to the Anonymous director of this farce. Cut the stupid fast forward on the interviews and GO BACK WORKING AT THE TACO BELL !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deleted scenes, shmeleted scenes","review":"What makes this movie compelling is the fantastic acting performance given by the beautiful Sheryl Lee. It's no wonder Lynch made this 'prequel' to the series: One of the best talents on the show was DOA from the pilot.The opening sequence with Chris Isaak and Keiffer Sutherland is very funny, in that quirky, Lynchian, 'should I laugh now?' way.And while I'd have hoped that the deleted scenes were going to be on here, I'm not surprised that they aren't, and that fact doesn't diminish the fact that this was a pretty good, yet disturbing flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"the truth","review":"everything a real fan of twin peaks loves. for those who don't love twin peaks and david lynch you probably wouldn't understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.","review":"I am a big fan of Twin Peaks: the TV series. However, I did not like this movie much at all. All of the humor and humanity of the show is gone, replaced by the usual weird crap and leering sexism that rule the movies of David Lynch. People who haven't seen the show will be wondering what the hell's going on; die-hard fans will be disappointed that the movie contains no new material. We've quite literally seen all this before."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Line Home Entertainment disappoints!","review":"First, TP:FWWM is an excellent film (by far, one of my all-time favorites). I have the Laserdisc of the film, and seeing it widescreen will set your socks on fire.I rated this DVD release 1 star due to the folks at New Line Home Entertainment (NLHE). I've written several letters to several people at NLHE regarding the missing deleted scenes. Unfortunately, no response (but I'm not surprised). You know, the most disappointing part is the fact they have \\"Infinifilm\\" technology which could allow a viewer to insert the deleted scenes back into the film (see their \\"Rush Hour 2\\" DVD release - which I will never buy). By releasing TP:FWWM WITHOUT deleted scenes, it confirms they are just another short-sighted, inconsiderate movie studio. Please wake up and smell the coffee. Lots of Twin Peaks & Lynch fans are disappointed with you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame!","review":"As one of the most devoted french fan of Twin peaks, I've been waiting for years to see the release of that DVD... And now, I'm simply disapointed: I fought to get those deleted scenes Newline promised to give us... And we finally get this simple edition of this outstanding movie???!!So I won't buy it. Clear and simple.I'll keep the fight, here in France. Hoping that the french editor will release the movie WITH those deleted scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Walk somewhere else please (I'm trying to sleep)","review":"Make no mistake -- I was (and still am) a massive fan of the TV series, in all of its quirky glory. But this prequel, even with most of the show's original stars (plus the addition of many other big names), was just plain bad. I actually fell asleep.The narrative was nothing like the humorously melodramatic soap-opera delivery familiar to fans of the show, nor was there any humor at all for that matter. The acting was wooden, the storyline foggy and the pace meandered unnecessarily.I went into this hoping to prove the critics wrong, but 30 minutes into it, I could see why FWWM received most of it's positive press in Japan. I'd be curious to see how the Japanese critics received the original series, because I imagine a lot of the subtlety in what Lynch does must be lost in translation..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you are a Lynch fanboy, skip this steaing pile.","review":"As a HUGE fan of the show I was excited to see this finally released (I missed it in theatres). Having recently re-watched most of the shows episodes I can honestly say that this worse than leaving things unanswered. Most of the actors did a fine job diespite the fact that the script seems like it was written by a 16 year old heroin addict that had only seen a handful of episodes. I have not seen a follow-up this bad since Highlander II."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Hell was that?","review":"That is probably what you'll be saying after you see Fire Walk With Me. I stumbled across Twin Peaks recently and have seen every episode. After being disapointed by the cliff-hanger ending I was excited to see Fire Walk With Me but now I am more diapointed than ever.To start with, if you haven't seen every episode, don't even bother with this one. You simply won't get it. Those that have seen the show still won't know what to make of alot of it. The show was symbolic and interesting while this seems weird with no point. This may be because a huge amount was cut from the film but in the end it makes little sense.Thankfully, it still retains the fancinating atmosphere from the show but the fact is that there isn't enough story to back it up. Maybe if they release a directors cut then my opinion will change but untill then, Fire Walk With Me has only degraded my opinion of the Twin Peaks franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, intense movie!","review":"I really enjoyed this movie on DVD. It's just a great piece of art, you either love it or hate it I guess. It is different then the Twin Peaks series obviously. Of course it wouldn't be possible to get the same feel of the series in one movie. This is quite an extreme and intense story about what happened before the Twin Peaks series. You'll finally get to know Laura Palmer a lot better and you'll find out what things were going on in her life. Great acting of course. I specifically liked Harry Dean Stanton and Kiefer Sutherland (they have quite small acting roles). Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i loved twin peaks","review":"this was a great series; and the movie was the best part. deffinatly the best of david lynch or anyone else assciated with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Honestly, I was hoping that this movie was gonna answer some of my pressing questions about the Twin Peaks series, like the origins of BOB and how he ended up possessing Leland Palmer. Instead, it was centered around Laura's last weeks of life, and didn't end up answering any mysteries left behind from the season finale. Plus, where the hell was original Donna?! And there was not enough Agent Cooper. Bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Moving Art","review":"The movie knows what it's doing. It's non impressionistic even when you know what's going on. Ridley Scott is a wonderful director/songwriter who gets the job done and takes his time. David Lynch is a trip. The movie is horrible to some but they'll never see the children in the movie walking around the outside of school. That is the funniest part in any movie ever and David Lynch knows...Just ask Dino."},{"rating":"2","title":"AI NO BANDA!","review":"I agree with the other viewer. What is probably the best part of the movie has been changed. In the old mix subtitles helped the viewer to understand what people were sayng in the Canadian Bar scene but in this version they are useless. Dialogue is perfectly understandable and the music not so loud.I Don't believe Lynch personally approved the sound remix since he is the sound designer of all his movies. I think he only supervised or approved the fantastic video transfer.Maybe I am too perfectionist but...I will always watch this dvd playng the audio track from the old dolby surround Laserdisc (in perfect sync of course) This is the only reason for which I give this DVD 4 stars instead of 5. This movie is great!!!Waiting for a new fixed edition...This I thought, This I WroteOREVUAR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning, the best movie in a while","review":"this movie is both intriguing and bizarre. the show was just astounding. it was everything anyone could ever want sex, lies, murder. then the movie led us up to everything that had happened, that way we werent hanging on the edge of our seats waitnig to know what happened!!!1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply phenominal","review":"This film is one of the best ever made, second only to Lost Highway and Dune (wow! 2 other lynch films). Perhaps what is most striking about the film is that it never ceases to give you something new with each viewing. I've seen it around 30 times and written papers on it and still see at least one thing that I had missed on all previous occasions. Watch out for the man from another place..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A non-Peaker Review","review":"I must confess to having never watched the tv series. Forgive me, but I was in one of those rare social, spending a lot of time away from the television phases when Twin Peaks aired. That said, I loved Fire Walk With Me.Yes, I was confused. Yes, some of it made no sense; nevertheless, I found it mesmerizing. I rented it again and again. The images, the music (had to buy that soundtrack), the characters. I don't think I'll ever fully understand some of the implications, but Fire Walk with Me will always haunt me.Sheryl Lee may have been cast as a dead body for the show, but she carried this movie. The depths to which she plunged and the heights to which she soared as Laura Palmer were incredible.Most Twin Peaks fans seem to think that this movie would scare off a non-Peaker, but I offer that it may just enthrall a non-Peaker enough to send them searching for the series on videotape, just as I am doing.JenMuse"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the do it yourselfer....","review":"This was an inexpensive drillpress vice that has worked out ok for me thus far.

Mommies can be doctors, mommies can go to work, daddies can stay home and fix dinner. Bought this at Christmas for my 2 year old granddaughter to go with her first baby doll. I always look for great illustrations in books for the very young, because I believe its important to pause through the reading to let the child express her thoughts in what I am saying and what she is seeing on the page.

I wish they would create an updated one with more accurate gender roles (ie, 'Daddy' helps cook dinner, the doctor is an older sister, taking the baby dolls to day care, etc.) and less outdated pictures and chores. But since this book so sweetly depicts the 'Mommy' taking care of her babies, which is what my daughter loves to play, we continue to read it. My 5-year-old son enjoys it too when I am reading it to her -- I think anything about pretending to be grown-up is intriguing to him. \\"Mumbledy bumps\\" has become a favorite pretend ailment in our house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Owned two of these in the last 7 years and both died","review":"I have owned this exact model twice in the last 7 years.

The best part of F.O.D. 3 was the begining when they showed clips of the other F.O.D. videos, It seemed a lot more fake than the original and I was quite disappointed although it did have a few good scenes, you can spot the staged scenes a mile off but I would say overall 40% REAL 60% FAKE.

The problem is, when the cleaning liquid dries, it leaves ugly fog-like marks on your LCD screen. I've found out that after it dries, using a lint-free soft cloth to lightly polish the screen helps clean up the screen completely.

Funky, danceable numbers are included in Rock Steady, Clean Up Woman, and the risque Jungle Fever. Oh Girl is a classic soul ballad, whereas the soft Suavecito has a slight Latin flair.

The acting is absolutely shocking (not just from Olivia). Perhaps the only saving grace is the average single \\"Twist of Fate\\". This is not a cult classic, make no mistake.

You have \\"angels\\" played by people like scatman crothers and Charles Durning as well as the Devil played by the now later Oliver Reed coiming into the middle of the scenes and \\"fast forwarding\\" and \\"freezing\\".......just not realistic at all. Plus you have travolta as an inventor. Edible sunglasses? Yes I know not all movies have to be 100% realistic but this movie just goes too far. I watched it because Grease was such a great movie but this movie just is pathetic, even compared to an average movie, let alone Grease.On the bright side however, the theme song \\"twist of fate\\" is one of the best songs of all time and the video is equally awesome.

This movie proves she can't. She can't even say one line right. John Travolta is too good of an actor for her. The plot was stupid. Why would angels pick these 2 people as a good reason why the world should be saved? They are a good reason why it shouldn't be saved. Stupid and not even entertaining. Grease was stupid but at least it was somewhat entertaining. Bad plot, bad script, terrible acting by Newton-john. Waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hands down...the WORST movie I've ever seen!","review":"Grease was cute...the perfect match-up of actors/singers to roles. Newton-John and Travolta were so cute in that.THIS piece of trash is unforgivable. ONJ should stick to singing and John Travolta should stick to supporting roles. They also didn't look good together aesthetically this time. This movie was made before either of them had their face-lifts (they look great now, btw), and ONJ looks old enough to be Travolta's mother.

Bravo From Philly!!!!","review":"The Bridge is like Pipe Dreams to the tenth power. Although it is a completely different story, Solomon has a way of grabbing you by the hand and walking you through a world unlike your own. Both books kept your attention with the right-in-your-face action which made the book a definite page turner. I immediately felt the pain of the characters, and what emotions they were going through without being side tracked from the story. The ending was a true shocker and it will have even the most avid reader stunned. Solomon Jones is bringing something to the table that the average reader isn&#65533;t quite ready for. Writers beware; there is a new man on the block, and he&#65533;s about to take us by storm. Bravo, Solomon!

It is jam-packed with wise observations relating to the intersection of poetry, language, and meaning. His arguments revolve around the metaphysical nature of metaphor, with lots of examples and subtle distinctions. In the end, the reader leaves with a vision of how a more conscious understanding and use of poetry - or better said, imaginative language - is at the heart of a true understanding of what makes us human.

The reason this book is a bit different are the characters of the hometown and the underlying story of a woman wanting to leave her no-good husband. It's always comical to me how in the throws of a life change there always seems to be some charming (usually younger) man coming along to sweep the main character off her feet. I wish Eliza would have stood up on her own to leave her marriage but then I guess we wouldn't have been treated to the steamy scenes that dot the book.

Your view on the world beneath your feet will definitely change (as vast and intriguing as the deepest ocean) and if it doesn't make you more spiritual, it will certainly make you respect the very small, living creatures this world takes for granted.It will also bring about a bit of sadness as the modern era is the first of any time/culture to treat the small so terribly. From the ancients, to Egypt, to the 1800's, the small creatures were respected (as they should be) and were even considered sacred (to protect them from the fears of the uneducated common folk).Even if you have no interest in gardening, READ THIS BOOK!

The video was almost full screen, smoother, and there wasn't a large wait between rooms.Then this 32X version was released. It was both a blessing and a curse, here's why:GOOD: The video is clearer then the Sega CD version, it has a larger video screen, a pause feature, the on-screen text is legible, it's possible to see what the room buttons are supposed to be, and the audio can actually be deciphered.BAD: There are frequent load times during videos, video screen is not as large as 3DO's, and load times inbetween rooms/failed tasks are almost unbearable--especially before something actually happens.The long and short of it is that I played this 32X-CD version once, then returned to my old Sega CD version for subsequent plays."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAT review","review":"Not really all that useful, Kaplan, Barron's and REA guides are better.

Of the 3 episodes, only the last one \\"Toby Dammit\\" sustains interest.

His character, a self destructing actor who has reached the end of all worldly hope & desire wants only to leap into the chasm of death & destruction & he does so in spectactular fashion. This segment alone is worth the price of admission & Fellini caries the weight of the entire film on his capable talents. Images to delight & dialogue to astound, Terence Stamp should have won some kind of award for this brilliant performance as he portrays a burnt out actor with a death wish.

Even today, it's painful to see Clint teamed with Charlie Sheen for the sake of commercial desperation.

It kinda reminds you of a Dirty Harry movie..so I guess that is why I liked it so much. Charlie Sheen did a pretty good job, but maybe someone else would have been better suited to play that part.

It's a brutal, uncomfortable shave that feels like individual hairs are yanked out of your face, one at a time. That's when it works! Many times, the action of the shaver does virtually nothing, requiring many passes over a given area to shave anything. It's given me rashes and lots of skin burns.To their credit, Braun sent me a friendly email & replacement cutting block when I let them know of my unpleasant experience.

To get a close shave I find I have to go back and RESHAVE with Norelco. Not good! Norelco trimmer is vastly superior to Braun's. I have sixty days in which to return. I will put up with it for another week or so and then return it if shaves don't get anywhere as close as they did with all my previous Norelcos. Not a bad product.

Either I got a lemon or Braun has lowered its manufacturing standards on their lower priced electric razors.Problems: (1) my beard is not heavy, but it takes twice as long to shave as it did with my former Braun razor; (2) Moreover, the shave is unacceptable since the result of this Braun shave is a remaining rather rough, not smooth, beard. Repeated shaving over many areas do not do the job removing the stubble, particularly with respect to short hairs;(3) The side cutter is a \\"menace\\" -- I have drawn blood twice trying to use it; and (4) The razor did not come with a plastic \\"guard\\" over the cutter as all Braun razors did in my past experiences.In summary, this Braun razor is a disappointment and I regret its purchase.Dr. Stephen E.

My favorite character was Goranu because he not unlike myself is a trickster and sarcastic at times. overall it was an okay book. the only way i would improve it would be to give it more of an ending instead of leaving the reader hanging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Sister Review","review":"The adventure of Mitsuko through the chambers of hell was written in colorful language and in a thought-provoking style. It did a good job of integrating facts about Japanese mythology into an interesting and creative plot. The ending was rather abrupt, however, it did leave you room to create an ending that you enjoyed. The beginning was slower than the rest, however, as you got into it, it speeded up quite a bit. The various haikus and poems that were included at the beginning of each chapter allowed a slight view of what was to come and made you want to read more. It is in a language that is readily understandable without being too easy. It included a useful glossary of all of the foreign words during the book. Overall, it was a very good book to teach one about Japanese mythology and magical creatures while still being very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book that you can't but down","review":"I thought that Little Sister was a very good book. It gave me a very good idea of Japanese rules, and mythology. The book was very well written and was very entertaining to read. You could really feel the emotion that the characters felt. The author did a good job of making cliff hangers at the end of the chapters so you couldn't put the book down, it was slow only in a couple of parts. No part of this book was confusing and I highly recommend this tale about how Mitsuko and Garuno the tengu must find the soul of her sister's husband's soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Japanese Family-original","review":"The ancient Japan setting enhances this books style and artistic cover.

The food in the cold compartment does not stay cold (or even cool) and the soup container is not really insulated at all, so that gets cold.It's a nice concept but just doesn't work. If you have the equipment to reheat your soup and don't pack anything in the bottom that actually needs to stay cool/cold, then this is an okay way to transport your lunch.

The soup was cold by the time lunch came around. The lower salad container was just a big mess.

It's similar in style but the set is much brighter, there are 4 exercisers with Bob, there are less swings, a bit more use of dumbbells (especially shoulders), quite a few lunges and squats, and the \\"ass burners\\" are killer.

It all happened very quickly and with thousands of people watching. It is still an unbelievable and somewhat inexlicable tragedy.

It does leave the bottom of the tub VERY slippery so use caution getting in and out!

The author could not make up her mind which characters to write about, she tied it all up in the end but it would have been so much better to create more of a background on each of the main characters instead of talking about people you could not remmber who they were because she had written so little about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"This book was not what I thought it would be. Instead of delving in to strong characters, the Moon family women were given the impression that they were cauldren stirring vixens with a supernatural power to hypnotically lure any male in to their bedroom. It was ridiculous and the lack of detail left me wondering how the author got away with this one.There is no meat on this bone. The dark storyline lacked plot and purpose and was terribly unbelievable.If you are looking for a book with strong southern female characters and storyline... don't look here. The only thing you will get is egotistical swamp witches with a hideous ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating style.","review":"This book caught me by surprise.

No wonder why child sex abuse lasted for so long. Take a look at the Joe Paterno mess: Penn State is more important than the raped children. For all its worth, Donald Sutherland turns in another masterful performance, and it's the only reason why I see The Rosary Murders.

There are some lines that are really funny (unintentionally, I'm afraid).But the #1 reason to see it: THE A-1 STEAK SAUCE GUY DID IT!!!! I think the actor's name is Jim Murtaugh.

I bought this as part of the 4-dvd set from Blue Underground. Though this is minor, it's pretty good and is a good example of the genre as a whole. It lacks the flamboyant style of Argento but it's handled competently enough.Basically it's about a guy who goes back to his hometown and meets with his brother who is a priest. Years ago there was a murder of a young girl and when the brother comes back, there are more murders. It's not the most original set-up but it's entertaining.It's not terribly gory but a lot of gialli flicks weren't. The genre is rooted in traditional murder mysteries (like Agatha Christie and Edgar Wallace) and they got more and more violent as the years went on.So if you can get this for ten bucks or under, it's worth it. Not a classic but will feed your giallo fix on those lonely Friday nights.-Jordan Krall, author of the spaghetti western/giallo FISTFUL OF FEET"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLDS THAT LINE","review":"Collagen injection for more attractive lips?

I would stay away from this and highly recommend buying the Box set or Bruce Lee collection, as it is a much better buy. This dvd is unrestored, has no option for subtitles, comes only in fullscreen, has no extra content that I think is worthwhile, and furthermore, both movies were not uncut as in the box set, which I bought later on. So anyways, go for the Bruce Lee Collection instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor looking dvd","review":"this is the worst quality i seen in a long time. i thought this was a great deal. it was very cheep and i said i would by it. some one warned me about it. but i thought they were being picky so i bought it anyway. when i put the dvd in. i was very upset by how the picture was so poor and the audio was also. i usually dont leave reviews but i have to let people know not to by this verison of the classic bruce lee flicks. you will be very upset about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIST OF FURY, NOT CHINESE CONNECTION","review":"True this is Bruce Lee at his best, BUT, this DVD is TERRIBLE! The video transfer is poor and the audio (and I don't mean the dubbing)is low, low, low. Definitely get the Media Asia Version which is in it's original language (Cantanese/Mandarin)with an optional English track in GET THIS, 5.1 Dolby Digital. The picture is crisp and bright. And also please refer to this movie as \\"FIST OF FURY\\" and Not \\"The Chinese Connection\\" when you purchase this from the Media Asia Version.

The dubs on this version however are terrible. I am pretty sure that this version was simply copied from VHS because near the end of The Chinese Connection (the one with the ice factory) you can see problems with tracking. This is also where you begin losing the sound quality as it speeds up and slows down. This collection makes me sad.

At least they could have had the actors play orientals. Too bad because this concept could have been funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Beat Bruce","review":"This movie is a great. The picture and sound are pretty bad, but you won't find better anywhere elts. It just looks as if the master wasn't taken care of.

As they say \\"You get what you pay for.\\" Do yourself a favor and run far, far from away from this horrible collection.

It sounds like you are playin a 45rpm record on 33rpms (those of you under 30 won't understand). Fists of Fury looks like it was dubbed off of a 50 year old version of the film.

Don't look here!","review":"Madacy's Double Feature edition of these classic Bruce Lee films, is by far the worst. \\"THE CHINESE CONNECTION\\", runs over 2 hours, but, hold your breath...that doesn't equate extra footage, it means that the film transfer is so slow, both sound and picture, that it stretches the film's running time by nearly 20 minutes! Both films look horrible, and are not uncut.Also, GOODTIMES version of \\"CHINESE CONNECTION\\", although it is widescreen(2.35:1), runs only 103 min., versus the full running time of 107 minutes.

The picture looked, at times, like I needed to adjust my tracking (this was a DVD remember?).

The quality of the picture actually seems to have tracking problems right in the middle of one of the best fight scenes not to metion the very grainy nature of the movie from start to finish.

If you look closely at the time period, the early 1900s, it illustrates the Japanese government occupation and oppression of Chinese people. The Japanese were like the British of the far east. Bruce Lee skillfully demonstrates the struggle and social activism for justice and equality. This movie truly has more to offer than just martial arts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality Video and Audio","review":"Two of the best fighting movies ever destroyed by poor video and audio.

Not only were the transfers done from what appear to be film that was played so much it was scratched and broken, the audio is terrible.

The CASE is worth more than this sorry disc!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie convered to poor quality","review":"This is the worst DVD I've seen. I've seen the movie before, and it was great.

Perhaps all that's necessary is a good editor to bring out the film that was clearly intended; one that's an over-the-top satire of 21st century life. In this world, porn stars, terrorists, politicians, cops, and A-list Hollywood actors often cross paths and form alliances on their way to fulfilling their various narcissistic agendas. They roam around, self-absorbed and self-unaware, grasping toward whatever decadent trinkets tickle their fancy, while the world is literally about to end.Unfortunately, somewhere along the way the entire thing just became muddled and incomprehensible. Which is a shame, because with the writer/director of Donnie Darko at the helm and a slew of varied talent in the film, it really could have been something great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually impressive, but incoherent","review":"I usually try to begin my reviews with a brief, neutral description of the plot, but in this case I have to make an exception. Pulling a coherent narrative out of this mess would require more effort on my part than writer / director Richard Kelly apparently made to put one in.There are some excellent visuals here and it can be fun to play \\"spot the recognizable character actor,\\" but I'll be darned if I know what it was about. With so many pointless and inconclusive subplots going on, I just became bored after a while, but I stuck it out to the end, which left me unenlightened. I even watched the credits roll, at the end of which I saw that there is a trilogy of graphic novels that precede the film. Would they help to make sense of what I saw? Can't say I care much anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are there Cliffs Notes for this Film?","review":"Seriously, this film is bad. It is incomprehensible.

I am a huge fan of The Rock, but this movie just doesn't make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleh","review":"What an awful follow up to the great Donnie Darko. I get it, its just not good. If you want to watch something strange and well done then watch a David Lynch movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Complex and Amazing Plot, Wowwww Great Movie","review":"A movie that made no money in theaters, and the movie critics hated it without understanding it. It's no surprise this is a great great film.Southland Tales has a ton of social commentary mixed into a genius plot about the end of the world. It's a satire and a black comedy, but mixes many genres along the way. You will need to see this more than once to understand it, because it reveals info that explains why the characters were acting so wierd before.If you like movies that make you think, this is definetly one of them. It also doesn't try much to explain itself, assuming a mature audience. I hate seeing most movies, because they are fluffed-up and brainless wastes of time. I really, really love this movie and it's probably the best movie of the decade.I would say this is a mix of Vonnegut, Philip K Dick, Brazil, and the Bible (of all things). Kelly can die a happy man because he made this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"southland tales","review":"that was very strange movie and how they got all that stars to be in it i hope they got a lot of money for it.

I had been awaiting the release of this film for years, but was a little hesitant with the cast, but i must say that the cast was perfect amazing job done. Kelly's direction is amazing, i've already watched this film half a dozen times in the 2 weeks since i received it. It's really good, i've come to the conclusion that i may enjoy this movie even more than Kelly's first work Donnie Darko. The incredible storytelling and camera work is absolutely stunning, i knew this would be a worthwhile film the first time i saw Sean William Scott in the bathroom with a delay in his reflection. amazing. I Highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, Really Wierd, but Somehow Prophetic.","review":"After about 15 minutes of this movie you are confused, you ask yourself, \\"should I turn this off\\" but you just keep watching it. The more it went on the more I wanted to see how all these oddball characters would come together and culminate into the end of the world. My wife was disgusted and picked up her book, but I kept on watching and was glad that I did, I hate to tell her that I plan to watch it again. This is not a movie for everyone and a love of dystopia and apocalyptic vision is a prerequisite for watching this film. There were many of the old Saturday Night Live crew in the movie, the most notable is Cheri Oteri, the Rock is a poor actor, but it did not really matter in this movie. The best part, that really made this story come together was the soundtrack put together by Moby. This is destined to become a cult hit like Donnie Darko."},{"rating":"1","title":"Southland Tales = Bad","review":"Richard Kelly is an amazing writer and director, Donnie Darko is on of my favorite movies. He does some great films, but Southland Tales is just not one of them, I just thought the movie was confusing and kind of slow. Also I was expecting a great finish to the movie similar to Donnie Darko, but the ending was lame and just boring. All in all, I would say that this is one of Richard Kelly's worst films.

It's got all the kook tyranny of goverment stuff that was constant and viral from the left about the Bush administration as a sub-plot... at least the first 20 minutes did.

It tries to borrow too much from Donnie Darko and tries too hard to blend it with Bible stories. Don't waste your time. It takes the mildly interesting parallel bubble universe idea from Donnie Darko and does a bad job of tying it to the Book of Revelations. There are some funny parts like the Killers video in the middle but it doesn't make up for the mountain of bad things.

In a way it is a parody of a Hollywood-centric paranoid world view. I say \\"parody\\" because I can't believe that this movie could really be taken seriously. Even though, a world where a porn star gets a talk show isn't unbelievable.I saw a lot of potential from this movie, its graphic novel style, and the cast (would somebody please give Curtis Armstrong his own movie?), but neither all the special effects in the world, nor MTV imagery could save this nightmare from choking on its own excesses.This is the sophomore effort from Mr. Kelly, the director, and I didn't expect him to make another \\"Donnie Darko.\\" Perhaps, his next movie will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait...

The biggest distractions of this movie were (1) the glut of celebrities forgetting to play characters and instead were playing themselves and (2) the boring pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird Maybe, But WoW What a Great Movie","review":"Southland Tales may leave some viewers scratching their heads, saying, \\"What the heck is going on\\" but it is a wonderful production that deserves higher praise than it received. Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson plays the strangest part I have ever seen him in, and plays it beautifully, along with the awesome cast that breathe life into this bizarre Sci Fi Flick. I Must have watched this movie more times than I can remember, because it has that kind of appeal, watch again to reveal the things you missed, or failed to understand the first time 'round. Southland Tales is definitely a weird, strange, totally bizarre movie, but by God it's Brilliant, and I get a thrill when I share it with friends who have never heard of it, as they all have that jaw dropped effect throughout the movie. Amazon had a great price, delivery was a little ahead of expected time, and this is one happy customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dwayne Johnson!","review":"Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) actually is the most entertaining character in Southland tales. The movie is confusing because there appears to be over five main storylines all hapening at once. Each storyline seems to flash quickly from one to another without a good explanation. However, the ending is interesting as time travel is involved. Plus, Sarah Michelle Gellar looks very attractive as usual. I give this movie five stars not because of the storyline, but because of the excellent cast of actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rare Garbage","review":"It's rare to find moving video this bad. I can't call this a film. I have finally found something to which I can say, \\"I'd rather watch paint dry,\\" and be believable because I'm simply being honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artistic and Innovative","review":"First, this film is bizarre. You will likely be confused watching it and very few, if any, of your questions will be answered at the end. There is no catharsis here. That being said, this film has strokes of genius throughout, and if you don't mind something completely a-typical then I think you'll enjoy it. The casting choices here are absurd, which is precisely why they work so well. I would encourage you to give it a try if you're looking for something very different than what you're used to, or to anyone who is used to those very different movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never finished watching","review":"I had great hopes for this one: look at the cast! As a matter of fact, I'll watch anything with Dwayne Johnson in it - Rock On! But this dystopian satire began to look too much like a Saturday Night Live sketch gone wrong. As it jerked along going nowhere, I lost interest. So much possibility, so miserable an outcome. Sad. Really sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real attention grabber","review":"I'd caught parts of this film on cable, but never managed to catch the whole thing. I was intrigued, and just couldn't get it out of my mind. Having finally managed to see the entire film from beginning to end, I can highly recommend it. If you liked Donnie Darko, you will love Southland Tales (especially since the same mastermind is behind both)! A great addition to your collection of films that make you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes... however, dashed.","review":"Southland Tales....what can one say but, WTF???? I had high hopes for this film considering the cast, but I was sadly disappointed. Kevin Smith was pretty cool for the 3 minutes he was in this (Great makeup, Kev!), but not worth the other 140+ minutes you'll waste watching this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waist of a free rental coupon","review":"I expected better w/ the cast that was listed. Movie was so bad that I turned it off. If I wanted to hear that kind of language I would have rented a porn flick (wouldn't do that). Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"baaaad","review":"I was excited to see this film. I really enjoy many of the actors but the film is terrible. It's nothing like the preview. It's very long, and very boring. I looked online to see how well it did in the box office because I wondered why I hadn't heard of it. It made approx 350 thousand dollars worldwide. Seriously, look it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Badly Spent","review":"About the only good thing that could be said for this movie is that it replaces \\"Highlander-The Source\\" as the all time greatest waste of two hours in my life. Sarah, make something with dignity again. Even \\"Scooby Doo 3\\" would be better than this.(And a suggestion to Amazon. Whoever makes the decision should really allow a \\"No Star\\" option just for movies like this. One star is just far too high a rating)"},{"rating":"1","title":"0 out of 5 stars","review":"Watching this film was the biggest waste of 2 & a half of my life. It was plotless, and lackluster. The acting sucked, and nothing in the film was explained. I'm a big fan of Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson's work in film but watching him in this film was an absolute disappointment. Maybe this movie was over my head, but even movies that go over my head can be explained. I can't begin to tell anyone what this movie is exactly about. I only gave this movie 1 star because my review wouldn't be viewed, otherwise I would have given it 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Film. Ever!","review":"Please, please, don't watch this film. If I can stop just one person I'll feel better. A vile, incomprehensible script puts disgusting dialogue in formerly likeable actors' mouths. Endless and pointless narration by some weird character who is never properly explained. Scene after scene of flat, painfully unfunny \\"jokes\\". A script that was apparently never examined by anyone with an iota of good taste. A stupid musical number that has no clear meaning. Ideas rehashed from the excellent Donnie Darko, and put to no good use. An actionless part for an action star. A main character whose manner and actions remain unexplained. Constant shots of a room full of widescreen TVs which is both annoying and unhelpful. And an ending that fails to deliver any clear (much less satisfying) resolution. How does a director go from Nights of Cabiria to Fellini Satyricon in just two films? this film has no redeeming qualities whatsoever- I'm not kidding. Go rent The Conformist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Strange","review":"Movies like this very rarely come around. Though this is a older movie it is a great movie for those who enjoy weird and strange movies. I watched it a handful of times and still very unsure of what I am watching but love every minute of it. If your in the mood for a strange piece of film then I suggest picking this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's funny","review":"I don't write a lot of reviews but I literally just finished watching this and felt compelled to post something. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not exaggerating. The plot makes no sense and the acting was terrible. In one of the final scenes when Mandy Moore spontaneously starts dancing with Sarah Michelle Gellar on the \\"super blimp\\" I actually burst out laughing. I really liked Donnie Darko and was expecting it to all pull together in the end just like that film. Didn't happen. Just a confusing mess. It's free on Amazon Prime. I suggest you watch this movie because it's so bad it's actually funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not The Happening","review":"This movie has a wonderful plot, it is just falls apart left and right. I want to give it 1-star, but The Happening has that honor in my book. If it weren't for the plot, I would have given this movie 1 star.The movie certainly has its moments though, but goes on much too long (like some of its reviews here on Amazon).Southland Tales is what I use to compare a movie that has a good plot, but just isn't done \\"right\\" to a movie that isn't done right and simply has a really bad plot (the disaster of The Happening).If you are sitting at home trying to decide what to watch, and you have to decide between Southland Tales and The Happening, I can strongly recommend Southland Tales for your viewing pleasure. Otherwise, try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie blows","review":"i have tried twice to watch this movie, and i couldnt make it through an hour each time.

After great releases by Ann Lee, Eiffel 65, Soundlovers and Whigfield comes another project called 'Easy Lady', which has all the ingredients of a big summer hit... catchy lyrics, thumping beats and lots of oldfashioned synthesizers...not very much unlike last year's '2 times' by Ann Lee. In fact, if you listen carefully...it could even be that Ann Lee herself has lended her voice to this project! I'll leave it up to you to decide if that's the case, but you can be sure that if you like Ann Lee you'll LOVE Easy Lady!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best vampire movies I have seen","review":"Beautifully shot, well acted, well casted, amazing script.

Buy this to see Del Toro's Bleak House video where he takes you on a tour of his museum of creation. I want a house just like that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Immortal Classic...","review":"Guillermo del Toro's first feature is a skillfully crafted and highly inventive parable on immortality. Jesús Gris, a Mexican Antiquarian (played by Argentine actor Federico Luppi), and his grandaughter, Aurora, discover an ancient device in the hollow base of an angelic figurine. Called the Cronos device, conceived and invented by a 16th century Alchemist, it harbors a mystical insect within its golden scarab-like shell. Once granted immortality, Jesus finds the device is sought by an American businessman and his homicidal nephew, played with menacing glee by del Toro favorite Ron Perlman. However, immortality comes with a price at the potential expense of Gris' soul. Aurora, acutely aware of her grandfather's metamorphosis, and willingly keeps his secret, proves to be his savior, for it is her unwavering love for him that provides ultimate salvation. Love is truly immortal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting take on \\"vampire\\" movie","review":"I love Ron Perlman, and Guillermo Del Toro, but when i found out this was Del Toro's first film, I was even more amazed. Great acting, script, direction and even production values for a debut.

The acting is good (Federico Luppi, the argeninian mel gibson as he takes a severe beating in every one of his films), but as we reach the end of the film, we are left hanging without a conclusion.

Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eternity is a long time...","review":"I hate dismissing a film without giving reasons why (I think it's lazy) but I have to confess that 'Cronos' managed to stupefy my critical facilities completely.I can't think of anything to say about it other than I found it utterly boring. Neither the story (which admittedly is intriguing for the first few minutes) nor acting nor actual film making engaged me on any level. Every half hour I'd glance at the clock wondering how much more there was to go... and discover only three minutes had passed since I last looked. It made me think of that Woody Allen quip: 'eternity is a long time... especially towards the end'.From other reviews I can see this film has its fans and to them all I can say is, sorry this didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Unfortunately this movie is a waste of time. It's not a horror, not even a thriller, but more of a dark drama shot in gloomy interiors.The storyline is very weak, the dialog is boring. The initial idea was good, but it was poorly implemented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love del Toro's movies, but this was a major disappointment. Apart from a few nice visuals, this film has no redeeming quality. Every scene is predictable, badly acted, badly filmed, and not even remotely scary.Furthermore, this movie features possibly the worst child actor in history of the world cinema. I'd imagine that a young girl (5? 6?) who's just seen her grandpa come back from the dead looking like a corpse would be freaking out, or show at least SOME sort of emotion. This child's face and body language were only a tad more alive than a plastic manequin, including the scene where she splits a man's skull open with a walking stick. For me, that drove the final nail into the coffin of this movie.Skip this one, and see The Devil's Backbone instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Made in '97, in Mexico (which translates to roughly 1977 in Hollywood terms), this little diddy has two redeeming factors; Ron Perlman, and an original plot. Other than that I'm thinking why the hell did I see this.The story is not bad: 400 years ago an alchemist figures a way to cheat death by creating a device (cronos) with a little cookarocha in it among other mechanisms. A weathy (and dying) De La Guardia seeks the device after obtaining a manuscript with precise instructions on how to use it. It's another twist on the vampire theme.

Not too long ago we got See How They Grow: Sea Animals VHS from the library. It wasn't a hit, I must say. Both me and my mom found it very childish. Just listen to those animals' goofy voices ...definitely intended for youngsters. It seems like they are making it as least educational as possible. They even say hermit crabs are fish and I have no idea why! It's OK, but you'll probably find it pretty annoying if you are not very young. Overall, if you have a youngster interested in sea animals, then you could give it a try, but I think it would be better to check it out from the library than to own it.

Yet even from one of these authors I would expect a basic understanding of the English langauge, esp. where commas are and are not appropriate.

Steel spends countless lines explaining how alike the twins are, and yet how different. Sections of the book keep telling the reader which twin is which, as if we had no brain to figure it out.

They do not shave as close as a razor blade but are much easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun 3 370 Shaver","review":"This is the best electric shaver I have ever owned. It has worked flawlessly: smooth, close shave; reliable long charge; my face has adjusted to it. Everything is a positive as advertised. It has far exceeded my expectations. Five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun Shavers Quality","review":"I had a Braun Series 5 \\"system\\", after about two weeks it started sounding like a buzz saw, and the shave wasn't as good. I used it for about a year and gave up on it. then I bought a Series 3 \\"system\\" and have had it about 6 months. Sometimes the cleaning stand won't shut off. Sometimes the shaver won't turn on. Sometimes even after a few days, when I go to shave, the battery is dead. The quality of the shave is great, but I think either their manufacturing or engineering sucks, they have no web access for problems, you have to take it to an authorized dealer (about 30 miles from me), and apparently don't want any feedback from customers. It seems that since Gillette bought Braun things went to hell. I doubt if I'll ever buy another Braun, and it's too bad, because the shave is really great when it does work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smooth but can't tackle a tough beard","review":"The shave unit is certainly smooth, but it can't tackle a tough beard.

For the price this product is no better than a cheap Braun Shaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun Shaver 5775","review":"The shaving head is quite good, but the side trimmer is difficult to use. Also this unit had a problem within a week. The battery is charged with a special cord. When the battery is being charged the shaver does not function. My unit was defective in that it would not charge the battery. Had to send it back to a service facility, warranty repair, and will be without the shaver for 2-4 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is worst shave","review":"After years of shaving with a cheap Remington 3 head shaver, I finally went shopping for a new razor. I researched and decided on this Braun Foil razor. I switch between a blade and electric because the blade is always a better, closer shave, but at least my old remington came close, and it was quick. This crappy razor was never even close to a blade and it's about a year old now and is worse. Plus it takes longer to keep going over the same area on my face to try to get all the whiskers that I may as well just lather up and use the blade. I use the electric to save tiem in the morning. This doesn't save anything.I keep it clean and oil it occasionaly, but it's still nothing like the $25.00 Remington, and nowhere near a blade shave. I would never by another Braun shaver. They should be ashamed to sell such garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Series 370 Men's Shaver","review":"This is an excellent product that shaves nearly as close as the multi-blade shavers that dominate the market now. If needed you could use it several times a day, since it is not at all abrasive to your skin. This razor is convenient and even cheaper than the multi-blade razors when you consider the annual cost of blade refills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never had such a close shave","review":"This review is for the 340 model.I have used this one only for one shave till now but I was so happy with it that I decided to write this review. I have never had such a close shave till now. Absolutely fantastic performance. I got it from walmart for approx 70, same price as it was on amazon (walmart made it quicker). Why I didn't make it 5 stars? It was leaving a few hair around the neck and i had to try it repeatedly. May be this was my first try because of which this happened. It took me quite sometime to get the best shave of my life. :)Updating: I am loving this product. If the stubbles are not very big the shaver does the job excellent. If you haven't shaved for days together then it will take some more effort. Whatever it is but the shave is fast and easy, close. Cleaning it takes sometime especially removal of water drops if you wash it. May be the cleaning base is a good option to buy if you want to spend 50 bucks more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Braun Shaver I ever owned","review":"I have owned many electric razors and of late I have been purchasing Bruan's. I seem to go thru an electric razor every 3 years or so. My last 3 razors have been Braun's thus this is my forth. I bought it because of the many postive reviews and because I was totally satisfied with my previous Braun razors. Not any more. This razor just does not shave. It a very solid built razor, thus out of the package I was pleased. But after the first shave I was not happy. I have been using it for 4 months now, I even changed the foil and blades as I bought extras when I made my original purchase. Still a very poor shave. I have been using my blade razor most of the time and only use the Bruan for a quick touch up. I am now reviewing which razor to go to next. I may buy a high end Braun but I hate to spend that kind of money and end up with the same results. I would not recommend this razor to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it Back","review":"The razor works as long as you are willing to shave the same area over and over again.

And it manages to be more irritating than the Norelco as well.I'm partialy bald and shave my head daily and this shaver is useless for that too.If your face was as flat as a table top this shaver might work, but it can't deal with curves and creases.Overall very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"high expectation, low performance","review":"Owned braun shavers most of my life... really enjoyed previous models performance until this one. Positive - the shaver charges fast and it is light. Now the negatives. It does not shave evenly especially around the corners of the chin. Also the trimmer is absolutely horrible - it failed to trim much at all and if it does, catches hair and tug on it. Would not recommend at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Had a Braun 4700 prior to this, which didn't have the contour moving head.

It was a replacement for my $29.95 Norelco rotary shaver. After using for a month it misses lots of whiskers, is noisy and has loud vibrations. This is similiar to wet dry Panasonic shavers I had before. In comparison, I Norelco is super quiet, no vibrations, 3 heads have more shaving surface, closer shave and has reserve to hold all your cut whiskers. Your whiskers fall out with the Braun.

I recognized 4 out of 11 animals by shape: a lion, a crocodile, a giraffe and an elephant. I also recognized a crown, a palm tree, and a man one one knee aiming his rifle. I also thought I saw a ghost. By looking at the picture in the box I identified the ghost as a toucan sitting on a branch, a monkey hanging by one arm from a branch with one arm and two legs dangling and only a bump for a head (impossible to recognize by the shape, as are all the rest of the figures). A boy hanging on to a branch, a jeep (for the hunter, I guess) and the pirate ship from the title of my review. The set is mini for sure, but the theme was not appropriate. Surely there are more jungle animals than the six in this set, two of which are unrecognizable by shape alone. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"Great little mug.

Looking at the rather poor legacy of Buchanan, Lincoln's ineffectual predecessor, Updike gives us a dying man, gazing back at his life and trying to find some comfort in his accomplishments, but instead he is haunted by his failures. Filled with historical figures that history itself has condemned to anonymity; Updike's play fails for the worst of all reasons; it's boring. Well-researched with an earnest attempt at finding an emotional center to one of history's ciphers, but still boring.Occasionally a scene grabs your interest, but they are few and far between.

It will be five stars if it could be more focused and systematic. Anyway if all the lessons are remembered and applied, a manager will make much less management mistakes and devise better management systems to avoid those mistakes. All in all, a very good and rare book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expert guide to decision-making tools","review":"In this original, honest and sometimes amusing book Gary Klein studied expert decision makers, such as firefighters, soldiers and chess masters, who operate under highly challenging conditions.

What seems, on the surface, like very suboptimal consideration of how to respond to situations works very well for us. Read this book to understand what is really going on in the head of an expert. It is not broad-based consideration of options, but rather a rapid ability to accurately recognize the most salient elements of a situation, formulate a potential response, run through it in their heads and choose it or formulate another (until they find one that works in simulation).If you are in a leadership position, this should change the way you think about developing others in leadership or high-volume decision-making positions.

I have awesome respect for him. He was betrayed and mutilated by his best friend, and still, he survived. He defeated his nemesis in a great strategic way that Sun Tzu would have mostly likely done.

Sun pin picks up were is grandfather leaves off and he goes into a little more detail. The book provides history of China when the books were written.

No prejudices color his opinion of what is edible. Cockles, Pen Shells, Coquina Clams... nothing escapes Gibbons' palate. Often, his \\"insider\\" information is priceless, e.g. how to remove a stone crab from its burrow without getting nipped; how to procure a harvest of the elusive but sweet Eastern Razor Clam; what to look for in Gulls' behavior to find surf clams...One drawback: details are sometimes sparse as to how to find some of the clams discussed. I have yet to find a single living cockle or razor clam, despite having read those chapters repeatedly, over several years. I suspect it was intentional on Euell's part; to keep his foraging disciples from taking too much from the sea, he obfuscated somewhat.

But today you can watch FOX News and observe how this type of propaganda is created and spread. A funny thing though is that the first RAMBO is a good movie. I love it. It is actually good, as hard as that is to remember now.

In Rambo IV, our hero, with the help of his \\"great friends\\" the Saudis and the Pakistanis, liberates the country of Iraq from the evil clutches of Saddam Hussein, then single handidly defeats the insurgency and gives the Iraqis a Jeffersonian democracy.

Just imagine that terrible things could happen today if Russians would defeated these peaceful Afgan people in 80's... However the history was gracious. So, bad Russianswere banished from Afghanistan, and good Taliban people were fully allowed to do that they were wanted to do. They got the money, they go the power and they got the time to prepare their plans. Should we say \\"thanks\\" to CIA and personally to Rambo for all that they did to Taliban, for all that they did to Al Queda, and for all that they did to USA??? Do you really think so?..

First of all, extremely unrealistic- Rambo shoots a few bullets at a Soviet helicopter and it explodes like a toy.

No thanks from the women of Afghanistan to Rambo for helping the Taliban take over! I was especially disappointed by the scene where Rambo gave the necklace to the little Al Quaeda kid. He got it from the dying Vietnamese female soldier in the previous movie, after he promised he'd never forget her! After she had saved his life helping free the American POWs! How soon he forgot! There are many reasons to hate \\"Rambo lll\\" but I think this one is the most memorable for me. Shortly after this movie was filmed, the Soviet Union retreated and Afghanistan fell to the same jihadists our troops are fighting there now. Afghan women have been liberated by the American troops after Rambo helped enslave them! Ironic, isn't it?

My mother is a devout Stallone fan, so I got to see many of his atrocious movies. However, the Rambo series stands out in my mind as some of his best--the third being my personal favorite.For the time period it was the ultimate action movie--a story that was meaningful at the time, nice sequences that display some rather nice visuals(the scene where he burns out the wound in his side was rather impressive).If you are looking for a good action movie that will satisfy a boring Saturday night, then this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try to Save them All.","review":"I have all of the Rambo movies and the progression to the final movie of course it there with the better video moves that make a movie look so realistic that by Rambo IV, I am closing my eyes through some of the violence.This movie was very good and another simple, singular Rambo thought to follow and he does, as is his character and his morals. Do what is right, even if you might get killed in the most adverse conditions on earth and feel no pain and don't complain. He does what he know he must do or he could never live with himself, he could not live , period. He would not be a man if he did not try and did not do his duty to save sould and write wrongs.

Facts and theories stumble over each other in long, meandering paragraphs. They announce their strong disagreement and disapproval with the theory set forth in Holy Blood, Holy Grail, but do not present an alternative clearly and with enough evidence for me to grasp. Too bad. I like their hidden treasure theme.I suppose what was especially disappointing were the several photos of Lionel looking too pleased with himself at important locales. I would rather have seen more graphs and visuals which promoted the revelations of those secrets.They present some fascinating esoteric codes at the end of the book, but don't explain them well enough for the average intelligent reader who happens not to be a puzzle fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly don't waste your time","review":"This book does have curious information and even some interesting observations but egads!

However, if you're interested in reading the Fanthorpes spin Christian apologetics, half-baked theories based on little or no evidence, and bash other authors, then this is the book for you. Instead, I would suggest Markale's \\"The Church of Mary Magdelene\\", Picknett and Prince's \\"The Templar Revelation\\", Douzet and Coppens' \\"The Secret Vault\\", or pretty much any of Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh's books (which the Fanthorpes are so fond of trashing - Baigent, Lincoln, and Leigh may have been steered down some wrong paths, but hey, at least they attempted to do their homework).

Save your money on this one! The writing is awful-- not just unskilled or boring, but full of errors. I don't mean that subtle bits of English, like when to use who vs. whom, were messed up. I mean that the English was just bad. \\"to be perished\\" is not acceptable English, and while the author's bio indicates he's not a native speaker, any competent editor should have been able to help him overcome that in writing for an English-language market. Instead, the entire book is just dreadful.Aside from the language, the quality of the book itself is poor, and the illustrations look like they were done by a middle-schooler, albeit a talented one.

I snapped one off during installation since the Warmrails unit was not flat (warped during shipping perhaps). I will repair it with Epoxy and completely fill the hollow portion of the mount with Epoxy resin in order to strengthen it.

Always thought that was a moronic complaint, as it is supposed to get pretty hot. I would not hold onto the rails. For those who wish it was hotter, well, that is a function of wattage. This Kensington runs about 100 watts, like keeping a light on all of the time. Certainly is not $40/month as someone else wrote. Hotter will be more costly.

The coating is so thin that one warmer came with scratches already through the paint. We chose \\"satin nickel\\" to match the finish on the fixtures in the bathrooms, but this finish is very different from the normal satin nickel finish.

Comes with the option to be plugged directly into the wall with no wires hanging on the floor. We leave in San Francisco where the weather is on the cooler side all year round, not too much sun and I was hopping that this unit would not only heat up the towels which it hardly does but dry them up as well. It takes it almost two days for the drying part, that's only if you keep it on 24/7 on, lost of energy and for this to work you have to have multiple towels on top of each other.

I would have liked it if the film had featured more historical sites where he had been, paintings of his times, and a wider lens in examining his life.The format of the film was largely a piece of music composed by Beethoven (played by a modern day pianist, violinist, or orchestra) and then someone espounding on some aspect of who Beethoven was. It went like this back and forth, back and forth.I think this documentary is rather intellectual, and cerebral, and will be enjoyable for those who like historical biography mixed with classical music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad i read the reviews","review":"Ok, I admit it...

But, after reading these reviews, I have decided to stick with it.I enjoy the complexity and depth of characters and having read G.

She focuses on one character for a few pages, then abruptly switches to another leaving the reader without a protagonist. There is no cohesion or logic to the changes and after awhile, I just gave up trying to piece it together. If you want to read a long, absorbing story with a cast of hundreds, try the George R. R.

The settings could have been interesting, but it all ended up being very boring and slow. There are a lot of setting changes which make it difficult to understand what is going on, and if in fact one should care anything for any character around. I just could not care, and it was a chore to finish this novel. Other reviews compare this to authors I do like a lot, but for me this just fell flat.To be as fair as possible, it is NOT an awful book, I can see why other people should think it interesting, but it was below what I would consider an average novel, so my verdict is 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I read this book and the rest of the trilogy and enjoyed them more than I thought I would.

Hundreds of pages go by and very little happens - almost like a soap opera, except that soap operas are usually cogent and easily understood - and, like this book - boring. This book is slow to develop a plot, if a plot is ever discovered.

A little acting and a whole lot of talking. The lead actress had this emotionless expression through out the show and it seemed to me she was just reading the scrip instead of acting . I dont care if they wanted the story to be as real as real life is. In real life no body runs into his/her ex 5 times a day , at the gym, the bookstore , the restaurant etc......they danced around the issue of them getting back together and sure enough one would be mad and storm out.

Despite its name, History Of The Poster is not so much a straightforward historical narrative as it is a fantastic gallery of posters used for politics, propaganda, advertising, and art throughout history.

Angola is a facinating place, and this book delivers a haunting look around. Warden Burl Cain is a classic case where truth is stranger than fiction. This is the kind of book that you wish could go on forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angola Bound: a friend gets religion on death row","review":"Bergner,who I should begin by saying I've known personally for some 13 years, has done an in incredible thing in this his first work of non-fiction. He's written a book that at once takes the reader to a deceptively verdant-death-row in Louisiana (the Prison was formerly a Plantation, think Tara times ten) to the born-again-warden's living-room,to the inmate's families less-than-Tara-like-homes. Bergner has focused all of his novelist's empathy and amazing acuity, and attention to detail on the lives of a few good----though very Bad men. The book becomes increasingly spiritual as the writers' year with the inmates draws to a close---as did this reader's experience of the writing and of Bergner's subjects'lives. Ultimately it's a book that, eventhough I work in publishing and could get them for free, I've just ordered six copies of to give to friends who Dan and I do not have in common."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Extraordinary Book","review":"Dan Bergner does an exceptional job of bringing the reader into a world that the reader will (hopefully) never visit on their own. In doing so, Bergner paints a uniquely vivid picture of the deprivation and desperation that is life in Angola and brings to life the inmates who populate the prison, including the warden with whom Bergner struggles for access and integrity. Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this book is that, in the end, it is about more than the inmates or the guards or the prison, it is about life and the struggle for transcendence. In sum, this is a remarkable book that will be appreciated by anyone who even mildly enjoys great writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The positive reviews I have read here are mystifying. Bergner is a talented writer, for sure, but I really felt as if he mailed in this book more than anything. It sure didn't seem like he spent a year at Angola prison or even in the vicinity. Seemed more to me as if he flew down there every once in awhile to see what's up. The book starts off GREAT, the first third, and then proceeds to fall apart with the not-so-interesting details of his fight with warden Cain to retain his access. Once he wins that fight it's as if the author has lost his steam. The charcters, even warden Cain, don't seem to come to life and their story, the one he tells, just isn't so compelling. I just came away feeling that the author was worn out. Too bad, too. I had high hopes for this one. Want to read a book that DOES make this kind of access work? Try Pete Early's The Hot House, about his two or three years inside of Leavenworth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cajun Music: The Essential Collection","review":"A really \\"toe tapping\\" CD.

The score adds emotional depth to many of the poignant scenes, underscores the humor in others, and never becomes an unwanted distraction as with most modern film scores. I especially liked the way the \\"Sioux Mambo\\" is used as a prelude to each of Fausto's \\"turning points.\\"It's easy to see why this film has spawned so many imitations and inspired many directors, especially Martin Scorsese - a director who knows how to weave music into the fabric of his films as if it were an additional character.One last point on Scorsese, when the Vitelloni are introduced in the beginning it was impossible for me not to think of the same introduction technique used in Goodfellas.Great use of locations, a very good cast, brilliant cinematography, but most of all a great evocative score make I, Vitelloni well worth the price of admission and worthy of repeated viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Fellini Vacuousness.","review":"Viewed: 6/12Rate: 36/12: Being lured to seeing I Vitelloni by the virtue of Alberto Sordi's magnificent performance in Mafioso but not at all enchanted by any of Federico Fellini's works, I was laid a dud of a picture.

His readings are entertaining, with lots of energy, but the book itself disappointed me. It's not really his fault, but his potentially funniest chapter, an episode exploring the Southern rite of passage of tipping cows with drunken rednecks, reads as an awkward dying giggle in the long shadow of the Matthew Shepherd hate murder. The grown-ups in this book are distressingly childish.I think this material would have worked better as one or two magazine articles, or a single performance art piece, as there are countless indulgent details about characters who never reappear and seem to exist in the book for no other reason than Kirk happens to remember them. How could the decade since these events have left him with so little insight? Kirk's response to challenge is invariably to act more queer. In an increasingly post-gay world, Kirk Read comes across as just a brat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but problematic","review":"First, I must say that I did enjoy the book. However, I have some problems. The book seems meant to be some kind of boost for young people, which I totally understand. He paints a picture of himself that is really positive. He's this kid who was just like everyone else and he didn't give a second thought to anything anyone may have thought about him. That just seems dishonest though. He had to be bothered by some of the things his classmates said to him. As strong a personality as he might have been growing up, there's no way Mr. Read was totally accepted in the South. I do think this book would be good for gay youths though. Once they grow up though, they'll realize what a fairy tale it is.

The quotes of Jesus in the book don't resemble his Biblical quotes, nor his quotes from the Nag Hammadi.

Dr Archibald Douglas disproved that Notowitch even visited monastery of Himis. There is no historical or archeological data supporting claim that Jesus ever went beyond Palestine. Moreover, there is absolutely no hint in His teaching that would even remotly resamble Eastern teachings, nor did the xenophobic Pharisees ever accused Him of such influence.

I would venture to say that all of the information that applies to the Olympus C 3030 could be extracted from the book and would easily fit in 8 pages. The rest of the book talks about basic photography - material that I believe anyone that buys this kind of camera, would have stored away years ago.I am not sure, but, I believe that much of the publication is \\"boiler plate\\". I would like to have someone compare it to the NIKON Coolpix 990 book and the Digital Photography book.My point - when you bought your Olympus, the manual will provide most of the information that you need - and the other \\"tricks\\" of using the camera will be learned by trial and error or from someone else that has learned.I really don't enjoy slamming a product, but I am just miffed over this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Reproduction","review":"I ordered this book mainly because I wanted to learn more about the Olympus C 3030 Zoom digital camera which I own. The original Olympus owner's manual, IMHO, is terrible. This book is a better manual, with good explanantions and examples (that are not easy to see at times) but is it worth the price? I mean, it is a spiral notebook of 102 pages. (...) Also, when I read the description of the book at the author's site, it says that the book was loosely bound so that it could be updated readily. Well, my copy says \\"2000\\" on the inside page and I doubt anything has been changed since the original printing. Maybe if the book is ordered from Mr. Curtin directly, it is updated, but I prefer ordering books through Amazon because of this company's reputation for good customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"A darn good and useful book","review":"This book is also useful for those of us who have an Olympus C-3020 camera because the C-3020 is nearly identical to the C-3030 in so many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"He won't get a Pulizer but he's sure got personality","review":"I bought this book becasue I've dabbled in the cyber-dating thing and i thought it would be fun to see what an \\"expert\\" had to say. I was glad that he didn't spend too much time on the technical side of it and focused more on fun stuff like some of his stories and his ideas about male and female relations and how they can play out over the computer (which i have to admit were pretty funny and might shock some younger or inexperienced readers). Overall, it's a great book if you want something light and easy to kill a few hours and have a few laughs. There wasn't much i didn't already know about how to meet a woman online, but he did make a few interesting points that I hadn't thought of. It could be helpful for someone who doesn't know the first thing about it too. Good book to pass around to your friends too - my girlfriends think it's hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"Definitely a book for guys, and his mother would want to wash his mouth out with soap.

If they would, I'd be at the head of the line to purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"But a 5-star metaphor!!!","review":"There is only one thing \\"wrong\\" with this book: it points men and women in the wrong direction, outward instead of inward. Psychosexually speaking, in this day and age of widespread rape, domestic violence, and sexually transmitted diseases, it behooves each potential Lover, whether male or female, to \\"come within\\" and cease \\"looking for It\\" out there, which is to say, treat every \\"male\\" online as a Voice, not a physical person, and inner Voice for astute women, the Voice of her own Animus (see Jung's books); the reverse is true for men, the inner Voice belonging to the Anima. Within EACH individual, the inner marriage of both Anima and Animus results in personal peace, happiness, and even Joy. Thank you for the 5-star metaphor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced thriller","review":"A very entertaining and fast-paced suspense novel that interweaves real persons and events with a fictional plotline that is quite plausible. The book is built upon a genuine historical question: what happened to various works of art pilfered (or rumored to have been) by the Nazis during World War II? When present-day (fictional) people stumble upon part of the answer, the action begins. As someone who reads non-fiction almost exclusively, I did not expect to become as engrossed in this work as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classical take on the new Zombie craze!","review":"As a self proclaimed horror flick aficionado who wants to be as brief as possible, I will say this:Humans vs Zombies is an independent film that was written and directed by people who \\"get it\\". This was a very good story line, great filming, good acting, and good special effects. If you like the classic zombie movies from \\"back in the day\\" but want a more modern feel to it then this is the movie for you.I loved the character dynamics, and interactions. I also liked the idiosyncratic mannerisms displayed by each actor. In total this movie was worth the 1.5 hours and the 3.99 to watch instantly on Amazon. I am so pleased by this film that I will definitely look into other movies directed by Brian T. Jaynes. The ending was exactly what this film needed to. Great job guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, simply awful","review":"Juvenile movie......and that is being disrespectful of juveniles. This movie was not scary, poorly made in every way from film quality to sound quality.

This is the video equivalent of a sexually transmitted disease.Don't spend your money renting this much less purchasing the thing. I think I actually paid $3.99 to rent the thing for a week and I feel like I have been gang raped by a herd of horses.

After weeks of listening to Mary-Kate and Ashley's CD over and over and over again, I was thrilled to have something the kids loved and I could enjoy too. The songs are just plain fun. I love the classics, and these aren't the classics, but I can sing along and still enjoy them. I was quite impressed with N'Sync!

However, most of the songs are bad and dreadful. The only ones I found good were the ones by Ashanti, Jessica Simpson, Hilary Duff, and Christina Aguilera. The rest are pretty bad. Boy bands?

A 6 year old and 3 year old both love it. It's amazing how quickly they adapt to this thing and start climbing all over every surface of it. It's not a treehouse -- it's like the monkey bar sets we remember from growing up. The assembly isn't bad, but I can't overemphasize the need to organize at the outset. Take the time to sort the screws and bolts into ziploc bags and label them. The 10 minutes it takes to do this will save you hours. All in all, it probably took 4-5 hours to complete assembly. Use quickcrete for posts to set the posts. I used about 60 lbs per post hole. It was easy as could be -- pour the mix in the hole, soak it, and cover. When's the last time you assembled something where every weld was right, and every hole lined up just where it was supposed to? This is one of those.

We ended up buying this one and could not be happier. It is sturdy and my kids LOVE it.

Unfortunately, the author seems to say everything he can make out of their writings & lives within the first couple of chapters. Afterwards you're just left reading the same thing over & over again. I would suggest reading their individual works if you want something more stimulating. However, this may be a good starter book if you know nothing about either person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read despite a somewhat obvious bias","review":"This book is very unique in the fact that it provides two sides to a very weighty question. Almost every other book out there that deals with the existance of God takes only one perspective, giving the reader very little information about the opposing side's arguements. While I thought that perhaps the author did show a slight bias, it was not nearly as overwhelming as many other books out there on this subject. And in my personal opinion, it is nearly impossible to write completely objectively on such a controversial topic. In addition, this is one of the most readable books available, and is not weighted down with a lot of theology or philosophy. It is very straightforward and easy to read, and I found myself unable to put it down! I heartily recommend this book to anyone searching for answers to this important question!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining and educational read","review":"I am not a scholar, a student of either psychology or religion, just an avid reader. This book is a well-written and an enjoyable reading experience. I knew a little about Lewis and less about Freud before I started, but found both men's lives and ideas of interest. And, as sometimes happens, you'll pick up a book to read and something in it will provide a little spark of insight into something that's troubling you. That was the case for me with this book, so I'll always be glad of having read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An incredible disappointment.","review":"This book was an incredible disappointment and I hold myself responsible for not doing the proper research, such as reviewing this site, prior to purchase. I had hoped for an honest point-counterpoint debate. But the book is obviously biased toward the Theist's point of view and anything but honest. For example, when Freud describes himself as an \\"infidel Jew\\", you just know that it's the author's subtle way of attacking Freud and how the author really feels about him. What really burns my biscuits is that I also purchased the DVD before viewing the show on PBS. Oh well, maybe I'll be able to get some of my money back when I sell the book and DVD to Half Price Books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be published by Zondervan","review":"I'll start off by saying I am biased, but that's no problem, because Nicholi is too. At least I'm not selling a book by disguising that fact. Perhaps Freud and Lewis could be seen to reflect two differing worldviews held by a large swathe of people. They certainly have been influential to many readers and to our culture as a whole. However, any unbiased party would immediately have to accept that as far as brain power goes, Lewis simply wasn't in the same league as Freud. He wasn't as original, and as a philosopher (or apologizer) his arguments have the tension of wet noodles. I mention this only because as far as the showing in this book, Lewis wins the day intellectually and existentially. Which might be right if the good life = meekness and stolid asceticism. Advertised correctly this book would be another vacuous addition to the religious best-seller of the week. As it stands, expect to be [disappointed] if you judge a book by it's cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Question of God","review":"The book was everything I was looking for.

This is a book to read for research though, as opposed to entertainment. The author showed their lives from an unbiased viewpoint which was amazing considering some of the information he covered.

I am not talking about the superficial religiosity that is so common today but the genuine faith spoken of in the Bible (without being a fanatic!).

I was bewildered by how the great Sigmund Freud with all his brilliance and genius yet lived a miserable life. Then on the other hand you look at C.S. Lewis and you compare the effects of religious views in their lives and it becomes clear. The single greatest difference between these two people is not their intelligence, nor their power or might. It is not their humanistic philosophies. It is their views and their relationships towards God that is the single most defining characteristic that separates these two colossal giants. Great read for the educated and scholarly, and a captivating read for those interested in psychology, religion, and sociology."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was great","review":"I loved the book.

However, this not interfere with the reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the open-minded","review":"One reviewer describes this book as \\"propaganda,\\" but this misses the point. The author Dr. Armand Nicholi, is a practicing psychiatrist and a professor at Harvard Medical School who has taught a course based on the subject of this book at Harvard College for more than 25 years. And the author shows that Lewis didn't merely \\"flirt with atheism during his youth,\\" as one reviewer states, but was indeed a Freudian atheist while he was a professor at Oxford. No condescension or smugness by the author or Lewis is intended, just a challenging comparison of views based on prodigious research. But it does take a certain open-mindedness to benefit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Read It","review":"Read it and take what is worthwhile from it. It's a pretty good book in alot of respects. The sheer fact that Dr. Nicholi contrasts Lewis and Freud was the reason why I, personally, bought this book- on a whim. His rhetoric and writing is so-so I think, but that's a far beyond forgivable flaw.For additional reading about Sigmund Freud, \\"Degenerate Moderns\\" by E. Michael Jones is a good book to read. It was one that kept popping into my mind while I was reading this here book."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah blah blah","review":"This book may be interesting to people who have never read or thought about Lewis or Freud, but otherwise it is just like reading pop psychology. Lewis thought this, blah blah blah, Freud thought this, blah blah blah. And, the writer is a Christianity sympathizer who obviously has bias. This might be a great book for those who have never read anything beyond Psychology Today. Maybe high school kids... if there's any left who still read books."},{"rating":"1","title":"C.S. Lewis worship in disguise","review":"I purchased this book hoping for a thoughtful exchange of ideas on the topic of God's existence and religion in general. However, the author frames his supposed \\"debate\\" in such a way as to not allow a full airing of Freud's views while always positioning C.S. Lewis as the final answer on the subject. The numerous problems with Lewis' thoughts are never pointed out, let alone explored. All of Lewis' supposed responses would work equally as well for any other believer in any other theistic religion, yet this point seems lost on the author. The author also conveniently ignores the fact that since Freud didn't have the opportunity to answer Lewis directly, other have do so repeatedly and with great convincing. This book is intellectually dishonest and a piece of propaganda at best! BE WARE! This author does his readership and the educational institution from which he hales a huge disservice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Using Freud as a front.","review":"Without reading the reviews I started this book. Have only heard half, but after a feigned objectivity it is blatantly biased. It is a book contrasting three people actually; Freud, Lewis before and Lewis after his conversion.Already it is obvious the author is making a case for happiness being exclusive to those that believe. He contrasts Lewis in the last part of his life with Freud and the younger Lewis. It is easy to skew any look at Freud simply because he is open and honest about any assertions he could make against the existence of a superior being.If you are looking for an unbiased comparison of the two men, look elsewhere. The author simply uses Freud to assert a favorable view of Lewis. Of course, if in the last half of the book the author leans again toward objectivity I will amend this assessment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicholi is an Apologist for Lewis","review":"This book is hugely disappointing. I had to stop at page 105 when it became clear that it was hopeless to expect the author to give Freud's position a legitimate airing. This is not a debate - this is a very biased presentation in favor of Lewis's view, with little or no presentation of the arguments against it from Freud's view. The arguments lack any foundation in logic and little if any in philosophy. It is also disappointing that someone trained as a psychiatrist would deliberately deceive the readers into thinking this was an honest presentation of the two perspectives, or, alternatively and more plausibly, that he would be so blind to his own bias. I favor the latter explanation. Nicholi is trained to recognize illogical, unreasonable, and neurosis-inducing efforts by others to eliminate congnitive dissonance; too bad he cannot recognize such efforts in himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ad hominem ad nausem","review":"Other reviews said it before, so I shall be brief: this book is sold as a fairly balanced review of ideas, but that is a sham. From the first chapter, it is obvious that Lewis is better viewed by the author, while Freud suffers both gratuitous personal attacks and critical commentary(albeit usually superficial, which simply compounds the problem) from the author (whereas Lewis sales through areas begging for questioning; the author would have no such thing!). A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"zydeco: The Essential Collection","review":"I guess I ordered the wrong Zydeco CD. This one is OK or less. Has a few good songs on it.

The genre is called 'drum and bass'. However, this CD is nothing but sped up snare drums to an unthoughtful, unoriginal, jazzy background sound in the style of LTJ Bukem (Bukem is better in when it comes to jazzy DnB). The people in the clubs in Europe would look like they drank 4 pots of coffee if they danced to the snare drum -- but you don't dance to the snares, you dance to the bassline... and this CD is definitely lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"FYI","review":"For those of you seeking INDUSTRIAL MUSIC, please be informed that this artist is NOT Clause Larsen (Leaether Strip), but an EBM project by a completely DIFFERENT artist using the SAME NAME by coincidence.

I have been sending various emails back and forth, sometimes they return them sometimes they don't. Usually it's \\"we will check on that and get back to you.\\" Very frustrating.

Since then it has crashed on me several times. They said it was a glitch in their system and after NUMEROUS emails their instructions finally worked. They kept giving me the run around, changing things, and often completely ignoring me. After all this and thinking all my treasured recipes and hard work/time spent entering them was a complete loss I got it all back, and now I've lost it all over again.

Recently, I purchased a new computer with the Vista operating platform. The older version of MasterCook would not work on it so I checked Amazon to see if there was a newer version available which would be compatible with Vista, and was thrilled to see that Amazon indicated that version 9 would work. I purchased it, installed it, and had a lot of problems. While attempting to learn why the new software wasn't working properly, I just learned that Amazon has listed the product information incorrectly. The software manufacturer, ValueSoft, indicated in their HELP guide that MasterCook 9 is not compatible with Vista...so BEWARE.

It is not as intuitive as I thought it woold be. It is not what I was looking for - an easy to use source of new receipes, but with the ability to accept my recipes with minimum hassle.

Version 9 is an improvement with some nice added features. I especially like the web import tool. It was a little difficult to find it and get it working with Internet Explorer, but well worth the trouble. Once you open the tool in IE you simply highlight portions of an online recipe, mark what the text is (title, instructions, picture, etc) and then import directly to Mastercook. I love this new feature. If you have an older version, it is worth upgrading. If you have never tried Mastercook and are looking for recipe software, this version is a good one for the price. It comes with many recipes and you can easily add your own or collect new ones online!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Program to Catalog Recipes","review":"Bought this on recommendation from a friend.

First, the recipes are not great. They claim over 8,000 recipies and only 150 are listed under \\"kid-friendly\\". And what are they? Pizza with this, Pizza with that. Not very creative. The calendar feature is not at all user friendly. The shopping list is fine, although doesn't do a great job of merging, so you have a few different entries for \\"boneless chicken\\" depending on whether the recipe uses lbs or number of breasts. I think I'll go back to just looking through cookbooks and handwriting out the menu for the week. Just not worth the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"program is buggy","review":"I have version 9.0.00.20. It is basically unusable. Customer service by Valusoft is about the worst I have run into.

Full of features that do not work, non cohesive. Recipes they have compiled from free sources. No insight. I am just plain mad and disappointed. I hate being taken.

I wish ValuSoft would invest in an upgrade. My biggest gripe is that I bought a Palm Pilot primarily to export shopping lists to only to discover that MasterCook doesn't support newer versions of the Palm operating system. So I spent over a hundred dollars on a device my twenty dollar software can't talk to. Major bummer. I'm too dependent on my Palm Pilot now for other things so I still have to print shopping lists to carry to the grocery store with me.I also find the print design module very difficult to use. I suppose I shouldn't expect too much from such inexpensive software but the tools are really clunky.I keep hoping ValuSoft will come out with an upgrade soon.

I would also like to be able to customize the views more, such as viewing certain fields as columns in the cookbook or recipe list view so I don't have to always go to the search function.I have found the import function works quite well.

Actually, yes it is. This movie from director Phillip Roth (Velocity Trap, Falcon Down) is a triumph in bad filmmaking. It's predictable every step of the way, right down to how the giant snake is going to tear its prey apart. It's about as likable as \\"It's Pat: The Movie,\\" only a little funnier. The special effects are terrible, hard to see, and very confusing at times. UFO LLC usually has some pretty sweet effects in their flicks, but this movie is different. It suffers from minimal visibility and a terrible lack of anything scary, let alone coherent, in the film. At least Dean Cain got a paycheck. As long as he's making a movie, I suppose the world is a better place. As long as it's not \\"Boa 2: Snakes Alive.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformed!","review":"After much anticipation to view this DVD, I was extremely disappointed to find out that \\"Boa\\" on DVD is only available in the \\"Full Screen\\" format, which is actually \\"Pan & Scan\\". ... list this movie as being in Widescreen 1.85 Aspect Ratio. Please get your facts straight!!! I would have liked to have seen the rest of the movie (which I stopped once I realized it was not in Widescreen) because dispite its low budget and comic book style, it looked like a fun Saturday night type horror flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?!?!?!?","review":"First, in all fairness, I haven't seen this movie. Why? I refuse to watch so called horror films that demonize snakes. Snakes are NOT evil, people, they are part of nature, and maybe occasionally one will eat a person. But we eat cows, spiders eat flies, and so on. Snakes are lovely creatures, and the CGI never does justice to their beauty.Anyway, my main problem with this movie? The cover. 'Boa' it says. OK, Boa Constrictor. The people behind this movie obviously did not do their homework on Boa Constrictors. Their teeth do not sit up front like venomous fangs. They sit in back, curved backwards, which is why a bite from a Boa would be painful.In conclusion, please, do not make more movies demonizing animals. Make movies about monsters that may or may not exist, make movies about humans who are monsters inside, but don't make something innocent evil. And if you MUST, do your homework on the creature and make it look realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONSTRICTED THRILLER","review":"It's hard to believe while watching BOA That Dean Cain once played Superman. Here he is supergeek, pathetically underacting a role that wasn't even needed in the film. Ditto to Elizabeth Lackey's lackluster performance as his obsessed paleontological wife. Only Mark Sheppard as the Chechyan prisoner brings life into a role that should have been expanded. His heroics at the end put Dean Cain in his place quite properly.Now as for the snake, there were times it looked frighteningly real; other times it was quite obvious the movie's budget constricted its monster. Craig Wasson who was so good in \\"Body Double\\" and \\"Ghost Story\\" horribly overacts his role as the Warden. The finale is quite good, and unexpected compared to the movie itself.All in all, it's nowhere as awful as \\"Tail Sting\\", but it's not as good as it could have been under different guidance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yummy Yummy! MORE bad actors in my tummy ^^","review":"Okay, lets get one thing strait - the acting made me fall over laughing...Dean Cain and the girl playing his wife did a good job but the prisoners were terrible...Also, there wasn't enough time for the snake...I am a die hard animal-eating-people fan and I think that all the savage beasts should have a reasonable amount of time.

Do yourself a favor, and don't buy this movie, it is boring and stupid. The two snake movies I would recommend are Anaconda, and Python 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It could have been better than Anaconda. BOA ( R ) a movie I picked up thinking it would have some Sci-Fi value. I was disappointed. The film takes place 12,000 feet below the earth's crust in the South Pole. A team of engineers are building the next Alcatraz to house the badest of the very bad. I guess the governments of 30 plus nations thought this is the best place to build it. The movie stars Dean Cain (TV's Superman) and he gets no help for an unknown supporting cast. Although I don't think a cast of Oscar winners could have kept this movie off the B list. Compare it to Alien, there is no comparison. If you're in the mood for a movie of big snakes, Anaconda with Jon Voight and Jennifer Lopez is a better choice. Or switch to big Crocks in Lake Placid staring Oliver Platt and enjoy a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looked great, Baby doesn't seem to enjoy it much***Edited***","review":"We begged for this crib toy. But Baby isn't very interested. She will play with it for a minute or two, but really prefers her Aquarium (best crib toy!). I think she gets frustrated with it because the keys aren't positioned quite right for her hands or feet. She also tries to push the lights to make it work, but the sensors aren't under the lights. I think the setup confuses her a little. We also put it on the floor to see if she would like it there, no such luck.***edited*** Okay, now at 8 months she likes it. We pulled it out the other day and set it on the floor. She giggles every time the animal noises come on, especially when I imitate them. (I never thought I would be oooh-oooh-ooohing like an ape!)

Sometimes she enjoyed listening to the tunes but you can get that from any other music instrument. The fact that the lights are ABOVE the key boards was confusing to her when she was little and she kept pushing the lights, which of course produced nothing. Also, the elephant sound scared her. I would not buy it. It also started to make funny sounds after a while - not durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not attach to crib well","review":"This is a very cute toy, but the skimpy strings you have to use to attach it to the crib are awful.

I couldn't wait for my daughter to use it. What a disappointment. Every day would pass and I would wonder that if she got just a little bit older, would she play with it? I have since taken it out the crib and she did play with it a few times on the floor. There are much better toys out there.

He would kick it randomly from birth but never understood it was his kicking that did it and he couldn't see the piano to see the lights. I only turned it on a few times and then soon the first mode was broken and wouldn't work at all. It just makes a continous clicking sound. Then I tried using it on the floor for tummy time and he'd get tired of it very quickly. I tried it again when he learned to sit up and he still couldn't care less. I also think the sound quality is very poor and some of the animal sounds don't even sound like the animal they are, especially the bear. A lot of today's toys have very clear sounds to them and this one just doesn't compare. I love Fisher Price and most of their other products, this one was just a dud.

She is just so amazed by this so our her parents..:) Believe me your child will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way for baby to learn cause and effect","review":"We have the toy attached to our son's crib just like it is in the advertisement. Our son was only 4 months old when he got the toy so when he would kick the toy we figured it was just his natural reflexes. But eventually we realized that he was not kicking just as a reflex, he was kicking the toy because he actually knew that it would cause the toy to make music. Whenever we put him down in the crib he immediately starts kicking, even if the toy is not on or if he is not posititoned towards the toy. If he kicks and the toy is not on, we can see it in his face that he is expecting to hear music. I would not believe it myself if I didn't see it for myself...it is so obvious. I don't see him playing with this toy much longer, but it's an inexpensive toy that will definitley get it's money worth for baby's first year."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"My little girl didn't show much interest in kicking this at all.

Linda Blair gives a credible performance as the young widow of another vet whose father is the local rich guy. Her small son is a doll and the whole movie is one that most anyone in the family would enjoy. For once, the sheriff in the small town is not the bad guy (although his deputy isn't all that likeable!) and the action is not dependant on murder and mayhem--but lots of stuff gets blown up and there are enough shots fired to please action film lovers.

Particularly, it develops the theme of forgiveness at the level a child can understand; Pea's realization that she must forgive for her own sake as well as for another's is poignant and a wonderful lesson for children to learn, especially in contrast to Roscuro's heart which healed crookedly because he did not forgive. I also appreciated the clear illustration that one can be dangerously misled by listening to unwise or evil people (rats, in this story). This book could be a real discussion starter on either of these topics. However, I do agree with the reviewer who cautioned that the abuse of Miggery Sow was treated lightly. Since her abuse was so severe, I'm not sure it belonged in a child's book at all. This was more than Cinderella being kept home from the ball sweeping ashes! Because of it's positive points, I recommend this book; however, because of the abuse issue, I do so with reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book about a mouse","review":"THIS BOOK IS GREAT!

The queen had a heart attack and died. The king made spoons and soup illegal!!!!I recommend The Tale of Despereaux if you like adventurous books with happy endings.

No wonderful role model here for young girls.Very sad and disturbing story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsuitable for Children of any age!! Violent and Sadistic","review":"Like the other reviewer who gave this story one star, I received the book for my 8 year old son as a gift from his grandmother. Yes, the book is creative, enchanting and very well written. But absolutely NOT! suitable for children. The story opens with the depiction of still born babies, infant rejection, continues with excommunication for the idolisation of unattainable love, includes capital punishment and covers a lengthy paragraph on the fine points of torture, including the art of befriending and then betraying someone so as to amplify the effect of torture. As an adult, the story is interesting. But for a child, no-way. In my opinion, these themes don't belong in our children's culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tale of Despereaux","review":"I received the book in a timely manner. It was an older book, but I knew I was purchasing it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas - Grade 3","review":"The Tale of Despereaux by Kate DiCamillo is about a mouse that falls in love with a princess named Pea. Despereaux is different from the other mice because he reads books and talks to humans. When Pea is kidnapped by a servant named Miggery Sow, Despereaux tries to save her. Despereaux is a brave mouse. The book is interesting and I read it two times! Well, my teacher read it once and I am reading it again now. I like the characters because the do and say funny things. I like it when Miggery Sow answers everyone with \\"Gor!\\"The book teaches an important lesson. Even though Despereaux is a mouse and Pea is a princess, they still love each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"entrancing tale","review":"I used this book as a read aloud with my 7 year daughter. Former high school English teacher, now home school mom, I thought this was one of the best books of children's literature we've encountered yet. (Also loved Because of Winn Dixie.) From the first chapter we were captivated by the characters, the brilliantly descriptive narrative drew us into the story, and the illustrations captured the mood of the story perfectly. Because of the short chapters, we were able to read alot or a little depending on what was happening that day. My daughter loved the story so much she kept asking her friends over to listen with her. A story of love, hope, faithfulness to ones-self, and good overcoming evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"A very good book, to say the least.

It deserved the award it got, definitly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting classic","review":"I just finished reading this book to my children, whose ages span 6 - 10. They were all captivated by it, as was I. The chapters tell of different characters in the book, and how they eventually intersect (like in Pulp Fiction). There is humor and sadness, kindness and meanness. My kids and I had to promise each other than none of us would \\"read ahead\\", but it was hard! This is a book they will remember, like I remember the Secret Garden or A Wrinkle in Time. A wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a charmer","review":"This book about outcasts is delightfully old fashioned but a heart warmer through and through.

It was recommended in \\"Publisher's Weekly,\\" and we've now ordered the other books that were recommended along with it. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I liked this book a lot. It's about a little mouse named Despereax, a rat named Chiaroscuro, and a poor serving girl named Mig who all eventually end up in a castle at the same time together. Desperaux's mission is to rescue the Princess Pea, Roscuro's is to have revenge on Pea, and Mig's is to switch places with the princess, serving girl to princess and vice versa. It may sound like one of the cheesey Princess in a castle stories but it's better than that. It's definitely not cheesey. I also liked the fact that Kate DiCamillo doesn't go on and on and on about the setting of the story if you know what I mean. It was a beautiful morning blah blah it was crisp and sunny la la blah.This is a good book that you'll want to get while it's on sale. Kind of expesive. Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tale of Despereaux","review":"I was very excited to read this story. Kate DiCamillo is a talented author. Before I continue I want to point out that I am an adult and enjoy reading books for all ages. However, although this book is marketed for 9-12 year olds, I felt it should be for children much younger. The story begins well, but then the author addresses the reader throughout the book, often talking down to them as if they don't know anything. I found this not only distracting, but I thought it didn't give kids enough credit. Children are smart, they get it. I don't beleive they need to be hit over the head with points or asked to look up words in the dictionary while enjoying a good book. That said, I thought the story ended too easily. There was great build up and controversy as everything came to a head, but then the story just kind of petered out. A great build up needs a great ending. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 of the BEST books I read","review":"i recomend this book to 4th and 5th graders. if ever one day you are looking for light than open this book and read. when you read this book you might or will find something,a few things, called light, darkness and love.

I can tell you, I was highly impressed with this book. Di Camillo is a pro with imagery and voice and all I can remember thinking once I'd finished is that I cannot ever remember having read something so magical...not even as a child. Furthermore, the artwork is beautifully illuminating to the story. This one is good for people of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why in My Opinion Despereaux is a great book","review":"I think the book think the book The Tale of Despereaux is very good and interesting. The main characters are Despereaux Miggory Sow and a rat that wants revenge on the royal family for blaming him for the queen's death.One more thing is there is some soup. The reason this is a good book is that there are so many main characters because the book is broken up into stories each one giving information about the others. The last thing I am going to say is that the rat, the soup, and the queens death all tie into each other, but you're just going to have to find out how."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tale of Great Bravery","review":"The tale of Desperaux by Kate DiCamillo is an amazing book filled with joy, darkness, bravery, romance and adventure. This story is about a mouse, Desperaux, who just doesn't seem to fit in with the other mice. Desperaux loved to read and listen to music. One day, he heard music and followed it. The sound was the King singing Princess Pea to sleep. All at once, he seemed to be falling in love with Princess Pea. Little did he know that jeoulosy, hate, and darkness would come together and try to take away his precious Pea. Can Desperaux, being as little and timid as he was, save Princess Pea from harm's way?

Tha human was the princess. the princess was with her dad the and the king was singing a song to princess so could to sleep. one second later the princess sees Despereaux. and that is when the adventures happen. its a great book for kids i recomend this book to kids that like adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3rd Graders LOVE it!!!!!!","review":"I have read this book aloud to my third grade class for over four years. Every year, they simply love hearing the tale. It does have some sadness, but I think 8 to 10 year olds appreciate hearing the bad with the good in a story. The characters and symbolism are developed well and have clear motives that children can understand. It was sad to say good-bye to the characters at the end of the story--we wanted to hear more about their adventures together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tale of not-so-disappointing","review":"Kate's books are always so refreshing, simple and well written.

I imagine it's holiday release will put a dark cloud over more than one family's holiday festivities."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story for kids","review":"I rate it only four stars because I read it for myself and did find it interesting but many things were just very annoying on how the author keep directing the readers and askjnd the reader questions and so forth. I got this book for $1 through a kso and very glad of it.I'm sure however that it would be great for kids. It is directed to them nonetheless. I give it four keeping kids in mind.

Kate DiCamillo has written what is sure to be a classic fairy tale, as worthy as any by the Brothers Grimm, to be told and re-told for years to come. There is bravery, deceit, aspirations and sacrifice all told in the voice of a narrator that addresses and engages the reader. This book is fabulous as a read-aloud!--Reviewed by Michelle Delisle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This has to be one of the worst novels i have ever encountered, the previews looked so promising. There is sadness, death, backstabbing and stupid adults all throughout this novel. I think there is enough sadness in the world, yet to read this to a child.. i found that idea wrong in every sense of the word. I am previewing novels for my daughter to read when she can handle it and this is definitely NOT going to be one of them. I did preview another book she wrote and again it was awful. As a writer for children I feel this chick falls flat. If your into animal novels that teach children how to deal with death, war, politics and teach kindness, love and teamwork then i would stick with the Redwall series by Brian Jacques..... Kate Dicamillo could certainly learn a few writing lessons from Mr. Jacques about childrens novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the minority...hated it","review":"I will admit that I plan to reread this book. I first read it a couple years ago to see if it was something my kids would enjoy as a read-aloud book. It had received rave reviews so I was looking forward to it. I hated it and almost didn't finish it but did so because I kept holding out hope it would improve. It was truly dark (think WWII writings) and morbid and I found very little uplifting, humorous,etc. I read a bit to my one daughter (the most serious who has patience with most books) and she even lost interest quickly. Now I see they have made a movie of it and I was shocked! I thought what a depressing film. But I know everyone now seems to love it so I'll give it another shot and re-read it. But I guess I'd warn people to read a chapter online or in library before buying it, just to see if its what you expect in tone and style."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tale of Despereaux","review":"This was the first daily deal book I purchased after recieving my Kindle for Christmas.

The author is Kate DiCamillo.It is fantasy and the theme s a mouse learning the difficulty of life. My favoriteCharacter is Fourlogh, Desperaunx's brother. I like Foulgh because he is the brotherThat takes Desperaux to the Dungeon; I think that makes the story dramatic.Another thing I like about this book is the authors writing style.I think it is exclusive, How she puts herself into the story somehow, like she's one of the characters love this book because its dramatic and really shows a strong brave mouse vs the world and its darkness. I think the French writing is cool.People who like dramatic and romantic stories should read this book and love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for kids and adults","review":"Read this book!

We give the book 4 stars. The book is about a tiny mouse named Despereaux. We knew that he was different when he was born with his eyes open. He also has very large ears that lead him to music. When he finds the music, he meets Princess Pea. She tells him he is cute. Despereaux falls in love with the princess. When his parents find out, he is thrown into the dungeon. The rest of the story focuses on Despereaux's adventures. He is determined to find his way back to Princess Pea. One of the strengths of this book is the descriptive language. We could make clear pictures in our minds about the way the characters might have looked and also the type of characters they were; such as, mean and evil or nice and goodhearted. We would recommend this book to people of all ages. It is an awesome adventure story.

And he is in love with a human princess - the Princess Pea. Then there is Miggery Sow, the maid who wants to be a princess. And lots of rats.This is a tale of love, death, forgiveness.I enjoyed reading this children's book (and have actually ordered it so I can read it to my twin grandchildren) but I did enjoy the author'sThe Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulanemore. I enjoyed the illustrations more in EDWARD TULANE'S tale also even though the pencil sketches in THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX by Timothy Basil Ering are charming.Short chapters, good explanations of some of the unusual words - great for reading in the classroom or at bedtime.THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX is darker and I would recommend that children be a little older that read it (or have it read to them). There are deaths (including mothers), rats, dungeons, blood, violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"A great story, just poorly written.

It is very dark and filled with characters who are abusive and abused, lonely, sad, violent, and depressed. I read the entire novel because I wanted to have faith in it and wanted to believe that it would get better. It didn't. The subsequent animated film was no better.

It was also hard to tell sometime what was a dream in the book and what was really a part of the story. I think it was confusing to read sometimes. I liked the characters of Despereaux and Princess Pea.

During my many years as an English teacher of adolescent children, I always asked myself before presenting them with any book, 'What kind of world does this take them into?' The world in this book is not one I would take any child into. An adult can read it without too much distress and we see the gleams of hope that the author introduces, but it is a dark, dark world.Interestingly, by contrast I was always happy to read 'To Kill a Mockingbird' with my 15 year olds because they live in the kindly world of Scout protected from the harshness of that society while still coming to understand the very serious and cruel things going on in that community.The darkness in the world created by Kate Dicamillo is gratuitous and pointless. I will not be reading any of her other books. Please someone, point me to to some good books for children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Newbery winner?!","review":"I could not finish reading this book- it was terrible.

Either go late, or make sure your kids don't see the Coraline preview - if they do you will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this book but my daughter did","review":"I found this book to be rather stupid and a pathetic story to boot. First of all, who would name a princess Pea? But, more to the point, the story includes a girl who is sold by her father and then beaten up by her owner. Why is that a good plot line for a childrens' book? My nine-year-old daughter liked it however. I thought some of the plot twists and turns odd like the jailer and the dungeon he works in. And the Miggery Sow character sad, and not at all sympathetic. I liked the little mouse, however. I just did not like it. I don't know why kids do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please!!","review":"I read this book, because I was really bored, and it was in that car.

It was annoyingly \\"happy\\", \\"silly\\", and \\"fun\\". Then again it may just be me. If you have read any of my other reviews then you will see that I mostly read dark fantasy. Little talking mice, outlawed soup, and killer rats simply don't appeal to me. Then agin the suggested reading age is 6- 12, so that could also be it. Ok I'll stop now before I make anyone mad.

As an author, when I read this book to my children, it literally depressed me because I wished I had done it. I loved the way she put it all together, the deep characterization and natural longings of those on the outside. It was just beautiful, inspirational, not to mention a great springboard for discussions with your children. My boys are 10, 9, 6 and they were rapt with attention. They don't even care that much about the pictures (which is amazing) because they have created their own in their mind.I thought this story was an incredible allegory of wanting more and striving for better.

He is sent to the dungeon for not acting like a mouse. He comes out, goes back in to save the princess, and comes out again with the princess.The characters in this book are Despereaux, the confident mouse; Miggery Sow, the slow-witted servant girl; Chiaroscuro, the mischievous rat; and Pea, the sorrowful princess.My favorite parts of the book were Chiaroscuro's mischievous adventures, like when he frightens the queen and accidentally kills her, and when he lures Miggery to lock the Princess Pea in the dungeon and is threatened to be killed by Despereaux.

A little red thread around the throat of a condemned mouse--ooooh!!!!! How sophomoric. The fact that it's won awards is a case of the Emperor's New Clothes.Dear reader, lest the reference is not clear, in the Emperor's New Clothes, the crowd applauds and compliments the emperor for his fine clothes. The crowd does this because they believe they're looking at something very grand, which only grand people can see, and that if they don't acknowledge its greatness, they will be revealed for the dolts they are.

And these are not tiny details; the brokenness of all the relationships is dwelt on, almost with schadenfreude.Second, the happy ending depends too much upon random chance: a jailer eager for a story, the lingering smell of soup. Rather than overcome evil, the good characters have incredible, unlikely luck.I feel this is too violent and upsetting for a child. The overall message:* You are alone in the world.* Everyone is against you.* Everything might turn out alright by random chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was not enthused about this book- I found it's story line rather bare, the characters were never fleshed out and the story itself too disjointed and pointless.

I cannot figure out how this book won an award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the mouse, not the story","review":"Despereaux is an endearing character and the story starts out excitedly with his adventures. It goes downhill from there. There is little to endear all the other characters (besides Despereaux) in the book to anyone. They're all terribly stupid, cruel, lemmings, or simple. And there is no sympathy for anybody. I was not at all enchanted with the plotline, nor how their stories came together.I really wanted to love this book, I savored reading it and put it off for years looking forward to it. But after reading it, I was unfortunately disappointed in the tale. I would have to alternatively recommend highly, as another reader did, the REDWALL series, and POPPY. And STUART LITTLE or CHARLOTTE'S WEB."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST read","review":"This book was amazing. It is destined to become a family classic.

It is an easy read for younger children and yet compelling enough to appeal to older ones.Enough wonderful things can not be said about this book and this author's gift for sharing such a special adventure.

Reader, I had just finished reading Because of Winn-Dixie, and I found it to be a wonderful book and story. But, reader, Tale of Despereaux did not come anywhere close to what I expected a good, or worthy of reading children's book, should be. I also, reader, feel that anyone who has to tell a child what is going on without letting them think for themselves or create their own meanings should not bebale to get their books published. I have always felt the point of getting children to read is to, get them to read! Then the stories and meanings can be discussed later. Children always bring something new the table, and this book ruins a childs creative and imaginative mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Awful Book!","review":"I HATE this book! It has a terrible story line that doesn't make any sense. It is a crazy book. And parts of it are very, very strange. When I first heard about it I thought that Despereaux falls in love with Princess Pea(what kind of name is THAT?) and some fairy or magic turns him into a prince or something like that. Instead we get a strange and confusing story. I give Kate one thing though, she certainly has a big imagination. I wouldn't buy this book, EVER!, so make sure you get it from the library if you still want to read it. But believe me, I'm a reader, BIG time, and this is definitely a book you don't want to read.

When I add enough water for a shake, it works fine. The container has to be wide enough to accommodate the way the blades flare out when it spins.

Arabella and John share a weird affair in the upstairs art studio while his pregnant wife is on bed rest. A so-so movie with strange things going on. Leon is a strong enough actor to pull off such a so-so movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT CONCEPT--A BLACK THRILLER/LOVE STORY","review":"I LIKED THE CONCEPT OF THIS FILM.

Nothing scary really happened. It wasn't even a bit violent. This movie belongs in the thriller section only, because it's not a horror movie whatsoever.I kind of liked the acting. The beginning of the film is the kind of beginning that is put into a good horror movie. However this beginning tricks you.

The drawings are not primitive, they are juvenile. I CAN'T draw but I can do better than what is shown in this book. It looks as if it was drawn by a seven year old! The shapes are poorly defined and not detailed, very basic doodles. This is primitive drawing at it's worst. Save your money for something worthwhile and skip this publication!

The book is so cute, and the CD music is really nice. They are traditional songs, but are not annoying and chirpy like a lot of chidren's CDs. My husband doesn't even mind listening to it. I like the Spanish, Japanese, and French traditional songs on there, too. There is one song that escalates with neat dance music until Lisa and crew say \\"stop\\" and there's silence, then the music starts over, etc. It's so fun for my daughter and me to dance to that, and she has learned the meaning of \\"stop\\" (she's a year old).

The silicon skin works quite well with access to all the physical buttons of the iPhone. And the iPhone definitely feels protected from (short) falls. However, the belt clip when it's on the belt digs into your side. In a way, I suppose it's reassuring to know that the phone is there, but on the other hand, I don't need a literal thorn in my side to remind me. Other than the physical pain of wearing the belt clip, the case and the clip integrate quite nicely.If you're looking for nice pain-free belt clip, I recommend the DLO Black lambskin Exposed leather Holster for the iPhone.

It may have been a good product at the time we bought it but it seems outdated today. In terms of reliability, one of the satellite cordless sets died about a year ago and the '3' button on another started having trouble a year before then. Overall, we're not impressed with the set and will be replacing it and switching to another brand (likely Panasonic) soon. Among the problems or annoyances with it, besides the two mentioned above, have been a difficulty to share the stored phone numbers among the sets, the lack of the LCD backlighting on the cordless units, and the lack of a clock on the cordless sets. We also had trouble transferring calls between handsets (though it's possible, it's not easy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"Nice to use for living room. It's quiet.

The End.","review":"This thing is 93 minutes of nothing more than Al getting high and his behavior while high. It's not about Ministry as a band at all. It's more sad than entertaining. This thing should have been a 10 minute bonus footage track on some Ministry Live DVD. 90minutes of Al Jourgensen high is boring.The interviews with Ogre, David Yow, Maynard and others is interesting but there is very little of this in it.Don't waste your time or money on this. Instead go buy/watch the LEMMY documentary. It IS worth watching.Lemmy: 49% Motherf**ker, 51% Son of a Bitch [Blu-ray]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vaguely amusing","review":"The best part of this movie is Jello Biafra reminding everyone that The Eagles behaved about as well as Al and no one ever batted an eye. The second best part is Buzz Osbourne's dog. What remains is just a lot of stereotypical rockstar antics--screaming, throwing furniture, banging groupies and drugs. It is, of course, edited in such a way as to make it appear that heroin was being injected on a nigh continuous basis, but if you pay attention it's really just two or three episodes chopped up and spread out over the course of the film.It's not difficult to see why Barker left, nor is it difficult to see what exactly Al's contributions were. It is, however, difficult to pay attention to, so unless you just want to see how jowly Trent Reznor is looking these days, you should probably keep your money.

The footage and interviews are just plain & boring. With all the crazy hype that's been circulating over the past two years about this long awaited release, it's a HUGE let down.

Good work Paul! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge the play by this film version","review":"There is a stage revival of this play recently presented in New York and I was curious to see this film version. I found it very dull. Walter Matthau acted very well but I thought him miscast (appearing too old, to me, for the part of the angry war vet). Felicia Farr (Jack Lemmon's wife) was excellent, though certainly there was no chemistry between her and Matthau. I don't know what happened to actor Robert Lipton; he does a good job here as the frustrated idealist. As a bit of theatrical history (many consider this to be Odets's best play), you could do worse, but the play deserves a better film version."},{"rating":"1","title":"NPS means NO POWER SYSTEM!!!","review":"I ordered this and had it direct-shipped it as a gift to my grandchildren in another state.

I first though it may be a defect with one of the two in the package, so I switched to the other one in the set of two.

She is featured only in the background in most of Adam Again's songs but she adds that special something to the bands songs. She has recorded several solo albums but this one is my favorite. It is on the Broken record label who launched many great Christian alternative projects by groups like Undercover and 411 in the 1980's. It has been described as alternative pop but features some beautiful ballads as well. The track Bride's Song 1984 has become a wedding favorite. Most of the songs are upbeat and funky as well as comtemplative and thoughtful. The influence of Adam Again's late Gene Eugene is all over this project. I would recomend it to all Adam Again fans as well as fans of groups like Daniel Amos and the Choir.Some highlites include the tracks Ghost in the Wind,For the Blue,and A Little Grace; as well as the title track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats Galore!","review":"Being an avid cat-lover myself (I am \\"owned\\" by 3 cats), I'm sure I'm biased.

As my subject alludes, this is the dumbest rubbish I have ever heard. In the opening chapter a cat sees another cat for about 5-seconds. That's it. There was no starvation, no gnawing, clawing, biting (not that that was expected, but the point is that it was not this life-threatening situation for the cat). A cat saw another cat for 5-seconds and the author spends the entire chapter talking about how the cat will recuperate after the \\"traumatic experience\\". It's like writing a chapter about healing, tending to the wound, and doing \\"talk therapy\\" over a papercut. I am dumbfounded and simultaneously sickened at how some (so many) people found this book not just mediocre, but 4-5 stars. THAT is a scary indicator of the stupidity of the status quo. I am looking into return policies for kindle content for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some amusing stories, but did she exaggerate them?","review":"The author presents some stories about how she successfully solved problems related to cat behavior.

This is an excellent story, certainly with a different plot, that is about friendship, love, and forgiveness. The hero......jack/will/wesley is a hunk by any name. His emotions bare his soul to us. Olivia is a \\"spinster\\" with an enormous amount of love to offer once she opens herself up to those possibilities. I wish ms miller would have made olivia a bit less spinsterish and perhaps not referred to her so often as being a prickly spinster.You could see the evolution happening but unfortunately the book ended too quickly.

Elizabeth, Mary and Sophia, each gifted in their own right, dealt with poverty, sickness, and internal rivalries as they each strove for their place in intellectual society. They interacted with Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott, particularly Elizabeth and Mary and two of the sisters married, one to Horace Mann and one to Nathaniel Hawthorne. It is amazing to read on how gifted these women were at a young age and how strong in character. Not only are the sisters lives detailed, but the general state of life in that era, from medicine, to education, and quality of life are meticulously detailed. This is a must for those who want to understand this period from a feminist or literary point of view on how key these women that you may have never heard of were to the times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"Megan Marshall has done superb work in this carefully researched account of the amazing Peabody sisters, for whom, even over one-and-a-half centuries, I feel great affection and admiration. Other reviewers have already done a good job of summarizing the contents of \\"The Peabody Sisters.\\" Synopsizing someone else's wonderfully written material is not my forte. I have, however, read a great deal about the Elizabeth, Mary and Sophia, both from historical documents and by assorted biographers and historians. Ms. Marshall's book is the most accurate and readable account of the three sisters I have read. These women continue to inspire me. Thank you for this excellent book, Megan Marshall."},{"rating":"1","title":"all over the place","review":"The author attempts to run the three biographies in parallel but what really happens is that she jumps from one place to the other, so none of the biographies unfold properly. I found it utterly unreadable. On top of it to add to my frustration, there are generalities, like Elizabeth fought with her mother \\"like all adolescent girls do\\" or romantic creations \\"like on this day if you didn't watch out a dog might have showered you with water\\". I wanted to read a proper biography and not a society novel. I had read \\"Eden's Outcasts\\" by John Matteson before and came away with a more lively picture of Elizabeth Peabody and her involvment in the Temple School then from this book. If you are interested in the transcendentalist movement, the time, or women I highly recommend \\"Eden's Outcasts: The story of Louisa May Alcott and her father\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well researched and long overdue","review":"At the center of the American Renaissance stand several families whose impact has been often studied and written about. One family of women has been clearly neglected and their impact downgraded, the Peabody Sisters. Megan Marshall has written a very well researched and long overdue work of depth that flows along lightly. Highly readable, this work articulates the contributres of Elizabeth, Mary and Sophia (wife of Nathaniel Hawthorne) in prose that reads more like a novel than like a multi-subject biography. For those interested in the American Renaissance, American Romanticism, Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, early feminism, and literary excellence this book is a necessary presence on your bookshelf. Do yourself a favor and read this book. I highly recommend it for scholars and layman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finish this very fine book","review":"Just finished this unfinished tripartite biography. The writing is good, really good, but this is only Volume 1. Where is the promise of Vols 3 and 4?I did really enjoy this story of 3 enlightened sisters, enlightened mother -- and the details of post-Revolutionary Boston. What I missed were the details of 'ever-day' life for a woman, married, unmarried, finally married -- what it was like on a physical/human scale (toilet facilites, dealing with feminine hygiene, sex, lack of sex, so-on).If one reads a recent biography of Jane Austen, the 'stuff' of her life is all there -- though so much less is known of Austen. So, why not include the facts of daily life for the Peabody women whose thoughts and courage were noble beyond belief.Well, I shouldn't complain. I enjoyed this book so much and wish that it will have a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Megan Marshall do any more research?","review":"Peabody Sisters is excellent. There are so many people connected to these three woman that the reader is vicariously hearing inside information about historical figures, as well as the Peabody sisters---women most of us probably did not know. While you learn the historical significance/involvement of these women, you also learn of their daily lives and personal frustrations and joys. Megan Marshall has some 150 pages of notes and I think she must've examined every diary, note, letter, and biography of every individual involved in the sisters' lives. But, this is NOT a boring biography...Marshall speaks in a readable voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"gaelforce a nice suprise","review":"expecting the excitememnt of an Irish dance show, and well recieving it. the story was easy enough to follow, but it still had some loopholes that were not explained. the lighting made it difficult at times to see what was going on, but when the lighting was bad, the camera focuses on the highlight of the moment in the shot. overall, gaelforce is a well done show worth keeping and watching over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not fully professional","review":"I don't like montage of this show.

That said, it is easy to build one of the examples and you can invent your own as well as there are plenty of pieces. More slopes would be good though as there are only 4.

Here are direct quotes from the book and I'll let you decide for yourself.\\"...mild slaps on the bottom or the hand can begin between fifteen and eighteen months of age.\\"\\"If it doesn't hurt, it doesn't motivate a child to avoid the consequences next time. A slap with the hand on the diapered bottom of a two-year-old is not a deterrent to anything.\\"\\"I would suggest that the youngster be placed in bed and given a little speech... Then when his feet touch the floor, give him one swat on the legs or backside with a small paddle or belt. Put the paddle on the dresser where the child can see it, and promise him one more stroke if he gets up again.\\"Instead of this book, I highly recommend The Discipline Book by Dr. William Sears."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful","review":"I found this series to be APPALLING.

Other types of harsh corporal punishment were also condoned.I am a clinician. I also have a strong-willed child. I have read (or listened to audio) of dozens and dozens of parenting books.

This book has come directly out of a victorian, punitive, rule-your-child-with-an-iron-fist kind of mentality that does nothing positive for your child. Dr Dobson advocates corporal punishment from a very young age, and obviously shows his complete ignorance of child development by advocating such things. He also has no understanding of the harm that is done to the parent-child relationship through the use of such techniques(and all future relationships for the child, including the relationship with oneself); not to mention the perpetuation of violence through the generations, a pattern we need to stop.If you want parentign books with heart, I would recommend Jan Hunts \\"The Natural Child\\" or Jean Liedloffs \\"The Continuum Concept\\" as a good place to start to really find out who we need to be as parents to raise well adjusted, emotionally healthy adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wisdom on Parenting","review":"The Strong-Willed Child is an excellent resource for parents who desire to rear positive, enjoyable children. Dr. Dobson offers practical advice and suggestions that are easy to follow. He backs his information with medical evidence and studies. Whether you are a Christian or not, Dr. Dobson presents the joy of parenting when parents are balanced between firm discipline and unconditional love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone who admits to beating a 12 lb. dog with a belt . . .","review":"I can't believe it. In the very first chapter Dobson describes how he beat his 12 lb. dachshund with a belt. And this man thinks he is an expert on behavior? Clearly he's a sadist, not a psychologist. I've had dachshunds (and strong willed children), and I'm appalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much more respectful and effective resources out there","review":"I am a child psychologist with expertise in how to effectively discipline children so that they can learn to be respectful, cooperative, and caring individuals. About ten years ago, I posted a review of this book, recommending that parents use other, more effective parenting approaches. I was contacted by Dr. Dobson's wife via email and she informed me that I was not a Christian because I had posted a critical review. This told me that I'd done the right thing, trying to steer parents toward a different, more respectful resource.For parents in search of a Christian parenting resource, I would suggest 1-2-3 Magic for Christian Parents.Parenting is no joke. It's really difficult and I wish all of you the best in finding the guidance that you and your children need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you evaluate your parenting style","review":"I had sought out this book because of my 4 year old son and the frustration he has been causing lately. I was worried that this book would be hard to read since I am more of a nonfiction person who can't stand to read self-help books but I was very pleasantly surprised. Dr Dobson gives several stories and real life applications that make this an easy read. While there haven't been any ground-breaking things that I have found in this book it has definitely helped me evaluate how I've been interacting with him as a parent and make some positive changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Willful? Or being a child?","review":"I was given this book by a helpful relative. Please read with a grain of salt - some of the ideas, like hitting a child with a small belt or paddle if they do not stay in bed, and then telling them you love them, are really off the wall. Bedtime is one of the most precious times in the world, and the idea that you would hit a child with anything as you send them off the sleep has to be wrong. We have had to deal with this on occassion and find the \\"Nanny way\\" works best, little talk, be firm and put them back in bed.would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want an antagonistic relationship, then this book is for you.","review":"I picked up this book along with several others in order to work with my difficult son, and I was blown away at the perspective that Dobson takes on difficult children.He takes the view that when children misbehave it is a deliberate effort to make life difficult for the parents. I can't imagine any real Christian parent sincerely subscribing to the maxim of \\"beating the devil\\" out of your children, but this is the closest thing I have come across to this view.If you want to love and respect your child, I would recommend Stanley Turecki's The Difficult Child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Right Wing","review":"I am a strong Christian.

Dobson's message of bring-the-fear-of-God to your children is extremely disturbing to me. If you believe that instilling fear is the best means to break a strong willed child, then push that \\"put it in my cart\\" button for this book. If you believe a relationship between a parent and a child should be based on a respectful, sometimes tough teaching paradigm which ultmiately ensures a child can make their own good choices, check out the \\"Love and Logic\\" series. I have nothing to gain financially from making this recommendation. It could keep me awake at night, thinking of people accepting Dobson's pious, totalitarian philosophy as any kind of answer to the challenges of child raising. I wrote this review so I could get back to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing \\"New\\": just recycled and out of date advice","review":"Dobson doesn't really have anything \\"New\\" in this book except the title, an attempt to sell more books, as if this was an update from his previous ones, and it is not. He ignores decades of research findings about the best ways to raise healthy and successful children, and instead reverts to his standard method -- \\"pick up a belt or a board and hit them, and don't allow them to cry longer than a few minutes, or hit them more until they stop crying about it.\\" Parents who are seduced by his folksy style into following his advice are likely to injure their children and invite child protective agencies into their lives. Dobson is the dinosauer of child rearing -- he needs to become extinct. This book is harmful, creating the opposite effect of what parents really want for their children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a support group for the children survivors of this book?","review":"I suppose that should some up the review.But truly, I grew up under the sick-minded, mercy & forgiveness free parenting teachings of Dobson. My mom loved the strong willed child. It destroyed our family.I was hoping there is some sort of support group out there for people how suffered through his sick teachings. I know there is a lot of support against similar teachings from \\"To Train Up A Child\\" authors (the Pearls). IF anyone knows, I'd love to get hooked up. I think it might be a path to finish healing.Honest to goodness, I've forgiven my parents (though I have disowned them), but I can't seem to forgive Dobson who empowered them & gave them ideas about calling me evil-intentioned when I was not.

I have a young strong willed child(2) and in the book he compares disciplining her to beating his twelve pound dog with a belt. Some other reviewers say I just have a calm child, not at all, possibly not such a cold heart. I can't even fathom purposefully inflicting pain on my child for inconveniencing me by getting out of bed or doing what she wants. She has started to form free will and a mind of her own so she needs to be taught not beat like a cowering dachshund or pinching her shoulder if she tells me no.

He states on pages 125-130 that the research which supports banning corporal punishment is opinionated but fails to mention that dozens of professional organizations in this country including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychological Association and the American Medical Association have condemned hitting children. These organizations have looked at the 50 years of research data which show that hitting children is both physically and psychologically dangerous to them and creates more social problems than it tries to prevent.In particular, spousal abuse is a societal problem that begins in childhood.

The book views parent child relationship as a constant struggle for power and control and advocates disrespect, violence and unkindness toward children.

Another wonderful book is \\"How Would Jesus Raise a Child.\\" Can anyone really imagine Jesus using corporal punishment on children? We are to model ourselves after him (as I'm sure Dobson would agree), so shouldn't we also model our parenting practices after him? Please read one of the other books recommended above instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous and Ignorant Advice","review":"I found James Dobson to be both ignorant and dangerous. He clearly has not kept up with the research done since receiving his Psychology degree in the early 1960's. He advocates violence and corporal punishment, and has an overall negative assumption toward the motivations and intentions of children.If you want a guide to misconstruing your children's attempts to learn and crushing their spirits, get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!!","review":"Praise God!!!! Getting me through some rough times with the kiddos!!!!!!! Dr. Dobson is right on!!!!!!Don't hesitate to order if you're considering adoption, or just wondering what its going to take to raise your strong_willed little one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"spanking? are you stuck in the 50s?","review":"hard to believe in this day and age that anyone would advocate spanking as a valid form of discipline. smacking your kid around doesn't strike me as very christain either. this book is going in the trash because I don't want an unsuspecting parent to pick it up at goodwill and then implement this sadist's suggestions. there are many and much healthier ways to deal with a wild child. i was one and now I have one so I've been on both sides of the argument."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed the book","review":"The book was very helpful.I was able to use it with my daughter and I used many of the charts and graphs that were in the book.Anyone that has a child with ADHD I would advise them to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Very Helpful!","review":"This book was recommended by a friend and I found it very helpful using with my daughter and even applicable in my classroom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful Practices!","review":"The lowest I could give this book was one star, but of course it doesn't deserve any star.What kind of people write this type of book, and what kind of people actually believe it???Whipping innocent babies with switches and paddles? Get real. This is America, not some third world nation, and even there, who whips their babies???I'm appalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Parents Who Can't Understand the Difference Between Discipline and Punishment","review":"Beating your kids is not a good thing. There are some who think it's an occasional sad necessity with some subgroup of \\"problem kids\\". What I find off-putting is the tone of almost gleeful relish Dobson seems to use when he writes about physical violence against children. His words read like those of a sadist hiding behind cheap rationalizations. In any case, there are many other strategies that have been shown to be much more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does strong willed= bad????","review":"If you want your child to grow up self-assured and secure knowing right from wrong and making moral decisions based on your parenting, RUN AWAY from this book. This is a manual for lazy parents who are only concerned with having compliant kids, not kids who actually learn to think for themselves. We all know that research shows spanking our kids leads to increased depression, poor self-esteem and adult relationship issues. When faced with a moral dilemma, I want my kids to base their decisions on what is right from wrong, not a fear of being hit! Mr. Dobson has a lot of parents fooled, please do not be one of them! Have the patience and courage to teach with consequences that are non-violent. You will never regret it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received the book","review":"I ordered this book exactly one month ago yesterday and have never received it. I've emailed the store twice with no response. Guess I just threw my money out the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is NOT what you need!","review":"I actually rate this book NO STARS, but the form requires a minimum of 1. I was appalled at some of his ideas! What ever happened to rearing children with LOVE and gentle guidence? My book went right in the circular file! There are much much much better books out there. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I was astonished after so many people recommened this book how utterly off the mark it was with current parenting preactices. The sheer thought that one should physically harm their child in order to show them whos boss is beyond what my mind can wrap itself around.This was a waste of money and the time I spent reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks","review":"I purchased this book after it was recommended to me to help deal with my spirited preschooler. The person mentioned that spanking was advocated in the book, which gave me pause, but parents in my situation know that you are willing to hear out anything that might help. But after paging through the book I did some research on the author and was horrified to discover who this man is and what he stands for. In a nutshell, this man was a prominant Evangelical Christian who in addition to corporal punishment advocates that: women should know their place, thinks gay relationships are destroying society, non-traditional sexual roles are abominations, and on and on. I have a live and let live viewpoint on religion in general but I refuse to financially support anyone whose views are so at odds with mine. So this guy may be the child whisperer but I'm not going to find out because I'm returning the book and going with MacKenzie's work on the same topic."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],N={key:0},H={key:1};function x(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-21697a4b"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/29.md","filePath":"people/29.md"}'),L={name:"people/29.md"},P=Object.assign(L,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{R as __pageData,P as default};
