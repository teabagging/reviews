The top temp on the unit is 86 degrees so perhaps the units would have stopped heating at that point, I didn't wait to find out. Maybe the fan would have also shut off then too.Had this been in only one unit I would have considered it an unfortunate occurance, but for both units to have the same defect suggests a basic flaw in their design.These units are potentially dangerous and I would definately not recommended them to anyone.

It's about boys and men wanting, no needing, to get a few things off their chest, and if that means kicking in a few heads well then so be it. They run the streets like gangs, setting matches where they freely beat each other mercilessly but when Tommy (Dyer) makes enemies with a rival team he ends up starting a war, and in the midst of that war he begins to wonder if this life he leads, living from one fight to one screw to one drink, is really worth the pain.

To save your back, there is a zipper on the back, so you can empty the bag without dumping it upside down. It also holds an immense amount of laundry. Our baskets are always overflowing (I have a messy one-year-old), and it handles everything I give it from Monday until laundry-day Sunday. Finally, it feels sturdy and not cheap!

However, the rambling, often fragmented arguments that White offers in this book don't effectively support the premise. Reading through the text was much like having a conversation with someone in the midst of the manic phase of a manic/depressive cycle. This topic is deep and complex: It deserves a thoughtfully considered analysis, not simply piles of obscure references, tangential rants and belabored (!!) criticisms.Worst of all, White asserts that those who don't agree with or understand his rambling fragments are proving his argument and therefore (surprise!) are clearly Middle Mind-ed.

Yet once begun it is little more than a rambling 200-page editorial written in first person, with no cohesive thesis or logic, going to great pains to skewer the demographic which is not only its target, but its target market.

I was expecting to have trim knobs in a near neutral position but when it was never enough, there was no controlling it. $200 dollars is a lot of money to me and I expected value for my money of which I received none. I have been looking at other hellos and people are recommending the Blade 400 ($475) but based on the quality of its smaller cousin, I will not buy it.

As an experienced RC heli owner, I know how to work on these and I have spent close to 3 weeks trying to get it to fly decently.

Instead of brief, circumspect glimpses of Parcells and Belichek - important contacts for Weis in his current job - we'll get insight into the men and their organizations. Instead of bland coaching generalizations, we'll get real analysis.But here and now, Weis plays it close to the vest. He's disinclined to talk about himself, except when discussing family life and his disabled daughter Hannah. The Weis coaching philosophy is guarded like a state secret.His direct style makes No Excuses read like an extended magazine interview, engaging enough to hold a reader but short on depth, detail, and anecdote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read, not too deep.","review":"This was a good read with a solid look at Coach Weiss' rise to his current position. As a coach myself I was able to pull some good stuff from it as well as read some good coaching stories. It is not overly deep but I enjoyed reading it. I would have liked to see him go into some of his coaching stuff a bit more, but the book was not written for that type of stuff. Coach Weiss does give some good insights into some of his philosophies and how they developed. Some of the Bill Parcells stories are great.A good read.

H.H. Sai Maa offers profound spiritual truths and also, perhaps more importantly, practical advice for living those truths in your daily life (e.g., in your relationships).Reading even a few pages a day and applying even a fraction of what you read to your life can completely transform your concept of yourself, your relationships and how you live your life from moment-to-moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the book for self mastery","review":"Simple and straight forward is the mastery woven into this book.

Then it talks about the fund for the memorial and how it was built.Included are many pictures. The writing, I feel is incredible.

It's been over a year since I took French IV and this album is one of the reasons why I have retained much of my French. DePalmas' style is adult contemporary with an occasional dash of country. He is quite popular in France (Marcher dans le sable was one of FNAC's \\"meilleurs ventes\\" for over a year) and won a French \\"grammy\\" for \\"J'en reve encore.\\" \\"Si Tu Veux\\" is the easiest song to understand because of it's parallel structure, but I like most of the songs on this album (even if I don't understand every word) because they are so aesthetically pleasing! If you like soft rock (and Uncle Kracker type stuff) and are taking French, get your hands on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denverite living in Paris ... love this album","review":"I first heard this album in December 01 at a bar in Rouen. I asked the bartender for the name and went out and bought it. It's a great, mostly upbeat album with - believe it or not - a neat pedal steel sound on some of the tracks. Pedal steel is one of the reasons I like old Steely Dan and it works very well on this CD. Don't worry about the French - mine is awful - you'll love it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phil is Great, this video isn't.","review":"I have this video and it is a big disappointment. The leader of the band gets lost twice. It would be laughable, but one of the greatest sax players ever is standing there.

Audio quality is not very good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars for the horrible Joe Suddler","review":"When I hear musicians this incapable, I wonder why they would bother. I have to wonder if they have considered suicide at any point of their apparently musically meaningless lives. Joe Sudler is a sad excuse for a musician, and the list of no-name musicians in his band should be executed for being such an odious melange of arrogance and sheer stupidity. These \\"musicians\\" should be beaten to death with their own instruments. It is a disgrace that a musician like Phil Woods would have to live with pictures and audio recordings of this horrible date.

My case is largely blue, but I wanted to highlight a vent panel with a red glow. This light was fantastic! It looks quite ominous...You don't have to worry to much with these lights. They include nice long cords with a pass through 4 pin molex. They even include velco strips for easy placement!The only downside for some might be the bright chrome case for the puck. It looks awesome and reeks of quality, but hey, chrome is not for everyone.They are configured with two outside large LED's at 45 degrees, and the two inside that at 22 degrees, and the center light, well in the center. This gives that awesome fan pattern when you put it on a flat surface, but they have enough light to light up the whole case, given the proper angle.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating revelation on how medicine is developed.","review":"(if this is the book by Robert Steele) This book was most enlightening. I am not a student of medicine or psychology but I have to say that I found this book most enlightening. I had no idea how psychology was founded as a science(I'm sorry I really think it is a pseudoscience) and I did not know that it was based mostly on lies perpetrated to aggrandize a career or ego. Shame, shame. No wonder the Doctors who hold so tightly to their much paid for licenses and degrees get upset to discuss in detail their knowlegdge. The common layman knows better. That's what they are afraid of. Does anybody out there actually practice according to the Hippocratic oath. Steele does a great job presenting it the way it was. If you like to know the absolute unbiased truth about academia and its supposed great minds - read this book. It will give you great insight.

Deal is an awesome tune and Sugaree and The Wheel chug along quite nicely as well. Eep Hour is a delightful instrumental that has many new age elements. Ahead of its time, indeed.However, this recording is loaded with filler experimentation. The other three instrumentals...SpiderGawd, Late For Supper, and An Odd Little Place are just mere experimental noises. I really have to wonder what Jerry was thinking when he recorded those tracks? To Lay Me Down is six minutes and sixteen seconds of shear boredom. How often can one stand hearing Jerry moan to Lay Me Down over and over again? That tune actually makes Attics Of My Life sound good.This CD falls way short of expectations. Borrow it from a friend but save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like Garcia beating on guitars w/ a bunch of turnips.","review":"What a waste of time, money and chemical dependency. Garcia is an over-rated musician and songwriter. He's average at best. I've been listening to this recording, and I've come to one sudden realization: Garcia would've been better-suited to the world of being a short-order cook . . . much like Mel on TV's Alice.Once again, he's proven that he's nothing much other than inadequate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LITTLE KNOWN CLASSIC","review":"I bought this when it came out and still put it on occasionally. Many wonderful songs (Wheel,Sugaree,Deal and my favorite,Loser)from Garcia when he was at the height of his considerable powers.Side two is especially nice for late night reveries with an elevated mindstate.I saw the Dead many times in 1972 and remember hearing these songs and the songs from Bob weirs' \\"Ace\\". This is Garcia at his effortlessly soulful best. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This album is such classic Garcia. The Deal is a hot song and has some incredible guitar licks like only Jerry can give. Sugaree is a classic, Lay Me Down is gentle and reflects the subtlety of his music. And the Wheel is one of the most articulate as to what it is to live on the \\"razors edge\\" in life. You won't be sorry to own this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garcia's own American Beauty","review":"This album is the kind of music he could/should have been making all along.

I still get a tears in my eyes and chills up and down my spine when I listen to this beauty. This is one of the few albums that when you put it on you will want to hear the whole album from Deal to The Wheel. This is a must have for any serious Dead Head."},{"rating":"2","title":"wish it were larger","review":"This is a cute, fun, little book (check the dimensions before ordering so that you aren't disappointed).

So I bought it along with this shampoo , and another product by Mg 217. My mother has used them for one moth, but there has been not even a tiny effect. In fact, the symptom has even turned worse, especially when she used the Tar Shampoo.

One of my favorite parts was the quote on page 12 from William Styron: \\"Brainstorm,\\" ...has unfortunately been preempted to describe, somewhat jocularly, intellectual inspiration...Told that someone's mood disorder has evolved into a storm --a veritable howling tempest in the brain, which is indeed what a clinical depression resembles like nothing else-- even the uninformed layman might display sympathy rather than the standard reaction that \\"depression\\" evokes, something akin to \\"So what?\\" or \\"You'll pull out of it\\" or \\"We all have bad days.\\" It just doesn't get more honest than that. It's a storm all the time, sometimes it hails or upgrades to a tornado, but it's always a storm. Thank you for writing this book. I could finally explain depression to my family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This Book!","review":"Whether you are, aren't sure, or convinced you are not, this is a worthwhile book to read. Everyone knows someone who is depressed, and this book is so helpful for understanding what depression feels like from people in all age ranges. There are stories from people who have suffered from depression most of their lives to people who found solutions early on. I was lucky to happen upon this book in my therapist's office (she practically has a library there) and took it home to read because I am being treated for depression and also have a young son who is depressed.

The music and images of the waterfalls, that I use with my Kindle Fire, are so relaxing and beautiful. I can't travel very much, so this video helps me feel like I've gone to an exotic relaxing place. It helps calm my nerves, and if I put it on at night time I usually fall right to sleep. It is just what I needed to calm my nerves and take me away to a far off beautiful land.

Just like a dear old friend, they bring back all of the good times and none of the bad! Just like fine wine, these songs have aged gracefully. Ok, I'll stop with the similies right here! >:-)Seriously, Ratt is a great hard-rock band that has great hooks, crunchy guitar, and great longevity.

If you are already a Ratt fan, then you probably have all of their older discs (or tapes, in my case). So then this is good for the new song, \\"Nobody Rides For Free\\".

It starts off with classic early 1980's Ratt like Round and Round, Wanted Man, Back for More, Lay It Down, You're In Love, and You Think You're Tough. As the CD progresses, you are carried through the late eighties right into 1991 with songs from The Detonator, like Lovin' You's A Dirty Job and Shame Shame Shame. This CD is a wonderful tribute to one of the MOST metal bands of the 1980's as well as being, I believe, a wonderful remembrance to the all-to-short-but thoroughly-lived-life of Robbin Crosby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things get dangerous for Jessica and Nick","review":"Clay di Palma has murder in mind,and he wants to murder Nick Fox,but Jessica has made a terrible mistake in meeting Clay Di Palma. she knows what Clay is capable of,and wants to keep Clay away from her boyfriend.

He has become a little rusty on his New Testament Greek also. I thought this book would be excellent for keeping up with the Biblical languages a little at a time. Each day there is a verse or two in Hebrew from the Old Testament, and also a verse or two in Greek from the New Testament. There are some notes on the Hebrew, although they are primarily in German. My husband really just wants to study the languages using the tools he has learned, and didn't want the notes from another scholar. There are two volumes of this book, but I bought this first volume based on the review of another Amazon customer. So far we are happy.

It is wonderfully written and very hard to put down. The author's style of story telling is very engaging and flowing. I enjoyed the novel especially because it is the first time I read a high-quality English novel WITH a desi (Indo/Pak) theme [probably reflects on my limited exposure to the subcontinent's English writers]. Since I am from the same background, I especially enjoyed the local Urdu/Punjabi phrases/terms interspered throughout the book. It could be a bit distracting for the non-desi readers to encounter so many foreign terms [some of them not fully explained]. I almost suspect that the author was primarily writing for desi readers. I also enjoyed verses and translations quoted from famous Indian/Pakistani poets. The novel effectively touches upon a great human tragedy without being judgemental. Great reading, all around! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply a story coming from an illiterate Bapsi Sidhwa.","review":"The book is nothing but a waste of time and if anything else a way to let out Muslim hate toward any other religion.

At the time we didn't put 2 and 2 together. My youngest sons itch was so bad I took him to the doctor and she said it looked like ringworm and told me to get foot fungus cream. I did mention to her that I thought it might be the wipes but, she didn't think it was the cause. Well, after using the fungal cream for two weeks (the doctor said it could take up to a month for the ringworm to go away) the itching got worse and the rash spread. I took him back to the doctor and she took a culture swab and we found out he has a staph infection caused by the itching! So no more wipes and nobody itches anymore. It could just be that my boys were sensitive to the ingredients in the wipes but, I did notify Kleenex about what happened with us and am waiting to hear back from them. If your child is prone to skin allergies I would HIGHLY recommend NOT using these wipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Rough..","review":"Wow.. these Cottonelle Fresh Folded Moist Wipes Tub 42, are about the size of a Kleenex, and they're pretty rough on your backside.

I'm not really familiar with The Church, so Church fans please don't be upset with me. I only gave this two stars because I gave Spartan Fidelity's Excava 11 one star and this is a little better than that CD. The thing I didn't really like about this CD was the lack of structure. I prefer songs to have a verse, chourus, bridge, and so on. This was very free form. Also, I can't hum any of the songs for anyone. That's because there weren't any distinctive riffs or hooks that make any of the songs memorable, much like Spartan Fidelity. It also seemed a little over produced, lots of technology. All the drums seemed electronic, for all I know they were. I wasn't thrilled, but then again I'm not a Church fan, as a Remy Zero fan I was dissappointed. Such is life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annotated bibliography","review":"Despite its title, this book does not really provide a thorough examination of the moral treatment of returning warriors in the early medieval period.

Being a Greatful Dead fan, I find that H.Y.H. was organized extremely well, incorporating love, fear, hope, and anticipation. Not only did the album do well, but the cover's design and complementing colors draw attention and interest. Hundred Year Hall reminds Greatful Dead fans of the beauty that was behind the band, if need be. Although tragic stories and terrible outcomes were to fall upon the Dead community, this album reminds us all to think positively of our loss. This band was so remarkable in it's influence, Dead Heads are still wandering around listening to the Dead's musical spirit through other people's songs. This is the beauty behind The Greatful Dead; they simply wanted to expand music and its meaning.

At this point, at least, Amazon has 30 second sound samples available for the tracks on this cd. Give a listen and you'll understand why I chose \\"horrible modern remixes all sound the same\\" for my review title.

However, while the author shows charts and diagrams that explain food combining, the recipes and meal plans she provides are far from following food combining guidelines. I was dumbfounded by this inconsistency. While writing that food combining's basic tenant is to avoid mixing protein and carbohydrates, the suggested breakfast is an egg and toast!

There are no handles to pick it up once it is filled with water so it is a two-person job to empty it. You have to lift a corner and let the water drain to the other side where the hose outlet is attached. So far, so good. But then you have to LIFT the corner full of water so it is high enough to drain into a bucket! No thanks. I'm sending it back. Take your shower standing in a big Rubbermaid storage tub instead. The tub is good for storing camping stuff when you're not using it for a bath. It is easy to empty (two handles and corners) and is CHEAP. If you really really REALLY need something that folds, this will work for you, but don't think it folds up SMALL. It does not. It is 54 inches long when folded. Not real handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this piece of junk!","review":"We bought this and were happy with the picture but could barely hear it.

For those of you that does not follow the metric system, half a liter weighs 500g, so the scale is off by 306g, quite the discrepancy. Also, the buttons are placed in such a way that it is impossible to calibrate the scale without applying pressure on the measuring device leaving you with a uncalibrated scale (with the very large error in measuring it does not really matter because you would be better of just weighing the ingredients by hand). Learn from my mistake... do not buy this scale, you will only have to buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of the 90's","review":"This is a weird and wonderful work. The lyrics are generally dark, with a good serving of clever sarcasm, observation, and humour, but not all tracks are so heavy. The deep vocals are truly great, and simply give the album a different and fresh sound. The musical style is rock, but it will appeal to lovers of pop, folk rock, and alternative. Although only two or three tracks made the radio playlists, the rest of the album is just as worthwhile and carefully written, executed, and produced. This is a most recommended buy - go and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash Test Dummies Sing the Spirituals!","review":"Brad Robert's velvety vocals cast a unique presence on this fine recording. His deep reverberant bass coupled with Ellen Reid's juxtaposed harmonies makes mesmerised listening.I especially love the lyrics. This is where the CTD's really stand out.

There are deep instramentals imbedded within each song along with beautiful vocals. I enjoy how songs on this album are organized to flow easily into the next, allowing for an hour or so of a pleasurable journey into the intelligent, yet abstract, world of Brad Roberts. Every song on here is my favorite, but the final track -- a two-minute piano solo -- is a very intimate peek into the soul of Roberts (I am assuming it is he who wrote and played it), making me want to know more."},{"rating":"2","title":"witty lyrics and catchy tunes","review":"Witty, literate lyrics and catchy tunes, sung by a distinctive voice.The Big Questions of God and Religion are a common theme of the lyrics, but they are more subtle than being explicitly for or against.All the songs are nearly as good as the two radio hits, \\"God Shuffled His Feet\\" and \\"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"The only reason I got this CD was for Mmm mmm mmm, which is the only remotely decent song on this album, and even that got old after about the 3rd time I heard it.

When people speak you do not hear any language at all, only background music. Then you see a screen with what they said, like in the old silents. Sometimes the writing describes things which you can hear and see happening, such as a door bell ringing. There are no special effects worth watching.

Teenage Politics sucked! But this I like. Not as good as At the Show, The Ever Passing Moment, The Renessance, and Ten Years and Running, but it is still good.

First of all, this the the only CD by them that you can buy at major retail chain stores like Target. I was kind of worried by that. But being a huge fan and having all their other CD's, I got it, and as usual, it rocked. My favorite song is GSF, but the whole CD is good. There are so many tracks and such a variety of songs on there, that everyone I know has found something they like about this CD.MXPX is a great band, and I know tons of people who lable it \\"christian music.\\" Well, this isn't.

The faster include \\"Lifetime Enlightenment\\", \\"Thoughts And Ideas\\", and \\"Small Town Minds\\", while the good slower songs include \\"Let It Happen\\", \\"Rock And Roll Girl\\" and \\"Elvis Is Dead\\". This album pretty much has something for everyone, even including some pretty neat demo versions of other songs like \\"Chick Magnet\\".

There cover songs alone are amazing, such as there cover of Socoial Distortion's sick boy. I've only gotten into social distortion a year ago, which was because of hearing mxpx's cover. But as good as this cd is i only gave it a 4 out of 5 because MxPX defenitly have better cds out, such as Teenage politics, slowly going the way of the buffalo, and 10 years and running.

The sound on this CD is terrific, and it'll rattle your soul if you play it loud on a good stereo. These guys are great musicians who play well together. The deft bodhran work isn't hidden in the background like so many other recordings, so you can feel--not just hear--the energy of The Culchies' music. That's not to diminish the lively strings and the terrific fiddle. You can't go wrong with this CD. It's worked its way into heavy rotation in my collection.

The book is in the format of commonly asked questions followed by concise answers, grouped logically in the manner in which questions typically occur to patients and their families. It is printed in somewhat oversized type- which is frequently helpful given that patients are older and often have difficulties reading standard print.

And, it was. While I found the writing style a little staggering, I was pleased with the short chapters -- which typically get me through most books quite easily. The \\"voice\\" is the essential problem as it's hard to latch on to. The author, interestingly, explains it in an epilogue -- but, I found myself feeling rather miffed with this voice issue from time to time.So, that's the technical stuff.The story is actually a very creative mystery that I think would translate well to a movie. It does a great build-up to the earthquake and fire, and keeps you focused through the tragedy with lots of detail. The fictional characters are vivid and also lend to the story very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Burning Issue","review":"\\"1906\\" is a compelling novel that has overtones on today's political scene.I got into it and it wouldn't let go.

I made an exception to \\"1906\\" and I have not been disappointed in that decision. If you aren't too careful, you start to forget this is a work of fiction. The historical references are extremely accurate and the characters are definitely believable. The story line is well constructed and once again, if a large vehicle rumbles by as you come to the account of the great earthquake, you may find yourself taking cover.I rated this one five out of five for the excellent background stories and portrayal of a city that was on the verge of the big one for many years. \\"1906\\" may well be the \\"Gone With the Wind\\" of the 21st Century. An excellent work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not stop reading!","review":"It's not only a gripping page turner, but it is truly informative. I loved every minute, it's a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"Wow - what a horrible book! The writing is amateurish to say the least. Dangling participles abound; no noun is left unmodified. James Dalessandro could use a writing 101 class, and an editor. Here's a nice example:\\"As I reviewed my handiwork, I tensed at the sounds of footsteps on the hardwood floor above, easing when I recognized Hunter's jaunty stride.\\"If you can take 350 pages of this, more power to you.On top of that, the characters are shallow and 100% Hollywood stereotypes. The San Francisco history isn't bad, but it's incompetently presented. A historical map of the city would be a nice touch since our author is capable of describing places using only street names.To top it all off, Dalessandro uses an awkward mixed perspective plus first person narrative with transitions that read exactly like screenplay scene changes. The afterward acknowledges this as unorthodox, but I think it takes someone with substantially more talent to pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Historical Fiction Ever","review":"Awful. Just awful. Don't waste your money, or more importantly, your time. The flaws in this book are too numerous to list here; just know that nothing works. Not the characters, plot, or narrative. It's atrociously written and so poorly edited that it's nearly unreadable. If you're interested in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, there are other, better books. If you love San Francisco, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"The disaster of \\"1906\\"","review":"1906 was incredibly disappointing. The topic of San Francisco's 1906 earthquake seemed so interesting and full of possibilities that I really looked forward to reading this novel. However, I can't say it was worth picking up. It was written with no thought to character development and with descriptions that were really of lists of mundane details rather than anything designed to create mental images. When I discussed the book with a friend, we agreed that it seemed more like a cheap Hollywood movie (a disaster film with themes of revenge and a romantic subplot) than anything resembling literature. I'm not at all suprised to see another reviewer bring up that the book is being made into a movie. In my opinion, that's why it was written in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"1906 - The year Hell was unleashed on Earth","review":"Dalessandro's '1906' does a superb job of weaving fiction with history. His high level of detail not only transports you back in time, but also reveals the true magnitude of this epic disaster and the unimaginable devastation it caused. I enjoyed reading '1906' immensely and was particularly impressed by his strong, intelligent female protagonist- Annalisa. Another strong point of the novel is the colorful and diverse palette of 'good guys' and 'bad guys' (two of which ultimately box it out in a ruggedly well-written fight scene at the Barbary Coast.) Dalessandro gradually builds the story to a thundering crescendo in the 3rd Act when the earthquake tears the city apart and literally unleashes Hell on Earth (the earthquake is just the beginning of the terrifying chaos that follows...) Most stories have fairly mediocre endings, but not here- Dalessandro ends with a strong finale and all of Part 3 kept me glued to the book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author compares it to \\"Gone With The Wind...\\"","review":"Heavy-handed cliches. Unbelievably shallow characters. Mediocre writing. Narration makes no sense, but in a defensive final chapter the narrator offers an explanation.

I'll have to read something else I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN","review":"A friend gave me 1906 for a gift, and from page one I could not put it down, something that has not happened to me in awhile. I don't know what I loved more, the incredible portrait of old San Francisco, or the description of the earthquake as it rips through California, or the portrayal of Enrico Caruso, one of the funniest and most endearing characters I've ever read. I loved the action, the characters, but most of all the history and the descriptions. This book is a lot more than a disaster novel. After my husband reads it, I'm going to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazingly shallow book...","review":"I can't believe I read the same book as these other reviewers - how could this book be worthy of 4-5 stars?? It was long on name-dropping, short on facts, and incredibly shallow.

Still, nothing took me inside the mayhem the dual forces of nature and politics caused as the earth shook like reading 1906. 1906 gave me a great mental picture of the times, and although ficticious, skillfully allowed me to suffer the effects of the earthquake along with the characters. Dalessandro's plot is fascinating, but what I value most after having read this novel is that when I'm in San Francisco I now find myself seeing certain street names and places in a whole new light."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO Forced!","review":"James Delessandro is too full of himself. His writing is forced, and his research is just cut and paste. He has spewed something out for money, and fame.

All in all, I've seen better writing from elementary children."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"First of all, I'm shocked at those other reviews. They must be 'plants' from the publisher because this was truly one of the worst books I've ever read. I'm a huge fan of historical fiction and this seemed like a great scenario. But the writing is horrific. The author can't string a coherent sentence together. But worse, I blame the editor for this mess. Having the point of view shift in mid-paragraph is not only infuriating, it's complete incompetence.

There is murder, romance, a coverup, and plenty of heroism too, with a broad canvas of places and people, from Nob Hill Mansions to the gritty Barbary Coast, from Enrico Caruso to the US Navy. The story builds page by page until the final crescendo of smoke and fire. Get comfortable and hang on for the ride!

The volume is little more than an honors paper in a quality high school, exhibiting a familiarity with specialized terms and the ability to assemble a bibliography. There is no substantive analysis validating the title, and definitely no support for the subtitle which indicates support for school vouchers. Most readers will remember the \\"Sokal Affair\\" where a scientist parodied cultural studies authors and had it accepted in their top journal. One could imagine this piece attempting to be placed in the same position with its over the top style; but its visible superficiality denies one even that latitude.

There was one comparison to Hemingway that turns my stomach. The book was about several friends engaged in a couple of disjointed weekend paddling trips. The editorial description made it sound like there was an actual expedition down the coast of california and into mexico when in fact the trip was done over several different weekends. I don't have any heartburn with how they conducted their trip, what I do mind is that it was misrepresented in the book's description.

When I had my daughter, I began looking for it, but I couldn't remember the author's name. After all, as a child, who wrote the book didn't really matter to me. I vividly remembered the clean Japanese-style drawings, and the beautiful, rythmic song of the rain falling on Momo's umbrella. Then, my mother brought out a box of my old books. There it was! Well-worn, and well-loved. Now as a mother, I also remember that this book was one of a number of beautiful multicultural books that came out in the late '60s and early '70s. They were a pretty new thing when I was growing up. Having a multicultural family, I don't take that for granted.

I've only listened to it once thru, and I know I like it.Once I listen a couple more times, I know I'll get stuck on it. I'm totally sick of all the indie crap, all the over stylized everything. I think this album has a raw tone to it, I don't think it's overproduced. I believe it's honest writing. Personally I think it's simply Gavin with some new people to work with.

I really loved the music he produced with bush the combination of his music writing coupled with NIGEL PULSFORD was an explosive combination, Kinda of how Tom Morello's Guitar Riffs/Noises/Solos made the Rage Aaginst the Machine stand out with ZACK DE LA ROCHA's voice! I will admit \\"Moutains\\" caught my attention,alil, but the problem was I was waiting for someone to fill in te background like Nigel did. Never happened!

Hmmm... well, either he's not the frontman I thought he was, or he just put together a band with no chemistry whatsoever.This Album sounds like a bunch of buddies who got together to jam; wrote some choppy tunes, laid the foundation for a few tracks, then quickly scrambled to jumble together some lyrics (which are AWFUL, btw). It's just basically music with absolulely no harmony, no feel, and like I said before, horrible lyrics. Never before in my life have I seen such a profound frontman fall flat on his face as I did with this album. This album can't even boast a decent song. Every song is B-Side quality.Hey Gavin, how about trying to reconcile with the band members of Bush? Save your career, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"?????????","review":"What is Gavin Rossdale thinking? This album is horrible. Bush in their day were mediocre at best, and always desperately bland. This however is terrible. The songs are boring Nu-Metal folks.

Considering I have not heard any air play on my Local \\"so called\\" Alternative stataion. What is Alternative today anyways? Most bands today sound like Preppy Rock.

They certainly did not make on the debut \\"Institute\\" album. The disc is full of power chords, very weak hooks, and \\"psycho-babble\\" lyrics. A huge let down for Bush fans hoping to recapture the glory. I am, however, looking forward to hearing their next LP (in who knows how long), I have a feeling it will be alot better.

I laughed out loud at several bits (one innkeeper had a \\"never-ending seven year dispute\\" with a zoning board) and cringed at others, especially the parts that seemed to kowtow to every inns' staff.

With other fantastic songs such as Jeff's beautifully written All That is Good and the irony-laced The Untimely Death of Brad, as well as the usual phunny tracks (When I Go Out rulez!

I found this a fascinating autobiography. He was a rounded man with a real doctoring job and a wide range of friends and experiences. The autobiography flows very smoothly and easily and gives you good insight into the times. This was to me a momentous period in the history of poetry, imagine all these folks Williams, Pound sitting around in the early 20th century, smoking, jawing, it's almost unreal and Williams gives a good picture of it...and also how you can be a poet with a real job (as hardworking physician) as opposed to faculty at Harvard.

If you are a Ziggy fan, you will be very happy that you bought it. If you are a Bob Marley fan I also recommend this DVD, because Ziggy's performance at the Avalon in Hollywood (in which he does some \\"Bob songs\\") really does justice to Bob Marley's legacy. Ziggy may not have as many great songs as Bob, but in this performance he displays a passion that really hits-home. \\"Love is my Religion\\" is an awesome song and Ziggy sings it in a way that makes it feel like a spiritual experience. I think Bob would be very proud of how far his son has come as a musician and as a messenger for peace. The quality of the recording is very good too... and the option for 5.1 surround was a big plus too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!!!","review":"I attended the concert at the Avalon in December 2006. This DVD brought back the memories of how much fun I had that night, it also reflects the great energy from Ziggy and his band!

It is terribly dry, with huge long sections of complex reading, not to mention, the information is very out of date.

True, many subjects are covered - e.g. there is yet an other IP overview - but unfortunately I can't say the descriptions are very clear. The frequent use of acronyms, some of which were new to me even the subjects were familiar, doesn't make the reading any easier. I found the voice traffic modelling and delay simulation results interesting but I don't understand why to cover the complex mathematics so thoroughly when most of the book only skims the subjects. The reason why the human resources outsourcing via web was selected as a case study remains a mystery to me. The relatioship to Voice over IP is quite distant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up-to-date information","review":"This book was published in 1998, and that should tell you plenty about what is covered in it.

After finally getting the coating like I wanted and cleaning off the spots I didn't mean to cover, I didn't get any glow. I set it in direct sunlight for 2 hours, then took it into a completely dark, interior room. Yes, there was a glow, but only a slight glow. If I had to acquire this site quickly in a dim room, I doubt I'd have much luck. For daylight situations, I still think you'd be better with a pearl type fingernail polish.

Is this a joke?On top of that, the cover does not mention this fact but in the rear side, whereas the front lists the song among the highlights of the album!It is obvious that it had to do either with some producer's rights or with sales policy. In the first case it is her management's duty to bring such things in order.

The timer hands are also a bit difficult to see, being red against black.

Steele suggests practicing reading BL by watching couples in restaurants. I've tried it watching TV shows like Blind Date, and I can see many of the gestures that Steele describes. Unlike some of the author's other books, this one is oriented almost equally toward men and women. The book also adds some good advice on other aspects of dating relationships, like \\"What to Talk About\\" and \\"Courtship Tactics\\".

Besides multiple typos, this is the first book I have ever read where the entire index is a typo! Not one entry is correct. Apparently, they laid the book AFTER the index was written. None of the page numbers agree with the entries. Now, if the book had riveting content, I could overlook this \\"little\\" problem.

The subject could have been fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop Psychology From The Bargain Basement","review":"Body Language Secrets promises a lot. Dates with beautiful women. Exciting nights of ecstasy. Romance, Love, Everything! Actually, it delivers little steak and much sizzle. This is a poorly written independently published book that would have a hard time competing in any bookstore. It consists mostly of hackneyed, dated information that is of little use in the 90s dating scene. It is complete with many typos and a lot of misleading information. Pictures of essentially unattractive people in bare feet illustrate the book. I suggest you save or money or try to find a copy at a flea market or used book store. I doubt if many libraries would buy a copy. My opinion: pass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Body Language Secrets","review":"AFTER reading BLS, I become more sensitive to women non-verbal signals, which are very subtle.

The book was based on observations of the author or his own social interactions, and had very little scientific or research to back up his observations. His attempt to equate human social interactions with the animal kingdom is just useless. For an author with so much education, he should spend more time doing research."},{"rating":"2","title":"seek no further","review":"Success awaits those who read and re-read Body Language Secrets.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars and More","review":"I was just reviewing the comments on this book and surprised to see it rated at only a 4 star, because this is a Five Star Book. It is invaluable.This book teaches Men what they need to know about Body Language so that a man can tell if a woman is interested in him. This stuff is real. If you don't think there is anything to body language, watch television with the sound off, and notice for the signs listed in this book. This book is full of practical advice. Like any skill of value, some of these things take a while to learn and use. Keep with it.I have found the information in this book powerful. It has given me more confidence. Buy this book, after all, you can't go wrong, if you don't like it you can always return it.

They are the experts on this type of communication and Don's book helps men to learn to be aware of it. Buy this book and make a major step toward good positive interactions with women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre bood for novices","review":"I purchased this book based on reviews and recommendations posted here at Amazon. I have to admit I am disappointed.Good points: concrete pictures (though not well-done), and accompanying explanations of what the body language of those pictured conveys. Might be useful to some who need the very basics explained from level zero.Bad points: No organization, no methodology, no classification, articulation is poor. Scarce number of poorly done pictures. Lots of anecdotes more appropriate for an online forum of some sorts. Packed with ads from the author about his other work.Interestingly enough, some ads are for products and services that I would NOT want to buy after seeing this book. For example, on page 68: \\"Body Language and Dress for Success Video\\". Look at the way people in the poorly done pictures are dressed in these book. Would you want to dress like them? I am guessing no."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"R. Don Steele is the expert on female flirting. If you don't think he knows his stuff, go to U-Tube and watch the videos made by his local TV stations. He accurately predicted the female response almost unfailingly.

Buy all three of his books","review":"I have three of Steele's books and you can't find a better value anywhere on body language or courtship/dating info. I recently became single again and I am buying all three of his books for a second time, as the others are in storage. The information is priceless."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of paper","review":"My problem with this book is that it simply states what has been said a million times before.

This is a small book, but the photographs tell the proverbial thousand words. I have no less than eight books on body language by other authors, and all of them combined didn't give me as much information on the specific subject of courtship as this one. Better yet, I can re-read the book within a few hours and have my memory fully refreshed on the subject. Folks, this guy knows what he is talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some very good information, BUT not much","review":"This book does have some very good information, unfortunately there is not much of it. There are some very useful explanations of body language in the first couple chapters that will make you much better at reading other peoples moods and desires. However after the first couple chapters the author gets off topic and his suggestions for dating, etc are not very useful when they do not explicitly relate to body language. Also this book is generally poorly written, and there are sales pitches for the authors other products at the end of each chapter. In general this book has the feel of an infomercial product.I give the book 2 stars for explaining a small amount of very useful subject matter but I feel like there must be a better books out there about body language. This book was less that 200 pages and the useful information could have been summed up in 25. Not worth $19"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I never thought about all the cues that people, especially women, use with body language. This book is full of gestures that people use to tell you rather they're (un)interested, arrogant, etc. It's very easy to understand, and I was able to use the cues within minutes of reading it. I even learned to watch women's body language around me, and how to send the right signals. THIS IS A MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monkey See, Monkey Do","review":"The only reason why I didn't give the book 5 stars is because it's a little dated, and the author really is not in tune with what the dating scene is like these days. But the art of body language pretty much transcends time. After you read this book, it really is amazing the subtle signals that people give off that will tell you what they are actually thinking. You can pretty much put info in this book to use after you have read it. For those single guys like me who want to know what a woman is REALLY thinking when you talk to them, then this book is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most of This Book NOT About Body Language, Save Your Mone","review":"Much of this book is very similiar to Steele's How to Date Young Women series. There are better and lower priced body language books out there without Steele's dating observations of varying quality included as filler. If this book were strictly about body language it would only be about 50 pages in length. Like his other works, which are self-published as is this, editing and writing are crude. Steele has some dating and relationship observations that are continuously recycled in his writings. And remember, he's twice divorced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not secrets. So general. Common sense, though","review":"it may not be that common.Not that I am being demanding or exceptionally critical, however, the author himself did admit that people nowadays had become so sophisticated that he or she could manipulate his/her own body language that the real meaning behind many of the movements/gestures discussed in the book should be judged by the readers themselves. If that's the case, what's the value of this book then? The content of it is just too simple, if not sometimes naive. I am sorry that I had made a mistake for buying and reading this book.For those who want to study about body language, \\"Never be lied to again by David J. Lieberman\\" is a much better choice. For those who want to improve their knowledge on courtship and dating, \\"How to make anyone fall in love with you by Leil Lowndes\\" will satisfy you well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Companion to HTDYW","review":"An absolute must have companian to How to Date Young Women, Also by Steele.

Read and understand this book, and there will be no more cold-calling."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of three of the most essential books by this author","review":"One of three of the most essential books by this author, you will need to enter or re-enter the dating scene. In this book you will learn how to read an individual's stance, change of stance, cluster of movements and weather they are interested in you or just being polite. More importantly the author helps you to develop your intuition and more. The author had a radio show \\"the truth about dating and mating\\" (Cd's for past shows are available on his website).

The book is not all encumpassing but a good start in the study of our human race."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointed","review":"The vast majority of this book is old school courting that simply will not work today. Women are more sophisticated in picking nonverbal than this book talks about. If your inner psychology is jacked up no amount of body language will fix that. In addition, if your body is not moving right then you cannot even get out of the gate to send the right signals and all of hers will be skewed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap dating book disguised as a body language guide","review":"Cheaper and better books exist elsewhere. Hell, \\"Body Language For Dummies\\" is better than this crap. At least it just focuses on body language. While Steele's observations are solid on body language, everything else is utter crap. So it just gets 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A one of a kind book that everyone could learn something fro","review":"Not as good as the stellar How to Date Young Women by the same author, but a good read into a subject no one else is really discussing.

The author's style of writing takes a while to get used to because it is both unrefined and brutally honest. This book did have a few topics in it I havn't found in other books and because of this, have purchased his other works as well. As usual, my advice to anyone purchasing dating books: read many books from different authors. Everyone has different results with different methods since you are different from everyone else and so is your target. What works on one person for someone may not work on another. The more tools you have in your toolchest the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn the unspoken language which women know better than us","review":"I now know when a women is beckoning me across the room, when I ain't supposed to know.

It teaches a person absolutely nothing of any value and has intuitive truths that are easily seen even by the most ignorant, unfocused people I know.

If this be your first book by the author its a good place to start, it takes a little while to get used to his writing style and his characters in situations, but that will pass and I found myself exited with every turning page. The characters and situations the author puts these people through are crazy, dreadful, scary and hilarious.

This book, on the other hand, drew me right in. I love the descriptions of the Angles, the character interaction, the descriptions of Vittorio's physical surroundings were great, and it captured lots of emotions. I understand that this book posed some contiunality problems in relation to the other Vampire books, but as a single-shot reading for a person who has never read Anne Rice, this book is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"An epic tale of good and evil, guilt and innocence, and trust and betrayal. Vittorio the Vampire has the relentless pace and stunning power of The Triumph and the Glory, the psychological tension of Hannibal, the visual imagery of the Harry Potter books, and the stark horror that only a novelist of Anne Rice's talent can deliver. Not as good as The Witching Hour or Lasher, but compares favorably with her Vampire Chronicles books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gateway through Time","review":"Rice vividly gives us a taste of ancient Italy...alive with the painters and artists that made those times unique and beautiful. The book dazzles you as she uses her words to show you how it used to be in Italy. As for Vittorio, you will grow to love him, especially after reading his past and what he has been through. He is sort of like Louis, having humanity to him more so than the other vampires. Give it a try. I think it would have been more exciting with less descriptions and more action or weirdness, but it was good. I fairly enjoyed it, it was a tad bit better than Pandora."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with interview with the vampire","review":"I had read the first in the new series Pandora and found it more interesting and bareable. I found that this book dragged at parts as you hear the young, still human Vittorio talk of revenge. He doesn't even become a vampire till almost the very end whereas in Interview the Vampire the tale begins with how he was created. The whole moral of the book is summed up in the last few chapters: revenge will eat away at you, people do crazy things for love, and whatever evil you do will come back to haunt you and stay on your conscience forever. To suffer through most of the novel to find out the obvious in the end just made it seem like a waste of time. If you really like Anne Rice's work read it for the hell of it but let me say this, I warned you it was bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it.","review":"This is one of the worst and most disappointing books that i have ever read. After reading both Interview and Lestat, i decided to pick this one up, expecting something spectacular. Instead of the uplifting, romantic, adventurous tale that i had wanted, i got (in my opinion) a shabby, sputtering plot and writing that didn't seem to focus on or develop the characters. I don't know if having angels involved is normal for Anne Rice books, but i thought that including them was somewhat insipid. Another thing that bothered me was that i couldn't figure out exactly what Vittorio was, even reading more than 1/2 of the book. For me, it wasn't Vittorio, the Vampire; it was Vittorio, the Crazy Italian who Sees Angels. And that wasn't something i wanted to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was disapointing!","review":"Vittorio the Vampire read like a well written soap opera. Rice spent so much time describing how he became a Vampire that she forgot to tell us why we should care. The characters were not fully developed and it was hard to care whether they lived or died. The love story between Vittorio and Urcilla is completely unbelievable and fails to inspire.Overall, this book pales in comparison with her other Vampire and Witches chronicles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Unlike most of Anne Rice's books, this book was very slow. The entire book is about how Vittorio became a vampireand almost nothing of his life as one. It was extremely slow moving and the love story was not believable. I found myself skipping many paragraphs to see if anything interesting was every going to happen. It did, but very occasionally. I would recommend saving your money and just rereading some of her better books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a little bit disappointing","review":"Before I had started this book, I had read the vampire chronicles.

He ends up killing many people and a few animals to quench his deadly thirst. For, you see, he is a vampire. As in her previous novels, the vampires in this story want to live eternally, so they keep killing people and sucking their blood to keep living. But this story has a startling twist which will enthrall the reader - this vampire is not named Lestat or some French sounding name. This vampire is named Vittorio, like an Italian.Bravo, Ann Rice. You are our Mistress of the Dark from New Orleans and one of the great literary giants in the history of humankind. Please keep giving us your wondrous books about vampires who suck people's blood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is the author?","review":"This book is hugely infuriating. I finally finished it on the 3rd try. I keep asking myself is this the same Anne Rice who wrote \\"Interview\\" and \\"The Witching Hour?\\" I think she has become so successful--making so much money for her publishers--that they're afraid to edit her anymore. Lately she has become so self-indulgent as to be virtually unreadable. I struggled with \\"Armand\\" and simply could not read \\"Violin\\" even after 4 tries. \\"Vittorio\\" is hardly better. It is so maddeningly amateurish that it probably couldn't be published if it had been written by a first-time author. I told myself that it wasn't really Rice's voice that I found so annoying, but was the persona she'd adopted for writing as Vittorio. But then I remembered that I'd had the same problems with \\"Violin\\" and \\"Armand\\" and have to conclude that Anne Rice is simply getting lazy. And that saddens me because I used to like her work so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the Real Anne Rice Please Stand Up?","review":"Although a fan of Anne Rice's early Vampire Chronicles (first 3 were the best - 4 & 5 were ok), I am thoroughly convinced that Vittorio was written by Mrs. Rice's housecat.

If you decide to cram them all into one short work you'll end up wih a pointless little casserole like Vittorio, the Vampire. The book starts well enough but then disintegrates; while the places are, for the most part, beautifully described, the characters are poorly drawn, the plot meanders aimlessly from pillar to post until it disappears altogether, and the various jumbled themes can't be addressed satisfactorily in a book this brief and hastily assembled. No wonder it was only $3.98."},{"rating":"2","title":"My best book ever","review":"This book is about demonds destroying a mans home and family.

Vittorio is dry, draggy, boring and completely unworthy of Ms. Rice's authorship. If I wanted to read about art and history, I'd buy an art appreciation book at the university book shop. Vittorio is completely without character and uninteresting.What a disappointment from such a gifted writer. The only time she lives up to expectations anymore is when she creates a new category of monster - Witching Hour and The Mummy were outstanding - everything else lately has been boring repetition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vittorio the Bore","review":"This is the worst book in either of Anne Rice's two vampire series of books. In each of the other books the reader had reason to care about the main character. Vittorio drones on with his story of becoming a vampire to the point of boredom. In each of Anne Rice's other vampire books there is always some hint of what is happening with the other vampires in the series. Here Vittorio starts out stating that he has no connection to these others and the reader will not be enlightened as to them. What follows is a tale with just that - no connections to the previouse tales - including how vampires are made. This vampire seems to exist in another universe of vampires. There is nothing alluring about him. There is no excitement or mystery about him. One begins to think that someone other than Anne Rice wrote this book. Sadly, Vittorio is a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much detail not enough action!","review":"Unfortunately, I like to read about characters and actions not long descriptives narratives about music, archecture, clothing, and soul searching. I miss Ms. Rice's Lestat-type writing style. It was witty, fast moving, and action packed. Her new books are a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like a basis for a new cottage industry","review":"This book read like a work-in-progress. As if a deadline had to be made and \\"something\\" had to be delivered. So little happens here that it seems Rice is setting us up for a series of Vittorio books. Contrary to what other people have thought the parts about Fra Filippo were the most interesting. And of course they were true as Rice tries to impress us with her bibliography. But at least she didn't resort to the soft-porn of Cry of Heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"Does anybody else remember when Anne Rice wrote *stories*? Sigh. This was a book with nearly 300 pages of lush descriptions, occasionally interspersed with a little bit of action.

I didn't regret ending this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampired Out?","review":"This is yet another typical Anne Rice \\"vampire\\" novel.

If you enjoyed the other books in the vampire chronicles, don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice prologue, but where is the novel itself?","review":"After finishing Vittorio, I was disappointed, to say the least. The book is flat, no real characterization takes place. Some very interesting characters are introduced only to be beheaded fifty pages later.

I try not to compare the new books to the old ones but I was very dissapointed with Vittario. The story started off good but quickly became dull and lifeless. There is too much missing in this book! What has Vittario been doing for the last five hundred years? Where was he when Akasha was destroying all of her kind? There is a small link to him and the other vampires that is missing. And the ending was so dull it made me feel I had wasted my time on the first 200 pages. I hope that on the next book she remains to be as detailed as she is known to be. To Anne: I still love you but come on I know you can do so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"When I first opened \\"Vittorio,\\" I was so excited. I thought I finally had the old Anne Rice back. Her discriptive power, which has been lagging ever since \\"Interview\\" seemed back in full. But as I read on, a dull sense of unease began to creep over me.I was sure I'd read something like this before.I have - in the phone book, which, like \\"Vittorio,\\" shares a complete lack of characterization. Vittorio the character started off with such promise, but I didn't care about him by the end of the book. He was never developed to the point that I could. Ursala suffers even more; she could have been a cardboard cutout for all the time Rice takes to give her a personality. This makes the \\"love affair\\" between the two completely unbelievable.I take my earlier contention back. It's the characters, not the descriptions that make (or made) Anne Rices books good. Unfortunatly, it's not in \\"Vittorio.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"more on the italian babe, please?","review":"i was aware that none of the good ol' fav characters like lestat, armand and louis would be featured in the latest vampire novel...unfortunately, i still couldn't help but miss their presence.nevertheless, vittorio was a good read (much better than memnoch and body thief ANYTIME) and i hope rice will continue to write about his new vampiric adventures, or concentrate on ursula who wasn't given much of a character in the book, other than that of an innocent sweet young thing whose life was cruelly taken and ravished. would be interesting to hear her personal account of the horrific death-rape matrimonial consumation with florian and subsequent life as the vampire bride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vittorio the Vampire","review":"Anne Rice will always be a master of fiction, but VITTORIO is another nail in her casket as far as I am concerned. The short three hundred pages of this book were not enough. They were well written, but they were very much lacking. The joy of Anne's books includes learning the stories of more than the main character. In the golden days, Anne would have told us the story of Ursula at least. Come to think of it, Anne left out the last five hundred years of Vittorio's life too. Don't tell me he and Ursula haven't done something interesting in five hundred years. In summary, I'm very dissapointed with this book. Sorry Anne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vittorio Nice to meet you NOW go away","review":"After reading Vittorio I checked to make sure it was truely a Anne Rice novel. I enjoyed the images that were painted about Italy but I never want to read about Vittorio again. It should have been called \\"The boy who weeps at EVERYTHING and happens to become a vampire\\" Give me characters that I can have feeling for, either good or bad. I have hated and loved her other main characters so much that I feel that I know them, I don't want to know Vittorio. Shake his hand and send him away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vittorio is a Coke addict","review":"I think Vittorio snorted too much cocaine, he hallucinates and sees angels. Just kidding.It was an pretty good book - I guess. I was going to give it three stars, but considering the fact that I finished it in two days, I decided to give it four stars. It captured my attention, and I wanted to find out how it ended. However, I did expect Vittorio to turn into a Vampire right away, so I suppose partly of what kept me reading was to find out when the hell he was going to be one of the Undead.Anyways - read it. It's short and sweet - though it's not like you really \\"feel\\" a character, like many probably have with Lestat and Louie. The character development is weaker in this one, but still readable.

Instead of the steamy settings and cool vampires that have you drooling for more it was a story filled mostly with a whining vampire.Didn't we already get that with\\"Interview with the Vampire\\"? And that book had great characters to balance out Louis's whining. The same,sadly,can't be said for this.We miss the action we had with Lestat. Anne,get with it!

This book holds interest for the visually minded who are not afraid to let go and expand with the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the beaten path","review":"Once again Anne Rice takes her readers off the beaten path by introducing us to her newest character, Vittorio. She breathes life into this character like no other. This adds yet another twist in the path of her branching storylines. Just as she managed to tie the Mayfair Witches to the Vampire series, she takes off in a new direction with the innocent Vittorio. The charm of Italy and the vivid descriptions add to the beauty of this tale. I look forward to reading more in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un grande viaggio...","review":"This is the Annie we do love! Keep up the good work. We are waiting for the complete story of Marius and the sequel (book four) of the Mayfair witches... Ciao G.Luca - Roma."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best!!","review":"i love anna rice's book, Vittorio. its now my fav. book, mainly because of Vittorio himself. i think that the story itself could not have had a better setting than Italy. i too thought it as sort of a breather from the rest of the \\"old vampiers\\". the only problem i had with the book was its length, it was too short! but one thing is certian, i will definatly be on the lookout for Vittorio in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auch!","review":"Usually Anne Rice writes pretty decent books but this must be her worst. The book raves as she tries to describe hallucinations. This makes it tough to follow. The ending is also a complete reversal the direction which the book took. And the logic and justification for that reversal lacks merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I don't understand why Anne Rice even bothered with this book. Who wants to read about some whining spoiled baby who doesn't compare to any of the characters in her other great novels. Vittorio is a character that is a waste of time and energy. You might as well skip the book because it has nothing to do with any of the other Vampire books. He knows none of the other cool characters and contributes nothing to the saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This is not a great book book it is Ok. Although nothing really happens and there is no unexpected turns or anything really exciting.Ann Rice is a good writer but she has obviously run out of ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"This terrible, boring book is a major disappointment. It cannot even compare with The Tale of the Body Thief, Interview, or even Pandora. I hated Vittorio and and all of the other characters. A total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst in a series of declining tales.","review":"I've read all her books. The Mayfair Witches, all the vampire series'. All of them. Nothing was better than an Anne Rice book on a long plane trip. I couldn't wait for the newest Rice book to hit the stores. With Vittorio, things took a dramatic turn. I almost couldn't finish it. I put it down so many times (out of sheer BOREDOM!) only to pick it back up in the hope it would improve. It didn't. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again excellence","review":"Again Anne Rice winds you completely into her characters lives. History detail was tremendous. Once leaving this book you feel as if you've known her characters and lived through time with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING!","review":"I am a great fan of Anne Rice, but this book was very disappointing. The characters were bland and I could simply not get into the book. I hope the next round of tales will be more exciting and a worthwhile read. If you are a new Rice fan, I recommend \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" and \\"The Vampire Lestat.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"convert or entertain what is Mrs. Rice's goal at this point?","review":"Sadly, Vittorio The Vampire turned out to be another of Rice's smotheringly Christian novels. This time hidden behind the guise of a love for Italian art. Even I thought this one was too pious to be anything more than ennuyant & I can usually put up with just about all of her self righteous tripe to get to a good read. The morality she is gracelessly vomiting at her loyal readers has become all but intolerable to this reader. Will I personally purchase another piece of junk food litterateur by Mrs. Rice? Yeah probably but I never claimed I didn't have masochistic tendencies. Sometimes I think it's helpful to express a not so terribly positive view of things. In my honest opinion if I can save just one reader from the agonizing boredom caused by this book than I have done something pure & good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Not worth the money. I forced myself to read it as I had faith in Anne Rice and thought it would get better. The beginning was good, but it went drastically downhill around the middle. I was extremely disappointed and promptly threw it away after finishing. Maybe I don't get it, but I didn't find the angel descriptions that captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Strange story that was mildly interesting in the beginning and turns into a completely different one.

This book doesn't really do it for me. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but is really crushed by my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment.","review":"About once every two or three hundred years, a man lives who is so charming and beautiful and prone to uncontrollable weeping that he is destined to become an Anne Rice vampire. And so we meet Vittorio. This new vampire comes off as arrogant, pretentious, childish and unlikable, as does the book that bears his name. I am a big fan of Interview with the Vampire, but Anne Rice's books seem to slip gradually farther from the depth and drama of that first work. She didn't always need angels and demons to walk her through explorations of good and evil. I hope her next installment is a little fresher. I would love to love her again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A love story between immortal and mortal souls.","review":"Anne Rice's narrative of the relationships of these immortals and their mortal companions is like a love story not between man and women, rather between two passionate souls."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"A great read - I was mesmerized and carried away. A great way to escape the world's cares."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Anne's Best!","review":"Vittorio is simply intoxicating. It is one of Anne Rice's best novels to date. The character of Vittorio is a character of which the readers haven't seen the like since Louis in Interview. He is totally mesmerizing and I anxiously await more of his story. Bravo Anne!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vittorio the Vampire","review":"I loved this book so much I did not want it to end. Vittorio and Ursula were so good together. I was hoping for a miraculous ending. Please write another book about them and The Court of the Ruby Grail and there journeys in the beautiful Renaissance Italy. I can not help but to imagine how they would look if they were brought to life in a Motion Picture. This book let my imagination run WILD. Please continue there saga and life together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash of her better works.","review":"Oh man, what a stinker. Anne Rice must have needed some more money, so she rehashed the worst parts of her first three Vampire novels (agonizing pacing, annoyingly whiney vampires, etc.) into this pile of crap. Anne can still turn a good phrase and occasionally insert a neat new detail, but you're better off re-reading \\"Interview...\\" and praying that Anne gives it up before plunging into self-mockery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bor-ing!","review":"I find her so boring since she became well known. This book puts me to sleep, but I hope to finish it just to get closure. \\"Interview With a Vampire\\" was so innovative and \\"The Mummy\\" was also great, but I find her present writing style and storylines tiresome and her books uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment for an avid fan","review":"Let me start off by saying I love Anne Rice's style. Her attention to detail creates an incredibly realistic sense of time and place and her ability to craft memorable characters makes many of her novels a joy to read. That said, this book flickers weakly with all the things I love about her novels but it falls short and was entirely in the end a disappointment. Her books of late, and Vittorio is no exception, are replacing creativity with self-indulgence and good old-fashioned story telling with religious pontification.Read it if you must (it was better than Violin at least) but skipping it would be no great loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring history of Florence","review":"Boy, did this one bite. Hoping that Rice's newest would be in the Tale of the Body Thief category, or quality, or that she found something else interesting to say, all I found was detailed Florentine history, of which I had my fill in Western Civ. classes. And the Satanic rituals outlined go completely against Lestat's philosophical apologies in previous novels. A book chronicling the history of Sesame Street's \\"the Count\\" (ah, ah, ah... one, one more Rice novel that was no good) would be better than this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"This would have made a decent short story, if Rice had pruned it down to the essentials. As a novel, though, it isn't really developed enough to be interesting. Poor compared with some of Rice's earlier works . . . and a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An underdeveloped vampire yarn","review":"This book is overflowing with potential. The story is set in a fascinating period, the so-called Age of Gold during the Rennaisance in Italy, a time filled with art, political intrigue, and rapidly changing conventions. It is told through the eyes of a 16-year old boy, torn between the desire for avenging the death of his family at the hands of vampires and love for a female vampire. For those familiar with the other works of Anne Rice, you would expect these elements to yield a richly woven tapestry. However, the potential of the story is never realized.The book is pleasant and mildly diverting, but woefully thin in character development and plot. This is a short-story overly dressed as a novel. There is also an irritating excursion into pop spirituality with the introduction of angels. In short, this is far from Anne Rice's best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staring at the sun through a telescope&#65533;.again&#65533;","review":"I would refer to this book as a forced tooth extraction without novocaine. Lestat is nowhere to be found for the third time (third book). Since she dumped Lestat in the church the series has went downhill. This is my promise to Anne Rice: As long as the stories are kept at their current level and Lestat is not the prime character. My money will stay in my pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was awful...","review":"The end of the world must truly be at hand. All you have to do is look at Anne Rice's new book to know that even she is suceptable to these ends. I was so disappointed by this book, I was even looking forward to a story about a new vampire, but this was terrible, just a titch above the quality of her book \\"All Soul's Eve\\" which had a disappointing ending as well. This just seemed to be too much a regurgetation of past ideas, which were great the first time I read them. Anyhow, even if your an anne rice fan, it's still worth reading, if you have nothing better to do. I hope in the future she doesn't hurry so much to put a book out like this. I'd rather have a longer wait with the promise of something better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Short Story","review":"Well what can I say? For the first time Anne Rice has dissapointed me. For one I would like to point out that this IS a short story, not a novel. The most distressing thing is she left out the vampire part. As usual she was great with the story background, however I was dissapointed with the characters. I'm sorry but putting 100 pages of print into a wide margined double spaced, huge type, does not make it a novel. All I can figure is she arrived at her deadline with what we've read and I can't help but think she never quite finished the story. C'mon Anne I want to read about Vittorio The VAMPIRE. It was good and the message was positive (though thinly veiled) But I would have liked to have read the whole story. I'm sorry but I feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best...to say the least","review":"I have read every single one of Anne Rice's books and thoroughly enjoyed each one but this one left a lot to be desired. Her other books are filled with passion and mysticism and they have the ability to transport you into the characters' lives. This book however, did nothing of the sort. In the beginning, it seemed very promising but it then it dragged on and on. Anne was certainly descriptive and attempted to infuse passion, mystery and compassion into the story but it didn't seem to work. But, all the same, I can't wait for her next book! Please read Pandora and Armand - they are truly Anne Rice masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical word journey through centries of wonder!","review":"The book starts off slowly, but only for a few pages. Then, the magic that is Anne Rice takes your hand and transports you through time. Transfixed by the flow of her words, you stand in awe as vampires talk with angels! We are all rewarded with a tale of beauty, horror, love, lust, wonder, magic, blood, and finally an amazing, awesome ending! Anne Rice at her very best! A hard book to put down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I found this book very boring; I couldn't even finish it! Pandora was very good--I'd like to hear more about her story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Anne Rice but...","review":"I've read all of the Vampire Chronicles and found most of them very enjoyable. But this book was soooo boring and long winded. I had to force myself to finish. Her last two books Pandora and Armand were readable but definately not her best work. The storylines for all three books were kind of boring. But this by far is her worst book. I wish she'd continue with the Mummy Story. Her Witches were my favorite. Sorry Anne this one wasn't very good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED","review":"I've read all of Anne's novels and I really had a hard time with this one. I love descriptive novels, but this was ridiculous. Every page was a never-ending detailed description of Florence and Italian paintings, and yes, it's \\"cultural\\", but isn't this supposed to be a horror novel? I don't think I would recommend this book to anybody. Don't expect anything exciting in the plot either. Anne should stop writing such boring novels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read, one you can not put down.","review":"Ms. Rice, is ture to her form in this tale of the vampiers. It is a book I found diffcult to put down. I wanted to know what was going to happen next. This book will keep you on the edge until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm just glad Lestat isn't plastered all over the pages. :)","review":"This book was great, because it's new material. I've become tired of reading about Lestat in his apathy, and frankly, Vittorio is a fresh new character who is lively, but in a good way (and he doesn't whine like Lestat used to)."},{"rating":"2","title":"New perspective","review":"As an avid reader of Anne Rice, I open each new book of hers with great expectation. Vittorio, was different than what I had expected. I enjoyed having a new vampire from a new place with no connection to the others. The views of this vampire were different than any of the others and I was quite moved at times. Vittorio doesn't snivel and whine about his \\"condition\\", but qoes on with life or unlife the best he can. I enjoyed it greatly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At times recycling is a bad thing...","review":"I have just recentlty completed reading Ms. Rice's latest novel, Vittorio..., and near the end of the book I had this nagging feeling that I'd read this somewhere before... then it hit me... I have!It seems the well is running dry for Rice. All this book does is place the agonized Vampire, here named Vittorio instead of Louis, in yet another European setting. This time 15th-century Florence in lieu of 19th-century Paris. Instead of the Theatre du Vampire, we have the Court of the Ruby Grail. Both meet the same demise. LeStat had his Gabrielle, Louis his Claudia, Vittorio has his Ursula.At best, I found this book to be just average. I know nothing will top Interview...Eh ... just my two cents"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep the Faith Making a Come Back","review":"Isn't it a miracle that Michael O'Brien's song, 'Back to You' had a transcending calling to make this great album a come back. The album is being promoted on TV by those who have heard it. One such buyer said it was \\"..hope in a small box.\\" I do have to agree with them. It overflows with blessed talent and vocals. Who can go wrong with these list of artists like, Bob Carlisle (Butterfly Kisses), Greg Long (the 'Jesus' song), Kim Hill, Avalon, Amy Morriss, Sandi Patty, CeCe Winans, Steven Curtis Chapman, Kathy Troccoli, Point of Grace-among other great artists. If you're having a stressful day just turn on this CD and let your anxiety melt away. The kind of lyrics and soothing music does make a difference in a person health and well-being. I have to say that Christian music is the best soother of the spirit. And the songs on this album are exceptionally helpful.

When I first got the scale, I had my body fat measured at the gym (water submersion) and on the scale. The results differed by just 1/2 percent.My only complaint is that it can be cumbersome to enter the information for body fat measurement.

This only calculates your body fat based on height and weight, not your impedance!! I got on the scale and it gave me a body fat reading. I went back on it 5 times in row...exact same measurement each time. Next, I performed a little experiment. I picked up a twenty pound weight, now this should have brought my body fat % down since a chunk of steel has no fat. But, NO! It just saif I had even more body fat now because I weighed more, not because I was any fatter! This is a pure rip off! It may be okay as a pure scale but do not buy it give you a proper BF%.

The idea that the scale is sending electricity through your system to check your body fat does not pan out if you do a simple test: - input your info, get on the scale, and see what percentage of body fat you've got. Now get off the scale, get a heavy weight, (like 3 gallons of water), input your info same as before, and get on the scale. Voila! Your body fat percentage is now higher, not due to extra fat but the extra weight which the scale calculates out to a percentage. In my opinion, not worth a dime for fat percentages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inputting data every time is a pain","review":"I wanted a low end scale and went with this one. I was disappointed to find that you have to input the height every time to get fat calculations.Body fat calculations are off because it only measures how the electricity runs through one leg to the other, so if you carry your weight more in your legs and hips, it will be higher than it really is, if you carry your weight in your torso but not in your legs it will be lower. This is true of any of the home body fat scales however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Scale","review":"This is a good scale, with the only reason it doesn't get a 5 is that it doesn't save your information. I'm the only one who uses it, so I have to reinput my data everytime I want a body fat analysis.Of course if this is/was a big deal to me, i would spent $30 more and got one that saved settings"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it does save your profile!!!","review":"I just wanted to add contrary to others comments that you DON'T have to re-enter your information each time. If you tap one of the bars on the bottom part of the scale, it will pull up your profile (height and gender), you then are able to stand on the scale and get your weight and body fat measurement. Two people can save their profiles, you do have to read the directions to learn how to use it properly. It's a good scale, but the body fat is definitely off by five percent. But this is why it's cheap. If you want accuracy, you have to pay for it. I'm satisfied with an estimate. I just know that I subtract 5%--no big deal to me, as long as I know it's consistantly 5% off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not store data","review":"Contrary to the review below- others who have said that this unit does not store body fat data are correct. The person who says it does must have purchased a different model.

It is so poorly written that I was tempted to mark up the entire book with edits and send it back to the authors for the next edition. Then I realized that there should be no next edition.

Then, when he tried to say something, he said it rather poorly. The book just couldn't seem to decide what it wanted to talk about. It jumped from topic to topic with no cohesiveness between the sections. In addition, the numerous plugs made was disheartening considering the amount of money I had to spend on this book.All in all a very basic overview of day trading.

The majority of their customers make money, with many of the best making millions a fact never mention or bragged about anywhere.

I was utterly disappointed. My criticism of this book is made up of the following points: 1. The book is not well written. In many instances, the explanations given by the authors are unclear and downright confusing. 2. No usable trading methods or techniques are described in the book. Even if I was to attempt to trade electronically, I would have no idea whatsoever on the how-to of choosing what to buy and sell, when to buy/sell it, at what price, etc. 3. Descriptions of what market makers and their ilk do are so simplistic as to be useless. 4. No real life examples of trading are given to help clarify what the authors are talking about. 5. The only decent portion of the book talks about the different systems available to trade electronically. Even this portion of the book is hurt by being poorly written. In short, don't buy this book!

I am a day trader and I think the \\"tips\\" they do offer, combined from other people, are misleading. In sum, I think this book was only made for one purpose - to make money on the people who have no idea about day trading. Unfortunately, they do a poor job of it.

By utilizing Nasdaq's SOES system I can hit and run with incredible speed! My profits have gone from 20-30% a year to over 5-15% A MONTH!

Ninety-five percent of people do not have access or would not want to pay for the technology discussed in this book. Even if an individual did possess all the ECN's, NASDAQ level II quotes, and such, it is doubtful they would excel at day trading since Friedfertig can barely get past his discussion of NASDAQ fraud (complete with photocopied NYTIMES articles)to describe how to actually day trade.

No real information in this book that can't be found searching the Internet with key words \\"Day Trading\\". The software system used by the author costs about $1500 a month and he trades from a seat on NASDAQ with a multi-million dollar account.

Trust me!Also do you think our authors would be able to spot \\"managerial talent\\" over a few aspiring proprietory traders? No they hire guys who have previously filed bankruptcy in their past and pipe up their accomplishments, which are a joke when you realized they bailed on creditors!!Save yourself a dime and avoid it-if someone gives it to you, and you can't return it, use to start the BBQ grill.

Killer observations on the excesses and all round BS of most commercial rap. A real sense of the values that make this MC who he is, and he is (cliche) da bomb.

So I lightly polished the contacts on each end of the battery with a few strokes on the sole of a leather-soled shoe. This seemed to resolve the initial problem, and the battery then seemed to charge and work in my Sony MiniDisk recorder.But, I then discoverd that the record time was much shorter than my original Sony battery, and a fully charged battery seems to run down on it's own in less than a month.

I don't know what it is that entrances him (the rhythm of the words or the rhythm of the images?) and what he focuses on has changed with time - but it is much loved by him, and I look forward to explaining more of it as he gets older and better able to understand the many levels of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellington Was not a Street should have won the Caldecott","review":"I think Ellington Was Not a Street should have won the Caldecott because it had very realistc and large drawings.

Some of the men featured in this book are musicians like The Clovers, Edward Kennedy \\"Duke\\" Ellington, and Ray Barretto. These men plus others would some of the ones who would help \\"change the world.\\" I would recommend reading this book to your children to help teach them about some important figures in history.This book features colorful pictures that feature dark greens, purples, and blues.

Their earlier material was more psychadelic rock, sort of like Pink Floyd. And there later stuff was more experimental prog rock, like a compination of Opeth, Dream Theater, Theatre of Tragedy, Pink Floyd, Rush, and Genesis. I kknow that sounds like a lot, but really shows its eclectic side of aweseomness. Now If you have ever Porcupine Tree album, you still need this. This has some new mixes of certain track and unreleased material. As well as a huge booklet of interveiws a biography and some really awesome pictures and art.

I can't say enough about it - buy it and you'll see !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Music, for the Bob Fans","review":"Bob Weir certainly takes his licks from a lot of Deadheads, but I don't count myself among them. I have always thought Weir's contributions were underrated, and several of his tunes are showstoppers. A couple of these make an appearance here (i.e., \\"Throwing Stones\\" and \\"Looks Like Rain\\"), but they don't really match the full band versions. Of much more interest are the true Weir solo tunes, which get nice understated acoustic renderings. Listened to all in one sitting, this one gets kinda dry, but it is definitely a nice change of pace, and if you're a Bob fan like me (hey, I know, Garcia is Garcia, but that doesn't mean you have to hate Bob!), you should definitely own this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I have used other products and even tried scratch.

I've had some success with various products - Gold Bond has a dry skin cream that's pretty darn good.These guys sent me one of their catalogs out of the blue, and I decided to give it a try. It's very effective - even better than the Gold Bond stuff. Yes, it smells sort of turn of the last century medicinal, but that goes away pretty quickly (I like the smell, but I can see how people used to modern cosmetics and fragrance might find it odd). It's also not particularly greasy. And a little goes a long way.It goes without saying that nothing works for everyone when it comes to skin care - kinda depends on what's going on with your skin. But this is an excellent product, and I love the fact that it's got nothing weird in it. It's absolutely worth a try if you have a problem with dry skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Wonderful Film!!!!!!!","review":"I have been waiting for decades for this to come out on commercial video.

It was co-written by Joan Rivers, so you can see some of her comedy shining through. The video transfer is very clear for a made-for-tv movie. The sound is mono, but it's clear. Stereo sound for tv was years away back in 1973.

It definitely doesn't sound like any american hip hop. But after putting it away for a month or two I pulled it out again and listened to it and it's now one of my favorite albums. The fact that I've been studying italian really helps - the lyrics are really intelligent (yes, hip hop can be intelligent) and it's just infectuous fun to listen to. I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to get an idea of what Italy's music scene sounds like when they're not just copying american styles, but are really making the music their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"rivalry jacket","review":"This jacket was not sized as advertised.

Logical Progressions does exactly that. I have seen people, previously unacquaintaced with the term drum and bass, and minimal to absolutely no exposure to the genre, listen to this cd, and adopt to its rhythm with a smooth instancy. Incredible music to study, dance, cook, chill, sleep, exercise...whatever (truly!) to.

With all of the Dead music out there, we've got to be a little critical about the best and worst of it. This CD is by far the worst Dead I've ever heard. I gave it an honest effort when I first got it and gave up, and then tried again after some time away - but it is no use. In general, the playing is sloppy and uninspired, but the biggest reason is the horrendous keyboard playing of Brent - it has a really unpleasent tone, he plays too much, and it's too loud and too obvious. Using a poor analogy, over and over the band starts building a promising musical structure, a delicate house of cards, and Brent's keyboads come in like a hammer to demolish the whole thing. I initially gave it 2 stars, but I have to be honest - it is that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Dead","review":"Phil said that Jerry was basically dead their last five or six years of touring (except for occasional lapses of brilliance) and this is a brutal example.

Good music but redundant.","review":"While I would like \\"Dozin'\\" very much if I did not own many live Grateful Dead discs. However, with so many official recordings out there from 1990 (not only better performances, in my humble opinion, but also cheaper purchases), I would tend to steer people away from this release. Instead, I would recommend \\"Dick's Picks Volume 9,\\" a 3-CD set from 9/16/90, Madison Square Garden ($22 including postage through 1-800-CAL-DEAD), or the super-great \\"Without a Net,\\" which is pretty much a 'best of' Spring '90 run. It is widely available in music stores... and at about $15 for 2 jam-packed discs with no filler, it's a major bargain.Don't get me wrong. \\"Dozin'\\" is good, but there are other gems available from this era, and we already suffered from 1990 overkill before Dozin' was released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud, trippy and unique.","review":"A really worthwhile compilation. Disc 1 is amazing, with superb versions of \\"Row Jimmy\\", \\"Blow Away\\", and Dylan's \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\". However \\"Bucket\\" and \\"Dupree's Diamond\\" could have been better and they sound way out of key.Disc 2 is the best of the three. \\"Terrapin Station\\" is really trippy here. So is \\"Playing in the Band\\" and \\"Uncle Johns Band\\". Very well improvised jamming on \\"Drums\\" and \\"Space\\".Disc 3 is ok, but could be better. The best songs are \\"The Wheel\\", \\"broken Down palace\\" and \\"Black Peter\\". What I don't understand is why does the Dead like to play songs for other bands? I feel that the cover songs they do really suck, except for \\"Turn on your Love Light\\" and \\"Morning Dew\\" (which are not on this album). But why sing \\"Walkin' Blues\\", and \\"All Along the Watch Tower\\" when they have amazing songs like \\"China/Rider\\" and \\"Jack Straw\\" in their basket of songs?On the whole, it's a compilation that deserves the five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply, a wonderful collection","review":"A great collection that highlights the Dead at their collective peaks (1990, in many a mind, was the hottest year since '77.

Replacing the batteries with new ones didn't help, the screen remained completely dead. There is no reset button or any other control.

I didn't want to pay such a relatively high price for a scale. Indeed, I originally ordered a much cheaper Tanita model that I later discovered was out of stock. Yet I am glad I finally ordered this model. This scale is extremely accurate and easy to read. First touch your memory preset button with your toe and wait a few seconds for the digital display to read \\"0.0.\\" Then Step on it, the scale locks in on your weight, and you can get off to check the results. Very easy to use after you do it the first time. The scale is wider than normal, but I like that. It's easy to place your feet. Fortunately the scale is quite thin, easy to store and easy to pick up from the side. Five memory settings are good for families and I love the \\"previous weight\\" reading. Gives me incentive to do better. Some have complained about this feature, but it doesn't bother me at all. If my spouse knows my weight, all the more incentive to lose it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking around the world","review":"McGann and Weaver are two of the leading scholars on think tanks and they have done an excellent job of painting the think tank landscape around the world.

I found the regional overview chapters to be particularily informative. This book has a wealth of information in it and will prove to be an inportant reference work on the subject.

It has an amazing version of \\"That's It For The Other One\\" and a fair version of one of my favorites with \\"Doin' That Rag\\". However, I'm sorry but I think their attempt at \\"Hey Jude\\" is pretty bad. However, disc two deserves five stars. The late show begins with \\"Dupree's Diamond Blues\\", trips into \\"Mountains of the Moon\\", dances into \\"Dark Star\\" and rocks straight through \\"St. Stephen\\". It concludes with a beautiful version of \\"We Bid You Goodnight\\". One complaint is that at the very end of this CD, we are teased into believing that we're about to hear an encore of \\"Cosmic Charlie\\", but the song is crudely killed in the middle. The sound quality on this isn't as good as some others, but considering it's from 1969... It kind of has a bootleg feel to it. Plus imaging being there, at the legendary \\"Fillmore East\\", waiting to see Janis Joplin, kind of adds something to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware buying this from Amazon","review":"Beware buying this item from Amazon.

The kit is large enough to add virtually any scratchbuilt detail you can think of and the kit itself is fairly accurate. The biggest drawback is the kits landing gear and lack of detail in the tail-wheel, the gear will need to be beefed up a bit. If you are building right out of the box, it's a fairly fast build. If you are adding detail, the kit has raised panel lines so get a lot of sandpaper if you plan to re-scribe them! Overall, I love the kit. I have built 3 in total, one gear-up/panels closed. The other, wheels down/one panel open. The other one in a work in progress, I am going to open the engine up, gun bays, control surfaces...everything! We'll see how that goes!Anyway, it's a great kit that you can do virtually anything to!

Eleanor Cooney takes you by the hand and leads you on on odyssey that you will never forget.

It is a very powerful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cautionary Memoir","review":"I have read Death in Slow Motion, and found it a provocative insight not only into Alzheimer's but more so into its effects on the lives of the people bound by love and duty to their loved one. Ms. Cooney has every reason to dwell on who her mother was, it is after all the central tragedy of the illness. Alzheimer's does not just kill someone, it disintegrates, it degenerates the very essence of the persona you know and love. We do not grieve for the loss of a body, we grieve over the loss of a person and with Alzheimer's we lose the person long before the body they inhabit dies. It is not only Death in Slow Motion, it is also Grief in Slow Motion. I recommend this book to anyone who may be facing a loved one's descent into Alzheimer's or to anyone who thought they were alone with the experience Ms. Cooney so unsparingly reveals. I recommend a visit to the book's website for a more personal insight into the lives involved with this loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a KNOCKOUT!","review":"Lovely & fascinating piece of work.

As anyone going through this heartbreaking process knows firsthand, not only are you faced with losing the parent, spouse, or grandparent you love, but also with the harsh realities of how \\"the beast\\" takes over every aspect of your life. In addition to being impossible to put down, one of the things that struck me most about this book was how her story touches on so many levels. DEATH IN SLOW MOTION is as much a love story, a tribute to her mom - a memorable character if there ever was one - as it is about living, loving, looking back and having to face your own worst demons and forge ahead the best way you know how.

Thankfully I did not purchase it as a gift, because the bottle it came in is not the bottle pictured here. Due to poor packaging, the outside of it was sticky and the cheap label was covered in oil. The oil itself is very thick and sticky, like diluted sap and the best way to describe the scent is a very weak Egyptian musk and cardboard. I am thinking it maybe is old stock, but I have another brand that is several years old and still smells great. Even though it was inexpensive, it is not worth the loss of even a few dollars. I would not recommend this. Pay more somewhere else for better quality.

(would you believe polkas?)","review":"The legendary Chet Atkins, who recorded something like 175 albums, even wrote an \\"Ode to Mel Bay.\\" This series of instructional books has been around for decades. When I was a whippersnapper, I thought they were terribly boring. I've played piano for about 40 years, and recently developed a curiosity about the accordion. I bought this to learn some basics by myself , without benefit of a teacher.If you were alone on a desert island with nothing but an accordion and this book, (how's that for a scary thought?) you could become a decent accordion player. This book is appropriate for the total neophyte to music, as well as someone with musical experience who is new to the instrument. It is organized in a logical and stepwise manner, with successive exercises and tunes building on previous ones.I highly recommend this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Accordion method by Mel Bay","review":"I am a harmonica player, now a newbee for accordion.

Truth be told, the dinosaurs don't look THAT bad for the time, but Baby running near the end of the movie always puts me into fits of laughter. Same goes for any time a dinosaur gets shot. I can't believe this is on DVD, I was thrilled to learn that it has been digitally preserved forever. As far as I'm concerned even the DVD menu is hilarious, just look at the dinosaur's face - it has eyebrows."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I liked it","review":"Ok, saw this one on sell for almost free.

Lotsa swearing, violence, and naked ugly tribal chicks. The only funny line in this entire piece of @#$% is when the guy tells his airplane driver about his wife.

I have no idea what happens in the last half of the movie. I turned it off and read books and worked puzzles with my son, who I had bought the movie for.My advice is don't buy this movie and instead spend true quality time with your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for children","review":"Violence, foul language, semi nudity/foreplay. This is not appropriate for children. I am surprised it received a PG rating. It should have been at least a PG-13.

That's a shame, for her earlier work is remarkable for its breadth -- she played everything from haughty British girlfriends to wisecracking career women to O'Neill heroines -- and it would be hard to come up with a character more different from Mame Dennis than her taut, vicious Harriet Craig.Less wildly lunatic than Joan Crawford's, Russell's Harriet is a deeply disturbed woman who finds herself no longer able to hide her problems, so tightly wound she seems in danger of shattering. Director Dorothy Arzner marshalls an excellent supporting cast (an unusually warm Billie Burke and the marvelous Jane Darwell among them) to set off Harriet's chill with a lovely suburban normality.All in all, it's a fine introduction to pre-icon Roz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoochie Dance","review":"Nice hard driving bass beat and soulful Bill Coday showing us all, how to do, the Hoochie Dance...Some of his other cd's are better than this one but that is a good song on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"The Aristos is a nonfiction exposition and statement of position on reality, the problems and challenges of humanity and what it means to be human by John Fowles, one of the greatest novelists of the second half of the twentieth century.

It may, however, be a bit daunting for a One-L looking for a text to supplement the casebook, so you might consider using Calamari as your main hornbook.But my personal recommendation is that you buy both if you can; where Calamari is brief, Farnsworth elaborates a great deal and provides plenty of dense, helpful detail.

This system does not include a mask which is one of the things I like best about Proactiv since it seems to clear up bad pimples very quickly.I think that the system is better than just soap-and-water, but it's not the solution I was looking for.

But what I think have seem to work for me over the years is changing the product, if I use something it stops working after a few months, then I have to try something new. A year and half ago I started using birth control pills, which did wonders for my face. My face cleared up a lot. But even using the pill I used to get some breakouts. I tried a lot of products but they seem to work at the beginning and then don't. With this product I don't get many breakouts anymore, and if I do it is one or two small blemishes, but nothing too bad. I think this product compliments what the birth control pill does for my face.

The author does not pretend to be impartial or neutral. He pans many famous authors who he feels are given far too much credit. To my amazement, his treatment of Jane Austen is almost sacrilegious. He claims that all the adulation and praise that has been heaped on her is undeserved and the sooner she is relegated to obscurity the better off readers of the future would be. However, the beautiful illustrations used, the timelines provided and the obvious fun the author had in writing this book is well worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent strap for the fashionable player","review":"I was looking for a neck strap that i could wear with my tuxedo and other dress shirts that was comfortable but also not very visible.

He also describes how to identify women with emotional problems and how to use the phone effectively when talking with women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandpa Goes Gunnin' for the Young Ones!","review":"This elderly author has made a cottage industry out of a very limited number of observations about the dating scene. Most of his few worthy points are lifted out of \\"A Man's Guide to Women\\", which he did not write. Curiously, for all his preaching about being a man, this guy writes under the phony name of R. Don Steele. And he points out late in the book that even he has met with limited success using his strategies and that the young women he does nab dated him usually less than a year. Volume 2 is just a continuation of Vol. 1, no new tips or strategies. His books are surprisingly crude, even considering he is self-published, reading them is like swimming in cement. Combined with his controversial online behavior, the author continously displays a dominating demeanor which wouldn't work on an educated or emotionally healthy young woman.

All useful advice, but I think most men figured out the right attitude during high school. If you are both attracted to each other, the less contact the more the attraction grows. It's the old absence makes the heart fonder maxim. Not much of a revelation there.Where this book fails the worst is the assumption that sex is the main need of males and females after air, water, and food. If that were correct, then the author would not be three times divorced. If you are looking for a book on one night stands or limited relationships for a few months or years, then this book is for you.

It may take at least 5 listens to completely assimilate the songs as they are dissonant and not easy to get into, but if you're patient enough, they will be rewarding.

Think of 'Dimension Hatross' as an equally progressive, thrashier version of 'Nothingface'. I also feel that \\"Dimension Hatross\\" is the more consistent album of the two. With the exception of the humorous throwaway track \\"Batman,\\" every song on here is a classic. When I listen to 'Nothingface', I'm always thrown off a bit by \\"Xray\\" and a few of the later tracks.The only aspect that is lacking in 'Dimension Hatross' is the production.

On the most romantic side, there's \\"Forever in Love\\", and \\"Sentimental\\". There are the vocals by Peabo Bryson and Aaron Neville which are nicely backed by Kenny G. Unlike many instrumentlists, he never tries to take the song away from the vocalist, but rather backs the singer, and adds a little embellishment.This isn't the greatest CD, but it will please the ladies Kenny woos, and all those with an emotional sensitivity, while it irritates his detractors.

I used to follow them and quite enjoy their music from afar. Out of curiosity I set out to buy their Cd and I must say I was left with a good taste in my mouth. Most songs I recognised as having heard before (exept 'notorious', 'serious', and 'all she wants is')All the tunes contained in this cd are so nostalgic and put the eighties in a really good light. One must admit that they where great even if they where heart throbbers! Let us see if Backstreet boys can manage the same in ten years time..... I guess this CD will occupy a lot my cd-player.

It includes from '81's \\"Girls on Film\\" to '97's \\"Electric Barbarella\\". Some songs were edited in this album. I also recomend the other 12 albums, they are all great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding new layers of fond memories","review":"Like most people coming of age in the 1980's I fell in love with Duran Duran. Years later a friend gave me this CD as part of a \\"remember this?\\" gift. I remembered a lot of great things as I listened to the songs over and over but then, for the first time, I really listened to the lyrics and the multi-layered melodies that escaped me when I was younger. They really put a lot into their music and it's worth revisiting. You'll remember a more innocent time in your life and find new meanings to apply to your more hectic, adult life. The video collection is awesome as well. Men in make-up never looked so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Before I bought this CD, I had \\"Decade\\" and when I saw that they had another one out, I bought it and sold the other. I like this one better than \\"Decade\\" because \\"New Moon On Monday\\" was on this CD as well as \\"Electric Barbarella(sic?)\\", which I had only heard on Jay Leno.But there is a little flaw, and that is the fact that the intro to \\"Rio\\" was cut. Other than that, the rest of the CD is okay. I know that some other songs were cut, but I don't notice the difference.All the songs bring back memories of when I heard them when they were hits, especially \\"Hungry Like...\\", and \\"Notorious\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation of Duran Duran's finest!","review":"OK, first of all... Ordinary World is Duran Duran's BEST SONG EVER!!!!!! I take personal offense at anyone who thinks it's bad!That being said, this is a most excellent CD!

Whether you are an 80's music lover or a Duran Duran fan, or you just like good music, you must have this album. It is by far one of the best compilations ever released. You get all Duran Duran's biggest hits in one nice package. To be honest, if you buy Greatest you do not really need any other albums by Duran Duran, you will have their best songs right here. The only other album that you should consider is Rio. I personally think Electric Barbarella is the best song on Greatest (I've never even heard it on the radio,) but all of the songs on here are great!

What could have been an incredible 2-CD collection was shortened to a single CD joke. Not only were great singles omitted (Careless Memories, My own Way, Too much Information, Violence of Summer, Out of My Mind, and others), but some of the best songs they chose were shortened to keep it on 1 CD.

The album itself shines like the sun and should have had been a hit for Dionne, but somehow, the obvious did not materialise. It is sad, not for Dionne, as she makes music as an artiste regardless of its hit potential, but for the listening public to be deprived of some of the coolest and most yuppie styled arrangements in music choices this album has to offer.

However, she mostly lets her interview subjects guide the way; she does great with this style as well.

I thought it was going to be a first hand account of life in Germany during World War II...my latest research fasciantaion. The book is actually stories told to the author and I felt the author spent considerable time complaining that she will carry the stigma that follows many German's after Hitler's atrocities. As I said, not as I expected and was very disappointed in the book. I don't even know if I will be able to give the book away on a book trading site!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already","review":"This book is nothing more than another anti-German hate book ! I am so sick of these pathetic self hating \\"Germans\\". Please explain to me how a young German is responsible for something that happened 30 or 40 years before they were born. WWII has been over for more than fifty years now,isn't it about time we called of the hate war we have been waging against the Germans since 1914 ?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tinstad & Rumbel - beautiful music","review":"I'm a serious fan of Eric Tingstad and Nancy Rumbel, either together or separately. It's what I expect from this duo: intriguing and evocative melodies superbly executed. This is not background music. It demands your attention. Tags often label their music soothing and relaxing, and that's true, but there's also enough lively energy and complexity to be stimulating. I've never been disappointed in any of Eric and Nancy's albums, and I doubt you will be either. It gets 4 instead of 5 stars only because it has no true standout tracks and isn't quite as good as my two favorites: Paradise and Acoustic Garden. *Addition: Leap of Faith is a new one from this \\"dynamic duo\\" which is as good as anything they've done."},{"rating":"2","title":"gigli: from earliest to middle period","review":"Romophone has maintained its excellent standard of transfers with this double album of recs that begin in 1918. A friend of mine says Gigli's tone was the most \\"seductive\\" of all tenors, about which I would have difficulty arguing. The later electrics show the bad side to Gigli's singing, with aspirates at every turn; unnecessary with his abilities and a disgraceful indulgence. However, most folk will not be concerned, concentrating on the honest upfront outpouring. Recommended to newcomers to Gigli as a good cross-section; most fans will already have the contents (though unlikely to be in such balanced transfers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suca Who?","review":"I had never heard of sucanat when I came across this book. I have been trying to cut down on white sugar in my family's diet & until now I have been experimenting with honey.

The interesting thing I discovered is that sucanat was used widely before the commercial refining of white sugar began. This product is much healthier for you & does not contribute to tooth decay like white sugar."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS ALBUM!","review":"After seeing the One Night Only concert on PBS, I knew I had to have this album. It is amazing how good the brothers sound, personally I think they sound better here, than on any other recording I've ever heard. The album is basically a greatest hits compilation, recorded live. There are no misses here, every song is a winner. This album is a 24 song showcase, so the higher cd price is justified. I would have been willing to pay even more for this wonderful collection of songs. On a personal note, if you have never heard the song \\"words\\", you have to listen to it. It is one of my favorite songs of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome album!","review":"I love this album. Anyone who appreciates good music should get it.

Beyond that admiration, I like their music, well, most of it, and this CD is a quick paced movement through a lot of their best stuff. I watched the special on TV a few times, and enjoyed that as well. I finally figured out what they were saying in How Deep Is Your Love!(I still can't belive that Maurice has died.) Although Robyn tends to get on my nerves a bit, Barry is still as fab as ever, with that lions mane and his voice still hanging in there. This is just a fun CD for anyone who likes a bit of easy-listening, a great pick-me-up for the home commute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"I really enjoyed this CD, but when I bought it, I thought I was getting 24 whole songs.

Barry Gibb does not sound as good. The music on this CD was better than the vocals. I only liked 3 out of the 24 songs listed on the CD ( You Should Be Dancing, Night Fever/More Than a Woman, and How Deep is Your Love). Only a true Bee Gee fan would love this CD, but then again, they would love anything the Bee Gees produced.

Casual fans may be tempted to get their 2-disc \\"Greatest Hits\\", which is also amazing, but this 24 track live disc is just as great. Song after song is just classic, and newcomers will probably be suprised by how many hits these guys had. Included is \\"Stayin' Alive\\", \\"To Love Somebody\\", \\"Tragedy\\", and even \\"Grease\\". Plus \\"Islands In The Stream\\", and my favorite \\"(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away\\". This is a perfect example of quality and quantity together in one collection, and it's all live in Las Vegas too. It's a must for any level of fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same stuff, different decade.","review":"For years the Bee Gees have complained that they were unfairly portrayed as \\"just a disco band.\\" How ironic, then, that they should open and close this concert set with \\"You Should Be Dancing,\\" the most blatantly disco song they ever recorded. Most of the rest of the time, they're singing hits from the 1960s and '70s (as they do in every friggin' concert), with only a couple of songs from their latest album, \\"Still Waters.\\" The Bee Gees recorded some of their finest songs in the 1980s and early '90s (\\"You Win Again,\\" \\"E.S.P.,\\" \\"One,\\" \\"Ordinary Lives,\\" \\"The Only Love,\\" \\"Paying the Price of Love,\\" etc.), but you won't find any of them here.

His other client was Darrell Diaz, who's CD, \\"Devotion\\" received lots of airplay on this radio station in 2003, so we were anticipating something of the same. \\"A Little Space\\" debut CD has been out since 2002. The overall engineering of this CD is very good. Unfortunately, many of the tunes on this recording did not reach out and grab me. They seemed to be missing something creatively. According to the artist's profile, their influences were Steely Dan, Al Jarreau and Sting. I didn't hear any of those influences upon listening to this recording. It could have been a much better CD if the producers would have taken chances. I would have liked to hear better arrangements and improvisation on all the tracks. Even the lead singer, Terrell Moran, even though he had a nice voice, seemed to be reserved in his singing. Hopefully, their next effort will be more ambitious and creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible movie!","review":"Don't bother! I am a huge fan of both Stephen Dorff's and Gabrielle Anwar's. But this movie has almost no redeeming qualities. The plot is weak, although at times it shows the potential of some depth. The characters are unbelievable. You have no idea about anyone's motivation... even after the movie has ended. And it is VERY poorly acted. Dorff delivers THE WORST performance of his career. He should have had an accent coach, because his accent was so spotty that I was left wondering whether he was the child that was sent off to America instead of Anwar. I could go on and on about this movie, scene by painful scene, but what's the point. Hardly anyone can find a copy of it, and out of those almost no one watches it. Well, don't break ranks on this one. It's simply not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innocent Lies Review","review":"Brother Loves Sister. Sister kinda seduces Brother. Both hate Mother.

If you can link turns, don't bother. The information is very basic, the production value is low and the pace is almost painfully slow. The instructor uses a \\"graphpaper progression\\" to demonstrate concepts with the snow boarding action figure. They are simple line drawings and the on-screen writing is very difficult to read.

The problem I have with this book how the author judges the movies he presents. Get a copy and read \\"Solomon's\\" description of your favorite movie. It as if he stretches his views and theory's around a movie that just are not there. A case in point is The Great Santini / The Gift of Fury (1979). A coming of age movie with a dedicated Marine Pilot as the father. Gary Solomon treats this movie as Child Abuse. Gary misses the point completely. Once you begin to actually look at the movies he recommends his Prescription falls flat on its face! It is the same self help mumbo jumbo for a buck that hits the book stores every day.

I own more than 50 Sinatra albums, and I can unequivocally say that the Duets I & II albums are the only ones I NEVER LISTEN TO. The version of \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" may be the single worst piece of noise that has ever emerged with Frank's voice on it.

The cover declares it to be a \\"COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCE\\", don't believe it.This book is a very good introduction to web page design, with chapters on Frontpage 98 and Visual Interdev, while IIS installation is relegated to a mere appendix.More than the first half of the book chapters are classed into categories such as \\"Developing Basic Web Site Content\\", etc. , and while it may be useful to many IIS admins who also happen to develop their site.

Not a fan of formulaic romances. But, as other reviewers wrote, Roper deserves much credit for handling beautifully the sensitive issues of AIDS as well as teen pregnancy. She was true to Scripture but also covered it all in grace and love, the perfect example for all believers. Developing the character of an AIDS victim goes a long way to personalizing the issue and avoiding stereotypes.

I wish it was more like the first couple of seasons where Carrie would be really sweet some times and totally explode other times. Kept you guessing. By the time I got to season 4 you knew what was going to happen. Doug was going to do something not so smart, and Carrie was going to Whip him into shape. The only character that continues to be unpredictable in his antics is Artie. You can see seasons one through 4 all in one shot and still not get tired of Jerry Stiller in this role.

This wasn't a blown fuse. The LED lights came on, but nothing worked. I was trying to run a very small vaccuum for a few seconds to clear out the dust before taking inside. It's supposed to shut itself down if overloaded. I think this was the first time I used the outlet.I received a replacement and will be sure to test the outlet right away, and then use it only for small stuff. I had the unit for over a year and used it regularly for inflating car tires. It's slow and loud but it worked well enough. The pressure gauge was even pretty close (1psi high compared to an industrial gauge from Schrader). I have never used it to jump start a car. I'll put on safety glasses if I do..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot fix it !","review":"I bought one of these about a year ago. Did everything I wanted and expected it to do. One minor complaint was it is rather heavy, BUT WORSE NOW is I cannot get a new cable ass'y for this model as it is no longer available. The unit is rendered useless without that cable. The plug in end always seems a bit flimsy, so I always kept it a separate bag rather than have it stick out and get bumped. It finally fell apart and ALL black and decker places have this cable labeled unavailable/ no longer being manufactured no replacement. I just ordered a new model (JUS500IB) with attached and different cables, but if they are just as weak as my old one, it is going back.

NG on air compressor","review":"Ive purchased a number of portable jump start units and they have all worked well for both jumps and aux DC and AC supplies. All of the compressors I have had have failed in the first year or two of useThis includes this unit which has just failed in month 18. There is no support for parts or service I have foundI support four vehicles and boat trailers with it.Ive concluded these air compressors are useful for no more than monthly or even lower duty cycle use.

I've used it for camping and inflating tires and blowup toys. Worked fine for about 6 months then the compressor just quit. Being a tool oriented kind of guy, I took it apart to see what was up. Come to find out, the \\"piston ring\\" that provides the seal for the compressor was only a cheap plastic washer, and had worn out already. After trying in vain to find replacement parts for this thing, I threw it away. Sad to see what B&D has become. I will never buy another of their products again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Product arrived quickly and works like a charm.Only drawback is that it requires an extension cord to charge and the extension cord is NOT provided.

It run my all in one IBM computer for a hour without problem. I also inflated 4 tires from my old van from the ground up . Very convinient because it also shows the pressure.It does not need an adaptor to charge it. So I just plug it every after use.I bought at the same time a Duracel 600 watts with a radio. Flash light did not work from the start.It also need an adaptor to charge it. I like Black and Decker better. I wish they will make it an option for every car just like a second battery on boats.

I have a V8 mustang and it would not jump start it. When I brought it home from the store I fully charged it per the directions. I never once jumped a car from it because it failed every time. So I just used it to pump up tires then, awful expensive tire inflator, but that stopped working about a month after using it. Even when I did inflate tires, it took about 20 minutes to put about 10lbs of pressure into a car tire. I would have gladly taken it back to walmart but I didn't have my receipt. I would never recommend buying this product as it is the most cheaply made jump box I have ever used and has totally turned me off on buying any black and decker products ever. Now I don't even know how to dispose of it as I don't want to just throw it away as it has batteries in it. The worst $100 I have ever spent!! Do not buy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I own a similar device that I purchased at one of the \\"club stores\\" 7+ years ago. It's made by a different manufacturer that has been rock solid and it is slightly bigger (500 amps). I needed another one for my second home and decided to buy this Black & Decker model. It worked great for about a year, and then it stopped holding a charge. It won't run the compressor for more than a few minutes, and it won't even jump-start my 2 cylinder motorcycle or my riding mower.Maybe I got a bad unit, but I wouldn't buy another one of these from Black & Decker. It's total junk compared to the other brand that I own (and the B&D; one wasn't cheap). In general, I just haven't had a lot of good luck with Black & Decker products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Owned it for years: never worked once","review":"I have owned an ElectroMate portable power supply for several years: Over those years, I have used it to try to jump-start 15-20 cars that had dead batteries. In those 15-20 attempts, it literally has never worked once.(Always in mild temperatures, cars that had recently been running.) I was careful to re-charge it after every jump attempt, and to re-charge it after every month or so of non-use. I would even put a date-stamp on it, to be sure that it always had a recent charge. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Today, I took it where it should have gone long ago: To our county recycling facility.I bought a Peak brand power supply for my wife: She has helped dozens of folks with dead batteries, always with 100% success. After we had jumped our neighbors' van several times, we bought them a Peak jump-starter. And (of course) I just bought myself one. So, Black & Decker has absolutely sold us on Peak."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"PIECE OF JUNK DON'T BOTHER, AND YOU HAVE TO PAY TO SHIP IT BACK UPS.

We have a boat and have loaned it out to other boat owners at the lake many many times to jump start their boat. We've used it on a truck twice when we left the interior light on all night. We also use it to air up bike tires. During bad weather (we live in OK) we have used it to power our cable and tv during storms when they knocked out the power to the rest of the house (tornado season). Very useful. I would recommend everyone have one of these. We will probably buy more one for each one of our vehicles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable jump starter","review":"I got this for Christmas and keep it in my car at all times. As a female I like to be safe and know I can easily and independently jump my car if my battery dies any time- day or night. I have a bad habit of leaving my lights on when I park on rainy days. I have been stranded and needed to use this device several times so far and it came through every time. It even jumped my car several times without being recharged which was amazing! Needless to say I had to replace my car battery (which was overdue anyway). But the minute it takes to hook this up and put it back in the trunk sure beats the hour waiting for AAA. You do need an extension cord to recharge it though- a minor sacrifice.

The bad news is that the first one I owned only lasted 7 months, the second one lasted 10 months and the third one lasted 11 months.

For whatever reason, the electrical outlets do not work now. Tried everything.Follow up:Just received my second unit. Charged it 24 hours. Plugged in regular size box fan and the unit's electrical outlet status light starts blinking green and shuts down after less than 2 minutes. Plugged in a small desk top fan and the same thing.

I had been looking around at various replacement options for several months before settling on the VEC026BD. It has the same characteristics and abilities as the one it replaces (including the light and compressor). While clearly this should not be the only option one has for a compressor or power inverter, the VEC026BD does the job it is designed to do. I have not yet had to use it to jump start a vehicle (really - the primary objective). However, based upon the reviews of others, and if one keeps to the plan of keeping the unit sufficiently charged (on A/C charging power at least once a month), the VEC026BD serves a very useful purpose and I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & Decker VEC026BD Electromate 400 Jump-Starter with Built-In Air Compressor","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS IT IS JUNK.

NOT so great for charging your car battery so dont buy it for that reason. I have had several instances where I needed a jump and had to take the charger in the house and charge it up forever. I have left it charging overnight in advance just incase, but that doesnt seem to help it store power. 400 amps just is not enough. There is no reason why this product shouldnt work for my car. I have a 2004 Corolla. Last night I was stranded again because my battery power was low. I had to call AAA. When the guy got to my car he told me my portable charger was a piece of junk. I agreed and will buy a diff one. Preferabley something with 900+ amps. But it charged up my cellphone pretty fast so that I could call AAA. I decided to just buy another one.

I am now searching on amazon for one with higher than 400 power. It would not start my six cylinder engine on my crossfire. I think it will be ok in the other vehicles that have four cylinders. No way this would ever start a V8. It was fully charged just not enough oomph. The K&K; models look interesting but I am not excited about having to tend them while they are charged to prevent damage.

I have a slow leak in a tire that I pump up every week or two with this and I run my 95w laptop off of it every few weeks (it lasts for about 4 hours if I put the laptop on \\"powersaver mode\\").The only problem I have ever had occured just this week. I had to pull out the battery as it wasn't being recharged correctly. I hooked the battery (it's a 19ah battery for those that care) to a proper recharging station and it is fully functional again. I have been very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Air compressor hose is made out of plastic, broke after a few uses","review":"While the battery and jump starting parts of this unit are great, the compressor isn't up to par. The piece at the end of the air hose that attached to the valve on the tire is made out of cheap plastic, which broke right off after using a few times. So now I have to buy a new jumpstarter/compressor, but it won't be this Black & Decker. Oh yeah, why they didn't include a charging cord with this thing is just beyond me. You have to use one of those 5-plug power strips, it's pretty lame and inconvenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought Two!","review":"Had a power outage 1.5 years ago and my old unit died. Went to Home Depot and picked this unit up (last one). Works great! My power goes out frequently but usually for just a few hours so not long enough to start the generator but enough to be annoying. This unit will give you some light, power your cell, charge your laptop, power your modem, for a few hours without the hassle of starting a generator. Why four stars? Competitors now offer a USB port and a radio would be nice (just used this thing during Hurricane Irene and had to have a battery powered radio going to). However after reading reviews on other models this unit seems the best (I could find no other that got 4 stars or more) so I ordered another from Amazon.

The pouring rain continued until about 7AM, and it didn't disintigrate to the point where there was no rubber left, but it wasn't a fun 90 minutes. During this 1.5 hour period, I made up my mind to do research and find the best wiper out there and buy it regardless of cost. I bought these for my accord (different size) and now am buying for my odyssey. It was raining the other day and I was showing these blades off to my brother.

The best part of the book as a whole, as all Londonites will agree, is the simple philisophical dialogue exchanged between characters. For those who are seeking a die-hard, man vs. nature conflict, you still won't be disappointed with the primitiveness of the characters (philisophical, mad, and fanatic) and their interaction with a civilized world that doesn't quite match the truths that they hold to be dear.

As far as the silicone chemical on the blade refill, I did not see any rain drops ROLL OFF the windshield like what others said. Maybe I am doing something wrong.Not going to lie, I am a little disappointed.

He couldn't possibly laugh the way he does in \\"Once in Love With Amy\\" if he wasn't having the best time ever. I'm having a great time too, learning all the words and singing along. I do have favorites and those include \\"All I I Need is the Girl, and \\"Real Live Girl\\", but I've found new favorites in \\"Look to the Rainbow, and But the World Goes 'Round\\", and I thank Barry for giving me these new songs to love. As an added bonus, I work with singers and if I start a song someone around here will sing along with me. This is so joyful it's like champagne bubbles in your blood!My only wish would be that Barry would make \\"Showstoppers II\\" and put in something from \\"The Music Man\\", but I suppose he still has a few hundred favorites of his own that could go in it...sigh.

I love Barry Manilow and think he is a great singer and has great taste in songs. HIs version of where or when is the best by far that I have ever heard! The arrangement is beautiful. It doesn't get better than that. Another standout song is \\"look to the rainbow\\", a beautiful duet, probably Barry Manilow's best duet by far. \\"I'll be seeing you\\", \\"old friends\\", \\"the kid inside\\", \\"Never met a man I didn't like\\", and \\"bring him home\\" are all great songs, which are the kinds of songs we've come to and love by Barry Manilow. Thanks Barry for making old songs fresh and new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insomniac Specials","review":"If you can remain awake through either of these two sleepers, you deserve a medal. These are both painfully slow moving, unfunny, undramatic, and utterly boring movies. Don't let the cheap price fool you, they are over priced at any price.The only reason to buy these movies is if you can't get to sleep, watching either of these will have you snoring in no time at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coming-of-age story","review":"I'm tempted to call this a black coming of age story, but why identify it as such when it's a great book no matter what your ethnicity?Stevie grows up among a lot of political and social change, and the generation gap between how she sees things and how her mother views the white and black line is telling. As she goes through grade school through high school she starts questioning her parents mores, and figuring out how to deal with early encounters with interracial dating....This book is also peppered with great bits of humor, including \\"Growing up reminded me a little bit of Hide and Go Seek. When it was your time to grow up, Nature said \\"Here I come, ready or not.\\" And nature could always find you.\\" This book will tell (remind?) you what it's like being a tomboy..., or first learning what a virgin is. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, true story of a little girl's life","review":"This novel explains what's it's like for a little girl to grow up.

I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days (a first). Every female, especially Black, should read this book. It will make you laugh and cry because of its realism. I could relate completely to her coming-of-age experiences and that made it all the more worthwhile. Although I felt that the ending left the reader out on a limb, I can't wait to get the sequel to clarify what happened to Stevie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I just read \\"Coffee.....\\" recently and it was good. I like the characters and how they were portrayed. Carla,for example,is basically an example of a recent day teen. She does what most teens do today, smoke, have sex, etc. Jean(Stevie), who is the main character, is going through some changes with her mind, sexuality, as well as her body .(What most teens go through.) Stevie goes through a series of scenarios to help her see what her true sexuality is. From a scale of 1-10, I rate this book a 9. The book is good, I kind of didn't like the way it ended, but I would recommend anyone to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"A few months ago, this book was in the news for being banned from the Chicago Public School system. Naturally, being the curious kid I am, I wanted to know why. My mom bought me the book and I couldn't put it down. It's an interesting story of how the main character, Stevie, goes through the trials and tribulations of adolescence on the verge of adulthood. To me, it was akin to Are You There God? It's Me, Maraget (Judy Blume) on a slightly more sophisticated scale. What's more is that the girl lived in Chicago, which added extra personal depth to it. (I live in Chicago too) It is really a wonderful book...but be forwarned- there was a reason why it was banned, as Stevie does experiment throughout the book. It's not very explicit though, and persons (especially girls) over 12 or 13 should enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Novel!","review":"I just happened to stumble upon this novel this morning in the libaray at my school and I can't put it down!

I gave me a lot of insight on how it was to be growing up as a afro-american teenager, or any teenager for that matter, growing up in the 60's and 70's. It discussed issues on sex, sexuality, race, popularity. I think everyone should read the book. We also can't forget how incredibly funny the novel was in it's entirity. So anyone looking into this book should go buy it, sit back relax and enjoy reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enduring Novel!!","review":"Wonderful, wonderful!!! I could not put this book down for one minute; it was so dramatic. Jean \\"Stevie\\" Stevenson happens to be a very naive black girl growing up in the 60's. Friends and sexuality seem to be the top priority among all the kids at this time, but \\"Stevie\\" seems to always be one step behind everyone else. She doesn't even know what a virgin is. Even though she has never had sex, she thinks that she cannot possibly be a virgin because of what she read in the dictionary, 'immaculate, pure'; these were the definitions of the word virgin. She is so naive she thinks that she cannot possibly be one because she doesn't think that she can be 'immaculate and pure'. The book has a lot of 'down home' things that most of us can relate to and feel comfortable with. I wish that everyone could read this book. It is worth it, believe me"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read.","review":"I got this book from the library over a year ago because on the first page Stevie askes her mom \\"What's a Virgin\\" and I thought, well this might be interesting. This book talks about a young girl named Stevie growing up in the 1960s Chicago. She makes a few school friends along the way and at the same time tries to figure her own self out. She hangs out with a variety of different characters. I like this book even more towards the second half when she \\"rebels\\" and grows an afro. Jean \\"Stevie\\" stays true to herself and never tries to be somebody that she's not. She questions her sexuality, some she explores in 'Ain't gonna be the same fool twice' and she has a really cool grandma, didn't care too much for her parents, mom was too old fashioned. I would reccomend this book to anyone really. Race is just as big an issue in this book than lesbianism."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAH-LEASE! What a load of GARBAGE!","review":"When I read this book I was just TOO THREW! I have never read a book so time-wasting. I am in the 8th grade and I could make up a story off the top of my head that's better than the one I read! The plot itself was just ridiculous! And if you want the truth I would rather waste my money on a pinto than to spend it on the book \\"Coffee Will Make You Black\\". Who ever wrote this book was just TRIPPIN!!

If you listen to this tune closely at a loud volume you will really appreciate the genious of Kieth Richards. \\"Gimme-Shelter\\" comes across as a mediocre track that doesn't capture the power that was displayed in the live shows when the Stones played this number. Dave Mathews on \\"Memory Motel\\" shows an unusual twist to a classic tune as does Josh Redman o \\"Waiting On A Friend\\". \\"Live With Me\\" has a different sound on every live recording the Stones have released, you have to appreciate the freshness.

I expected something like that here something different, something new, No Dice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is another huge dissapointment","review":"Now, if you have seen my reviews on Bridges to Babylon, you will realise that I absolutley hate their new tracks. eg Flip the switch. What I hate about this album is the fact the stones have to get other musicians on stage to perform with them. We buy the records to hear the stones, not hear them perform with Dave Matthews, Taj Mahal and Joshua Redman! These people don't deserve to be on stage with the stones. Even the perfrmance is below par, especially Jaggar who's vocals are rapidly decaying. However, there is a high point in this album, and that is the inclusion of gimme shelter, one of their old and best numbers. The album gets 1 star for that and another for still sticking to live music and not quiting. Keep trying boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST IN YEARS!!!!","review":"I was VERY pleased in this CD.

Oh, and terrible, useless maps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not put this down until I was through the entire book","review":"This book is a fast paced story about the life of a man who has nothing but problems in every direction that he turns. I started this book and got through the first 2 chapters and I could not put it down, I even took it to work and read it on my breaks and lunch hours. The main character starts off with a tough life and it only gets tougher as the book goes on. There are a lot of ups and downs that keep you pulled in to the story and you can almost feel as if you are there. I have a feeling a story like this will hit close to home for some. Great read and I think everyone should check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"there are a few minor things that could use improvement, but given that this is the first printing, by the second printing, this book will be awesome. a great story, realistically displaying the trials and tribulations of alcoholism, relationships, and life itself. excellent ending, keeps you hooked and you don't want to put the book down. don't pass this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best $25 I've ever spent","review":"Everyone has done something that they subconsciously know they will regret later. Well, in Mike Lupica's Redzone, Jack Molloy knows that feeling intimately. He has recently sold half of the shares he owns in his family's football team to a self-righteous entrepreneur. With the sell having a negative effect on him in every aspect of his life he commits himself to obtaining his previously owned shares. With that plot the book goes from Las Vegas to the beaches of Florida and contains money, women, scandal and even a mob boss or two to turn it into a great book that you will be unable to put down after the first page. But this book isn't only just a great read it also shows you to always fight for something you want, and that even when all seems lost you can come out victorious. Overall this has been one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read and one of the best $25 I have ever spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your $5.

I chose it because of the larger table surface. A lot of tv tables you see are disappointingly small and not very sturdy either. This tabletop is expansive compared to the norm, the table very sturdy, and the \\"leather\\" top rather rich looking. What was a nice surprise however was that the larger tabletop translated into a nice amount of leg and foot room at the base. It is sometimes awkward and uncomfortable to sit at those smaller tables, and there's much more chance of tipping them or what's on them. If you're using this for eating and tv, there's plenty of plate room with some to spare for the remotes. My husband is very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Construction","review":"I needed a small, easily movable table-like-thing to put my laptop on from time to time. These trays looked great and they are the perfect size.The problem is that they are so poorly made I'm shocked anyone would sell them. Mine fell apart the second day I owned it, but I needed it and just taped it together to keep it working until I could find something better. Then another part of the legs fell apart (I don't know the right terms, but I'll call it the \\"bracer\\" that holds the legs together at the bottom). I taped that together as well, and now have a taped-up, wobbly tray that won't fold up, that'll I'll keep in the closet for emergencies.I think this is the only bad review I've ever written. That how strongly I feel about the quality of these trays. Find something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Our two tables arrived promptly and were packaged well. The tables look great and have ample room for a place setting, beverage, etc. But that's where the good news ends. Both tables have a tendancy to sway and it's a bit like a rough day at sea. If you lift the table to move it, the table promptly goes into the closed position.....that's bad if you have any items on the table. The tables are also heavy and this makes setting them up and putting them away more work than it should be.So shop around and stay away from this manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse purchase ever!","review":"They look good on the internet but upon arrival they refuse to connect.

I've had other covers. If we'd not been so rushed I'd have returned this cover, although there are some good things about it. First the pros. The price was reasonable and I needed it quickly so prime delivery was a big consideration. It seems reasonably well made and was fairly easy to install. It is under warranty for 3 years. We'll have to see how it wears. The cons are as follow. There are no instructions other than the picture on the box. There are velcro tabs on one side that have no reciprocating velcro fastening places anywhere. Although in okay condition, the cover I received had clearly be out of the box, unrolled on grass and weed surface and probably installed on another, dirty 5th wheel before it was shipped to me. There seemed to be pieces missing and there were dirty smudges on the cover. Had I not been pressed by need and time I'd not have accepted this cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chips off within hours","review":"I have used this polish three times now, and each time it starts chipping within hours of application.

However, when we first got the TV, we found that our DVDs would skip at random intervals. I tried to overlook that and just continue using the TV, but last night, we were watching a DVD and the picture froze. I ejected the DVD and tried re-inserting the DVD, and it wouldn't work. I even tried inserting other DVDs and NONE of them are working on this TV. The built-in DVD is SHODDY! I'm returning this TV to Target.

Not even 9 months. And it's not like I used it a lot and abused the TV. Very disappointed - it's not like it's an easy item to carry off to the repair shop or return - and I have to look for the warranty/manufacturer/user guide - anyone like to find that stuff after nine months of placing it in a drawer somewhere at home?The TV itself works fine, although a colleauge at work pointed out that the TV/VCR combos of yesteryear usually worked like this: the VCR gives out, with TV inevitably not too far behind.

These are all good songs, but both The Saint and The Sinner appear on the 2-disc version of In Sides, as does the original version of The Box. This gets 1 star not due to the songs, but because now that the version of In Sides has become the standard (and is freakishly cheap and easy to find), there's really no reason to get this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book, A must read!","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who may not fully understand or are curious about the fundamental Mormon beliefs.

But he seems to grunt and scream his way through, using a terribly scratchy voice that grates through your head, like he's just smoked something particularly rough. He needs to tone down his voice and just rhyme his way through the songs; the only song I greatly liked was Menage' A Trois, and the tune on that was stolen! Buck up your ideas- get off Rap-a-lot and back in The Luniz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the Hype?","review":"What has happened to Yukmouth? He used to be one of the best most underrated West Coast rappers when he was a member of the Luniz? Now a move to Rap-A-Lot and a new (not so new now) double album. This cd falls flat on it's face. I was hyped about picking this one up and I almost threw it out the window driving home. It features Rap-A-Lot's whole family of over hyped gangsta rappers. Let's face it, Rap-A-Lot hasn't turned out much quality material in the past few years, with the glaringly obvious exception of Scarface's classic the Diary. Yuk needs to leave Houston and head back to the bay and get on some of the old Bay Area Funk. He is making the same mistake that E-40 has fallen into in the month's of late. In short this cd is no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"TURN IT OFF!","review":"ok, the first album by THE LUNIZ- Operation Stakola, was the BOMB! but what on earth happened to Yukmouth? on this album, he has the most annoying voice i have ever heard, and all he does is scream, it really sounds sickening. he needs to tone his voice back down to a decent level, call Knumskull & beg to get back as a group, get off RAP-A-LOT, and make some more good old fashioned LUNIZ music!

I'm 30 min in and only see 4 diff families. Well, they've at least put their Thanksgiving turkey in the oven. I'll stick it out for my $2 rental but honestly, I don't see this taking me on any type of culinary adventure to make my mouth water and delight my senses. It just looks like family drama. I'll edit this later if I'm wrong.Good grief.**So I'm back after finishing the movie. A few good looking tables of food is all you'll get here. Weak on food love; heavy on family drama. Because we need more of *that* in our lives and on screen, and not the therapeutic delightfulness of cooking and beauty of food.Foodies need not bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. I went to see it in theaters. Hoping to get an okay movie, and leaving instead with the feeling that I had just seen a really great film that most don't know about. I especially liked how they brought all the different cultures together all for a common purpose, Thanksgiving. Sometimes we get so caught up in things, that we forget to see what's really important. That's what this film is about. And it has a good way of showing that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad . . .","review":"I had been looking forward to seeing this movie as an multi-cultural movie bringing in all the different dynamics of different societies, cultures, and beliefs. In some ways it was that, but unfortunately the makers of this particular movie HAD to bring the overall wholesomeness of the movie down to the ground. It was very down-to-earth, gritty, and crude. The accuracy was there but in my opinion it wasn't worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"an human being","review":"This is the first movie I've ever watched which was bad enough to inspire me to write a negative review. This movie is disturbing, depressing, and socially harmful. It's attempt at portraying various cultures is a good idea. However, in this film it fails these cultures badly. As all cultures have strengths and weaknesses, this film entirely focuses on the negative, without giving any real voice or show of their strength. It does not give the viewer insight into what strengths have brought these families through generations to now. Rather, it even disparages the good in them by flipping social right and wrong. In the end, this movie does not portray the american family. It does however take the viewer on a long grueling tour of the writer/producer's social/political designs. The thought that this movie might have any influence with viewers is indeed disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanksgiving and the Melting Pot ad nauseum","review":"Sorry to say that I was not able to walk out of this film. It isdisturbing to find that people respond positively to a such an on-slaught of racial stereotypes. While starved for stimulating dialogue, I was force-fed ceaseless gorey close-ups of Food Food Food Food, greasy and ill colored.

But contrary to the reviews I read, this soap does not lather up well and did not cause my razor to glide any better then using hand soap. Cheap shaving cream does a better job than this soap.

It takes a new look at what it means to be fantastic and four, and why the original crew is so hard to replace.

The dialouge, humor, familial bond and comradery of the original FF is juxtaposed against the tolerant, mercernary teamwork of the new FF. It shows what the FF could be, why the FF remains what it is today, and entertains at the same time. If you're asking for more in a story, here it is.

The main character is first upset by the incest that was going on with her father and sister, but then is drawn into it in the end. This author should never have been able to publish this book. What is the matter with the publisher allowing this book in print. Any young person reading this may thing incest is a good thing, sexy, and exciting. Shame on the author and publisher both.

The CD is full of variety and mix of styles which can only be accomplished by very skilled musicians. The final cut is a spectacular display of creativity .....giving me the sense of 90's Hendrix feel. I would like to stress the creativity again and again.

It might make a nice souvenir from a local gift shop, but it won't satisfy any serious reader or tackle any of the important questions the story raises. Were any contemporary accounts of the haunting published at or near the time? (Apparently not, unfortunately). Did Andrew Jackson really visit the Bells? What record exists that he did? (In fact, the evidence to substantiate this seems to be lacking). You can find a great deal more hard information on this extraordinary episode on any of several websites. The attempt to link the ultra-colorful and complex personality of the spirit known as Kate to some lights flickering in a cave near the site today is especially dubious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super!","review":"Anyone who has an interest in Tennessee's most famous ghost should check out this book. It takes a long and complicated story and breaks the facts down in a clear and easy to read way. I have read several of Mr. Price's books and this is by far the best. We even get an update of \\"Kate's\\" activities into the 1990's.Is the Bell Witch still in Adams, Tennessee?

On the other hand, if she was too tough for Andy Jackson I might just stay here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surf the Web Instead, Get the Same Info","review":"I was a little let down with the information provided within the book, most of the substance found could be freely discovered just surfing the net. I was seeking inspiration and knowledge on moving my family to Baja or Perth and this book did not do it for me.I gave it two stars because, becuase the book is written for someone who is still working and for some reason has to move his family overseas to keep his career going.This book covers how to explain to little Billy why we are moving away from his friends, how to tell friends goodbye, what to do with aging grand parents.Overall, this book is not for the finical independent person who wants to move his family to another country.

The nation of Colodor, where most of the story takes place, doesn't appear on any map because of a cartographer strike, and has almost no military at all (one character demands \\"Send the entire Colodor Air Force after them! Yes, both planes!\\"). The head of ONI wants Tom Smith, the guy who's substituted for Pedrito Miraflores, to be more of a hellraiser than the meek, proper Navy lieutenant that he is, and gets his wish when Pedrito comes on the scene (\\"Booze! Cigars! Prostitutes! That's my boy!\\"). Meanwhile Tom is getting shot at by angry government officials and angrier women for Pedrito's misdeeds.It's fun, it's funny, and it'll make a great movie (it's the novelization of a screenplay)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious spy story!","review":"I loved this book it was mostly comedic with characters portrayals and scenes that kept me roaring.Based on the premise that the main character who was prim and proper who happened to have a look-alike double raising continual hell and escapades down in South America.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like their other books...","review":"I loaned this book to a friend.

And I'm a big fan of Hubbard's Battlefield Earth and Mission Earth books. I just didn't like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic book! I picked it up and couldn't put it down!","review":"If Amazon had a six star rating I would give it for this book.I read all the bestsellers, but this one stands alone in terms of pure enjoyment and fun. If one is up for an exotic South American spy novel with more twists and turns than a mile of rope, then this is the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ai Ronito! When your intelligence goes wrong!","review":"This book is on the level of a pre-teenie comic book without the cartoons. It is so stupid, that one wonders why Ron Hubbard needed a co-author: to make the book, or to take the blame? If they just labelled it as pre-teenie material per se, like the Hardy Boys, maybe it wouldn't get such a terrible review from me. But this example of vanity publishing by the super rich Hubbard, using his own publishing house, offers it dead pan to all, in competition with writers like Tom Wolfe and Tom Clancy. Forget it. At local bookstores it's discounted 50% and still they can't give it away. WASPs never are exact doubles for Roman Catholic Cubans, by the way. Lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ai, por favor, nada mas de este Pedrito!","review":"This is another example of a failed attempt to modernize an otherwise grossly ignorant story. K. Anderson's attempt to revive this story only served to make it even more stupid. Here we are in the late '90s, and we have this old admiral listening to Lawrence Welk on the radio? I don't think so!The opening paragraphs of the story seemed to have been written by an eight year old: the sentences were clumsy and filled with overblown redundancies. Next, the plot was ridiculous, and the portrayal of just about every spanish person in this novel bordered on loony toon comic book pap, bristling with ignorant racist observations and cliche stereotypes.I really rate this book a big fat zero. If anything, it's a perfect example of vigorous ( in the way that a washing machine is vigorous) art attempting to pass off tripe to the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action and humor!","review":"I really enjoyed this book! I normally don't like to read \\"spy\\" novels, but made an exception because of Hubbard and Anderson. I'm certainly glad that I did. There wasn't all that \\"intelligence\\" agency jargon that is the norm for novels like this. I'd definitely recommend this to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, even if it isnt your type of music, try it!","review":"When i frst heard \\"Every you Every me\\" i thought it was a smashing song, i asked a person who was it by, they told me \\"Placebo\\". I asked what type of music they are, they replied rock/ light? metal, not heavy. As it was rock, i thought i wouldn't like it, but when i borrowed this album off a friend, i was very suprised. There was some great songs, which i didn't get board with listening to them over and over again. But there was some despressing songs on the album, if you listened yo them alone, you might defind them depressing, but i think if i was depressed they would cheer me up, to think placebo are going through the same sort of depression as you.

Everything else here is only somewhat worse. All in all, they show a lot of promise in every area. Realisticly, they've got to improve to make a go of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappoinment","review":"I was seriously let down by this. I thought 'Pure Morning' was great, despite lead singer Brian Molko's grating vocals. Apart from Pure Morning there are really only two other good songs (Every you, every me' and 'The Crawl.' Listening to the whole album is a task, and listening to music should be enjoyable. This certainly is not. Think before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most useless rock band on the planet.","review":"Brian Molko seems to be the biggest whiner in the music business today. Claiming to be alternative, they release this plagiating \\"hard rock\\" with \\"aggressive\\" vocals. Yeah right! Placebo has been 20 times too commercially succesfull, and that rejects both to their music and personalities. I hate'em, truly. Placebo nuoleskelloop' Amazonin ?ijji?."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moody, catchy, overall great","review":"I found this album to be most useful to listen to when I'm feeling either sad, lazy, or annoyed with other people and/or life in general. It has plenty of catchy, bitchy songs that go from moody to thoughtful to sexy and back again. Of course the best cuts are the ones that have already been recommended - \\"Every You Every Me\\", \\"Pure Morning,\\" \\"My Sweet Prince,\\" \\"Without You I'm Nothing.\\" However, I very much enjoyed \\"The Crawl,\\" which sounds really twisted and mystical in the best possible way, and also \\"Burger Queen,\\" which is much lighter than the rest of the album and probably the most pop-like. In conclusion: This album *is* derivative of many other sounds (I agree with the reviewer who said Placebo is ripping off The Cure and David Bowie) but it still manages to create several interesting and provocative songs. If like your hard rock served up a little edgy and sophisticated, buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLACEBO, POSITIVELY PURE TALENT","review":"WITHOUT YOU I'M NOTHING IS ONE OF THE BEST CDS I'VE EVER HEARD. IT'S TOO BAD RADIO AND MTV HAVE IGNORED THE BEST BAND ON THE PLANET, BUT HOPEFULLY THE AMERICAN MEDIA OUTLETS WILL EVENTUALLY GET IT.

Ok, good album but not that good to deserve 5 stars. (apetite for destruction deserves it though)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's I've ever heard","review":"It's not every day a band like Placebo comes along. Brian Molko's voice alone is enough to make this CD a masterpiece, couple that with their musical talent, and you got something great. This album starts off strong with \\"Pure Morning\\" and keeps going, sometimes faster with tracks like \\"Every You Every Me\\"(my personal favorite) and \\"Scared of Girls\\", sometimes slower with songs like the title track and \\"Allergic(to thoughts of Mother Earth)\\", but always a great ride through despair, lonliness, and hurt, but it's not depressing. That's the great thing about it. If you only buy one CD this year, make it this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't know Placebo? Buy this album and become a fan","review":"'Every You, Every Me' was the first song I hear from Placebo, and I instantly love it, it's very catchy. Then I bought the album and after a couple of listenings, I felt in love with it.All the songs are great, but I love the title track 'Without you I'm nothing' which I think is a great, great song. I also like a lot 'Pure morning', 'The crawl', 'Summer's gone' and of course 'Every you, every me'.I think this is the best album to start listening to Placebo, and then get into it more deeply with the debut album, then 'Black Market Music' and finally 'Sleeping with ghosts' (whick I think is the worst Placebo album, although is a good one).Awesome album. Well deserved 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's hard to describe such a CD with so few words","review":"A truely lovely CD. A definate must for anyone who liked Placebo's first CD. Molko's voice is truely unique, though some may find it a bit nasaly. All the songs are very strong and the hidden track at the end is a strange one, with words taken right form Brian's answering machine.I recently dropped this CD on accident and put a huge crack down the middle and I'm missing it so much I'm definatly going to have to buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most darkly pleasing CD I've bought all year!","review":"People will try to put this recording into all sorts of categories. Ignore them all, this is the most intriguing band I've heard for some time. It is darkly beautiful in the same way as the best Jane's Addiction or Bauhaus songs. Anybody who says this band sounds like rush is an idiot who couldn't think of any other man with a high pitched voice. Placebo is a remarkably versatile band that can run the whole range(from sad slow songs to hardcore thrash), while never losing sight of the albums theme. There is no comparison between Placebo and the fluff that American radio stations try to sell as new rock. Buy this album! You will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a good record","review":"Placebo. Awesome, well-balanced... sound. Never boring. Mental food. Brain food. Physical food. So timeless. So cool. So fashion. So deep. I don't care. Strange. Listen. Weird. Oh Dandy. Vivid. Beau. Gallant.It's zen. 4 sure.Without Placebo I'm nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Bad Track","review":"I'd like to give this album five stars, but you have to leave some room for improvement - not that I know how the tracks could be improved. This music is so rocking that it would make you attempt to pogo while driving your car - and even an accident won't stop you if the tape player still works and you still have legs. And there's tunes and weird lyrics as well. What more can you ask?[Two years later] Actually, there were a couple bad tracks, and a couple of mediocre ones. But the core of the album is still solid and still rocking. The album still deserves four stars, only now I don't think that's underrating it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the most fascinating album of the year","review":"Beautiful, unique, and all-around fascinating, Placebo combine several great artists to make a glamerous sophmore album. The lyrics are brilliant, honest, erotic, and sometimes undescribable. If you buy this CD, be sure to listen to the horrorfying 8-minute hidden track!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadder and More Depressing than Debut","review":"\\"Without You I'm Nothing\\" is the follow-up to placebo's self-titled debut album. The general feeling of the album is gloomy and depressed, which differs from the debut - which was filled with teenage lust and sexual energy.The highlight of this album have to \\"Every You Every Me\\", which also appears on the soundtrack Cruel Intentions. This track is catchy lyrically and is acoustically driven.Over tracks to look out for, besides the singles, include \\"Allergic\\" - a catchy and meaningful track, with many memorable lines, and \\"Scared of Girls\\", a powerful song which deals with male sexuality. The album also contains some ballads which are ultra sad and at time very depressing, such as \\"The Crawl\\", \\"Sweet Prince\\", \\"Ask For Answers\\" and \\"Summer's Gone\\". The title track \\"Without You I'm Nothing\\" is one of the singles to lookout for with the build up of lyrics and musics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A non sequitor","review":"I have to admit, usually I don't like Music to Kill Yourself By. Which is exactly what this is. I probably wouldn't have even got the album, except I was \\"tricked,\\" in a way.Hearing Pure Morning on the radio, I liked the song, and downloaded the mp3. It was to bad, though, as napster didn't have any of the other songs for me to hear. In the end though, with the enthusiastic reviews of Amazon.com, I took a gamble, bought the album, and was immediately disgusted that is was Music to Kill Yourself By.However, it grew on me fast. The lyrics are well-thought out, and the bass guitar is always memorable. Now, it's one of my favorite albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST PLACEBO ALBUM SO FAR!!!","review":"This is my favorite Placebo album to date. I have all of their albums, including Meds, but I am still pulled toward this one. Probably because it's more melancholy and still not too poppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"visionary soundscapes","review":"Some bands are simply so far out there in terms of combining what we love from so many genres of music then elevating all of it to all time highs.Placebo is in a league all their own: deftly coalescing powerful vocals with soaring guitars, thunderous beats and ultra-hypnotic grooves. Addictively enjoyable rock worth returning to time and time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good resource with many gaps","review":"This is a great resource in a broad sense.

I have a bad SI/hip joint so I was excited about the prospect of new things to come. I was very disappointed when flipping through. I am a grown-up so I didn't need the Sex Ed class anatomy drawings. The few positions (6 I think) illustrated were like...DUH. There is allot of psycho-babble about the mental effects of disabilities, and education on STD's and other superfluous information. To call this the \\"Ultimate Guide\\" is not just stretching the truth, it's ludicrous. If you still struggle with accepting your disability and limitations, you might get something out of this. Otherwise, look elsewhere. Still trying to find a position book that doesn't require you to be a gymnast."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am still reading the book....","review":"I am still reading this book, but so far it has been very informative. I strongly recommend this book for people with physical disabilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD--Not one weak track!","review":"With a mix of ballads and high-energy tracks, this CD has everything you want.

Michelle Wright has great range and really pours her heart into every song she sings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Best","review":"I believe this to be this Canadian country artist's best album.

Even includes the 87 Intoxicated Mix of \\"Prisoner To Desire\\" among other gems.Here you get industrial, trance, and some cool alternative dance pop mixes, as well as the compilation \\"Misguided Angels\\" with 80s hits and more.If you like Synthpop groups such as Pet Shop Boys, listen to \\"Memento\\".There's everything a fan of synth music could wish for.Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye Horses off key","review":"This is okay for trance, but by all means, do not buy this for the Goodbye Horses song that you loved in Silence of the Lambs.

If I could do it over again I would have saved myself the $26 I spent on it and used Google to find different graphic organizers.

Nelson is terrific at creating dangerous madmen, and the characters in Pirate Round are beleivable and terrifying. This is real edge of the seat writing, with the usual atention to historical detail and the kind of sea writing that can onlycome from a former blue water sailor. A great book, you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pirate Round","review":"This book is part of a trilogy - though I found it difficult to determine in what order the three books were published. The Pirate Round is the third (I think) but I found it wasn't off putting to read the third of the three, first.The book actually grew on me. The author can tell an interesting story and, early 18th century piracy is an interesting subject for sure. The sailing scenes are realistic and the character development above average. Dialog is fast paced. In all - a good, fast read. I read it largely while sitting at a beach and struggled to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nail biter","review":"This was a book that couldn't be put down once you opened it. Marlow and Elizabeth made a very strong pair. Nelson should have found some way to continue the story. Three books in the series were to short."},{"rating":"1","title":"gay themes are well-meaning, but not believable","review":"This novel is essentially a very long episode of 'Law & Order: SVU' that relies on plot twists that do not feel organic to the story or characters. The most annoying element to me is the various diary entries of the gay male murder victim, which seem gracelessly inserted to humanize the victim and encourage tolerance for gay people in general. These diary entries are unconvincing; they are in the voice of an afterschool special instead of a gay man in a large city.I assume the author is straight, and that an antigay hate crime is used in this book of the series much as it is in an episode of a television crime procedural series: a fresh framework for a standard murder mystery. Regardless of his own sexuality, he has not written a believable gay character or even a believable gay milieu. Any remaining pro-gay goodwill is undermined by the plot twists, because of course the crime is not what it seems."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good and entertaining read","review":"This book by Bernhardt is exceptional. The characters we have come to know and enjoy and the usual interesting and compelling plot.

It not only contains intimate information on VanGogh's work in drawing,but has this explicit information about the craft of the books. He had a compartment in the rear of the book to keep notes.Of all of the books I own on sketchbooks this book is the most valuable.It shows how valuable sketchbooks were to an artist that seemed as though he would never master the basics of drawing . But, became one of the greatest draftsman of all time.The modest price on this book is money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real life situations.","review":"This book is worth reading for anyone wanting to get an inside view of what really goes on in this business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pediatric Neurology for the House Officer","review":"Lots of unexpected writing and underlining in the book.

I bought the CD because I saw a program on PBS which I thought was excellant. Although it has beautiful music I would have preferred to hear the voice of Michael Junior to a greater degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Pabulum for the Masses","review":"The only reason I'm buying this CD is because my grandmother asked for it. But this is one more example of the type schlock that PBS has been peddling as art during the past few years. This kid ranks right up there with Helmut Lotti, Andre Liue, Charlotte Chruch and others who are granted way too much air time on PBS in place of far more deserving and far more talented artists. I now believe that Newt Gingrich was right--I don't want my tax dollars supporting PBS so they can broadcast the television equivilent of Jell-o."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossover Album","review":"I've only recently discovered the delights of Michael Junior's album Dreamland, via Amazon.com, as he sadly is not very well known in the UK. What a pity! Because anyone who enjoys the unaffected and powerful voice of a boy 'pop come easy listening' crossover genre recording... will be missing out not buying this CD.I love the title track Il Mondo, even though as with all the non English songs on here I haven't got the faintest idea what the translation into English means. With a an enjoyable offering like this though, the lack of fully comprehending the language comes second place to the sheer spontanaity that is apparent in young Michael's voice. He may perhaps lack quite the control that by comparism Billy Gilman displays in all his recordings, but Dreamland is still comparable to Mr Gilman's albums in it's charm, and the musical ability on show here..with a fine and certainly strong treble voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words cannot describe this.....","review":"This artist has an unusually wonderful voice....haunting in an innocent way.

Probably mostly my fault for not reading some fine print or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great book!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed every page of Nashville Gold. From the very beginning, the author had me hooked. Being from Texas, this book really touched me the way the author described the beautiful Texas Hill Country, the horseracing scene, and while I don't personally know too much about the country music industry, it was clear the author does! The characters were so believable and so real, I was very attached to them (the good guys at least!) by the end of the book and really hated to see the book end! I hope there's going to be a follow up to Nashville Gold because I wasn't through reading when the book was over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Fun & Entertainment!!","review":"A MUST read! The characters are so well written it's as if they are real, rather than fiction. The author describes in vivid detail the area of Texas which I grew up & I can still see now through the vision of his writing. I tried repeatedly to put the book down, but was unable to lose the grip which was necessary to keep it from slipping from my hands in between the hysterical laughter and sobbing tears.Definitely a book that will make you fall in love with the characters, their stories, and the wonderful Texas ways of life.I can't wait for a sequel! I will be standing in line to buy copies for everyone I know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Air locks, work well","review":"These are your STD airlocks, good for all 5-6.5 gallon carboys. They work.

I have several of these and they are an integral part of my brewing process."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best airlock I've tried","review":"These are a very effective airlock. You can install it and then poor in the vodka,iodine water or whatever you want to use (don't use chlorine water) and away you go. The best part about these is that they are EASY to clean. The S shaped airlocks are too difficult to clean (re impossible). The only negative is that the S shaped airlocks are slightly easier to see the bubbling action coming through them. So bottom line for me is that if money is no object, you might consider the S shaped airlocks if you want to see the action better, but you need to throw out after each use in my opinion. And if like me, you replace airlock with a clean one about 5x with each batch, then you see the ridiculousness of S shaped airlocks. If you want to reuse the airlocks, then these are the way to go. I put only four stars because the bubbling action is a little harder to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"just got it and seems to be a good product, only gave it a 4/5 because one of them was brooken but for 2$ for 3 still more than i need"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality Airlock","review":"Good quality.

And here's the kicker - it was RIPPED! Had two large \\"snags\\" on the back of the dress. I'm sending it back and they BETTER not try to charge me shipping. I'm PO'd to the max and who knows if I'll find a dress in time. Grrrr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Company!","review":"After I FINALLY recieved my dress it was BEAUTIFUL until I seen the \\"run\\" in it all the way from the hip to the hem line!

So now Im stuck with no dress or money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing isn't accurate or anywhere close to common sizing","review":"This dress is cute in the picture... but pretty thin and flimsy - so if it doesn't fit right it comes off looking very, well, I don't think I can say the word on this forum. I looked at the sizing chart before ordering, but it still was very snug and didn't lay right. If you have anything over an A or B cup - forget it! Also, the underlayer doesn't come down to the bottom of the sheer layer on top - it stops 6 or 8 inches short... making it look less classy than trashy. I returned it... a cute dress doesn't do any good if you can't wear it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"how many harvard med school grads write books like this?","review":"Dr. McCarthy has added to the somewhat tiresome tradition of Harvard Medical School confessionals. I read this book at the end of my second year of medical school (no, not harvard, thank you!) and found her stories hum-drum at best, pedantic, preachy, and underhandedly self-congratulatory at worst. In addition, Dr. McCarthy's editor clearly rushed through this one - there are numerous instances of convoluted grammer that detract from the flow of the prose. So in summary: if you're a premedical/medical student or a doc, just keep your eyes and ears open and you'll collect lots more meaningful experiences than this book could ever give you; and if you're one of those lay people who likes to life the medical life vicariously, put down this book and spend some time volunteering at your local hospital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item received in time","review":"The material, specially the Clips are so low in Quality, it does not hold at all. Cost me $17 including the shipping. Does not worth $3. Some time Things are not good as it looks in the Picture. I do not know what part of this item is made in the US. I learned my lesson. Do not buy things those are not 100% guaranteed for full refund if sot satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto","review":"I have had the same problems with the Hunter 27182 control-ie. broken knobs on the slider after very little use. I even went and bought another unit and replaced the one with the broken slider knobs. I have three units and they have all had the same problems. Now the plastic neck that the knob attaches to has partially broken off the newest unit. I read a review on this site which listed the number to call for customer service and they are sending me new knobs and one new unit. I explained to the representative that the knobs and the slider assembly should be made stronger which could easily be done. She said that she had never heard of any other complaints which I find hard to believe and I referred her to this site so the company may get the message. The knob that broke yesterday was lying on the floor of the bedroom and it worried me that a small grandchild could get it caught in his/her throat. Hopefully, the company will fix the problem ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design","review":"The website made me give it at least one star, but no stars is my real rating. The knobs fell off after two months and the slides got so sticky it was hard to operate after six months (yes we actually used is knobless for a while). We replaced it with a new one and again the knobs fell off after two months. We're still using it, but just like the other one it's getting sticky. BTW, we're using a spray lubricant rated for electrical applications, but it's still getting progressively stickier. Hunter is willing to send new knobs, and even a new control, but they don't seem interested in improving the product. After two lemons in a row, I'd rather get a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Necessary evil.

BIG mistake! The tiny plastic knobs began breaking almost immediately, and we don't use them that much. After 2 years all 3 plastic fan controls are broken, and 1 light control. This is a nice idea but too poorly designed to work in the real world. Sorry Hunter, you did a lousy job on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Knobs Break Quickly","review":"Buyer beware. Purchased four of these for my new home build. Within one year they had all experienced the same problem, broken sliders. The cheap plastic just cannot stand usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky and Junky","review":"As others have said, this switch is a real piece of junk. Not too long after I installed it, the little knob on the fan speed slider broke. Now practically every time we try to use it, it falls off onto the floor and we have to go chase after it and then hope we can get it back on then hope it will stay on.Even worse that that, though is the super cheap clunky switch on the inside. I don't even think it's possible to slide the switch and land on the right notch the first time. Invariably you will overshoot or undershoot the notch and have to jiggle it into place (that is if the knob you're trying to hold onto doesn't fall off onto the floor.)Avoid this piece of junk. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I have had to replace 4 of these controllers over and over because the knobs and sliders break with normal use. In ten years, I have replaced them each three times.I spoke with Hunter Customer Service rep who told me that the replacement knobs are $1.08 apiece plus $8.99 shipping. That seems excessive for a couple of pieces of plastic that weigh almost nothing. This was after I had explained that I have replaced each of the controller repeatedly because the knobs and sliders break after a couple of years of use. The knobs are not available through normal retail outlets so you only choice is to replace the whole controller. They do not stand behind this product and know all about the issues.Do not buy these....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just replaced my second Hunter switch","review":"I just replaced the second switch in 3 years.

Eventually I will wind up replacing both of these switches due to this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior design and quality","review":"I bought three of these switches and the sliding knobs have broken off on all three switches - some within a couple of weeks of installation.

VERY POOR quality from Hunter - love their fans but these switches are cheap, replaced them all with slide switches from Home Depot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment!","review":"We made the mistake of purchasing these sliding switches for almost every room of our house. The plastic sliding knobs have broken or cracked on nearly every switch. When paying high dollar prices, I expect quality. Hunter has really disappointed me with this item. I have looked and asked for replacement knobs in every store and online and have had no luck. Seems like Hunter may have put themselves in a position to at least sell replacement knobs, but they have failed me again. I wouldn't buy these again, and I would never recommend them.

Prior to the electrical inspection, one of the slide tabs broke. Since being in the home, I have had to replace two more of these switches as the sliding tabs are too fragile and spaced so closely together it makes it difficult to only select one function. This product is not worth its price unless you intend to be replacing it frequently. Three out of five switches defective within three months time is simply unacceptable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be better","review":"I have had the same problem with the slide button breaking.

If it only cost a buck-fifty I could maybe understand the quality not being the best; however, the price for this is tantamount to consumer rape! I replaced the old remote control push button which had finally died after 12 years of use with this switch, and in less than 5 weeks the fan slider broke inside not allowing the fan to be switched off. And yes, I was being gentle with it; I wasn't tearing into it like Mike Tyson ripping into Evander Holyfields ear! Be warned! This switch is NOT going to last past a year. You will be lucky to get 6 months before it starts to break.

Boothe is more famous for a kind of sappy lovers style. That stuff is OK, but nothing compared to when Ken cranks up and belts out, \\"Then take off these chains, from off our feet!\\" The rest of this CD couldn't possibly measure up, but it's mostly in a rougher style than his other albums.

I think this makes all the difference, and really changes it to a meal instead of a side dish.This was one of the first meals that I could make that my daughter would scarf down when she was starting on solids.

I can't imagine why they made the choice not to put them at least in a sealed plastic bag inside the package. Plain noodles are ok, they're completely dry, but this product was seasoned. For this reason I'd never buy them again. Bugs took good 2 months to get rid of, extremely annoying in a completely bug-free home. Now I understand why all seasoned noodles come in plastic packaging.

But for me, the real bonus is that it's the only way to get a hold of \\"Watertown,\\" Sinatra's 1970 concept album about a small town father pining for the woman he lost. While the arrangements are straight from the So-Cal Mellow Rock School of the 70s (strings, acoustic guitars, bad drumming), Sinatra's in great voice, and the overall theme of love and loss eventually wins you over in some way. Certainly a unique chapter in Sinatra's varied career.

Well I guess it does not since 'body and soul' was just released some time ago from 1984 on a separate cd. Also the recording of mack the knife is from the original la is my lady cd yet the 4 cd, reprise collection set, has the alternate 1986 recording which is not on this set. Could there still be other recordings out there yet to be released? Maybe but how can you call this the complete recordings if it does not have everything.

I even like the silly songs, like \\"Everybody's Twistin\\" which sounds SO early 60s that it made me laugh.But am I the only person who is put off by the fact that these songs are not arranged in album order? Let's face it, Sinatra was a master of the LP format, putting together songs chosen particularly for a certain order. I doubt that anyone on the planet cares about hearing the songs grouped by recording date; we want to hear the songs recorded by album, with the other songs thrown in as well. Why can't I hear September of My Years the way it was intended to be?Listing the albums by Reprise number seems silly as well, since it appears in the picture and listing of the albums that Sinatra '65 was released right before LA is my Lady (1984).Does anyone agree with me??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to Deliver: Too Light","review":"I was very disapointed in this album.I had expected darker and hearty tracks on the level of \\"Panzer Mensch,\\" \\"Metalhammer,\\" and \\"Silver Century.\\"Instead, I was greeted with some of the most sickeningly-sweet junk I have ever had the displeasure of hearing. \\"Sweety Sweety\\" and \\"Movie Star\\" were by far the wort offenders.If you like sappy music, by all means, buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on soccer ever written","review":"This is not only a must read for all soccer lovers, but all literature lovers.

An interesting idea for a film if the producers would've paid for a good scriptwriter, but they didn't. Yawn. Let me know when Paz Vega learns how to speak English - she looks great but she has such a thick Spanish accent that I cannot understand her when she speaks English - maybe subtitles would help.Again - avoid all films produced by First Look Pictures. You can tell these films by the cheap graphics at the very beginning. Maybe these are films made by film school students where the name actors donate their time for tax deductions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ends ear odor and itchiness","review":"No more bothersome itchy ears and no more odor.

I basically just pour a bit of it on the cotton balls and then rub the animals' ears carefully. All three animals tolerate it fine (the dog took some training and the guinea pigs don't seem to mind at all) and it is amazing how much comes off on the cotton balls. The smell is not very strong. A little goes a long way. Although I've used it several times, I have quite a bit left over. If nothing changes, I'll keep reordering.

That was the first clue that this was an inferior product, but since it had already been installed there was no chance of returning it and I figured I would just deal with it.When my Jeep would not start in March 2012 and left me stranded, troubleshooting indicated the fuel pump was the cause.The only good thing about this pump was the lesson I learned - if the fuel pump is in the tank, buy a name-brand or OEM pump when replacing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Richard and Karen's nostalgia craze","review":"Apart from the gigantic hit Yesterday Once More,this set pretty much misses the mark. Karen and Richard's attempt to include a nostialgic 50s and 60s medley that nearly occupies one third of the disc indicates that there wasn't substantial material to begin with.Sing,Heather,This Masquerade,Jambalaya etc. all sound average and without any real substance when compared to Yesterday...which by it's self is a true masterpiece and probably their biggest worldwide hit.True Karen's beautiful vocal chords are angelic and clear ,while Richard's prodution skills are outstanding in their own right.Yet this album 's lightweight nature as compared to previous releases would deter any true music buyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Peak Continues","review":"With this 1973 release, the Carpenters managed to hang on to the peak of their career. This album spawned two hit singles, \\"Sing\\" (#3), and \\"Yesterday Once More\\" (#2). Even though there are only two big songs, \\"This Masquerade\\" is a masterpiece and is one of their greatest hits although not released as a single. \\"Jambalaya\\" is fun, and was a hit song in the U.K. The second half of this CD is an oldies medley that serves to reveal just how awesome Karen's voice really is. Her vocals on \\"The End of the World\\" and \\"Johnny Angel\\" make the originals pale! Masterfully done, this album is worth the cost for any music fan of the 1960's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun fun fun","review":"What a fun album! While \\"Sing\\" is one of the few Carpenters' songs I really don't care much for, the others more than make up for it. \\"This Masquerade\\" absolutely soars. \\"Jambalaya\\" is catchy, and \\"Yesterday Once More\\" is a keeper. The oldies medley is great. Karen will break your heart singing \\"The End of the World\\".By the way, \\"I Can't Make Music\\" is a hard song for me to listen to. In my opinion, it's the most haunting, disturbing lyric Karen ever sang. It gives me goose bumps every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carpenters Now And Then","review":"I'm a closet Carpenters fan.

None of this footage was meant to be serious, at all. Just a low-budgeted flick with intentional wack/funny sense of humor. Nothing serious. I dont see the reason in acting like its 'destroying' youth and that bs. Its just a movie. If youre a REAL Camron fan, youd know this movie was STRICTLY made for entertainment like most of Camrons albums. The highlight of this was the intro of him pissing on one of his partners for not paying up the money he owed him and said 'No homo, no homo' throughout that whole scene. Its an awkward-hilarious comedy, and he was able to pull it off very well with intent.Note: If you are a viewer that takes movies way too seriously, then step away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killa Whack","review":"This is horrible Cam is a very bad actor especially when his niece gets shot and he is crying and freakin out.It looks like a low budget film bad acting throughout the entire movie,the music disc is good but this crack is bad bad bad.Do not waste your precious time even if you like Dipset this movie is not any good.Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was this niggah smokin","review":"i think cam was smoking when he made this bull.the move was jus horrible bad acting bad screenplay he need to stop this madness thinkin he better than jay-z this dude should been tappin into the bootleg market wit this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok I'm done!","review":"Camron is the worst rapper/actor next to Nelly.

I could see him doing more movies....and then I saw Killa Season.....this was a terrible attempt at a movie. You would think with Dame Dash in his camp, he could have produced a better flick.

Mr. Giles' charater goes from Flea to Cam then back to Flea constantly. That's unaccetable, especially since he spliced in real footage of him playing basketball. I think he should've kept it purely fiction because of all the bodies he caught. Some segments were cool, like Flex's comedy and the Spanish girls transporting drugs, but that's about all she wrote. The shootout scene is barely so-so, and the ridiculous, nonsensical violence makes an already-weak story straight-up lame.

I like Cam in music, but in doin' film, leave it to the pros, dwag...or put much more money in your film budget, because there was so many errors and mistakes in this movie, that it took me four days to watch it.

That's the album that immediately caught my interest in Sarah's music. Then, I also got Surfacing which I think, while a good cd, doesn't live up to the level of \\"Fumbling.\\" I definitely consider myself a fan of hers, but I recently bought \\"Solace\\" after reading the reviews here on Amazon, and am disappointed in the album. It is not nearly as catchy and as immediately likeable as some of her other albums. Having listened to it several times, I still find myself trying to get drawn into the music more. Perhaps with more listening, it'll \\"grow\\" on me. However, I enjoy a more accessable type of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best Stuff","review":"I found myself listening for 30 seconds to each song and then skipping it. It's nothing new. It's not that it's a bad CD, it's just not very good. The songs are a little more fast paced and \\"pop-ish.\\" Overall, the CD is a departure from her typical style. I felt kind of like I had put 50 cents in the soda machine for a Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper came out instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"Nothing but garbage, pure and simple! She sounds worse than a road-kill cat gasping for air! Just plain awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty voice but nothing here whatsoever.","review":"It's a good album to listen to while cleaning your apartment. Save your money. Assuming your time is valuable don't bother listening to it. It would be a complete and total waste of time. Sarah proves again that she has some powerful pipes but so what? At least \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" has \\"Possession\\" and a couple of other songs which have hooks. You get the picture that Sarah was under pressure from the record company and just cranked out some songs with no hit potential and nothing really for the concentrating listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying for all of her fans","review":"Recorded and released before the breakthrough \\"Fumbling\\" album, Solace provides listeners with ample evidence of her musical strength and songwriting ability--already in full bloom. A lot of the same themes which run through her other albums--love, pain, coping, etc.--appear here, along with the variety of song styles (bluesy, ballads, rollicking pop) we've come to expect from a talented young musician who loves to experiment."},{"rating":"2","title":"mesmerizing","review":"Although I'm a teenager, Sarah Mclachlan's voice is breath-taking.And her talent is impressive. Her lyrics express her talent as a poet. Her voice reaches the high and low notes with ease. Sarah showed her extreme talent with \\"Mercy\\". Doing both the lead, and background vocals. This cd is the foundation of her later works. She's a Goddess when it comes to music."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring, amazing, a must-have","review":"This CD is absolutely breathtaking. I have Sarah's Mirrorball, Surfacing, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, Freedom Sessions, and now Solace. Into the Fire, the most upbeat track, is my personal fave. Terms is a great musical composition, and Drawn to the Rhythm is hopelessly addicting. I recommend Solace for any musicians. And fellow hardcore Sarah fans, get this one- you won't regret it! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Add This to the Oldie But Goodie List","review":"This may be an older and less known one of her works (well, at this point maybe it's pointless to say that any of her works are \\"not known!\\"), but it doesn't mean it's inferior in any way, shape, form, or fashion. Sarah is just as stunning on this record as in all the rest of her work. While her first album, Touch, was a little rough around the edges, she has really honed her sound and craft by this release.The first 4 songs are exceptionally brilliant. Not only the sound, but lyrically she is at the top of her game. Such a soulful tone and you can almost see the small sigh in her eyes just listening to them. But don't stop there, the rest of the cd is a gem as well. If you didn't come on board till her later works, don't concern yourself at all with spending some money on this one. You will be satisfied. Two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not appreciated enough","review":"Out of all Sarah's cds this is the one I think is most often overlooked but it shouldn't be. This is a fine cd and one of my favorites. I'll admit while I owned it, it was a while before I really got into it but it has since become one of my favorites.This cd is Sarah's second after her debut. It shows her strengths as a masterful songwriter in addition to her uncanny sense of melody. The lyrics are deep and introspective, often dark and filled with imagery. Lighter tracks like \\"Into the Fire\\" contrast well with the darker \\"Mercy\\" and \\"Black\\" and sorrowful tracks like \\"The Path of Thorns\\" and \\"I Will Not Forget You\\" add to the depth of the cd. \\"Mercy\\" in particular, while incredibly depressing, really stands out as it showcases the immense power of her voice.Many consider her third cd \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" to be her best but this is still excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could you not like this cd?","review":"Fumbling this, fumbling that. Maybe if you people would look past \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" and stop comparing it to her other work, you'd enjoy it. \\"Solace\\", like my favorite album \\"Surfacing\\", is dark and emotional, and displays her beautiful vocals (anyone would be crazy to not think she sings beautifully). Stand-out tracks are \\"Drawn to the Rhythm\\", \\"Path of Thorns\\" and \\"Black\\". So just look past FTE and here you will find a beautiful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Music Goddess....","review":"Sarah McLachlan has to be the best singer of all time (YES, this includes both male and female alike). I consider myself to have a refind taste in music. I love the songs on this C.D., especially \\"Black\\", which has a dreamy, dark tone, later noticed in her later C.D.'s. I also love \\"Into The Fire\\" its ethereal tone is almost unearthly to me. It is unlike any music to me.It was this reason for which I chose to get this C.D. I love also \\"Back Door Man\\" which is unusually hard for her usually ethereal C.D.'s. I seem to find myself liking each song more than others each week, this C.D. will NOT bore you ever!!!P.S.Sarah if you happen upon this, thank-you for your wonderful music, keep up!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare gem that shows Sarah McLachlan at her finest","review":"I had been introduced to McLachlan's music through \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" and after buying \\"The Freedom Sessions\\" and \\"Surfacing\\" was looking to see if she had anything else. I picked up \\"Solace\\" and was blown away by how superior it was compared to the other work she has done. Although her music has not gotten worse by any means, the recording here is incredibly wonderful ... her lyrics are touching and personal and the style of her music ethereal. \\"Thorns\\" and \\"I will Not Forget You\\" had me addicted right away to the CD and after listening, I can't find many bad songs on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"Possibly the worst singer of all time.

Tracks here that I absolutely dug the most were Bob Calvert's \\"The Right Stuff\\",Nik Turner's out-of-this-world \\"Grid Coordinate:Vorp One\\",the lost Hawklord's single \\"Time Of The Hawklords\\" and Zero Gravity's eerie \\"Space Does Not Care\\". Plus,I heard a couple of Helios Creed tunes I simply don't remember.

I have used it at every band rehearsal, DJ and Karaoke gig too. Instead of pulling out the long snakes with the stage boxes and fantails to deal with, I usually use this if I have to be positioned anywhere near the stage. Quite often, because of space constraints inside the venue, a full on snake is not an option and this has filled in nicely. Even when I do use the long snake, this is good to get all 7 of my drum mics away from theirs stands/clips, down to the floor and over to the stage box of the big snake. I could not do my job without this. I have not heard a crackle, pop or hiss from this thing since I have been using it and I use it almost every day.

This part is great. The only reason it is being given 2 stars all over, is due to the fact that the material part of this laundry sorter is make of thin cheap material. It rips at the weight of the laundry you put in it. I did not overload it. The pieces that separate the compartments just started to tear.

The association of Reverend King with this project is as crass a piece of commercialization as any commemorative ashtray ever sold in a Washington DC or Atlanta souvenir store.

A friend of mine bought this for me years ago, and I'm relistening for the first time in years -- it's as mediocre now as it was then, except that parts of it once seemed forgivably danceable.

It has more than enough power to drive my Bose speakers.Once you figure out how to set the zone 2 program which is really pretty simple (there are two separate controls which do everything) it entertains the whole house.Price and quality are the best you can find and the Yamaha extended warranty is a nice extra for a small fee direct from Yamaha.

It is a huge upgrade from my five year old kenwood that I paid $400 for. When I was shopping for a new receiver I considered Onkyo, Pioneer, Denon, Yamaha. From my research I eliminated Denon because all I heard was that all Denon receivers are a pain to setup. Next I eliminated Pioneer because only the Pioneer Elite receivers compared to this Yamaha unit but, the Pioneers' were much more expensive. So it came down to Onkyo and Yamaha. I went with the Yamaha RX-V659 because of the Price ($350), power (100w x 7), and that it had auto-setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love these cushions!","review":"We love our new cushions!!

Songs such as \\"Cowboy Pussy,\\" \\"Yellowbelly's Got a Girlfriend\\" and \\"Rob Zombie\\" are riff-heavy headbangers. Many of the tracks here are loud and heavy stadium-worthy anthems. Singer/guitarist Melissa Urbanski wails as she grinds her foot into your face. Pinned to the floor, drummer Zebulun and Bassist Reg Shrader take turns breaking your back. Yeah, you should consider yourself lucky to be getting such attention. That's what you get when you jump on the tiger.

She already had an impressive seven top 10 hits under her belt and two multi-platinum albums. But unfortunately music took a sharp turn around the time of this album's release so it unfortunately didn't get the attention it deserved. The album was by no means a failure. It did go gold and gave Ms. Dayne a top 20 hit with her excellent cover of \\"Can't Get Enough Of Your Love.\\" It's also home to one of her best songs, the soulful and catchy dance track \\"I'll Wait.\\" The version on here is superior to the remix on her \\"Greatest Hits\\" album. \\"Say A Prayer\\" is another highlight and so is the incredible ballad \\"Send Me A Lover\\" which is an unrealized song if ever there was one.Taylor Dayne evolved with her artistry and unfortunately stopped getting the mainstream success she had in the late 80's and early 90's. Still, a very good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Surprise package. I had only heard the Radiohead 'Just' cover once before and bought the album on spec.

I've come to lover her distinctive voice and style. I'm rather enjoying the horns and soulful rhythms.Then I move on to the rest of the album. Hmmmm. Pretty much sounding the same except for the vocal selections. And well, the vocals have a lot to be desired. Not familiar with many of them, nonetheless, not impressed either. Actually put off by some the vocals. Easily could see this has potential, yet at the same time, the various vocals and the same-o musical style can't see me putting this on more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I absolutely LOVED \\"Stop Me\\" when I first heard it, so I was really interested in hearing the whole album, especially after seeing the songs and vocalists. I'm always intrigued by interesting reworkings of familiar songs.Unfortunately, what sounded so fresh and new on \\"Stop Me\\" got really tiresome by the end of this disc since it's the same formula on pretty much every song. The same drums, the same horns, the same tambourine.... Sometimes it's hard to tell where one song ends and the next begins.There was a ton of potential on this album, but I don't think it even remotely lived up to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I bought this cd for Amy Winehouse's cover of Valerie, Which is so ridiculously good. Looking at the track listing was Intriguing, but I wasn't sure if I would know many of the songs. The Coldplay cover by the Dap-tone horns is really cool, I feel like I'm in \\"Snatch\\" or another British caper movie when I hear it. I think this cd has a good range of different sounds on it, and I love the rebirth of 60's Motown style. I would recommend this for any Amy Winehouse fan, as well as fans of UK style Electronic/dance music. I might also recommend Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings too, her voice parallels Ms. Winehouse, but she has more experience, less drama, plus the horns are awesome"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering, confusing, plain irritating","review":"Supposedly about the history and inner workings of the SS, this book also takes you on a disorienting ride into the world of convoluted sentences and uninspired phraseology.

This is a book meant for someone who already has significant background knowledge on the subject and who would have no problem immediately understanding terms like \\"folkish movement\\", \\"Kapp Putsch\\" and \\"the Kahr regime\\".

In one poem he declares [to a woman?], \\"I can't / hear you / I'm just a the / upon / your shore\\"--a marvelous line, using an original adaptation of syntax to reflect the way a specific being can be reduced to an article. In \\"Probably a Strong Undertow\\" he compares the undertow to the power of music, but with such a literalness that the musicians are wading out into the surf as the poem ends.

When we found this one, it sounded like the best bet for a small beginner. She still needs assistance getting on it. The foot stand is fairly high off the ground, and the bounce mechanism is pretty stiff for my 45 pound kid. Though, her jumps are still fairly timid. Hopefully once she gets more comfortable on it and the weather warms up, allowing for lots of outside use, she will be able to really wail on it and go higher :) We're very happy with the purchase, but do wish it wasn't so stiff.

It's pretty much straightforward semi-hard trance so you'll want to break it up a little with something but DJ Tiesto is usually very reliable and this is yet another great collection.It's melodic, it's several classic trance tracks mixed with some not as well know but there are zero fillers or oddball tracks here.DJ Tiesto didn't leave much here for a professional (or amateur DJ) to add, mix or layer in so maybe that's why some people want something rougher and incomplete but if you're looking for a trance CD to play out of the case (and of course, to get the party going) - you cannot go wrong with this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another dynamic breakthrough for the University of North Tex","review":"Blue Shades is awesome, such dynamics.

Still, however, not *everything* Jerry or the boys produce is uniformly wonderful. This live recording's a keeper - trust me, you'll listen to it over and over again - take the word of a discerning Deadhead. The fact that I felt like submitting my own little review should be an indication. Buy this one over \\"How Sweet It Is\\" - THAT one sounds like reheated Cat's Under the Stars. The present, simply JGB, is a wonderful sound, full of new songs. There's only one Dead song on this recording - Deal. You won't believe Dear Prudence, or Tangled Up In Blue. Jerry pulls out the fireworks on some of these songs, but mainly what you have here is Jerry at his poignant best. I only wish he'd done a Peggy-O while he was still in this mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"a music fan from northampton, ma","review":"Amazing, buy this album. You won't be dissapointed. Having bought JGB albums Shining Star and Dont Let Go... This one is by far the best of the three. Jerry delves deep into jams with inspired, creative playing, especially on the 17 minute \\"Don't Let Go\\". The Dylan covers are phenominal. \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" is soulful and would bring a smile to Dylan's face. Both discs are great. One of, if not the best live albums I've heard.

It is a story about tested faith, what it means to be a Christian, the meaning of religious iconography, and the conflict between internal and external expressions of faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant historical novel","review":"We think of God, as we should (I still think after reading the novel), as an Almighty Benevolent Supreme Being. Why He sometimes seems to be utterly silent and absent only He knows and this situation is masterly depicted in the novel. This is the story of the Catholic mission in Japan and shows how extreme persecution to Christian missions can be. Very well written story and informative also. With extreme evil and pain, also extreme love appears when God is somehow present.Besides, this was a gift from my Daughter which adds to the deep sense of love this books inspires in me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silence","review":"Silence is an excellent book based on the trials of a Catholic Priest attempting to do missionary work in Japan in the early 17th century. This was a time of persecution an tribulation for Christians in Japan as the Government had decided that Christianity could no longer be allowed to flourish in the country.The Japanese took great pains to stamp out Christians, using torture to force padres and Christians alike to apostatize, and trample a fumie in order to prove their apostasy. It was a brutal time for Japanese Christians as well as the Priests who attempted to lead them.In the end, Father Sebastian Rodrigues, the main character, must make some increasingly difficult decisions and come to some difficult conclusions concerning his faith and his God. I highly recommend this book, as it was very moving. I think it will strike a particular chord w/Christians especially, but recommend it for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Take on Christianity's Introduction to Japan","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Shusaku Endo's hilarious portrayal of the introduction of Christinanity into Japan.

Accepting their martyrdom with silence.There is no balance between these two. There is no reality.This is a book written by a Japanese for Japanese readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, tough questions","review":"The book's topic is the silence that some Christians (most?) feel when they try to pray and trust in God's goodnes while undergoing great difficulties - no answer seems to be forthcoming to the question of why some people suffer so much, and what good it serves. Another question is what would I do if put in a situation where I AND OTHERS would be tortured and killed UNLESS I aportatized (denied my faith). It was hard to read of these fictionalized historical events, and those in our book club found we could not read it quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"the \\"ye ye\\" years","review":"Franoise Hardy was one of my favorite icons of the '60's, with her sweet clear voice, her songwriting talent, and her incredible style. She just oozed style. Eventually getting bored with the life fame brought her, she followed her own path out of the limelight, but these songs from the \\"ye ye\\" years of international stardom are a treat for her fans.Though some of the early tracks have less than perfect production and backup musicians, it's a terrific overview of her early career. She penned 40 of the 50 songs on this CD set, and some of them are beauties. \\"L'amour ne dure pas Toujours\\", \\"La Nuit est sur la Ville\\", \\"Voila\\", and many more.There's a gentleness and a simplicity to these songs that delights me, and her voice, though limited, is expressive and appealing. The booklet insert is excellent, with lots of photos, a bio, and detailed song info...to quote from it, \\"...the Franoise Hardy of the mid sixties still looks and sounds truly modern\\", and I agree wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm so glad I bought this","review":"This is a pretty rare EP that was released before their breakthrough album, Parachutes, came out. It is definitely worth your money. I found it in Tower Records Import/Singles section for 6 or 7 bucks after I had got A Rush of Blood to the Head. Well, this release is somewhat different from AROBTTH in that it is extremely mellow. While their latest album leans more to piano ballads and U2-ish pop songs, Blue Room EP's 5 tracks are very laid-back and beautiful. I wish they could have kept on making songs like \\"Bigger Stonger\\", the first track on the EP that stuns me every time.In short, this EP is pure magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saul from Samo","review":"I chose to read this book because I love soccer, but it ended up dissapointing me. Never have I read a book where there are meetings and arguments in every page. The excess amount of meetings that Bose describes made me feel like I too was sitting in the meeting trying to stay awake. The greed that this club had to become the best helped them do so. Their were key moves by club officials that lead to this story of success. The only thing exciting about this book were the arguments thinking that at any time some club officials would literally fight each other in the meetings. If your interested in business and strategy you would probably enjoy it, if you play soccer and try to read this book after practice I guarantee you will have trouble trying to stay awake."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Miracle Revealed","review":"Mihir Bose does an excellent job of describing Manchester United's amazing turnaround.

I think not","review":"This book seriously undermines the exciting, exhilarating, thrill one receives from watching a United game. While it tells the reader of United's rise to the top from an economic point of view, it does so in a banal way. After a few pages the reader is highly tempted to put the book down. The tale never takes off and Bose throws so many names at you, that the reader no longer can tell who is on the executive board at Manchester United, or who is the former CEO of BSkyB. If you truly want to learn about Manchester United, save the money you plan to spend on this book, and put it towards a plane ticket to Manchster, England, and a ticket to Old Trafford."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures, exciting for babies and toddlers","review":"The Priddy books in this series are great.

This album is no exception to that rule! whether or not you speak french makes no difference. If you listen to this album one time -- you will learn to understand french!

They sound like they could be a good live act with some real fire, especially if all of the vocals were given equal volume (the harmonies complement the lead, but that's all they do, they're just in the background). There's just something about what I'd have to guess to be the production that really flattens and dulls all of the songs on this album, and prevents justice from being done to the potential talent. Something else odd about this album is that the songs are all grouped according to what key they're in, which makes it less interesting as well. That said, I do think this record has its value and makes for good easy-listening or background music. My chosen tracks are \\"Goodbye Says It All\\" and \\"I Sure Can Smell the Rain\\", with the former being the only really unique song on the record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it appears","review":"The disc I received was brand new in the wrapper.

I really like moe, but I would not recomend this DVD except for those who have to have it. It's a real shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"moe DVD is good but the same show on HDTV was better","review":"All it all, I really enjoyed this capture of a moe event. One thing I should note, I have previously seen them on HD TV and recorded the show on my set top box. The quality of the show on HD TV was/is excellent particularly the video portion. I then bought this DVD and discovered it was the same show. I noticed to my surprise that the quality of the video on the DVD didn't hold a candle to the same show that I recorded off of HD TV. It's not my gear since I have many rock shows on DVD that are of phenomenal video quality. Did someone at the production company cut costs on this disc? Seems like it to me. Still, a great show.

He is a master MC who has skills.I would recommend this album to any hip-hop fan, and also to any student of French."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"While I truly appreciate and enjoy all of MC Solaar's work, I do think that this is among his best work to date. The various melodic lines that he uses are as subtle and entertaining as ever and the topics that he handles are still challenging and thought provoking. He even takes the time to slyly refer back to themes and subjects that he has dealt with in previous songs and albums. This album transcends genres and labels. It is modern poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"About time...","review":"About time we finally found something good about France.

Independent film-making should be encouraged whenever possible, but in the case of all involved here, their parents should have been honest and crushed their dreams. There was NOTHING redeeming or even fun about this movie. No story, No gore or nudity, and no passion or ability either behind or in front of the camera. Don't bother.Check out October Moon, November Son or even Urbania for a better take on the gay horror/thriller genre.

The premise sounds brilliant and original, however the execution could not be more run of the mill if it tried.a lot has been said of the script, and especially the repetition of certain lines, I'm not sure that that wasn't done with a purpose, the film is however so condescending of the viewer that I didn't really care what the directors comment on society was. It's also rather pointless to make a B grade trash film (in the vein of the great John Waters) and then to make it as insipid as possible. John Waters had balls and he nailed them to the wall for all to see in his earlier work, something which is essential for this genre to work, what we have here is a sad imitation.I would suggest staying away, however if your anything like me, you're gonna buy it anyway and hope for the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Watch This Movie","review":"This movie is trash.

Discussing his own perceptions in which the way things could be in order to get full advantage of living and being free from oneself as well as anything material.

Each one of us dreams of some place or ideal as we grow, but few of us are fortunate or determined enough to turn those dreams into realities and go on to live them. Kuki Gallman along with her husband and children shows us what it is like to achieve and live our dreams and at what cost our dreams sometimes come. \\"I Dreamed of Africa\\" is a lyrical, magical account of one woman, her family, and the people and customs of the last continent in our world that truly has a soul.

I am sorry her son died, BUT ENOUGH ALREADY! There is VERY little mention of any other family member, including her other daughter and two step daughters. Her African \\"Staff\\" might as well have been furniture, and she gripes about the elephants eating her landscaping! She talks about how Africa \\"called her\\". She doesn't have a clue!

She considers herself the Joan of Arc of the Masai Plains, not keeping in mind that she was a colonist and not Jesus Christ. The western world has a completely different idea about the life in Kenya. Was the movie to be shown to the people who lived the colonial times, they would spit right in her face. The land that she today calls her own and made herself a fortune out of belongs to the Masai and their cattle. I am a Kenyan and I know what life was like during the colonial times.

From the reviews, it looks like many did.That was my first reaction. All the Africans she deals with are servants. When she describes visiting some new place, she lists a few Europeans that she visits. !I wasn't particularly turned off by her privileged life, and that she could afford a ranch the size of San Francisco, like another reviewer said.The other thing that really annoyed me was how she thought African children were getting corrupted by modern ways or something like that. Like other kids, African children should of course learn to appreciate the natural beauty of their country, and so on, but should also be studying math and science, and improving their living conditions.On the whole, this is very much a woman's book.

I have seen this first hand. So, where is Ms Gallmann's 'meaty' part in this lifestyle?Why this book deserves 1 star: For one, Ms Gallmann paints the local people as brainless, simpleheads... she's very patronizing in every sense. Two, if she cares so much about the country she lives in, and for her own credibility, she should have either left out the Swahili words/sentences or got herself a translater to do the needful. The Swahili deserves an F. Third, her treatment of the so-called loved ones is rather lacking, if not disrespectful. She should have just written a book recounting her son's life and his untimely death. Period.Ms Gallmann is certainly NOT Karen Blixen!

People who have spent some time in Africa with Africans or have studied Africa seriously are more reserved in their praise. Nothing about Africa in this book is incorrect (as far as I can tell), there's just not much of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read","review":"I kept putting this book down after reading a paragraph or two. I thought the book would never end. Although some of the descriptions of Kenya were vivid and did evoke the feeling of being there, I really couldn't figure out why Kuki was there at all. At best she was a two dimensional character who evoked no empathy at all even through her many tragedies. The book merely scratched the surface of the people of Africa focusing instead on how Kuki viewed them or their roles to her. As a matter of fact the whole book seemed to be the Kuki story and not a very good one at that. At best it resembles an amateurish journal written by a self-focused, privileged class woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragical..........but hopeful","review":"This novel was very depressing, but the end leaves you with a sense of hope and happiness. I think Kuki Gallmann can write very well, because, after all, she writes from her experiences. The detailed descriptions of Africa make you want to read the book over and over. I got it from the library first and ended up buying it, so that says something! Anyway, if you don't mind a depressing book, this one would be great for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTRAGOUS!","review":"It was a heart warming story and its one of the things where the book is better than the movie. And it is so sad that it makes it good. I love it and going to get the movie when it comes out and also I'm going to save the book for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to finish","review":"I'm in the middle of this book and am seriously considering not finishing it, which doesn't happen all that often. The book is written in a very banal and trivial style, which doesn't engage the reader at all. All the dramas and traumatic experiences are portrayed as simple facts along the story. There is also no reference to where she had all the money from to live such a high-life in the middle of nowhere and afford to go on frequent vacation to Greek islands and the Caribbean which is mentioned in some part of the book. Generally - a very shallow book."},{"rating":"1","title":"gave up after the second affair","review":"Having lived in African I share with my fellow one star reviewers the sense of her dismissive state at which she treats the locals. Having lived alone there I also understand the propensity for feeling lonely and afraid. However I would never have had the illicit affairs she had with two men...I finally gave up after the second affair and tossed it (about 9/10 of the way through it). Having her step daughter marry her ex was weird enough, but when the second affair was with a man 9 years her junior that reminded her of her dead son...well that was it! Introspective navel gazing to the max....God forbid that she could have denied her son the chance of collecting dangerous and poisonous snakes and thus prevented his untimely death....sigh...Africa deserves a better book than this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Dreamed of Not Having Read This Book","review":"I am utterly stunned that this book got so many positive reviews from readers. I got about two-thirds of the way through it before I finally let myself quit reading it.Gallman has lead an interesting life; there's no question of that. The only trouble is, she's not a good writer. She tends to tell the reader things--like that her son was a special person--rather than showing us. And she tries way too hard to add mystical foreshadowing. Example: her son was killed from a poisonous snakebite. Years before, when he got his first pet python, she said that she felt uneasy. This is supposed to show us, the readers, how in tune with the world she is, how she's probably psychic. Excuse me, but I think any mother would be a little uneasy about their child having a lethal pet.Do not waste your time with this boring, painful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and absurd","review":"I never ever laid down a book without finishing it before, but this time was the first time! I am a fan of Kenya and I have read almost all literature available on this subject. But Kuki Gallmann's book was a bore. She set off writing about her life at home, then the start of her life in Kenya. She writes about her love for this country and how beautiful she thinks it is. But she is unable to share the beauty with the reader, there are just empty words without compassion. And the book gets even worse, when she writes about her husband's soul that enters her unborn baby's body after his car accident. For me, that was a little too fantastic. And that was about it. I put it down and haven't picked it up since. And I am not planning to, either! It was just too bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe inspiring","review":"This is one of the most inspiring works i have ever had.

We play it fairly often and she loves it. Even though I am not a lawyer I enjoy it very much. It plays a lot like Trivial Pursuit, but the categories are specific to law (Torts, Criminal Law, Constitutional Law, Contracts, General Practice, etc). Questions are based off of real cases, many familiar to any law school student, and the answers are explained with a good amount of detail and cites the actual case and judgment.Now that she has passed the Bar and is officially a lawyer I am given a leg up when we play - if a lawyer plays against a non-lawyer, the lawyer must get a six categories while the non-lawyer only needs four. All in all a fun game, and if you have a law school student or Bar examinee in the family it would make a great gift that may even help them in their studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smooth,sweet ,tugs at your heart!

LeShan writes a weird mixture of vintage voodoo and goofy \\"new-age\\" hype.

On page 340, this ideology is defined as \\"required by the first Amendment to the United States Constitution\\". This idea of \\"separation\\" was a quote from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson regarding a single denomination and is taken out of context when applied to school issues of prayer, etc. Nowhere does the constitution refer to any such mandate.

But I recently went to a Manilow concert in Philadelphia, and it was amazing to see the range of ages enjoying the show. I would never have thought that teens today would like this music, but I saw many there, singing to every song along with their parents - It was great to see!This particular CD collection is awesome! It includes all of the great Barry Manilow songs that we've enjoyed for ages, as well as some newer songs that haven't got much radio play.If you grew up loving Barry, or just like to listen to some good love songs, this collection is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"blue-eyed soul?","review":"In my opinion, Barry Manilow should at least be considered to be inducted in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame sometime in the near future.

Plus, there are songs I've never heard before, something I didn't think was possible since I have seen him in concert 6 times! I highly recommend this to his fans. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 CD's Is Not Enough","review":"Having been under attacked by the critics through all 25 years of his career it is great to finally see this outstanding musician widely accepted.This four-CD collection (plus a free video)is just brilliant and a very good mix of classic cuts, alternate versions and new stuff that shows the wide variety in this man's music.Manilow excelled at both pop and jazz; his own compositions are as outstanding as his interpretations of other people's material. If you look beyond the hyped 70's \\"image\\" of Barry Manilow you will find a hard-working, gifted musician in these songs.In my opinion, this collection is the finest boxset ever issued - \\"complete\\" in every sense of the word, including a highly informative booklet, and the quality of the new 1992 recordings are worth the price alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this hoping for the music I remember.

If you get over the fact that there are a wall of words on most pages, the book actually has some great content and ideas. It generally talks about user interfaces, as opposed to web interface/design. It talks more about the distinction between them and what their purposes are. It talks about different controls and the best solution for a problem that a client has. You find out a lot of things that are like, \\"Wow, I never thought about that, but that makes so much sense\\".I am mostly a web designer, but knowing the purpose of GUIs is a great skill since there is going to be a boom in RIAs(Rich Internet Applications) in the coming years.

The book itself is by now outdated although it was written in 2000.

However, the brutality, cruelty, and antagonistic atmosphere in which the book takes place horrified me. I was repulsed by the violence portrayed so graphically in the novel. Yes, I can see that it is extremely well-written. However, I found the book horrifically gruesome and depressing. By the time I finished the book, I was in tears.

I can vividly remember despising it. It disurbed me in a way I didn't think possible. I managed to force this book down in a day, and it was probably one of the worst days of my life. It's simply an extraordinarily unsettling, disturbing tale about one boy's decision to go against the norm and abandon tradition. It left me with an extremely sick feeling that I'd like to forget. I don't care how well the author writes---this book simply isn't worth it. I don't understand why I was assigned to read this novel--I somehow missed the educational value. It's truly awful. Save this book for when you feel like depressing yourself beyond belief."},{"rating":"1","title":"An 8th Grader who is actually has a real view of school","review":"Robert Corimer's has a very disillusioned view of high school. This novel portrays teen-hood as a time where violence and vulgarity are more acceptible than refusing to be on the \\"in-crowd\\".

Although Jerry isn't the strongest kid he plays on the Trinity football team. There is a chocolate sale at the high school and each box is going to be sold for two dollars. Jerry has been assigned to sell 50 boxes. This is the start of brutal struggle to \\"survive\\" in his school. Archie, the leader of a gang called The Vigils, assigns Jerry to refuse to sell the chocolates for ten days. Ten days pass and Jerry is supposed to start to sell the assigned chocolates but he decides that he is not going to sell the chocolate at all. This ticks off The Vigils because he is not selling the chocolates as they had told him to do.

It was difficult for me to put it down. Overall, I enjoyed reading the book. An assignment for class was to write our overall reaction and whether or not we would use this book in the classroom. I would be a little reluctant. It's not the violence or the language. It's the fact that Jerry gets the snot knocked out of him because he's not \\"one of the group.\\" He goes against the norm and pays the price.However, I would recommend this to an older student (8th-10th grade) if they had difficulty finding interesting books. This book is, to use a cliche, a page-turner.

I don't know where Robert Cormier went to high school, but it simply isn't the way he made it seem. This is a typical book where an adult writer tries to \\"understand\\" or portray teenage life.

I have read other books by the same author and they are well written but this one just wasn't the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For the young and innocent","review":"I believe that this book uses too much bad language and it sends a bad message to young readers. This book to me promotes violence and getting authority through violence. It gives the message that if you don't go along with the crowd that you are doing the wrong thing. I believe that anyone who reads this book could be mislead to do something that they wouldn't normally do. The way that this book is written and the language that it uses would turn a lot of people away even if they agree with the message that this book puts across.I don't believe that this book should be available to young readers and anyone who is easily offended by the use of explicit language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft porn for teens","review":"This \\"book\\" is full of all the things teens and pre teens don't need to read about.

When I passed out excerpts to the school board for them to read.....they wouldn't . Of course the kids want to read it! Why don't you just get em a copy of Hustler,PlayBoy or Penthouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic view into teenaged boys","review":"At first I thought this book was banned because of multiple masturbation references, and it probably was, but possibly also the extreme cruelty with which the characters treat each other. The whole thing is very dark and disturbing. It wasn't pleasant to read, but really elucidates the frequent depravity of human nature.I expect children to be cruel, but the teachers' participation in these undertakings was truly sickening. However, the clearness and conciseness of the writing and emotional depth of the characters was brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best story to be put on paper!","review":"I first read The Chocolate War about two years ago.

I thought that since the book started out so pointless that maybe it would erdeem itself in the end, but it got worse! I agree with some of the other reviewers; their is deatiled descriptions of things that have no relevance to the plot, like the girl he meets at the bus stop and calls. The end is not only dissapointing but extremely pointless. My final synopsis: watch the movie. It has a sensible ending, and is worth the time if this topic interests you. This is the worst and most boring book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is a disgrace to novels everywhere","review":"I, a sixth grader from a good suburban school, shudder at the fact that people actually rated this a ten.

Not only does this book have no plot-why on earth did Jerry not sell chocolates it was also very poorly written. It gives people the idea that you should give up. And in my opinion we don't need books that tell people that they need to give up. The charecters in this book were very poorly developed, some of the male charecters acted like girls, and the book gives kids the idea that teachers are there to hurt them. the book had no climax at all, and what little action was in the book was pointless and could have easily been left out. This book would not pass the 4th grade writing test. Please take my advice and don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ A DIFFERENT BOOK","review":"I dislike this book for two reasons. The first reason was the character Brother Leon. He made you think, can you trust a teacher every agian. Brother Leon abused his powers as a teacher to gain power and fear from the students. Either threating them by accusing them of cheating or taking away their good grades for informationThe second reason I dilike the book is the storys ending. It made me think if I vote can I really make a difference or can one person in the world really make a difference. In conclusion, DONT READ THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Chocolate War","review":"The chocolate warThe chocolate war was one of the best books I have ever read...NOT! The chocolate war portrayed a very inappropriate scene. The boy jerry was supposed to sell chocolates but refused, but the book sidetracks and talks about naughty things and also swears a lot. I would not recommend this book because it seemed inappropriate. I don't think that this book should be available to children at a middle school level. This story might be better if the bad words and other bad things war taken out. I think that the story line seems great when jerry denies selling the chocolates because of Archie. Archie is a suspicious character that knows every one. I wish this book was more school appropriate, but it isn't and was a horrid book. Therefore, this book would be great if the author published a book with the Sam story but more school appropriate situations and words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspense led to disappointment","review":"The Chocolate War, was descent. The plot made you want to keep reading, I couldn't stop turning pages, but, I was disappointed with the end. It just cut off leaving me to wonder WHAT ELSE! One thing I strongly felt was the The Chocolate War had a lot of unnecessary detail with discusting parts and just unneeded info as if Cormier didn't have anything else to write. This made it boring. Being that I'm a female, I did not enjoying reading about a bunch of teenage boys going through puberty and making immature actions. I think this book should be read by older audiences because of the appropiateness with language and sexuality, plus, the concept does not have much of a point and an older audience might intepret it better. This is what I think of The Chocolate War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the original but defintely worth reading","review":"I have just recently read \\"The Chocolate War\\" in my 8th grade English class.

You really get into the heads of the characters in this sequel and see how the Vigils and Brother Leon have affected the student body at Trintity.

Anyway, I tried reading it again, and it's just too bizarre for words. The only part I vaguely understood was that there were some chocolates being fund-raised at school for a baseball game, I think. But from there things got crazy, because it seemed like new \\"storylines\\" and new characters were popping up on every page.

I had no idea that Cormier wrote a sequel until I came across it on Amazon. I immediately ordered both the original and this sequel. While it is not the book the original is, its definitely worth reading. If you know any teens who have not read these books, it makes a great present. Anybody who read the original remembers the characters and the final, disturbing scene under the lights on the athletic field. The original was about Jerry Renault, but the sequel is about Archie Costello, Obie, and the rest of the vigils. Its a good read, but not the great read that the original is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bud Disturbing","review":"I found this book to be very good bu also kind of disturbing. Unlike most people, I have not considered Jerry's story to be a \\"realistic\\" story but more of a \\"What if\\" story. What IF there where a group that rulled your school and could make you do anything like the vigils did. What if teachers like the cruel Brother had everyone in school under his little thumb.

This boy refuses to sell chocolate during a fundraiser. His decision sends the school in a loop. The reader will question whether he is a hero or a scapegoat? The school is divided on the subject. The book also has interesting characters such as a student who corrupts the temporary headmaster and has him target Jerry. With the wholes school against him Jerry stands alone.I believe this book raises deep questions about good and evil. As well as independence and compliance. It is a great book for Kids going in to high school because it shows the student what they can do if they stand up in what they believe in. over all this book deals with life's cruelty, and deals with complex issues with intensity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"The book that I am reading is The Chocolate War.

The choclate war was a story about a secret society and their abuse of power. They pretty much control the school, everyone knows of their excistance but no one talks says anything becuase of thier great power.Jerry Renault is the only one who cares to challange their power. When you hear that this book is for young adults your thinking seventh graders right? Wrong If I had a seventh grader I would not my child read it.

One of my favourite book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sequel to a Great Book","review":"Beyond the Chocolate War continues the story of Jerry Renault, Roland Goober, Obie, Archie and the Vigils. Cormier's slightly gritty and truthful writing is a welcome change from the perfect worlds in many Young Adult books. He tells it like it is; the pressure of secret peer society, the need to belong in the world and the ever-tumultuous teen relationship. The sequel is definitely as good as its prequel, though I preferred the latter, and the addition of new and exciting characters such as Ray Bannister and Laurie Gundarson and a deeper probe into Jerry's injuries make this book suspenseful and disturbing as it looks closely into the face of evil. The plot twists and turns, with Cormier's mastery of the teenage fiction novel evident. Since this book was an easy read, exciting and full of adventure, I would definitely recommend it to teens and adults who enjoy suspenseful books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book With Deaper Meaning","review":"The Chocolate War is an exelent story for use in school. The book contains a deeper meaning and is told from the point of view of students. Also, the message of the story is that not every conflict has a happy ending, a message Robert Cormier ment for students. However, the book fails to hold the interest of the reader and has a quite unsatisfactory ending, making the book unsuitable for pleasure reading. The Chocolate War is a dull book, but contains much controversial matter, making it an excelent book to be taught in schools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish the School could Teach Lesson with High Moral Standard","review":"I read this book 1st. I do not want my daughter reading the Mature Content definitely not PG-13.. Yes it's for high school.. most of the parents are saying. There are themes in this book that we do not allow in the movies that she sees, and do not understand why school and district FILLED WITH EDUCATORS, maybe not with children..., could not teach whatever lesson that they are trying to convey without the vulgarities within this book. Someone decided that the \\"classics\\" were no longer valuable I gather.My purchase from amazon was great, as the book was for 1 cent and shipping was 3.99.

And for that reason, I would very much like to meet Robert Comier. Beyond the Chocolate War wasn't one book however. It was many books all in one, and each one ended at different times. Each chapter is separate from the next and the previous, in fact, all of them, yet at the same time, they are all connected. No need to explain to you who Archie Costello is, someone else can do that. But I am envious of him. Envious of a ficticious character thought up by a very smart man. Is this the way Mr. Comier is in real life? Bottom line of Archie: No matter what he did, or how bad of it was, he had a way of making you think it was your fault. The characters in the book realize and think that Archie is right, and so does the narrator (whoever that is) but I find this not to be so. Read the book and determine for yourself. A good book.p.s. -- You won't learn anything from this book.--Adam Cortright"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perversions pointless and un-needed","review":"The Book The Chocolate War, by Robert Cormier I found rather disturbing. There were many incidents throughout the course of the book that were irrelevant and just down-right discusting. The author made many refernces to women in a derogotory sense, which made me as a female feel degraded and uncomfortable. On more than one occasion Robert Cormier irrelevantly included more than one of the students pleasuring themselves whether it was at home or in school. These actions do not belong in a book that is read in school. It teaches to do wrong and think like a perverted man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark","review":"While searching for a book for our book club we tried this one--we all found it to provoke only trivial, obvious conversation and overall it was dark, unhappy, and disturbing despite the \\"take on the universe\\" message the author tried to deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great performance of caricatured story","review":"Frank Muller did a great job performing this audiobook.

A book that should be read by everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful while disturbing","review":"I agree with the reviewers who believe that this book is one of the best books ever written for young adults. I never read this book as an adolescent and wish I had. The price Jerry pays to \\"disturb his universe\\" does not seem worth it afterall. I like that the author shows us the perspectives of several characters (whether main or peripheral) throughout the novel. Though this book leaves a bad taste in the mouth in regards to the current human condition, it says it like it (too often) is. The Archies of the world leave the scene of the crime unscathed, karma never catching up with them. The Jerrys and Goobers become weary, disillusioned, and circumspect. This book is about the clash of egos and unchecked power trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book! a must read!","review":"i have realalized that these things help people and that is what this is for. this is an amazing book and children of all ages must read it! great for teenagers al alike. a must read for it's plot sensory imagry and thoughts of popularity + the world"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ups and downs of the Chocolate War for teens.","review":"The Chocolate War, by Robert Cormier, somewhat describes the high school scene today. The books theme mainly revolves around peer pressure and individuality. The story isn't exactly realistic but it does bring up many interesting points. Many of these points deal with things we teenagers have to deal with on a day to day basis. From masturbation to fighting. It seems to deal with it all, but in a very awkward manner. Robert Cormier brings too many people into the book all at once which really doesn't help you understand too much about the character introduced, the setting, or the plot at the time. The dialogue of actual teens in this book isn't very masterful but in his own way it seems he is trying to understand us as teens and our way of thinking. All in all it isn't a bad book but if you really want to spend time wandering and guessing this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"When I first read the book, I figured it would mostly be one of the style and personality only towards a guy. But after I got into the book I realized that it set an image for both male and female readers. The book created a tension that one would be able to feel the presence of the characters. The Chocolate War was a book that showed the true events and happenings of a real life history of a 9th grade boy. What really impressed me was that the ending wasn't like the classic fairy tale endings, but the ending of something that would happen. Even though the ending seemed too brutal to even think about, I realized Robert Cormier has a great sense about the issues of the true ending of a life in the Chocolate War."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best book I've read!","review":"I really liked this book because it had a very ineresting story, and the characters were developed very well. Some of the part of this book were slow, I don't like slow parts. Other parts of the book were well written.This book was about several kids who had to sell chocolates. There was some conflict about the selling and when they had to do it. Jerry didn't want to sell the choclates. He had a 10 day assignment from the vigils to wait and not sell the chocolates. There was a fight.I would recommand this book to a friend because I think my friends would enjoy this book too. It was a story about conflict between kids and teachers and how they solved the problems. This is how people have to live together and get along in life. We can all learn from a book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chocolate War","review":"This book is very different from any book I've ever read.This book teaches important life lessons. Also, this book has a very good theme. But, the way Cormier writes is very confusing because he changes the point of view every chapter. This takes away from the book because half the time you're reading you don't know whose eyes you are seeing through. Except for the very end this book is very boring , and almost nothing interesting happens until the last 3 chapters. This is one of those books that you will put down, and never want to start reading again. This book is also not suitable for younger readers because it has some graphic images, and swearing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless you love Robert Cormier, and read every one of his books. In conclusion, this book teaches wonderful lessons about life and has a good theme, but the book is so boring and confusing that even the great theme can't make this book great."},{"rating":"1","title":"CW Review","review":"The Chocolate War is a strange novel. In the story, one Jerry Renault is going against his peers and refusing to sell chocolate, and under the peer pressure things eventually escalate to violence.I didn't enjoy this particular novel very much.

It may have something to do with the fact that i don't find the genre appealing.I wouldn't recommend reading this book, but you may want to consider looking at other people's reviews and opinions before immediately discarding this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as interesting as it seems","review":"In my honest opinion I'd have to say that this book is not all it's cracked up to be. Yes it shows strength of the characters but I think in reality that this would never happen. The whole story was basically boys calling boys stuff. And the plot of the story was over a chocolate sale. Underneath that there was a more \\"in-depth\\" plot but that hardly made sense at all. Friends supposedly not liking each other and turning on each other in a second. No that's not right. All in all I think this book was a waste of time, paper, and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to put down","review":"The Chocolate War, by Robert Cormier, is hard to get into. It has a poor plot and skips around too much. It gives great detail on topics irrelevant to the story line. Cormier goes off on long drawn-out accounts of characters' personal lives and histories. This novel is boring, monotonous, and altogether poorly written. For some odd reason Cormier was compelled to include more about the lusts of a fat, teenage boy than major issues concerning the plot. Also, this novel has no real age-appropriate level. It combines mature topics with elementary school grammar. Cormier tried to add a realistic air to an improbable setting and did a poor job of it. He used a clever little ending which completes the book in what would be the middle of any normal novel. The book leaves you not wanting to read more, just wanting to forget what you just read. I could hardly recommend this book. It is worth neither your time nor money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chocolate War","review":"The Chocolate War is an outstanding book. The way Robert Cormier exhibits human cruelty is just brilliant. It starts out when brother Leon an evil priest purchases 50,000 boxes of chocolates knowing he will overextend the schools finances.

On the surface are Jerry and the other kids who attend a middle class private school, that seems to be religiously affiliated, but inside are issues of: authority, self-perception, puberty, decision making, good vs. evil, social responsibility, and so much more. Of course the adults in this story are evil and rotten, as are some of the boys. Jerry is the hero in more ways than one- sometimes vulnerable but always strong. It is possible that Cormier wanted to blast religion in this novel, but I see him as empowering kids, to not simply lie down and let the world happen to them.Don't I wish I'd read this book as a teenager? YES I DO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Book","review":"This book has a very interesting story line you become interested in immediately.The plot is a little on the twisted but true side of the socail groups in high school.Like a known but unknown secret society using people to get thier tasks done for them.

Jerry has been assigned by the Vigils to refuse to sell for 10 days. By the time 10 days pass, Jerry's still not selling the chocolates. Because of this little thing, students are getting all heated up. Students are threatening Jerry to get with the program and start selling or else. Don't underestimate this book. It's much more than selling, it's about power, mind games, feelings and all that. This is an excellent story. It was amazing how the author could capture all the feelings and details and personalities of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a page turner.","review":"This book was not a page turner at all. The whole book was based on a kid not selling chocolates. Page after page was just about a kid not selling chocolates and worrying about being beat up. The book was okay at sometimes and horrible at others. One of the better parts is when Jerry got into a fight with Janza and his gang. The horrible parts were when the gang was planning to do something or when the school and the gang were thinking up ways to sell all of the chocolates. There were to many different people and to many points of view. It was almost confusing at sometimes. A small matter that came up in the story could drag on page through page until your finally tired of reading about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding book that actually deals with reality!","review":"Robert Cormier has done it again! The Chocolate War is a refreshing change to the average Joe's image of what books can be. This book deals with peer pressure, and the world around us in a new light. Yes, any person who can write can write a book with the same setting, but the realism that Cormier has added is outstanding! Charlie and Brother Leon are just the tip of the iceburg. How in a Catholic high school for something to happen is quite unusual. Cormier has added that aspect and more to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for all ages!","review":"A wonderfull and powerfull book. I truly enjoyed it I urge all to read it. The Chocolate War is a real page turner and a good book for all ages. On a scale of 1-10 I give it a 10"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was interesting, but it could of been better.","review":"This book was not very well developed. He doesn't do a very good job of describing a high school and a teenage boy. He forgets what times are like now. I only read it because I had to read it in my englis class for a literature group we had to participate in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting novel which depicts many thought provoking ideas","review":"Robert Cormier presents many relevant themes to teenagers and adolescents in todays society. The evil, manipulation and corruption of teachers and students in schools are shown to extreme, but relevent lengths through the issues. The novel presents main characters views towards individualism and following the crowd. The storyline is interesting however has some gross but true pictures in the readers mind. Exagerrated but quite true. Not the best I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE BOOK!","review":"As an incoming high school student who had to read the book, I NEED to warn everyone about this book. Besides the trash inside,(including curse words and sexual references) this book is poorly written. The Chocolate War confuses readers with irrelevant characters, and the extreme bullying in it makes readers deem the story completely unrealistic. If you need to read a bullying book, one like Kiss Me, Kill Me is very rational, and would make a more suitable assigned reading book for students, in order that they would recognize their own weaknesses and strive to correct them and be kind to all, instead of passing bullying off as an overrated topic and then unknowingly performing it themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I Have ever read","review":"The Chocolate War is the worst book I have ever had the distaste of reading, the entire story is based around a terribly ridicoulous plot with an awaiting climax that never happens. All the characters are tremendously exagerrated and all deserve to have someone around to pulverize them. Robert Cormier failed completely on a terrible story, characters, and overall plot. Just the idea is insane, kids getting beaten up and half dead over some stupid chocolates. If you enjoy childish stories, idiotic characters, and reading about Jerry Renault: The Loser's Life purchase this book immediately. If you rather spend your life doing something meaningful go get a good Tom Clancy or Clive Cussler novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid and waste of time","review":"This book was stupid, confusing, and a waste of time. I really didn't get the point. If your in to books about guy's in a all boys school touching each others butt in the halls as a sighn of frindship. Boy's in gangs trying to pull pranks on teacher. Asking the same question over and over again weather or not the main charecter is gay or lonley. if you don't want to waste your time DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for high school students","review":"I enjoyed just about every bit of this book. As a high school boy, it was written in my \\"language,\\" if you will, and was easy to relate to and laugh about. The characterization was great and I knew what was going on the whole time. I would give this a 9 out of 10 but not a 10 because some of the material seemed a little unnecessary. The teenage guy material that I am talking about was not something that I haven't heard before but it seemed a little awkward to read and ponder.I would highly recommend this for a high school teenager looking for a relatively easy but entertaining and worthwhile novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is a great book, and a worthy sequel to Robert Cormier's outstanding book The Chocolate War. I was afraid that the sequel would not live up to the standards set by its predecessor, but it lives up to expectations, and even passes the level of quality in the Chocolate War. It's everything you want in a sequel.The book starts out slow, but then you realize it starts it out slow for a reason, as it needs to introduce some key characters and plots that will be in play in the book. It soon gets into the action, though, with robert Cormier doing what he does best: Making Archie manipulate others, even manipulating his two top officers, Carver andObie. This book touches on subjects that other young adult authors don't, such as rape, extortiong, and cruelty in schools.And at the end, everything culminates into an immensely satisfying conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Classic","review":"\\"The Chocolate War\\" is still among the most challenged books in public schools even nearly 30 years after publication. It has a recurring theme common among Cormier's books, a helpless protagonist thrust headlong into confrontation against a nearly irresistable force. His books also tend to avoid the happy ending and tidy resolutions to the problem. Cormier got his ideas from real life situations and added a \\"What If The Worst Thing Happened\\" instead? \\"The Chocolate War\\" came from one of his children being involved in a harmless chocolate sale at school and he wondered what would happen if...this book will not leave you unemotional at its conclusion. It will affect you emotionally and makes for a great classroom discussion tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chocolate War","review":"The Chocolate War was one of the best books that i have ever read. I would only recommend this book to boys because some of the scenes may be controversial. If you like being a rebel and defying the rules this is a great book for you. This is also a great book for people who like to get revenge on people that you do not agree with. The main reason that I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because the ending did not tie up all of the conflicts. It would have been a lot better book if we only found out what happened to the main character and the crooked teachers that made the students miserable. But, overall this was a really good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome- I mean, pretty good, for some part of it","review":"ok, I was reading some of the reviews up there and I can't quite believe there are people rating it an 1. Even though then I discovered there IS something missing in the book, the whole conduct is still beautiful. What was missing is a more convincing ending, is what I think. Well, I haven't found out what \\"Beyond the Chocolate War\\" is about, just gonna check it out after finishing this, and to find if there is a satisfactory ending"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Cormier delivers masterpiece about a boys prep school","review":"Robert Cormier goes into the mind of Jerry Renault, a regular high school boy. Jerry is persued by a school mob and is told by them to refuse to sell chocolates in the school chocolate sale. Jerry follows the mob's orders and refuses to sell the chocolates. When his ten days of not selling the chocolates are up the mob tells him to begin to sell the chocolates. But Jerry refuses. This sets off a exciting (and grusome) war betwewn Jerry and the mob. Robert Cormier seems to know what depression for teenage boys is like, though he was a teenager long ago. Not many writers like him can do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am 13 and Thought it to be very uneventful","review":"After reading this book I felt as though the something was missing.

It greatly attracted by attention, and I was able to easily imagine the various situations. School activities, use of language, and even the way their minds operate are very close to a typical teenager. I particularly enjoyed reading about certain problems an everyday teenager would be experiencing. I would definitely recommend this book toward any teenager."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I would highly recommend this book. I could not stop reading this book.

I was instantly engaged as the first bars of melody streamed from what seemed to be a magical horn, then further transfixed as the drums came in and I was transported to a world of surreal beats and hypnotic tones. I forgot that music was supposed make you feel that way! Thank you to Mr.Laswell for fusing the funky beats of a jazzmaster with his own innovative vision!

Taking all the most basic elements of innovative band's songwriting, erasing the subtleties, adding nothing, and just being a straight up creativityless mimic. If the post-rock scene Mogwai spawned has outlived it's usefulness it's only because bands like this (and the audience they're inexplicably still able to impress by doing nothing) refuse to let it grow. This album is an offense to my sense of creativity in much the same way rotting garbage is an offense to one's sense of smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muldoon, an excellent read","review":"Strangely, when I began to wrtie this review, there was some heavy footsteps upstairs, and sounds of some doors opening and closing, although I know no one else was home.

The best thing about reading this book was that it reminded me of some \\"unexplained occurances\\" in my own life.

However, as usual, there are plenty of new and wierd beasties and problems for him to face. This time, instead of patients arriving at the station, he is going out to find them.The problems faced are ingenious. All the answers are there in the story but it is often not until the very end that the solution is revealed; very much a mystery story.The only criticism I would have is that Conway and the captain spend too much time telling each other what is going on, technically - it is a bit like having technical footnotes to the story rather than letting the action speak for itself.Good story lines, good problems, not as good at the characterisation as some of his other stories; but still an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Madman's Return","review":"I listened to this stuff all the time when I was little and I still enjoy it now. It is like a mix of techno, dance, electronica, and hip-hop all blended into one sound. I like the lyrics of most songs are the beats are crazy techno stuff that still sounds great today.

Both 23 Degrees releases should be in the collection of any self-respecting \\"ambient\\" or \\"chillout\\" music aficianado. While it's true this is not quite as strong an album as \\"An Endless Search For Substance\\", there's no real difference in approach between the two releases (despite the other reviewer's remarks). To imply that this might have anything in common with 10,000 Maniacs is just irresponsible reviewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed.","review":"I just got this album last week and it is definitely not on the same level as their first album. The whole tone of this album is almost \\"new age-y\\", very weak stuff. It has none of the underlying dub funkyness of their debut. In fact, this seems to go out of it's way to be much more soft and commercial. My wife likes this one, but she also has 10,000 Maniacs CDs in her car, so take that recommendation as you will."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book...","review":"Bette Ford is a premier writer of the most sensous and heartwarming romances.

Donald is a gorgeous, famous NBA star and Taylor is the down-to-earth beauty he falls in love with. He practically moves heaven and earth to win her trust and love. The MANY delectable steamy love scenes left me breathless.

The fictitious character of NBA star Donald, made you wish all of the NBA stars were as grounded and down-to-earth as he was. I liked the fact that he had mellowed to the point where he did not let his ego rule him. Instead of going after some narcissistic, ego-tripping, super-model, actress, or diva, he went fell for and went after a regular sister like Taylor who was working to have her own and didn't want him for his money. Taylor's hesitancy in believing someone of Donald's star status would be interested in her was so realistic. His pursuit of her so sweet and romantic...he didn't want his status to scare her off. Their eventual love scenes were SIZZLING! This is a book that you will want to read again and again...I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"sexy, sensual, erotic","review":"This book is worthy of a third read. Normally I give my books to charity, not this one. Donald is a man who is not afraid of going after what he wants despite rejection. Taylor is a woman who is confidant in her career but not in love.

The pair--repressed Harold (John Cho, Better Luck Tomorrow) and freewheeling Kumar (Kal Penn, Love Don't Cost a Thing)--get extremely high and set off on the road, only to be sidetracked by skateboarding hooligans, racist cops, an inbred tow truck driver, and Neil Patrick Harris--yes, Doogie Howser, M.D. The humor is all over the map, and it would be nice if there were one female character who wasn't a caricature, but Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle has a loose, gregarious charm, and the movie's canniness about the cliches of the buddy-movie genre give it a sneaky subversive feel--just the fact that neither of the heroes is white puts a different spin on just about every circumstance. Surprisingly clever, cheerfully stupid, and a wonderfully great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE QUEST FOR BURGERS CAN BE FUN!","review":"With a title like this you don't expect too much, but Harold and Kumar's first adventure is surprisingly fun! The two leads have good chemistry in this thread bare plot about two buddies who take a trip to eat burgers and wackiness ensues!Sure it's raunchy at times with some nudity, but that shouldn't bother this film's fan base.

When I first heard of it, I was like, \\"Seems like a long ad for White Castle to me.\\" But I watched it in theatres anyway! And I loved it!THE STORY: Harold and Kumar are two stoner roomates. Harold is an Asain dude who has a crush on a girl named Maria, and Kumar is an Indian guy who likes weed. One day they see an ad for White Castle and get hungry! So they drive over there, running into hilarious obstacles along the way!As you see, it's not a serious movie, but it's fun! The DVD is also sweet! Oh, BTW, the sequel, \\"Harold and Kumar Go to Amsterdam\\" is coming soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast food, High times","review":"Harold and Kumar is well...it's pretty much a \\"stoner\\" movie as what most people call it. I will admit I had such a great time watching this film especially the gross out humor in near the middle of the film. I'll make this short and sweet.This isn't a bad film at all. It was pretty funny, Hell it's better then most of the crap that's come out inawhile!I enjoyed the film, had lots of laughs in theater and I recomend you watch this film. It ranks up with all those other \\"stoner\\" films likeHalf BakedCheech and Chong Up in smokeHow High(I think that is one)It's great to see that the guy who plays harold has better role as well..he is one of the main characters..duhh. He was always \\"that asian guy\\" in American Pie. I find this film to be wayyyyy better then American Pie EVEN IF YOU COMBINE ALL THE Films together, AP1 2 American wedding, It doesn't matter.If you want a good laugh check this film out...Trust me. Don't listen to those negative reviewers..4 OUT of 5Lates"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good laugh","review":"This movie really made me want to eat white castle.

The lead female is beautiful beautiful beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely funny","review":"\\"Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle\\" is one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen. Though the jokes sometimes get a little stupid, I was amused throughout the film. Though the plot of the movie isn't very original (two stupid guys getting high and going on an adventure that features a lot of sex has been done before), I still found the film to be outrageously funny. I guess that type of plot line never gets old. I first saw this film two years ago and have seen it twice since. It was funny all three times. However, if you don't like crude and blatant humor, you probably won't like this film, since that type of humor is displayed throughout. Despite that, I love this movie and would recommend it to most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't give in to the hype","review":"I read most of the reviews on Amazon and decided to buy this movie. I then spent an hour and a half waiting to laugh at something. This movie suffers from one major flaw: it is just not funny. They have the right actors, a decent setting, and what should have been a hilarious story - two guys with serious munchies getting to Whitecastle - but failed to pull any of it together. If you could imagine taking all the parts from the American Pie(s), Road Trip, Half Baked, Euro Trip, and others of the genre that were cut out for lack of humor, you get this movie. All the potential was there but this movie fell flat. If you are thinking about buying it, don't. Just watch Half Baked for the hundredth time and you will laugh more than you ever would watching Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle."},{"rating":"1","title":"More commedy for men","review":"Has anyone noticed that while women have advanced in dramas they are probably worse off than ever in commedies? Little more than playthings or opponents for men in virtually EVERY modern commedy, from Harold and Kumar to 40 Year Old Virgin, Beerfest, etc. I think women were stronger characters and got better lines in the old screwball commedies of the 1930s!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A stupid movie with cheesy jokes.","review":"I had high hopes for this movie, but it disapointed me very much. The jokes were really silly, and if I were 10 maybe I might find it amusing. The subject matter has appeal, but the movie is just a bub trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, why the pretension?","review":"This could have been a really fun movie and I am disappointed that it wasn't. Had it just stuck with the cheese-o-rama approach and showed high-ons cavorting through the night it would have warranted three stars and a smile, but it kept forcing some bogus social consciousness into the story. Disappointingly, this film has an all-too-predictable politically correct edge to it. All of the white characters, and I mean all of them, from the snowboard dudes to the cop, are offensive and racist; whereas, all of \\"people of color\\" are good. It's absolutely ridiculous and reaches a low point when Harold runs into a guy who's in jail for \\"being black.\\" Yawn. Come on, make a movie about slackers about slackers and not about some half-wit trendy ideology steeped in bashing whitey. Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda should not be the target audience for a film with a premise like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupid but funny","review":"If you liked the humor in the Revenge of the Nerds movies you should definately like this one. This movie is so stupid but has some gut-wrenchingly funny parts nonetheless.There are a lot of stereotypes (racial profilers, Indian convenience store guys, etc.) thar are played out well in a humorous way.No matter how far the pair travel, they seem to run into the same people are end up back at some of the same places. And yes, the movie did make me make a trip to White Castle, where I hadn't been there in a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for selling white castle burgers,AND THAT'S IT!","review":"This movie had a couple of funny parts, but basicallyit sucked.

Their adventures were silly, outlandish, gross and just plain laugh-out-loud fun.I loved the way this under-represented segment of the population was shown to be just as party loving as the rest of us.These guys are my new heros and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh and doesn't mind some gross humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd premise, but entertaining film.","review":"If you live within driving distance of a White Castle (or Krystal), and can watch this movie WITHOUT having to get in the car and go there to have dinner (or lunch, or a midnight snack) when it's over... well, you're a stronger man than I am.Yes, it's silly. Sometimes dumb. Sometimes downright stupid. But it's very, very entertaining, and that's what a movie is supposed to be. The point of the film is that, sometimes, when life is kicking us in the teeth, we just have to grin and continue on towards a goal. Harold & Kumar's goal? A meal at White Castle. And while several (and I mean *several*) obstacles try to prevent them from reaching that goal, they rarely lose focus.If only we all had that degree of intensity... and if only the \\"prize\\" we're all looking for was as satisfying as a White Castle when you're really craving them...Definitely worth a rental if you've never seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious","review":"this movie is so funny i watch it and before i did i thought it would be some dumbass movie about two idiots doing nothing but its not like that these two guys smoke weed in their apartment then they figure that they would wantto eat something other then what they had so they see a commercial for white castle burgers so they go off looking for this place that is only 45 mins. away. but it ends up taking many hours it is so freakin funny you have lived til you seen this halarious movieWATCH IT!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great MOVIE!","review":"I saw this movie when it came out and it is real GOOD.

There are many, many better and funnier movies to spend your time with.This movie is all over the map with little to really to bring it all together, almost as if the writer/director decided to simply throw a lot of random and what they thought would be funny moments together (ohh, he gets bitten by a raccoon, ohh, this really ugly guy has a pretty wife, ohh, Dougie Howser!) It just seems like what it is, a bunch of random events overdone to try and get laughs.Pass on this one unless you watch it stoned, maybe its better that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I loved this dvd, very funny and definitely worth keeping, I also purchased the follow up dvd too, no regrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Very simplistic review here:As a fan of comedy, this movie sucked.

It turned out to be worse than I could have imagined. The movie is about drugs, drugs and more drugs and there is nothing funny about it. White Castle hamburgers make an appearance at the end but mostly it is drugs the Asian characters want. They smoke marijuana all the time which is not like any Asians I know. The white people in the movie are always calling Asians names but that is not like any white people I know either. In the real world, it is only the Black and Spanish that have called me names because I am Asian. I would only recommend this movie if you think it is funny to watch Asian people smoke marijuana."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG, stupid crap!!","review":"This is the stupidest, sh*ttiest piece of crap I have ever watched.

How the hell can anyone enjoy this movie? It's a dude movie, and it SUCKS. The humour is obvious, dry, and the plot is just stupid. Don't waste your money on this. Heck, don't waste your time.

Armstrong went to the moon. Harold and Kumar go to White Castle.This is a silly, escapist film. There are several hilarious bits. John Cho(Harold) and Kal Penn (Kumar) are skillful actors. They are spot-on, I believe, as they play two twenty-something guys looking for a good time. Things don't always work out as planned, but Harold and Kumar don't do much planning anyway. It's a free-fall (hang-glide) into burger land or it's the munchies gone wild.What I like about this film is that it absolutely does not pretend to be anything it is not. No hidden agenda. There's a lot of smoke, but it doesn't hide the fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addittion to any kitchen!","review":"As I get more into cooking, I find that having the proper tools is key to turning out some amazing food.

Also, the round Lodge 10 1/4\\" cover works great on this.

The cast iron holds heat well and provides the best indoor equivalent of a traditional outdoor grill. Like all Lodge products the quality is high and the cooking performance is excellent. The only major limitation, and the reason for the four star rating, is the time required to effectively clean the surface. While not particularly difficult, the cleaning process is time consuming as the relatively high sides of the pan limit brush access to the ends of the raised grill segments. Not a huge deal, but it does make you think twice about using the pan when a flat grill can be used. It is, however, a good alternative for a wide variety of applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for electric range","review":"Just a warning-- I would caution against using this type of pan on an electric range.. I mistakenly bought it and found out that you have to be careful when cooking cast iron pots and pans on an electric range because the burners create hot spots that can cause the pans/pots to crack..

The skillets are wonderful, but the Amazon packaging was TERRIBLE. The skillets were essentially stacked one ontop of another - the whole five with minimal separation in the center, then the whole lot thrown in a box with very little packing material and the skillets slid and bumped on into each other. The bottom skillet arrived with one of its handles broken off - keep in mind that they skillets weigh about 7 lbs EACH. Some of the other skillets had pieces of their \\"Pre-Seasoned\\" surface rubbed or knocked off. We were sent a return lable via internet and returned the broken skillet -- we have now been told that Amazon is sorry but has no more and will refund $3.39 (I think). If that was the case there was very little reason to spend the money returning the broken skillet other than to keep a computer happy.

It's too heavy for most normal cupboard shelves.A large stainless one pot is more versatile & produces no more grease than this grill pan.Skip any of the tv's creative ideas of adding tomatoes, onions ect with chicken breast in one pan. Creativity is done for by comparison.

Manyof his stories about everything from his war record tohis Bushman connections were exaggerated or just plaininvented. People loved to hear this stuff about the greatwhite hunter, the ancient heart of Africa, blah blah blah.To his credit, he did oppose apartheid.If you want an readable book on the Bushmen, try ElizabethMarshall Thomas' \\"The Harmless People\\". At least she actuallyknew them!BTW The film is called \\"The Lost World of the Kalahari\\",BBC 1958. Don't know if you can get it on video.

I ordered this copy to replace the one I lent to my professor of African Studies at the Air Force War College (which he kept).

By the time anthropologists and, later, dna-scientists became fascinated by Bushmen, they could no longer hunt as they could when Laurens visited them. Laurens describes the Bushmen and their way of life with intimate care, relating to them as one human being to another. Not like a scientist studying an \\"object\\". He is also a good writer, for example when he describes the eland-hunt. I loved to read this book while travelling through Southern Africa. Especially for travellers to Okavango & surroundings, this is a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Almost the entire book is wasted on the details of his trip to find the bushmen.

We have used other similar items in the past and are very familiar with following instructions and identifying the readiness of the dough consistency. This machine was very difficult to gage. We spent nearly 10 pounds of flour and one dozen of eggs attempting in several tries to have the machine extrude the dough through the disk with no success. Needless to say, we are very disappointed and resorted to the good old fashion hand- crank dough machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not make usable pasta","review":"While it is sturdily constructed, this machine just woul dnot make any usable pasta.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy pasta maker","review":"My Simco pasta machine broke a few years ago after giving me many years of great pasta.

This is the worst product I have ever purchased in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waist of time","review":"This machine is totally a waste of time, you would never ever make a pasta in 15 minutes, you would make the pasta in 4-5 hours. The mesurements of the flours and eggs would never make the appropiate mixture. After lossing your 5 hours to make the mixture, you get the second problem, the mix would not get in the hole so the pasta can get the form you want b/c is to dry for the mixture to go down that hole. If you want fresh pasta you are better off buying a manual machine and do it your self, or better yet go to the supermarket and they would have fresh pasta on the fridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally a good machine!","review":"I am Italian and make fresh pasta at least once a week. When we bought our first electric pasta machine (Popeil) I was simply thrilled at the ease and quickness of the process. But these first machines were unable to withstand real use- we burned out motors, had parts fail, and went through 3 machines over 10 years before I finally decided to 'bite the bullet\\" and but a higher caliber (and priced) machine. We've had it about 6 weeks now and I have to say it was definitely worth it. Easy to use, clean, strong - seems like it may be able to take on my family use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stripped 2 blades","review":"I bought this based on the reviews and metal parts...but the shaft is metal and the blade that moves the dough around is plastic...inside as well where it sits on the shaft. The shaft has rounded 2 blades now...I can't afford to spend 25$ on a new shaft every time I make pasta. The pasta turns out great, so I don't think it's a consistency issue, but I'm sure that is what they will blame it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like fresh pasta","review":"I received this as a Christmas gift. I have used it to make spaghetti. Having read the other reviews, I followed the recipe carefully, weighing the flour as suggested. The result was perfect pasta. The only complaint I have is the recipe book included with the Pastamaster is a little vague as to how much pasta the recipes will make. I ended up with a LOT of spaghetti from my first attempt. I looked for a book for pasta machines, and found one on Amazon. The Pastamaster has a little booklet that shows other extruder plates you can purchase. I have already picked out a couple I want to order. Looking forward to lasagna next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all-in-one pasta maker","review":"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter & son in law. Each time they've used it, the pasta has come out perfect & delicious. It's convenient that the dough can be made in the same machine as the expeller. The dough mixer is a little louder than a stand mixer...not too loud but not super-quiet either. Clearer instructions would've been nice, a video link even better. There was uncertainty on what the dough should look like. Maybe there's something on YouTube that would assist the first-time pasta maker on what the dough's consistency should be. They must've figured it out, because the pasta was delicious. Other than the instructions, a great machine. Fresh homemade pasta is so much better than dried store-bought!Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"No!","review":"It would not push the dough through the extruded. We had to return it.

Just follow the instructions to a t and it works great. I do suggest cutting their recipes in half tho. The included recipes yield a huge amount of pasta.There isn't much info on the web about this pasta maker. I had hoped that there would be a related web site but all I found were a couple of reviews and a pdf version of the included instruction pamphlet.All in all, I am very happy with my purchase.

The film, shot in Melbourne, copped bad reviews at a time when Aussie comedy was not flavour of the month with Australian film reviewers or film goers.Fast forward to 2009, Isla Fisher is a Hollywood star, and the Wannabes has been re-released with a brand new title and cover artwork, marketing Fisher as the star of the film for the benefit of the yanks or anyone else who may have missed the film the first time around.

I was moved by the story line and also by the music that was used during the movie. Kenny G's music is perfect for this kind of movie.

I saw the movie \\"Dying Young\\" two times and think that the two main actors Julia Roberts and Campbell Scott have done an extraordinary job in it. If you love romantic music and the music from Kenny G, well this is THE CD for you. If you have seen the movie, you can picture the scenes, especially when you listen to the track \\"Driving North/Moving In\\".

This book has a lot of good information, nice background reading, more explanation on looms, structure, color theory, and things like that, but the patterns are more complicated to weave, and frankly are really out dated. I did not find any of them to be inviting to actually do the project as they all looked like they were from the 60s.The book is a good resource, however, if you want to read more on looms and drafting basics and other reference information on rigid heddle weaving.

I was starting to believe that no one had written a book on this piece of equipment I had bought. I found her book very good for beginning weavers such as myself. It goes through putting the warp on the hettle to having small projects to take you through creating woven pieces.When you don't have a teacher available, or need a refresher, this is a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Book There Is","review":"When it comes to rigid heddle weaving, this is the only reference there is, unless you want to turn to a video. The author is complete and communicates clearly through the text. The illustrations are a bit confusing until you actually go through the steps and then it all becomes clear. The color photographs are beautiful. I've had only this book to teach me to use my loom and it's been more than enough. I would like to see more books on rigid heddle weaving, but I suppose it's not in fashion, so we'll all have to wait until it becomes popular.The projects in the book go through a logical progression from simple to difficult and the results are lovely. Each and every project turns out just as the pictures show if you follow the directions. My selvage edges are certainly not as even as the author's but that's a matter of practice and experience. I've been waiting for three years for Ms. Davenport to come out with a second volume, but so far, it looks like this is going to be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rigid Heddle Weaving","review":"Excellent rendered illustrations of process & equipment; good color photgraphs of projects and easy to follow directions.

Painters like Taylor, Truidgen and others continue to set the standard in historically correct military aviation art.His attention to detail is superb and the paintings are centered around a certain pilot or group of pilots during W.W.II. Many of his paintings are signed by the pilot or pilots portraided in the paintings. Most are paintings of aircraft that are close to the ground, like returning flights of planes getting ready to land or takeoff in a historical setting.The book gives blown up details of parts of the paintings and examines historical details not readily noticeable in the overall paintings. Taylor spends time telling the story, how he painted the scenes, and the research required for each painting.The price is a little steep, but well worth the purchase if you are a aviation collector, especially if you don't have the money to collect the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantasy","review":"If you don't have the money to buy an original painting of Robert Taylor, but you want to see his works, this book is absolutly fantastic.You can look to the prints for hours, using your fantasy how it was/is to be a combat pilot.But, do not not expect it to be a book with a lot of prints.This is just a selection of one of the most beautiful prints.This is really a book you can look in from time to time and turn yourself into another fasinating world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick education about home-buying","review":"I looked over a stack of books about how to buy a home, and chose this one because it was the shortest! Since I made up my mind to buy a home, I wanted to do it now, and I wanted to equip myself with knowledge fast! Everything is here in a concise step-by-step format for the process of planning expenses, finding and evaluating a home, dealing with the seller and the real estate agent or broker (never knew there was a difference in them before), making an offer and a contract, getting a loan, going to escrow and closing. Many terms I only had a vague understanding of before are much clearer (and in case I forget, there's a glossary of terms in the back of the book), and I have a good idea of how to proceed and what I'll be encountering. Having this knowledge makes me feel as I step into this venture that I will be in control of what I'm doing, and not be at the mercy of sellers or agents.The author really knows her subject, and I'm grateful for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"wished i'd had years ago","review":"i bought a tiny place with a hot water heater in plain site in the kitchen. i got the rheem tankless mainly because it was small and could hide inside a pantry cabinet.

The hero is the adorable Danny, who dreams of becoming a movie star. The backup cast is just as enchanting, and are a little more jaded than the average cartoon character. The pacing is almost like speed, and it will sweep you up and hold you until the very end. If you want something deep, buy The Lion King.

While it may have not been a box office success in 1997, the film has been praised by critics and fans alike, featuring the brilliant voice talents of Scott Bakula (Star Trek: Enterprise) and Jasmine Guy (A Different World), and deserves the title of animated cult classic. I've instantly fell in love with this film, the characters, the animation, and the songs (especially Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now) and my favorite characters are Danny, Sawyer, (the two of them make a wonderful couple.) and Pudge.

I find the recording outstanding, the work of Hal Isbitz passionate and delightful, and John Arpin's intepretation brilliant.

I found it so elegantly moving and lyrically beautiful. Upon further hearings, new nuances touch my ears because there is so much depth in its classical structure. I am listening more and more to contemporary classical music since it is being written more and more with the listener in mind, as opposed to being an intellectual pursuit that pleases no one but the composer. This album has knocked my socks off in its composition and Hal Arpin's interpretation. I am a librarian in a middle school and am constantly playing music of every kind both to expose and familiarize students with what exists. This piece will be a consistent must play.

Don't expect edge-of-your-seat scariness, but a decent time-passer that should give you a couple of jumps along with an entertaining story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The postscripts were a fab idea","review":"Clive James repeatedly asked: why did Primo Levi kill himself? I guess it never occurred to Clive that the simple pain of old age is enough to make anyone suicidal. Healthy youngish people always reveal their fatuous ignorance whenever they express shock about the suicidal tendencies of old people. Wondering why people kill themselves is a knee-jerk butt-backward approach. The real question you should be asking is: why *don't* people kill themselves? Clive finally turns realistic when he says: \\"For all we know, suicide is the mandatory escape route for anyone with clear sight, and the rest of us get to die in bed only because we have the gift of regrowing our cataracts from day to day.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware: These are NOT the original recordings!","review":"I knew it was too good to be true...

Since I got pregnant, none have tasted good... until I tried a Belly Bar! Tasty, decent balance of nutrients, and even some extra vitamins for those days when the prenatal horse-pill is just too much to swallow.Note, however, the Chocolate Toffee Crisp product page currently indicates that it's a 16 bar pack, but there are actually only 12 bars in the package, just like the other flavors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the chocolate?","review":"I was very surprised when I first tried these, because I was expecting delicious chocolate but instead they are somewhat flavorless.

However, since they were a little pricey, I wanted to eat what I had. Then the taste started to grow on me and now I love them. They are the perfect on-the-go bar, and with the extra folic acid, I can't go wrong. The only criticism I have is that they tend to be inconsistent, some have a little more intense flavor, and some tend to be a little bland. I love the chocolate toffee flavor, but the orange chocolate flavor is my favorite.

I made note of the reviewer from Russia and the reviewer who also made note of the Russian reviewer. Myself I haven't studied much about Russia, but I did think the names were rather odd.

I found myself very amused how the heroine in this book was portrayed and how she was placed in situation where all these men just want to kidnap her and somehow bed her. That is what I get mostly got out of this book, that Countess Synovea is an object of lust and thus her beauty is her curse...and that Colonel Tyrone just happends to be one of the man who lust after her and in the end loves her...and tries to protect her from all these men who wants to bed her.

IT was tedious to read but perservered. First of all the Names Tyrone and Synnovea, Uggghh! Some of the rest weren't even pronounciable.

When I found myself laid-up for 2 months in bed with a herniated disk in my neck, I tried to distract myself from the pain by reading something engrossing. I thought this would be the perfect solution. Really though, it was unbelievably tedious. I love historical novels, and romance all the better. The characters could have carried me away, but I agree with others that it dragged on and on and by the time I read for the 1000-th time how lovely Synnovea's creamy skin or gorgeous dress was, I wanted to scream.

It was much more fun to understand that the authour doesn't even realize the difference between Russian first-name, father's-name and family name, not speaking about the fact that she investigated absolutely absurd names for the characters.

It tried to be too much like Romancing the Stone but falls way short with the obvious low budget they had for this film. I guess they made it to make a bundle on DVD rental income-The outtakes in a lot of instances should have been left in and the alternate ending should have been the original ending. With these scenes added it might have been a somewhat decent movie. In its current state its hard to sit thru except for the beautiful lead actress.

I saw it in a video rental store and thought I'd try it. It was great. It's an action/adventure film and it moves really fast -- never a dull moment -- and has enough plot twists that its not predictable. The main character is a young woman who, as a suprise, decides to join her fiance on a business trip. When he's not where he's supposed to be, she goes to track him down and ends up involved in a revolution in a South American country. The cinamatography was fantastic, especially the cave scenes.

Furthermore, the spout is positioned EXTREMELY low: you can get a jigger/pony underneath it, but anything larger is an adventure. Finally, the \\"stem\\" isn't manufactured well: it had started to bend, thus degrading the performance of the gears even further, and when I tried to bend it back into shape with some gentle pressure, it actually snapped apart, destroying the juicer entirely.Save your $30."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good, lousy performer","review":"I had this item for approximately three weeks and it was broken by the fourth time I used it. The base opening is an awkward size making it hard to find a glass/cup to fit. The mechanism was not strong enough to withstand the force needed to extract the juice. As a result, the neck bent and after reshaping it a few times, it snapped in half. Their return policy is good but it is better to buy a different juicer all-together. The design is attractive.

If you need a small oven to function as an oven this will work great. The convection function (air flow) helps with that.Like all \\"toaster\\" ovens in this class, the problem is primarily the egg timer. That's all it is. It's a mechanical timer that has to be twisted enough to go through its full cycle (to zero and then ding). If you don't do that the oven shuts off and never reaches the end of the timer. Problem is, you end up burning your toast. A LOT. This toaster has sent more slices of bread to their grave than I can count.My recommendation: Don't get ANY toaster oven unless it is an electric timer that precisely measures the cooking time. These egg timer models are worthless as toasters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst \\"toaster\\" \\"oven\\" ever!","review":"About a couple of weeks after buying this toaster oven the convection fan started to rattle when in use. And not a low subtle rattle either - it was very loud. Then soon after, the door started to rattle due to the vibration the convection fan made when it rattled. I had to put a spoon in the door to at least prevent one of the noises while using the oven. The oven never really toasted at all and barely cooked very well.

After using it once, the door would not close so I exchanged it for the identical model. I had it for two weeks when the fan started rattling. Sometimes I wasn't even sure if the heating elements were working properly since I NEVER saw the bottom ones light up even though I tried various cooking settings. Also, the racks do not slide in and out easily which is annoying if you are dealing with hot food and you are struggling to pull out the rack.

The New Madrid earthquake, Indians, primitive living conditions and a host of other challenges spice the story of the historic voyage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Post Punk at it's Finest!","review":"If you like bands like Bauhaus, Joy Division, Interpol you are going to like Prosaics. As soon as I heard this band I had to go out and get this EP. They will soon have a full album in 2005 but prepare yourself for it by listening to this. The guitars are solid, vocals are real smooth and the melodies are so catchy. It is dark post punk but this band puts their own spin on that sound, and I highly suggest checking this out. These are 5 really strong songs, and people who have seen them live tell me that the best is yet to come. \\"Teeth\\" is such a cool track. If you like this band, Check out a band called the Organ.

The beats and guitar playing are what makes it different. On the first song, the title song it sound the same and then the vocals come in and the guitar player does this freaky thing that makes it sound way different. I think the 7th song, Whatever it Takes has some good lyrics, as all the songs do, and many are really heartfelt words and music that can speak to you or not.

Those are the only good factors. The middle led sticks out too far for it to sit on a table face down without wobbling. The tolerances of the seals are poor meaning that it leaks when submersed and causing the switch to be not needed. (if you screw the cap down close to when it comes on, all you need to do is press the end cap and the play in the threads acts as the switch.

It's only redemtive quality is that it is fairly bright."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This is a cheap flash light. It is bright, but the led bulbs burn out quickly. It is not water proof, it has no seals. The contact spring is extremely flimsy and you will have to find a way to keep the batteries touching the contacts. I had to use two nickels and it makes it quite heavy for its size. When the batteries start to die (after a short period) the flash light will turn off intermittently. Spend a couple more dollars and get something you will use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for home use","review":"This Flashlight is bright and very handy, so this would satisfy an average user. But I think it is inappropriate for them to use the word Special forces, cause military flashlights are far more powerful and they also cost you around 40-70$ at some online stores. But occasionally you can find them at ebay for 20-25$ including shipping.Finally, this is good for civilians but definitely not a military piece.This is my update.

Bad news! As reported in the previous review by E.A.P., the thing would not accept the DSL password and so could not connect to the ISP - end of story.Could be that the EE420-R would still work with broadband modem connections - I dunno.

It looked like a pretty solid product, so I wasn't concerned. But I have DSL, so out of three choices for configuration or set-up of \\"static\\", \\"dynamic\\", or PPOE, I have to go with the last. As the other reviewers indicated, the company is out of business, so the great \\"support\\" listed on the box is non-existant. That might not have been a problem, but it seems that the router needs some sort of validation from an outside \\"server\\" to configure itself, so that is probably why the device doesn't seem to accept my login and password for my Earthlink DSL account.

Do those words ever pop into your head: \\"what is love?\\". If so, you'll love this new cd by Haddaway.

Ever needed to hear more of it? Of course! This album explores many concepts, like love, questioning, and abuse.

On their debut album We Play For Pleasure, Dahlquist and co. get down with some inspired, old fashioned, no-frills rock and roll. The band, inspired by all-time greats MC5, Stooges, The Stones and The Faces, really sets out to have both fun and deliver a top notch performance. Thunder Express succeeds and as a result delivers a very satisfying CD. Some highlights are the heavy Stupid Lies, jumping Always Something New and great In My Mind.

This book is extremely accurate concerning the topography and the history of Montana. Many books don't have the day to day trials and tribulations involved in real life, as another reviewer wrote. One can feel the pain, sorrow, and joy when reading I'da Danced at His Hanging. I could not put the book down once started and knowing the area it was written about, I found myself walking and riding in the main characters place, in fact, when I drive by a place that was in the book and I relive that part of the story again. Having the book for a few short weeks it has been read twice now to update my memory on it. Also it has a very good moral theme through out. I would recommend this book to all western lovers, Christians and anyone that has a yearning for a bit of Montana."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Western that Deals with Spiritual Values","review":"Deals with the trials and tribulations of hardship in growing up; friendship experienced by a group of men who seemed to have little in common; the fears, desires, and attitudes of individuals who love the West and all the strength and beauty it represents. Cowboys and westerns are what we \\"baby boomers\\" grew up with each Saturday afternoon matinee. It is a wholesome story about men of various ages, their inter-relationships in adjusting to life. I recommend it for men and women alike who enjoy reading about life in earlier times in the western part of the United States. I also recommend it for young people (middle school and high school) for learning about different lifestyles and Christian values and influences on growing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom","review":"Even the youngest child \\"gets\\" this story of the letters of the alphabet who race each other up a coconut tree.

But no, this is a 2001 job and has no value at all. It's not scary. It's not funny. It's not sexy (though it is explicitly sadistic enough to fall in the category of pornography; I'm surprised Amazon even sells it). The acting and production values are atrocious. It's a miserable mess. I fast forwarded through most of it until finally I gave up on it. Simply unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone like this movie?","review":"About the only thing I can say that is good about this movie is that it is not hollywood, but really who cares? This is not a horror movie. In fact all it is is a cheap porn/snuff film that is pathetic because there wasn't even a good sex scene. It was not scary, it was not sexy, it did not shock me. I knew what was going to happen in every scene. Some scenes were drawn out for too long. In reality this movie could be made in one day, thats how stupid it was. PLEASE DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! It was a waste of time. I ended up fastforwarding through the whole thing. Maybe a little too much crystal meth and marajuana was involved in the making of the film and the proceeds should go to rehabilitation and incarceration of the creators of this movie.

What I pulled out of my mailbox today was a nothing more than, a dvd of a few friends getting together for three days and making a \\"movie\\". There was no quality in this thing. The sequences were drawn out, and often using the same shots over and over again. The editing was terrible, monkey cam, no continuity, the audio just sucked, not to mention the acting.To top it off, they have the directors commentary in the special features. It's with the director and the female star of the movie. They chat as if this movie was a serious project. All this amounts to is a porn with gore, content and quality. I should have given it two stars, because I guess it would get cool points at a party, so everyone could laugh at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!","review":"I rented (thank God) This film thinking it would be a decent remake of \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" Which was a fair B movie at best.

Try lying in bed with the one you love listening to this together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Sarah","review":"This is the best Sarah CD available. From \\"Possession\\" to \\"Fumbling..\\" everything is pure Sarah. Every single word on this CD touches one's soul. I played my cassette version of this until it could be played no more. This CD is the most powerful and emotional CD that I own and is Sarah's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I love this CD. Sarah truly shows off her talent in this one with a great variety of songs, unlike Sufacing, which was a great CD, but all the songs sounded pretty much the same, they were all sad and slow.

I listen to it over and over again in the car, never get sick of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"Sarah McLachlan has a voice that is simply beautiful and angelic. Out of all the female performers out there, I think her voice is by far the best one (just my opinion). She also has a remarkable songwriting ability. Of all her albums, this one is definitely my favorite one. Every song on here stands out on their own. It's hard to pick a favorite song, they're all equally as good, but I believe I'd have to say the title track and the piano/vocal version of \\"Possession\\" (the hidden track) are tied as my favorite. Also one of my faves is one that I think is quite overlooked, which is \\"Wait'. All of my aqcuaintances don't really dig it, but I think it's great. The whole album is just brilliant. It's not full of anger, just some music to soothe your soul. I'd really like a new album to come out soon, I'm in suspense to hear some fresh material. Also check out the collaboration she has done with Delerium (\\"Silence\\"), it's just as good, whether you like dance music or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timless Magnificence","review":"You know those songs that stay with you because of how they made you... feel? Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is the perfect collection of such beautifully threaded emotion. Hard pressed to choose a favorite, I will simply say each marriage of poetry and melody is a gift that seamlessly threads itself from beginning to end, making you yearn for more. Listening to McLachlan's voice is like wrapping yourself in silk. This CD is an essential piece to any easy listening collection, past present and future. A five star collection, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever...","review":"I must say that I've been Sarah Mclahlan fan for a while. For some reasons, I didn't own Fumbling towards Ecstasy. After reading other reviews I decided to buy one Cd, and I was amazed by the quality of this album. I agree that this is her best album ever... Afterglow is also a very good album, but to me Fumbling towards Ecstasy belongs in its own class. The music evokes sadness mixed with pure relaxation. This is a cd to listen to when you want a quite and relaxing time by youself. Pick any song and you'll enjoy Sarah Mclachlan quiet and inspiring lyrics.Just one sample from \\"elsewhere\\" lyrics...\\"the calm inside mein the space where I can breatheI believe there is adistance I have wanderedto touch upon the years ofreaching out and reaching inholding out holding in...\\"No much I can say beside that I LOVE this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Sarah album ever","review":"I got this album given to me and although I liked the only song I was familiar with (Good Enough) it sat on my shelf for about a year. My best friend then told me it was awesome and I should really listen to it, I did, it is now one of my favorite albums ever!! Every track is amazing, some took a while to grow on me (Circle, Mary, Ice Cream) but they did and I love them all. Possession is of course one of the highlights of this album. A powerful song that overwhelmes you. Fear, Ice, Hold On, Elsewhere, and Fumbling Towards Ecstasy are extraordinary.

Lyrical, harmonic, full of feeling and fun. I have all of her other CD's, and they're all very good, but there is something really special about this one. Do yourself a favour and spring for this one. It's fantastic, simply an amazing event."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no s after toward but this album is great","review":"Gorgeous music in here, I give it a 4.5. I disagree with the Amazon description that this album is \\"less polished\\", I find it just the opposite. The songs here have a perfect balance of emotion, subtlety, and mystery, and there are more layers in the music than all the albums that came after this one combined (to my ears). The only song I don't love is \\"Possession\\", which I find a little cheesy compared to the other tracks. It is a fun song but it just doesn't fit the mood when I feel like listening to this album. \\"Elsewhere\\" is amazing, one of my favorite songs by anyone. Lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Ecstasy","review":"Sarah McLachlan outdoes herself with this dynamic CD. The CD flows smoothly and easy to listen to. While performing some of her trademark songs, \\"Possession\\", \\"Good Enough\\", and the title song \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\", she also soars with lesser-known tunes such as \\"Mary\\", \\"Wait\\", \\"Circle\\", and \\"Plenty\\". She also performs the intense, \\"Hold On\\", and the care-free, \\"Ice Cream\\", and shows her talent for varying genres. Certainly full of dynamo, Ms. McLachlan defines what a great musician is."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best c.d.","review":"She has put out better music than this. I was disappointed with most of the tracks it didnt hold my interest. One or two good songs ."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you buy only one, get this one","review":"I used to listen exclusively to Sarah McLachlan. I got this album in 1995 and it spurred many emotions and encouraged me to start writing songs. Now, five years later, I'm dissapointed in the direction she's chosen. She seems to be very interested in making money and her music has reflected that (especially the shameless \\"Mirrorball\\"). \\"Fumbling...\\" is excellent and eclectic, with great songwriting and melodies that will always be influential to me. It's just a shame that I can barely look at someone who used to be my hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah McLachlan- Fumbling Towards Ecstasy","review":"You will be in ecstasy after hearing this emotionally demanding album. WOW. A journey like this is amazin. From so many perspectives the songs are. Like \\"Posession\\" is about a stalker. While \\"Hold On\\" is about someone dying of AIDS I believe. So, as one can see, the lyrics are ever so powerful with the amazing collaberation of music. Here is a breakdown.Possession- 5/5Wait- 5/5Plenty- 4.5/5Good Enough- 5/5Mary- 5/5Elsewhere- 5/5Circle- 5/5Ice- 4.5/5Hold On- 5/5Ice Cream- 5/5Fear- 5/5Fumbling Towards Ecstasy- 4.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timelessness is the only word to describe FTE","review":"Although this album is 6 years old, the songs still sound and have a contemporary feel. When I listen to them now, they do not have a dated sound. This album, in my opinion, showcases everything that makes Sarah McLachlan the talent she is: he voice, her musicianship, and her lyrics. This album is nothing short of solid. Personal favorites are \\"Possession\\", \\"Elsewhere\\", \\"Ice Cream\\", and \\"Plenty\\". I think that this is a must for any Sarah fan and a great start for a newcomer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bliss","review":"There are only about 10 CDs of all time that I can listen to straight through without skipping a song and this is without a doubt one of them.

From the opening notes of Possession, Sarah McLachlan pulls you into her world of ethereal, melancholy, dusky songs. Her voice is unique among the current group of female singer/songwriters, with more range and depth and desire than anyone else. She can be at turns sensual, lonely, pleading, dismissive and always lovely. The lyrics of these songs bleed into you with sadness, fire, and desperation. The music can be as spare as just Sarah and a piano or as lush as a deep toned organ, bass, drums, and a strange but inviting guitar. I love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"On my \\"My Fifteen Favorite Albums Ever\\" list","review":"This album is so emotionally powerful and exquisite that I find it hard to listen to. If I'm feeling depressed and alone in the world, and want to wallow, not distract myself, this is the first choice. The combination of McLachlan's beautiful emotive voice and clever songwriting with lush arrangements makes this album timeless and able to withstand unlimited listenings. And that's beside the fact that it helped propel the female alt-folk scene into the mainstream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best????","review":"This is the most acclaimed SM album, it got the highest ratings so I had to have it. But when I listened to it, I didn't find it to be remotely better than her other albums (I guess my expectation was too high because of the ratings). I find it to be harsher, more complicated, different and more well-flowed than her any other albums, but the BEST??? I don't know... I like her other albums equally. I think Surfacing and Afterglow are just as good and am shocked to see Afterglow not getting at least 4 1/2 stars. So sure, you guys can go ahead and say this album is her best, I won't argue. But review readers, please don't miss out on her other albums just because this one is rated the highest, because then you don't know what you're missing, believe me. Sarah Mclachlan has NEVER disappointed me and she won't disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"A work of art. My best friend's wife turned me onto this on (Thanks,Tamara!). Possession, Ice Cream, Plenty & Fumbling Towards Ecstasy are my favorites, but there is not a bad track on this one.

I am not a huge fan of Mclachlan's later work but I must say that if you're a female and you don't own this album you better get it! I listen to every song on here. The lyrics are poignant, moving and easily relatable. It's a must have!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only the Best","review":"This album is one of Sarah's best, if not the best. I have had this CD countless years running and have yet to tire of it. I still find new meaning in her songs when I listen and have never been disappointed when it comes to her music.If you have not yet listened to any of her CDs, this is the perfect starting point (this or Mirrorball). Her lyrics send meaningful messages without being cheesy or redundant like too many of the songs out there today.The song Possesion was actually written from the perspective of obsessive fans. Hold On was inspired by the documentary, A Promise Kept. The song was written in one day.This CD is like light and dark, both blending into one fantastic album. Once you get a taste of Sarah, you have to have more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best CD in the world!","review":"Sarah McLachlan is the best thing out of Canada since Hockey! Her voice is beautiful, her lyrics are powerful and playful. I loved this album! Song like Possesion and Ice Cream should get her into the Rock'n'Roll hall of fame, right next to the Beatles."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Classic Album of the Decade","review":"With lyrics that at the same time charm, delight and silence into wondering, Mclachlan captures both the mystery and angst of modern times and humms it up into a gorgeous and intense album. There isn't a song on here that fails to deliver; it's just pure bliss to behold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this cd!","review":"I bought this cd because I was watching Roswell and \\"Fear\\" is the song they play when Max heals Liz and the song just took my breath away.

This is absolutely a must have buy it today if you do not already have it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fumbling Towards Ecstacy","review":"This is by far her best album. It is a record you can play from beginning to end with no song skipping. Dreamy and passionate."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever recorded in the history of music","review":"I have been a fan of Sarah's since 1992, and have always been blown away by her flawless and unique voice. Since then, I have seen her four times in concert (trust me, she's not just great in the studio--her live stuff sounds just as good), and own every album and b-side she's ever recorded. She is on my list along with Lisa Gerrard, Enya, Caroline Lavelle, Kirsty Hawkshaw, and Loreena McKennitt for best female vocalist of all time. Fumbling is Sarah at her best (although I love all of her stuff). From start to finish, this album is perfection. When I bought it when it was first released years ago, I don't think I took it out of my CD player for 2 years straight. I've listened to these songs so much that they've become ingrained in my psyche. This is an album that people of all stipes and likes will love. If you have not heard it yet, fork over the cash, because you will be amazed by the talent of this artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Ecstasy","review":"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is an album full of raw emotion and beauty. The first track, Possession, gives the listener a taste for what's next to come. However, since it's Sarah McLachlan, only beautiful music can be found on this cd. Fear is a spine-tingling track, Hold On grabs at your heart-strings, and Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is an inspirational song, highlighted by McLachlan's beautiful vocals. While this isn't my favorite Sarah cd, (that goes to either Surfacing or Solace) pick Fumbling Towards Ecstasy up, as this is pure ecstasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the important releases of the decade.","review":"Well...since I've written about all the other albums she's put out....This is a landmark release, not only for the music that it contains, but as one of the defining moments in rock history when women artists were no longer considered a novelty act. Not only were they bankable, but were true artists.This album is full of textured, emotional songs, impecably arrainged & produced. The most noticable thing is her vocal delivery. She had always been a good vocalist on her first 2 albums, but here they're delivered with such emotion, sensuality & depth that it's easy to get pulled into it. And it's that delivery that seperated her from the pack.Why don't you own this one already?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph","review":"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy is an absolute masterpiece.

This is one of Sarah's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Fumbling towards ecstasy cd","review":"Strangely, when I play this cd on grooveshark, (which is where I first heard it and then decided to buy it) it actually is a completely different cd than the one sent to me. I conclude, since the one that was sent was in a broken opened case, that it was actually a replacement cd of an odd remix that I do hate.I am unsatisfied"},{"rating":"2","title":"raw yet polished","review":"this album is the mark of an artist who has mastered both writing and producing music. though she still had her trademark \\"mclachlan rawness\\", her voice and lyrics exuded a sort of defiant confidence without sounding cocky (read: oasis). in the way that surfacing is polished and another step in her unimaginable development, \\"FTE\\" shows us the sarah that attains musical ecstasy without fumbles"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"Sarah has a pretty voice, but I just find this music sort of cheesy -- the kind of lush, overly deliberate beauty that reminds me of relaxation tapes of Pachelbel's Canon in D set against ocean sounds, with high school poetry lyrics. It's stuff like \\"If I shed a tear, I won't cage it, I won't fear love!\\" and \\"Morning smiles the face of a newborn child, innocent, unknowing.\\" Yuck. I don't know; I say if you want to hear a genuinely beautiful female singer/songwriter, go for something like Patty Griffin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"would have given it one star but I think I've heard one or two worse singers than Sarah McLachlin. Her songs are not insightful, she has a raspy voice (why do people like this?) and she doesn't seem like a very nice person. It's not the worst cd I have, but there are SO many better singers out there, why waste money on this one? I suppose I have to admire what she has done with Lilith Fair, although there are many other women working just as hard as her, and just don't get recognized. I do like one or two of her songs, but even they become way overplayed and boring after awhile. I wouldn't waste my time or money on this cd... but then again I could name worse ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fumbling towards mediocrity","review":"Many moons ago, around the time of her first release Touch, Sarah McLachlan had the makings of a really interesting artist as a singer and songwriter. She was gigging at cool university bars. Campus radio stations would play her and consider her slightly alternative. At first blush, Sarah McLachlan could have taken her career in any direction. She chose the popular chanteuse route and hence the dreck she releases today is the kind of music your dentist prefers in the background as he drills holes in your molars. Artistically, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy was the beginning of the end for Sarah McLauchlan. The songs are mostly weak; the muddied, unsympathetic production by Pierre Marchand is simply dreadful. Save your hard earned money and buy the Cowboy Junkies great new album Demons or just about anything by Kate Bush or Margot Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure trash","review":"This has to be one of the worst \\"wailer/whiners\\" of all time. I refuse to say \\"singer\\" because that she is not. She sounds too breathy and reminds me of a poor animal that has just become roadkill and is gasping that last breath. Stick with Tori Amos if you like female vocals and pianos, this is a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply GREAT...","review":"I fell in love with her voice, her songs and her music the first time I heard her, when I was living in the States. Enchanting, enthralling, sensitive... that's \\"Fumbling towards Ecstasy\\" for me. Unfortunately, she's not very well known in France, she would deserve it though. Anyway, next time I go to the States, I'll get her last CD which should be just as great.I expect a concert in Paris sometime in the future... Sarah is truly the best of all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and soothing","review":"If her voice doesn't make your heart melt, you're not a straight human male :) . What a gorgeous voice Sarah has, and she writes cool songs and lyrics as well. Sarah is one of those gifted musicians who just emote musical talent. She blows away crappy Canadian artist Celine Dion who gave Canada a BAD name in music as far as I'm concerned. This CD is a great addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethereal","review":"For someone who is heavily into techno/ electronica/alternative/metal music, I just had to put my two cents in here. Sarah's voice is beautiful, her lyrics are moving, her piano playing is intense. This is definitely an album everyone should own. \\"Fear\\" literally sends shivers down my spine each and every time I hear it. Do your entire body a favor...go out, buy this ablum, grab a glass of wine, light some candles, slide into bathtub and lose yourself in her voice. (\\"company\\" optional, but highly recommended!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Combination","review":"The video documentary disc is the real jewel in this 3-pack. I gifted this set so I don't recall if the Freedom Sessions disc included all the rom-interactive features like the copy I bought singly back in the 1990's. Nevertheless, the Freedom song versions are just one more way to enjoy a landmark collection of great tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"reasonably impressed","review":"I would actually give this album a 3.5 out of 5 stars for little reasons that are to do with my own expectations in music, but Sarah delivers very nicely with this album. Possession, Ice Cream, and a couple others are among my favorites wit this album. Sarah's album \\"surfacing\\" is perfect in my opinion, while her two albums that came prior to \\"Fumbling towards Ecstasy\\" seemed less interesting, yet nonetheless recognized her talent. I would recommend this album for anyone who enjoys adult contemporary music, and where this genre collides with pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best","review":"This is the Sarah CD that I love the best. All songs are great. She has a beautiful voice and she's a great songwriter !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sara is really great at what she does","review":"In a business being recently overrun by over-marketed and packaged artists (i.e. Britney Spears, 'N sync, etc.) it sure is great to be able to turn to cd's bearing real music. This is definately one of the best examples of \\"real music\\". I mean no disrespect to Ms. Spears and those other artists, but there is just something about Sara's music that sets her apart from other people. Fumbling toward ecstacy is a perfect example of her poetic talents; the lyrics are so deep and the words just seem to flow...her voice is just so beatiful, and, while this album may not have received as much attention as Surfacing, I like it just as much. My favorite songs are Possesion, both the piano version and the original, and Ice. I really hope that Sara will continue to showcase her amazing writing talents and release another album."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album","review":"I have owned this CD for over two and half years and still listen to it more than any other.

Talk about a dull, uninspired recording! The only song worth anything on this record is the first one, the beautiful \\"Possession.\\" After that, however, it's Sleep City - BIGTIME!!To be fair, Sarah M. writes ethereal, piano-sprinkled tunes that can strike a nerve every so often. Plus, her lyrics are indeed heartfelt, and for that I commend her. Nonetheless, whatever happened to Lauper's famous motto: \\"Girls just wanna' have fun!\\" Sarah M. seems to be just the opposite: \\"Girls just wanna have depression!\\"Well, at any rate, it's better than April Lavigne or Nickelback.PEACE 'EM UP!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fecus","review":"From start to finish this album is an amorphous blob of wishy-washy sound. The lyrics seem like they should have a strong, assured message, but end up being nebulous and fakey. The only thing this cd is good for is a coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album by Sarah","review":"I literally \\"stumbled\\" onto this album when it first came out. I still wake up occasionally singing these songs. The artwork is brillant, the lyrics are incredible, the music is perfect. If I were to write an album, this would be it. This was before \\"Lilith Fair\\" and everyone jumping on Sarah's back to sound just like her. I don't care for \\"Surfacing\\" nearly as much as this album. I had an old VHS tape orignating from a Canadian concert she put on and it was incredible. I saw her with the Chieftons a year or so following this album and was blown away my her performance. I haven't heard much that still stands up almost 10 years later. This is one great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Longevity, personal, and perfect","review":"I have own this CD since 1994(?) and it is still in my CD player. In fact, I think I'm on my 6th copy because every time I lend it, I never get it back. Too bad I don't remember who borrows it.Sarah's best work and far superior to her other albums. If there's a perfect CD, this is it. This album is meant to be experience in its entirety and not with only certain songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of all time...","review":"This is the first album I could ever leave in the tape player in my car to just play over and over. There is only one song I would ever skip past, and even that song is not all that bad. Her voice is so phenominal and the music is touching. Even songs that the lyrics arent so deep (i.e. Ice Cream) the melody makes it be a great song nonetheless. If you like Tori Amos, Sting, or just about anybody, you'll love this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the finest record I've ever heard","review":"This album has been at the top of my list of all-time favorites since I bought it 4 years ago. She taps into feelings of yearning and loss with lyrics that are some of the best I've heard. On this album, she resembles Joni Mitchell (another incredible Canadian) in the way she lays her emotions right out on the table. And the production is dark, moody and atmospheric. Absolutely amazing. This is as good as it gets, folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an a amazing album","review":"I can hardly begin to describe what this album means to me. Her voice is one thing, but her emotion is another. I believe that this women is up there with the few in the music industry who are really artist. I believe that it takes a lot of courage to put your self on the line emotionally the way Sarah does. Every song on this cd is one masterpiece after the other. Intense lyrics, perfectly tuned voice, and incredible emotion all lye within this brilliant work on musical art."},{"rating":"2","title":"It easily becomes an addictive","review":"I just bought this album 2 days ago and already I played it over and over and over again. This is my 3rd Sarah's collection, I first have Surfacing and Mirrorball so I've heard few songs in this CD. But still it was different from the live version. My favorite CD is Surfacing but this one is also marvelous. I love the song \\"Hold On\\" and \\"Blue\\" which is a bonus-track. Sarah McLachlan is one of the best female musician ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"sarah","review":"sarah has a dark and heavy edge this album opened doors for me and helps me understand different genres her voice is angelic yet still rockin ben"},{"rating":"2","title":"Expanding stock ability","review":"This is a nice unit for people who wish to have bluetooth (as well as MP3 interface) in older Chrysler units that isn't available otherwise.

Some twenty years ago I started to be intrigued by her voice, but these were always just brief moments of thrill. The problem was that I had picked the wrong times in her career: too early and you're stuck with gospel music (which I happen too enjoy at most in church, but not on records), too late and it's bland disco. In particular, in the present compilation spanning 1980-1994, \\"Another Night\\" remains the only OK track, once you've experienced the real Aretha. For me that happened recently when I bought (after listening to many 30 second sound bites) the 4cd collection \\"Queen of soul\\" (the Atlantic recordings). These cds capture her at the peak of her power (1967-1974). This is R&B with FIRE. With me and A.F. it works like this: the harder the better. (In her slow songs there always is a kind of Gospel feeling that I dislike; as opposed to e.g. Ashford&Simpson who did gorgeous slow ballads.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No jumpin' jack flash","review":"I bought this cd for getting 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' no 16 on the list stated on this page.

That said, this is one of the least listenable of his works, and quite divergent from anything he's done in the past. I would NOT suggest getting this CD if you don't own at least the five previous CD's, or even his very early work. It is not indicative of his style or sentiment, but rather an interesting if unsuccessful foray into middle-eastern-influenced music. It's for his most (blindly?) ardent fans only, lacking in the meditteranean beauty of harmony and melody that so characterizes this otherwise superb artist.

That is wrong. \\"My\\" is not at all in the Hebrew.I could have let that go, since it is a common, but wrong, view.But then I saw Unger use the word \\"Jehovah\\" for God's sacred name, which is an error dating from the Reformation. The vowel signs are for the name \\"Adonai\\", signaling the scroll reader to speak \\"Adonai\\" in place of the sacred name for God. It was mistakenly translated as \\"Jehovah\\" when the vowels were mistakenly combined with those 4 consonants.Any beginning Hebrew student learns about this.

I always had the feeling that Gaudi should have had stamped on it \\"Warning! Contractual obligation!\\", and I was worried that Mr. Parsons was going to follow up that iffy album with something equally sketchy. Not to worry. Try Anything Once is bold, fresh, crystal clear, refreshing and as always, impeccably produced. Good variation in soundtracks, good rythms, slight pop appeal without any effort at pop appeal. A must-have for the collection.* Not that everything they put out during that time was good. \\"Eve\\" is a standout album only in the sense that it shows how even APP can lose the big picture in search of it, and let theme overcome both substance and pop appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"It arrived...finally","review":"Took a while, but I got what I wanted.

Like researchers before him, the author missed this glaring truth.Here are two hints of Kilpatrick's character and performance: (1) His men held him in such high esteem that they petitioned Lincoln to have him promoted to general (a rare occurrence in the CW); and (2) after the battle of Gettysburg his men presented their commander with a Damascus sword in appreciation for his leadership on July 3.In short, an author who doesn't dig deeper than his predecessors is dancing to the worn-out tune of incredulity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't order!","review":"I have very wavy hair and these rollers didn't smooth out the waves and added more frizz.

The last song on the CD is one of my all time favorites by any artist of any era. It is a wonderful song written and performed by Carly Simon entitled \\"Never Been Gone.\\" This is a wonderfully rich and evocative song about Carly's return to her island home on Martha's Vineyard. Written by Carly on her trip on the Martha's Vineyard Ferry called Island Home, it always transports me back to that wonderful island as soon as a close my eyes. The other cuts of the cd also have a particular island summer feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst instructional book ever.","review":"Both of these books by Roger Filiberto are terrible.

Then, during one of her rides, the horse flipped over frontwards and my toddler landed on her head and neck. In my opinion, the rockers on the horse are not designed properly if an 18 month old rider can cause the horse to flip over. The horse was assembled properly and my daughter was being supervised at the time of her \\"riding accident.\\" This was one of our favorite toys, but after seeing how she fell, I feel that she could have really been hurt. So, unfortunately, we are going to have to put this horse down--as a riding toy, the wheels don't cut it. When I put the wheels down, my daughter just gets frustrated that she can't get the horse to rock anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy for a 1 year old....","review":"We purchased this toy for my 1 year old, she's always climbing on her stuffed animals. She has been playing with it non-stop since Christmas. Great value versus paying $80++ for a similar and bigger one she wouldn't be able to mount by herself. It's the perfect size for her, the transition from rocking to rolling is easy. She loves to ride on it and push it. My 4 and 3 year old play on it also. Easy to assemble, the horse is very comfy.

One of the problems is if you hit someone with a chair they die in one hit yet it takes 8-10 hits to kill someone with a machete. and to add insult to injury it takes 2-4 shot to kill someone with a gun even if you shoot them in the head. LucasArts need to get their prioratys straight, a gun and a machete are more lethal than a chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok start, horrible finish","review":"I would have given this game a high review over its first half.However, this \\"game\\" quickly goes from fun to work. As others have said, the controls are mediocre, and the character is stupid... the puzzles are trivial... so the \\"game\\" quickly becomes a chore of boring/painful levels where death is constant due to Indy's desire to take swan dive off of high places.The designers were simply not up to the task. They don't understand the difference between making a game more challenging versus simply more difficult. Combined with its horrible visuals on the PS/2, and it simply becomes a painful chore to complete.All I can say is that I completed it, and that day took it and sold it and wish I had never started playing it... a shame because until it became a ridiculous exercise in arcade jumps and way over the top super natural ridiculousness, it was pretty enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid game for Indy fans, but ends undramatically.","review":"Many have already written on this game, so I'll try to avoid repeating what they've said, but ultimately, this game starts out strong and entertaining enough, but settles into a middle-ground groove that's neither bad, nor great, but not all too awe-inspiring as the game goes on.The voice actor for Indiana Jones is passable, but not too convincing -- you can tell it's not Harrison Ford.And unsurprisingly, it dusts off the long-lived stereotype of the dragon lady and at the end, Indiana gets the Asian (i.e. Chinese) girl, even though there's no plausible reason for her to have any sort of feelings for him -- she's little more than a toy doll for him to have his way with.The ending is dull -- both the final boss battle and the ending cinematic are little reward for having ran, swung, punched and kicked your way through level after level, trap after trap.Good if you're an Indiana Jones fan, but others should either rent or stay away altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"How typically American","review":"The trailer sure looks exciting, and coming from Lucas Arts, the game has to be good. Yet hold on...are these ponytails I see those Chinese bearing? I thought the story happend in the year of 1935, and the ponytail had already been abandond for more than two decades! Even if the stereotypical depiction was not intended as an insult, the bummer itself will be embarassing enough for Lucas Arts."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Adventure has a name, it must be...Indiana jones!","review":"This game is awesome. The controls are easy to learn, and the gameplay is great! This game does have some cons though. But we'll get to those later. The game consits of 9 different missons. Each misson is divided up into a random amount of levels. The game has 51 levels total. The 9 missons take you to these places as follows: Ceylon(9 levels), Prauge(13 levels)Istanbul(7 levels), and Hong Kong(4 levels) Yes, I know that's only 4 missons. That's because I'm currently in Istanbul. The guys you fight at the beginning of the game are wimps, but the enemies gradually get stronger as the game continues.The voice overs are superb, and the combat is even better. Want to get a taste of it? In Prauge I snuck up on a guard who was overlooking a ledge. I then shot him with my pistol. He fell overboard. Cool,huh? Now for the cons:No Save Points!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Every time you die you have to start at the beginning of the level.Other then that, fun game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lil children","review":"Bought this game influened by tomb raider.

The story is relatable, touching and funny and the best part is, it's true!This is a book I have read twice... and I continue to keep it within arms reach in my office. It is one of those books that I reference again and again - especially when I'm having the kind of day that makes me question why I decided to pursue my dreams in the first place.This Time I Dance! was recommended to me by a friend of mine and for that recommendation, I will be forever grateful.If you are contemplating making a leap from one career to another, if you're currently in the midst of your transition, or if you've already been there, done that... this book is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Sell Your Soul for a Retirement Nest Egg","review":"I loved Kieves' book, even reviewed it in my CBS MarketWatch column on May 27, 2004 (\\"Sometimes today's dream is the key.\\") Kieves was a Harvard attorney who left to pursue her dream.

Although I live in a relatively hilly, slightly rural community - It is not unusual for me to have a brake last nearly a month or two... but only 2 days is RIDICULOUS.

I found it funny that she did not speak to her own children that way.

From the cover of the book and the summary, you'd think it would be Ariana, but the plot seemed to focus more on Laramie. I find it hard to believe that Laramie was not a harden outlaw, since he was raised with a bunch of hard outlaws. The relationship between Ariana and Laramie seemed unrealistic, but that's where the fiction comes into play.

I own every major release ever by this band & returned this bomb. If you are looking to expand beyond the early ABB classics, go for An Evening With the ABB, Where It All Begins or Seven Turns all from the post 1989 reunion period. Gregg's last solo disc (Searchin for Simplicity) is wonderful, too. They have come back on fire and have put real ABB records with all four living original members sounding as inspired as ever.

How or from whom no longer matters, and hasn't for years. What's important is that our daughter, now 7 1/2, has adored and listened to this CD nearly every night of her little life. Years ago she renamed it, The Sleep Music, because she simply couldn't find her way to dreamland without it, and often still can't. This CD is tastefully done, attractive to both adults and children (although after a couple of thousand listens, it starts to get on your nerves).

That said, _One Nil_ does not disappoint. Every singer/songwriter and performer out there should do themselves a favor and buy this album (and all of Finn's other work for that matter)and listen to how songs of lyrical substance can also be catchy and melodic. _One Nil_ is closer to Finn's work with Crowded House than _Try Whistling This_ was. Standout tracks include \\"Rest of the Day Off\\", \\"Wherever you Are\\", \\"Anytime\\", \\"Secret God\\", and \\"The Last to Know\\".

When I heard \\"Wherever you are\\" I thought it was the best song I'd heard in years.That said, this album takes some time to really appreciate.

Firk developed into a fine guitarist and his 2001 release on The Physical World label (PWCD-P102) \\"What You Think This Is\\" Shows off his mastery of blues and ragtime acoustic guitar playing, alas the vocals are still bad but at least more suitable due to the tongue in cheek nature of his original lyrics and the decision to abandon the hokey posturing that was present 30 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shapiro's translations are classics in their own right.","review":"Shapiro's verse translations are incredible.

When I ask my 21 month old what video she wants to watch she pulls this out. I taught her sign when she was 6 months old. When she started speaking around 11 months she quite signing. She has a play mate who signs and started signing again so I though we would pick it back up. After only watching the video twice she is signing all of the signs in the video. There just isn't enough. The best signing video we have seen. It doesn't go to quickly that she can't get it and it gives her enough time to sign with it. And most importantly she really enjoys it. Maybe because she sees other kids signing or that there is a visual relation to the sign. What ever it is we are enjoying it together. And it is braking down the language barrier. Now that she is talking I don't always know what she is saying and that is just as frustrating to her as not talking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Educational even for Non-Hearing Disabled Children","review":"My 2-year old daughter is not deaf but she watches this as if she learns how to communicate in foreign language."},{"rating":"2","title":"16 mo old loves it","review":"my son loves this dvd, and has picked up several signs from the video without coaching from me. He loves all the little kids in the video. My husband and I both think #3 is better, but this is a basic introduction of early words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Done!","review":"I just ordered volumes 1-6 for my 7 year old deaf son and my 3 year old son with Downs Syndrome. Granted some of the first few DVDs bored my 7 year old but he enjoyed the music so he went right along with the DVD. My son with Downs Syndrome just loves the DVDs he signs and dances with them. I just want to say thank you for creating such a wonderful tool. I was very impressed to see other children on your DVDs with various disabilities.ASL is my second language and the DVDs were amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No what I expected","review":"We tried this dvd after my son learned from and loved \\"My Baby Can Talk - First Signs\\". However, tbis dvd did not hold his attention or provide the simplicity and connections that he needed between the signs and the actual words or objects. It was disappointing, especially since he learned to sign several objects and even say a few words from watching \\"My Baby Can Talk\\". We watch all dvds together and follow the recommendations in the tutorial on the dvd. I cannot recommend this dvd. If you are spending the money and the time to help your baby communicate with you, buy the \\"My Baby Can Talk\\" series, watch them and sign together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected!","review":"I wasn't that satisfied with the product. Didn't seem to hold my children's interest very well. I would recommend Happy Signs. My children seemed to love that movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ST is a hit every time!!","review":"We started using ST DVDs with our eldest son when he was approximately 18 months old after having used very basic signing with him earlier. He LOVED the DVDs and learned the signs on Vols. 1-3 in less than two weeks! We have another son, now 17 months who loves ST as well. He is able to communicate with us and with his older brother. Despite reservations expressed by friends and family we felt this was a wonderful approach to language development for our hearing children. We were thrilled to have the new ST DVDs, Vols. 4-6. I have given Vols. 1-3 regularly as gifts to new parents. I cannot say enough good about these DVDs. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sign Language Tool Available!","review":"I got a LOT of Sign language videos and books our of the library before I bought these. I just could not learn signs from a book. I needed to see it. I like these dvd's the best because they're fun and use music to help teach some of the signs. My son likes these because of all the kids signing. Even my husband likes them and has learned these signs. This is the DVD we started with and these were the first signs he used. We got these at 9 months and 13 months he started signing MORE, MILK, BIRD, DOG, AIRPLANE all in a one week period. We can't say enough good things about Signing Time! and we are eagerly awaiting volumes 4,5, and 6. I just wish we got these when he was born. I won't wait to start signing with my next child."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!","review":"I bought this for my 1yr old niece for her birthday and I am very impressed with it! We watched the video together, and she watched it the whole time and even did a few \\"baby signs\\" kind of like babble :) I know sign language myself and do some interpreting and I absolutely recommend this video. I have seen others that I thought were not so great...but this one is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegantly simple and charming","review":"This production has a certain magic to it that is nearly indescribable. The tenderness with which it was created shines through and provides an unexpected, heartfelt swelling of joy. Well worth the price.For those who complain about the sheer number of signs: It's kind of like saying, \\"Norah Jones (or other respected artist) doesn't pump out enough hits\\". Simply use your creativity and get a signing dictionary and then present the signs to your children in a colorful way as modeled by these productions! Problem solved. As for me, I'm voting with my dollars to encourage this type of authentic, educational creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"My Baby Can Talk is much better! The production is better, the filming is better, the music is better, the price is better. I was very disappointed in the quality of this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"18 signs for $$","review":"For that price I would have expected more signs. The woman who explains the sign first does not appear to be comfortable in front of the camera and I also felt that each sign got too much time (i.e. it's the kids going over and over it again).I would have preferred more signs related to ones introduced. For instance: \\"eat\\" should be accompanied by the signs for banana, apple, orange etc.While it's cute to begin teaching your baby the signs for dog, cat and bird, I would have rather liked to learn signs that are related to everyday stuff: foods, sleep, play etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING!!!","review":"I received this video as a baby gift. I was disappointed because there are only 18 signs on it! I was also disappointed that there are only two songs, one during the opening and one during the credits. I really liked the beautiful mommy, kids signing, and the two songs, but wanted more signs. I also felt there was too much time spent on each sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This series is disappointing compared to the other signing videos that are available--the Baby Einstein 'My First Signs' and the 'My Baby Can Talk' series. My biggest issue with the Signing Time series is as follows:- they do not use enough real world imagery, instead using cartoon imagery that even as an adult seem abstract-most of the talking is done by children or is 'baby talk'-they primarily show babies and young children doing the signs, and if you know how children sign it is often not that well articulated-a lot of the footage is dark and the lighting very amatuerish-the video is done very sequentially and my baby becomes bored by this video very quickly whereas with the other series she will watch from beginning to endThe one very good thing about this series is it has Vol 1 - 4 and goes onto more complex signing whereas the other series stops. I don't recommend this series to people except if they need the more advanced signing-if there was another option I would choose it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I thought I would try a different signing video then the one we own, My Baby Can Sign (it is totally scratched up from overuse by my daughter). Because of the great reviews I had high expectations of Signing Time. But, the production isn't great and it doesn't hold the attention of my 1 year old. He has zero intesest in watching it. This might be a good video for an older child or a child with speech delays. But, if you want to teach your baby to sign, this isn't the video for you. My daughter learned to sign with the My Baby Can Talk video, and I am going to use that instead. I will just have to buy another copy.I have seen several signing videos at this point and it is amazing to me the poor quality. Maybe the Baby Einstein series has given me high expectations? Its hard to believe that there isn't several high-quality signing DVDs out there, or, for that matter, that Baby Einstein doesn't have one (Baby Einstein Wordsmith aside)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend....","review":"This video was poor quality. (It almost appears like a home movie). I was very disappointed in this product and returned the other unopened dvd's in the series. I purchased the dvd's to teach my babies how to sign. This was not the best video for a parent... the video primarily shows little kids doing the signs. The songs are annoying as well. I was honestly surprised at all of the 4 and 5 star reviews. It was awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"My grandchilren are so smart!","review":"My 20 month old grandson was recently at a wedding party with my son. At the table he asked his dad: \\"Milk\\" and then signed it. A little while later, he said, \\"Dad, more milk\\" and then proceeded to sign all three words. Everyone at his table thought he was so smart. My eleven grandchildren are all hearing and speaking children but they are fascinated by these videos and use many of the signs when they speak, especially the little toddlers. They can sing all the words to the darling songs. I can't think of a more wonderful and useful learning tool than these Signing Times videos. I would recommend that all grandparents order them. It is great to have such \\"smart\\" grandchildren!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have the baby signing time DVDs then you won't need this one","review":"This is pretty good, but if you already have the baby signing time DVDs then you won't need this one, as it basically covers the same signs. Cute to see Leah and Alex so young, though. They did a great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves these videos","review":"We purchased these videos for our son who is a little behind in speak development due to a series of ear infections. My son loves these videos he will pick up the dvd and bring it to you so you will play it for him. He has quickly picked up 5 or more signs from each video in about a weeks time. His signs aren't perfect but at 23 months I wouldn't expect them to be, but at least we know what he means. Would highly recommend these videos to anyone with children let them communicate before they can speak. My sister purchased these videos for her 1 year old after seeing them with my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Hands Can Learn Too","review":"This DVD is a great way for children to learn sign language. My 5 year old grandson loves it and learned very quickly from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I just brought this DVD a few weeks ago and its the BEST!

Her daughter, although not clear when she talks, signs all kinds of words. It's very cute and easier to understand than baby babble. My daughter, who is 3 1/2, loved the DVD so much that I purchased parts 1 and 2. She loves the music and the signing. I had taught her how to sign the alphabet when she was 2 and she caught on pretty fast. She knows how to sign all her letters! And now with this DVD collection, she can learn so much more! I would recommend it for all new parents as well as parents of young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Signing Times","review":"This DVD is very good at demonstrating the signs. What it doesn't do however, is talk about how to introduce the signs to your baby. I wish there was a section that described how/when to use the signs with your baby. The DVD only shows how to make the signs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilled Grandma","review":"I purchased this DVD for my grandson who is autistic. While not every autistic person responds to signing, my grandson does. so far, the results are fantastic! In three weeks his vocabulary has increased by nearly 50%, using both the signs and speaking the words. His parents are completely thrilled by the results. Another plus, his 2 year old sister's vocabulary has increased as well. I will eventually buy the whole set for them. Thanks so much Rachel and company!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Signing Time Vol. 1 ,2 & 3","review":"We love the Signing Time DVDs! It grabs your attention right from the beginning. The music is great and hearing the children's voices keeps my granddaughters attention. While at the grocery store, she signed apple which is not a word we taught her, she had learned it from the Signing Time DVD. I just ordered Volumes 4&5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining for baby","review":"It amazes me that people can give this one star. I gave it 4 and not 5 only because the price is more that I believe is fair. It's great for my 14 month old. She watched it all the way through the first time and was totally entertained the entire time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upgraded, but not sadly not improved","review":"This is the first time I've ever reviewed a product. I have to say I was sadly disappointed. I checked the \\"original\\" DVD out from the library and loved it. I enjoyed all the little songs and the words that were taught. When I went to purchase it, I noticed that they had the \\"new & improved\\" version. I was so disappointed when I got it. It only has 2 songs (that really don't even go along with the words that are taught) and it's way too visually stimulating. I also missed some of the words that were taught on the first video and not on this one. I guess I learned my lesson that newer versions aren't always better ones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, fun, entertaining ~ You'll love it","review":"If you are interested in using sign language with your children you will love Signing Time. I first just ordered \\"My First Signs\\" and after watching it once I immediately ordered the 3 pack. This is such a fun video. Your kids will want to watch it over and over and it won't drive you nuts. The songs are cute. If you buy the CD the kids will sign along with the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and entertaining","review":"I have two children, 2 and 4, who both adore this DVD. The signs introduced in the first DVD are simple and usable immediately. The music in the DVD is well written and holds my children's attention very well. I would definately recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your baby will be captivated!","review":"My baby was only 8 months old when we purchased this. I was afraid it wouldn't suit him because he was so young. He liked the Baby Einstein videos so with this I also purchased WordsWorth (which also has signing)and Baby Sign. We found we put the other two on the shelf for awhile because my baby only sits for this one.I am CERTAIN that his 1st words (now at 10 mos)are because of this video (which we watch about 3-4x a week and reinforce daily). He now utters (not exactly enunciates) BALL, BIRD and GA (for DOG every time a dog comes into range). These are the words Signing Time introduces. You are able to skip over words or segments you do not care for right now and the music in the background is an attention getter. The mom sings twice and I wish they would come out with a whole sign/song video. My son would never leave the TV (well, then maybe it's a good idea they don't have one :o) GET THIS ONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This is a DVD that teaches signs for your childs every day life, a tool to help you build your bond with your child.

Yes, any kind of sign language can help babies develop communication skills at an earlier age, but learning ASL gives them the advantage of being able to communicate with other people who use it. You wouldn't invent words that sound sort of like Spanish or Russian and teach them to your baby, so why show disrespect for deaf people by using their language that way? The Signing Time videos are fun to watch and my grandson loved the first one so much that we bought the other two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Signing is a life saver with an infant","review":"This video is great not just for the kids but for adults too. Now my nine month old daughter signs when she wants to eat and sleep. It really helps take the guess work out and limit her frustration with trying to communicate what she wants. My friend recommended the video and her 2 year old loves that she knows when my daughter is hungry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I think that this is a great series. My 4-year-old daughter has a significant speech delay, but these are now her favorite DVDs. If your little one requires some extra help with speech or language, I highly recommend getting the entire series.I thought the first video started off a little slow, but my daughter loved it since it means it is easier for her to memorize the entire video. The pace does pick up for the other videos in the series, starting immediately with Vol. 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Toddler Signing Reinforcement","review":"I liked that this supports signing for toddlers, but truthfully it did not teach my daughter signing. The most important factor is parents working with the child - use this as a reinforcement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Signing Time","review":"I love this Signing Time DVD!! My sister has 2 girls (who will turn 4 and 2 this year), still uses the videos and has had great success with them. When my husband and I found out we were having a baby, we knew we wanted to do signing and that the Signing Time video series was the way to go. Although our son is a little young to be watching the videos regularly, we watch for a few minutes periodically and I do some basic signing with him throughout the day. One thing I love about the DVD is the review chapter, which is great for me and my husband to watch the signs in a shorter amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as I say with all the other videos of this series....","review":"YOU MUST GET THIS! My 2 year old is signing like crazy but my 1 year old has been signing for several months. The music, the video, and the signs are first rate. Don't make a mistake and think this isn't worth getting. There isn't a better video on the market. WE LOVE IT. The problem is that we want more and can't get them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome video","review":"Check out (...) for more info. My child started watching these fantastic videos at 8 months old, so we could teach her sign language. She is not hearing impaired but we thought it beneficial to teach her sign language as a second language to help her communictae with us before she could talk. She loved the videos and even asked to watch them. She did her first sign at 10 months and asked for 'Milk\\". Now she is 2 years old an still mesmerized by the videos adn loves watching them. She now knows all the signs from the first three videos and signs them often. She is also talking a lot now and signing has in no way impaired her speech or slowed it down.These videos are pleaseing to the eye both for children adn grown ups. Many children sign the signs adn it is also repeeated verbally to help your hearing child to pick up the words. they are bright colourful adn the songs are beautiful adn very catchy.I would recommend these videos to anyone interested in teaching sign to their children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better References Available","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this video. There are far better references out there to teach children. The quantity of signs provided was poor and the value for the cost was also poor. Do yourself a favor and buy one of the books Amazon has online - there are much better references available to teach your children than this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good addition to the collection","review":"This book was a surprise. I am a fan of folk and mythology from all over the world, and I have found that folktales need to be very well-written to be enjoyed, or else they end up as alien stories about alien cultures.

Read the first book (fantastic in it's own right) and then hold on to your hats and read this book! It is impossible to put down. Imagine Parmenian and Alexander meets the Chronicles of Narnia. The first three 'books\\"(chapters) will break your heart. The last one gets you righteously angry, and then it breaks your heart again.I seriously have not been able to read another book since I finished this one. My heart's just not in it anymore.

On the merits, the book itself is mediocre history, and would not be in print but for the fact that it bears the ex-President's name. For serious students of history, pass it up. For those who would read the book to learn something about JFK's personality or writing style, pass it up, too...He may not have read it all himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being a President doesn't make you a good witer","review":"It seems I'm the minority here, but I believe this was one of the worst books I have ever read. Maybe it's only because I have no interest in politics what so ever, or that I was forced to read it for school. But in my opinion \\"Profiles in Courage\\" was so incredibly boring, it's not even funny. It wasn't well written or even very informative at all. It would mention political events, but not go in to any detail, so you must have a lot of prior knowledge to understand what's going on. Honestly, these senators seemed to be more stubborn than courageous.

President Kennedy turns this mostly unknown historical accounts into an inspiring call for what the American people need to do with the future that has been bequeathed to them by these courageous men. We need more books like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvelous look at the U.S. Senate","review":"JFK has written an indepth look at the glory days of the U.S. Senate: the 1800s. With beautiful language and a thorough understanding of the material about which he is writing, Kennedy biographs a group of men who stood up for themselves and their beliefs (emancipation, etc.) in the Senate against the majority of men and popular thinking. Although sometimes it goes a little slow, this Pulitzer Prize winning work is necessary for any American history buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy","review":"I have never been a big fan of JFK and I have found that many things remotely associated with him to be unnecessarily praised because he is a Kennedy, American royalty. However, I found the book \\"a must buy\\" for the two objectives JFK wanted to demonstrate:- The courage of individuals at key points in their careers who risked and usually lost everything for what they believed in- That politicians are forced in their careers to balance of the interests of their parties, their voters, their state, the nation, and their conscience. It is very hard to serve so many masters.The book increased my understanding of the difficulty of the political process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine, but learn about JFK","review":"This is a fine book, interesting, informative, and well-written. But readers should understand who wrote it, and why. The idea that JFK was a brilliant scholar is about as far-fetched as the assertion that he was faithful to Jackie. Theodore Sorensen deserves the kudos for this publication, and he is indeed a formidable talent. For more on Kennedy, his ambitious father (who was responsible for the JFK image, designed for political gain), and Sorensen, see Reeves, A Question of Character (1991) or Jack, a solid biography of the younger Kennedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"President Kennedy certainly had courage in writing this book. This work is an important document that anyone involved in politics, or any form of leadership should not miss. Kennedy does an amazing job of looking at couragous policiticians from both parties and how they impacted their time and their country. I read this book in a few days and could not put it down once I started to read it. Before anyone serves in government at any level, they should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't stay awake when I read this book.","review":"I am currently in 9th grade and am reading this book for the first time.

I'm sure JFK had a good reason for writing it, I just don't see why innocent 9th graders have to learn why! I mean, who actually cares how many jobs John Quincy Adams had?

It was boring, repitious, and unclear of his point. He never actually states what exactly makes one specific person couragous. THe only thing that kept me focused was taking notes. The only profile that actually had impact on me was Edmund G. Ross, when he cast the deciding vote for Andrew Johnson's impeachment. That, I think, was a very brave and courageous act on his part, since it literally ended his career. That was the only one i thought was worth reading. I do not recommend this book to anyone, unless you truly enjoy reading about politics, and like very small print. I would not read this book by choice. It would be much better for adults to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why should 9th graders read this book???","review":"O.K., J.F.K. was a great man and wrote a very good book. It was true, well written, and informative, but a book about dead senators doesn't really interst a 14 year old 9th grader. I must admit that some parts, VERY few, were interesting, but I don't really care for this book. Actually, I hated it and would never bother to read it again! No offense to the people who gave it 5 stars, but your nuts!!--not really, I just think that this is a book for older people, not kids. And if we have to read it it should be in High School or College, no Jr. High. I would only recommend this book to old people, I mean older."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was written very well but was borring for kids.","review":"This book may have been written very well, but as a kid I found it boring. There Really wasn't anything in there to keep my attention. It was basically all facts about Senators that were alive many years ago. I don't think this book should be required reading because it really doesn't have any relevance to today's world. JFK should have made the book on the Senators that were in office durring the time that he wrote it and not on the Senators of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"A historical book that doesn't hold your interest.","review":"Even though I wasn't around during President Kennedy's term in office, I've always heard that he was a terrific President. However, he wasn't a writer. This book is heavy on the facts, but too light on interesting sections. Most of the Senators highlighted in this book seem to have done practically the same couragous acts at different times. Also, those acts were woven around dates and names that seemed to take away from the story. If you are a big history-buff, I would highly recommend this book. However, if you're looking for an enjoyable pleasure book, I would recommend you look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY SENT ME THE WRONG BOOK","review":"THEY SENT ME THE WRONG BOOK!I needed this book for MY HISTORY CLASS!You just messed with a full time students semester.What kind of a business are these guys running."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thoughtful Review of Patriotism","review":"JFK has written a thoughtful review of men who have shown courage under fire in American History. He has selected a diverse group and explained fully why he believes the actions each took represented heroism. It is a book well worth reading for gaining political perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was very well-written, but I found it quite boring.","review":"Parts of the book are quite interesting, but the majority of the book was quite boring. I admire JFK because he himself had a lot of courage and didn't brag about it. JFK was in the Navy (1943) during WWII and his boat (PT-109) was sunk by the Japanese. The whole crew got off, but there was one man that was injured, so JFK took him off the boat and into the water. he put a rope from the man's lifejacket in his mouth and pulled him to shore. He was in the water for hours!!! While doing this he aggrivated an old back injury and got Malaria! Now that is what I call courage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspirational read in ugly times","review":"After having just experienced the very ugly, brutish, and nasty 2004 U.S. presidential election, I found myself emotionally beaten up and drained. Picking up this book was a quick way to lift my spirits.John F. Kennedy's (or whoever wrote it) short history of a selection of senators who, caught between swallowing their pride and supporting popular measures they believed were wrong and following their consciences and supporting unpopular ideas, chose to follow their own hearts and minds. Many of these men had their once promising careers ended early for their unpopular actions. Many made their decisions to support unpopular ideas at the most uncertain periods in American history, such as the time immediately preceding the Civil War or the post Civil War period of poverty and raw nerves.For anyone who is looking for a refresher of what makes the United States a truly great country, reading this quick and inspirational book is an excellent place to begin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, Confusing, Confusing","review":"Well this was the most confusing book I ever read. The idea of what JFK tried to do was good but the actual book was way too drawn out and unclearly wriiten. To read this book you have to drink many cups of coffee so that you wouldn't fall asleep from bordum. I only recomend this book if you are interested in politics and if you have the time to read this book carefully so that you would understand what JFK is talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again......","review":"Alright, now I'm not going to say that this was the worst book i ever read... because it wasn't, but it definately was not one of the better ones. Yea it was well written and had a very good point to get across... but it just wasn't one of those books that kids would enjoy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book, Not For Anyone Other Than Social Studies Teachers","review":"I thought the book was very boring. All the book talked about was senators from way back. There aren't many people today that are interested in reading about that. ESPECIALLY 9th Graders!This book is good if you need something boring enough to put you to sleep. If you enjoy books like that, or if you want to make your students suffer through a boring and pointless book, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!!","review":"I received this book for a report my daughter had to submit, the book was torn,written in, and in bad condition for a used book.

This is my first bad experience and i hope my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Profiles in Boredom\\"","review":"Book Should be Entitled \\"Profiles of Quotes\\" This book though it has a good purpose (to recognize political courage) it's just a chronicle of quotes about eight \\"courageous\\" senators. The book is completely unoriginal, nothing is being said by John Kennedy, just a cut and paste job of quotes of other peoples views of the events in question. This book is dull, droning, monotonous, and I wouldn't recommend it except as a cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Drawnout, and Repetative!","review":"I would not recomend this book to a fellow student because I felt that it was not very amusing. Though the individual stories I found to be entertaning, only due to the fact that they are historical, the book was too drawnout. It seemed that the same thing occured in each of the courageous men's lives, they would stand up for what they belived to be right and then be disowned by their party. This was inspiring in the first story, and in the second, but when I got to the fifth story it became monotonous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very infomative but it put me to sleep.","review":"This book has a lot of facts and information but is very boring to read. I am not kidding when I say that it put me to sleep, it really did. As a ninth grade student, I would not recommend this book. However, if you like history (and boring books) this book is for you.

I don't believe, however that this item has much resale potential any more than a Roomba does, but the Roomba only cost us $199.00 for a refurbished unit (4230) which gives no trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries no longer sold","review":"I love my Trilobite, but they are no longer sold in the USA and worse than that, the batteries are no longer sold and can't even be imported from Europe, where they are still sold, so you are buying a dead horse on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rip off, hire a maid","review":"Bought the trilobite at a big box discount store at steep discount but the replacement filters (measuring about 2 inches by 8 inches, and not HEPA) cost a fortune, far more for a year's supply than the machine costs at full retail! Do your research before you make the same mistake I made. The filters have to be replaced every time the dust collection bin is emptied. Search the web for trilobite filters for the best price, do the math, and see for yourself. It's shameful what those tiny filters cost!

They work great.The cons: The quick release has 3 allen screws that I did not seem to have a wrench for, they came loose & I lost 2. They are pretty small (short). It should have come with the allen wrench in my opinion. The box is too small to put everything back into if you have the quick release and an air fitting on the hammer. It does not come with a nice carrying case, just the cardboard box. That would not be such a big deal if there were not a bunch of chisels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet air riveter","review":"I haven't had the time to try this one out yet, but it appears well made and screwing the end piece on and fastening it down with the 3 mm set screws was an easy reach.

The only reason for not rating it five stars is simply because it has not been used yet so I haven't made a personal evaluation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Dixieland Book","review":"The tunes are fine, but Dixieland is commonly played with an ensemble that includes a trumpet, trombone and clarinet.

Beautiful prose, I love how he creates tension and suspension with fragments and interjections, and the atmosphere here is so wonderfully moody and eerie...but there's no purpose. No meaning. Death is a predator that stalks and lures us in - much like a Venus fly trap - and those who die die, and those who survive just do, by chance. Also, even though I'm definitely a \\"it's about the journey\\" type of guy, the central mystery that serves as the novel's entire reason for being is never solved. Grant's prose is worth ingesting and absorbing, though, so I've got several more of his on the shelf that I'll try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!!!","review":"What a great way to keep memories!!!

I forced my self to read it half way through & then I had to close it for good. I read 1-2 weeks per week 90% of them are historical romances & it may have just been the setting for me because I don't much care for the European settings but most books pull me into them regardless of that but that wasn't the case here. I found the book quite slow & boring. Because I didn't finish this book I wouldn't normally leave feedback but when I saw only 2 reviews & they were both 5 stars I though maybe I'd save some people from thinking this was that terrific of a book.

The women are not bad, either, which makes for a pretty boring story. There are no real conflicts, no really hard choices. Noah and Allie supposedly argue a lot, but you never hear what they're fighting about. Some of it's just kind of stupid - for example, you would think that Allie would check the mailbox at least once in a year. Some of it's just a bit absurd - for example, why does Allie answer the door wrapped in a blanket? Noah starts off charmingly crazy - dangling by one hand from a Ferris Wheel - and quickly becomes dotingly earnest. Well, there's something to be said for men who are passionately devoted to their wives.

The time period (1940's) is one that different ages can relate to as well.This is definitely one that I will purchase for my DVD collection.

Highlights for me are Ryan Gosling as his natural portrayal felt real and honest and he deserves the acclaim he gets. Rachel McAdams was also good in her role as well. James Garner and Gena Rolands are beautiful in their roles and are wonderful to watch. The direction from Nick Cassavetes is very clean and he allows the natural performances to shine with the script. A solid film and well executed as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"saccharine storytelling","review":"Other than the scenes of the beautiful South Carolina low country, and James Garner's touching depiction of The Reader, this movie is pure sap. The South Carolina depicted is all so so pretty, and so so white - the Negro servant caricatures were offensive.Young Allie was all surface and no substance - \\"oh, boo hoo! Two attractive and intelligent men want me, but I don't paint anymore!\\" Young Noah comes off a bit better, with his quiet mastery of facial expression. Sam Shepherd and Joan Allen play their parts well, but their talent was wasted on such one-dimensional characters.However Your Mileage May Vary. There was enough sobbing and sniffling going on around me, that obviously many people were touched by the movie. I just wasn't one of them.

A real romance is not one where you have to go back and forth from one guy to another because you don't even know what you want. In a real romance, you just KNOW. Allie was portrayed as spoiled and wishy washy. I'm not even complaining of her infidelity, because I'm glad she made the right choice and chose Noah. But to think she could just sleep w/Noah and then go back to her fiance....thats just made me want to smack her. The older Noah and Allie were cute, but I just fell asleep when they came on.In the end, the only thing that held this \\"love\\" story together was the deep love Noah had for Allie, which was beautiful. Everything else was pretty dumb.I just hope young people don't watch this and think this is as good as it gets, cause it can be so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm still a sucker","review":"...for these tear jerkers.

From great dramatic author Nicholas Sparks of \\"A Walk to Remember[also a great movie and book], comes another one of his novels-turned-movies. The everlasting love between two different people in this film make up a great love story. This film will make you cry, make you wish you were born in the 40's[and if you were born in the 40's, it will bring back memories] and most importantly, it will make you want to find true love like the love portrayed in this.

But to say that I was bitterly bored and disappointed once I finally managed to see it, would be a massive understatement. This movie was boring, predictable and long and at the end of it, all I could think about was that I had wasted $8 of my hard earned money on this rubbish, but more importantly, those were 2 hours that I'll never ever get back again.I was looking for a little bit of entertainment on a quiet Winter's Sunday, I wasn't looking for a sleeping aid.

Beautiful and so encouraging to true romantics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Few Love Stories a Guy Can Sit Through","review":"My title says it all. The Notebook is not the greatest movie I have ever seen (as most women I know would claim), but it's worth your time if your girl wants to watch a sweet romance that won't put you to sleep. The beauty of Rachel McAdams held my attention throughout as did the well told story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start to an impressive old fashioned romantic tale","review":"This movie passed me by when it first came out and I admit it didn't really appear on my radar until the 2005 MTV movie awards when Rachel McAdams cleaned up for her performances in both 'Mean Girls' and 'The Notebook'.It's not a perfect movie due to a couple of outlandish and disjointed scenes (the World War II frontline scene in particular) but that's forgiveable since the romantic storyline is timeless. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are well suited to their roles.The strong supporting cast, nostalgic reproduction of a bygone era and beautiful cinematography makes this movie more than worth the time.To the girls I can only say be prepared with the Kleenex, they rarely make them like this anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Notebook","review":"Touching & romantic.

If you want to cry watch this movie, it will without a doubt fit the bill in that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction, but very romantic and touching","review":"It is a very moving movie, that covers different key aspects of life (love, loyalty, feelings vs the-right-thing-to-do, etc).

COMPANY STATED NOT TO SEND BACK THE COPY AND THE ORIGINAL MOVIE WOULD BE IN THE MAIL RIGHT AWAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful, boring love story!","review":"I watched this movie several times, trying to figure out what was so good about this movie. I discovered what was good about The Notebook was NOTHING. This movie did not make me think about love or anything. I found it very pathetic. Why everyone likes it, I'm not sure. However, there was a couple of things I liked about The Notebook... the previews and the credits (which confirmed it was finally over!). If you want to see a real love story go see The Titanic, go see Brokeback Mountain, even go see Superstar! But not The Notebook. You will be bored out of your mind! Guaranteed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"did i miss something?","review":"This was a good love story but how can that girl from a wealthy family and lifestlye so quickly fall in love with that boy from the other side of the track, financially speaking? Also when he jumped on that ferris wheel you would have to be a very trained stuntman before pulling that off! Also I noticed the boy all of the sudden grew nice thick facial hair to make him look older. come on now, that is too obvious for my taste. Plus any boy who takes pleasure in laying on the street in the middle of the night surely has some problems upstairs which makes me curious as to why such a nice good looking girl would ever join him, on the street. A lot of people were crying during this movie, not me though because I was too upset that other people around me would think i was the one crying. I have tears to shed but not for this movie. Ok, it wasn't a bad film but just not for me, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest love story EVER!!","review":"The movie came in a quick manner. The movie is in perfect condition. Great movie to cuddle up on couch and watch alone or with others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great young actors","review":"The two leads, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, were absolutely superb. Nuanced and emotive acting, but unfortunately, that's about the only thing that's good about this film. If you've seen the trailer, well, then, that's all you need to watch.I know I'll probably get severely ragged on for this review, but the truth is that it's sentimental in a really saccharine and smothering way. If you're not a die-hard romantic movie fan, stay away, or you'll roll your eyes right out of their sockets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours of the worst sentimental kind","review":"I don't mind a sentimental movie, but this one is totally awful. Mainly because everything is so predictable. And I really mean predictable. Not a single twist or hint of complexity in the story. The story has some potential for small surprised but they, too, are given away very early in the movie.Some alternative love-story films that are made for adults:The Yacoubian Building,Venus,Windstruck (ALL Region - Single Disc Edition) DVD, andAs It Is in Heaven. These movies are all very sentimental, but they also have a very good storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"sappy dappy, unlikely, over-verbalised","review":"Cliched characters. Unlikely outcome. They get together...they split up...they get together...etc...They talk lots about their feelings. The sexual mores of the time would hardly have been consistent with the amount of sh gging. Amazing how pregnancy not considered or discussed. Highly unlikely. I never want to hear another violin. The older characters are convincing but not the actors who play their younger selves but then the plot and dialogue so poor that no wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality...horrible movie","review":"The quality of the streaming was excellent, but the movie itself wasn't. While the story of the elderly man's love for his failing wife was touching, the story of how they got together wasn't. It relied too much on the worn out 'good girl gets bad guy' storyline,and has no real, believible romance in it; just an overeliance on steamy physical affection and sex scenes.I was very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it less than one star if I could","review":"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen and, except for Hollywood's built-in nepotism, would have not been made. My primary distaste for the movie and what distracted me from the \\"story\\" relates to the props and the over emphasis on \\"perfection.\\" All of the signs for Coke, etc., were in perfect, unblemished condition. The shoes worn by the girl star were totally today's. The mother's French manicure made me want to set my hair on fire.... Help!!!Guess it's really no worse than the Thin Man series and other movies from the 30's and 40's where most of the characters are rich and overdressed and were intended to encourage the masses to go out and attain their own impossible dreams but not to my taste at all. At least the earlier ones could be entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie - misleading packaging.","review":"I was SO disapposinted when I got this product. The seller totally sent a cheap burned copy to me in a clear cover. The DVD was not even marked, no images on the top of the DVD; it was silver on both sides of the DVD. Very disappointed, never buy from this seller again. Movie played ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie!","review":"I'm glad I finally got to buy this movie, it is one of my favorites.

So sad, too. I TOTALLY cried when I watched this! Nicholas Sparks is a GENIUS! And that b@#$% from 'MEAN GIRLS' played a great leading lady. Rayan Gosling was amazing as well! This is TRULY a classic love story! You will laugh, you will sigh, and you will cry. This movie shows us just how strong a person's love really is! :-D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unthinkably Wonderful","review":"I saw this movie with 2 friends, I knew about the plot, and was intriuged. When I sat down in the movie theater I wasn;t expecting what I saw. The acting was tremendous, the story was hearwrenching. I started crying 20 minutes into the movie and didn't stop until 1 hour after the movie was over.I read the book and it was wonderful but the movie captured the essence of the story, and the characters. It was one of the most amazing films I've ever seen, and I would watch it a thousand times again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an Inspiration","review":"What an amazing love story.

However, I was just convinced that Allie and Noah had fallen in love - their characters seem to be \\"one-note\\". Ryan G. had a stupid look on his face most of the time, and Rachel M. did that funny high pitched laugh most of the time. And the ending was just too contrived.

I'm not usually a fan of movies that take place \\"way back in the day\\" but this story is truely breathtaking. I have never seen a movie that draws me in in every which way. The ending was kind of obvious, even when I was reading the book, but every aspect of the movie was truely great. I recommend to the old, the young, and the in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sad-a tearjerker","review":"I borrowed my sister in laws DVD of this movie cause everyone told me how romantic it was. What they neglectecd to inform me was that it was an emotional roller coaster through out the movie in which I wanted to kick my tv, plus I didnt know I'd need to watch it with a whole box of tissues. I was either mad or cried throughout the entire movie! But I figured it was ok as long as it had a happy ending. I'm not gonna say too much there for those of you who hasnt see it yet, but what the heck was that ending about? That was soooo sad I was blubbering like a baby. Needless to say, after the movie I was so upset I actually threw the remote control. I have now boycotted the movie from my house. A little drastic you say? Not to somebody who used an entire box of kleenex throughout the movie. In closing, hated the movie! Watch at your own risk. (and with tissues)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like This Movie","review":"Maybe because I'm in my mid-40s, but because the stars are younger and maybe more recognizable to the generation after me, this movie may be more appealing to them. I just did not care for this movie. It's gotten rave reviews here, but it didn't appeal to me at all. I usually tend to see movies with actors and actresses I like not necesarily because of good reviews, critical acclaim or even awards. That may be the reason I didn't like it. One of my favorite romantic movies of all time is Bridges of Madison County. The Notebook didn't come close to Bridges."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY NEW FAVORITE MOVIE!!!","review":"This movie was absolutely amazing! It captured so many emotions, it was almost overwhelming. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone I met!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful love story","review":"I saw the movie, this evening, and I loved it. It made me laugh,and cry. I highly recommend it, also loved the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Spectacular","review":"This movie went far beyond my expectations. I'm not usually a fan of sappy romantic movies, but this movie was more than just sappy and romantic. Sentimental and old-fashioned, it told a real story, not to mention that the actors were just superb.I'm not usually one to weep at a movie theater but this movie definitely brought a few tears to my eyes, and I wasn't the only one. There weren't many dry eyes in the theater towards the end.I'll be buying this on DVD when it comes out, but for now I am settling with reading the book. This movie is definitely a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alzheimer's is not amnesia","review":"As much as I enjoyed this movie for its terrific acting, beautiful cinematography, mature and sensitive writing and directing, the depiction of Alzheimer's as a now-you-see-it-now-you don't amnesia left me wondering whether anyone involved in this movie had any familiary with Alzheimer's at all.When Alzheimer's patients' memory has deteriorated to the point where they do not recognize their husband or children, they do not exude the perfectly groomed, impeccably dressed magazine-cover glamour that Gena Rowlands depicted. Granted, Allie was not in a public ward but in what seemed to be a very expensive assisted living facility. Nevertheless, Alzheimers is not a disease where you \\"die pretty.\\"Having had a stepmother die from this disease, I would have preferred a movie that did not gloss over the true viciousness of Alzheimer's. It not only robs memory, it robs every vestige of dignity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad For A \\"Love\\" Story","review":"I will admit that I am generally no fan of romantic movies - I hate sappy love stories. I first watched \\"The Notebook\\" on HBO. I was walking through my den and the movie was on. I sat down just to see what it was about and got really involved in watching it. The scene where Noah and Allie were standing by the pond in the pouring rain was on and I was pretty much hooked from there on out. I later rented the DVD and watched the entire movie from beginning to end. I have since watched it about 5 times over - it's just that good! It does have the classic overtones of rich girl meets poor boy, they fall in love - rich girl's parents (especially the mother) think the young man is not good enough for their socialite daughter. I can't really describe what makes this movie so good, but it is heartfelt and touching and will get you involved in watching it just to see how it ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what you call romance","review":"For anyone who is looking for love, or in love already, this movie brings back the pureness and trueness that love should be about. It makes you remember what it felt to love for the first time, that there is no wrong in finding that one that is meant to be, your soulmate. This movie is very realistic and inspiring, and it makes you feel that you should never give up on love, regardless of the flaws that come with it. Great movie, can't wait to buy it when it comes out on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TRUE Story","review":"My understanding is that this is a story of Nicholas Sparks' wife's grandparents. I read the book when it was first published and saw the movie last night. I dearly loved both of them. I don't know who really wrote the book - the grandmother or Nicholas, but no matter - it's beautifully written and we got to enjoy it. I think the movie was also very beautifully written and the acting by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams was superb! I usually choose movies based on the actors rather than the story. I chose to see this movie based on the story, expecting the acting to be lacking (except for James Garner and Sam Shepherd, of course) and had a wondeful surprise! I don't think it's a \\"chick flick\\" but I couldn't talk my husband into seeing it with me. That's ok - I'll buy it and tie him to the chair in front of the TV while I watch it again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love story","review":"I would whole-heartedly recommend this love-story to anyone who hasn't had a good cry in a long time. It is guaranteed to turn on the old tear-ducts, as well as lift your spirits and inspire you that the romantic purism of monogamous lifetime love can be and is a reality, at least for this young couple, of whom James Garner's character is reading about. Without giving away the plot of the story, James Garner is a very noble and loyal friend to a lady in a nursing home, reading her a story that was hand-written and personal. He never misses an opportunity to pick up where the story let off during her previous session-- sadly, she is suffering from Alzheimer's and it is a challenge for him to keep her interested in the story, although she is surprisingly receptive to it and is amazingly consistent in her following of the storyline. It's like two stories of two couples in one movie! Scotty/Sioux City"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Notebook","review":"An excellent movie that really touches the heart.

Start writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Excellent!","review":"I read the book first and thought, \\"There's no way the movie could make me feel like that.\\" I was wrong. This movie is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. The portrayal of Allie and Noah's love by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling could not have been played better. The love, passion, and beauty of the book are passed to this movie like no other book-to-movie adaptation I've ever witnessed. Absolutely excellent! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a romantic at heart. Truly heartwarming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Calculated to Make You Cry","review":"And everybody loves a good cry. What you see here is remarkable from at least one perspective, though: this was based on a really outstanding first book by Nicholas Sparks. Until I saw the movie, I thought this was one of a series of tearjerker books by him, but learned that this was his first.That was extraordinary. For a first-time author to create this particular plot conceit was really brilliant. And it gave the moviemakers a lot to work with. You cannot help but cry your way through this one.But what realy made me cry was in the special features. Nicholas says that he was working as a drug rep, making $30,000 per year. I never knew any successful drug rep who made under six figures, so he must have been really, really ineffective at it. Thus, when Time Warner Books offered him a million dollars for this first book...I could not hold back a torrent of tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful written real Life Story. \\"The Notebook\\"","review":"This story is magnificent !!

The reason for me is the end, which I won't say what that is for those who have not seen it. It's a very sad, romantic film. My sister LOVES it. She even named her son after the main character. LOL If you love tear jerkers you won't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, romantic, tear-jerker movie","review":"I read the book twice before seeing the movie and once after the first time I saw it. My husband has watched this movies with me twice! It is a typically sappy love story but it is also a very good story about how people deal with the pitfalls of life. James Garner is fantastic in this movie. I think it is one of his finest performances even though he and Genna Rowlands actually have more supporting roles, the movie couldn't be made without them. Definitely worth seeing over and over. Not just for the beautiful love story of the young people, but for the genuine love story of the older generation as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The notebook","review":"It was a very wonderful, touching love story. I would highly recommend it too bad more relationships couldn't be like theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead.","review":"The main characters in this film have the same names as the main characters in Nicholas Sparks' novel, but the resemblance ends there. While the film might be entertaining to some, this reviewer found it to be annoying and uninspiring. The Allie and Noah in the book were portrayed as sensitive, intelligent and thoughtful individuals. The Allie and Noah in the film are just two more average, impulsive teenagers with no special or endearing qualities and not a lot of common sense. The reference to the elderly Allie's illness as \\"senile dementia\\" is misleading and inaccurate. This reviewer recommends reading the book or listening to the book-on-tape for an inspiring love story and a more realistic and sensitive portrayal of Alzheimer's Disease and it's impact on the well spouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to give it that one star.","review":"This movie was terrible and great at the same time. The parts that take place in the present show vivid influence by Nicholas Sparks and are the cheesiest, most cliche scenes I have ever seen. The parts that take place in the past are very witty, cute, and funny. I, however, would rather drill screws into my feet than watch the ending or any of the parts that coincide with it. Whichever one you prefer, this movie mixes both crap and wit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachel McAdams Lights Up the Screen","review":"I heard a lot about this movie, and I thought that no chick-flick could be that good.I watched it on cable and I figured out why everybody likes it so much. Two words -- Rachel McAdams. She is bangin!!!It's not that the movie has a good story, it's not that anyone else acted very well, this movie's success can all be attributed to Rachel McAdams. She's really hot and in this film her role is to be a really hot leading woman. And man does she pull it off!There's some other stuff in the movie that makes it worthwhile. The comparison between the mother and the daughter turns out to be pretty interesting.The setting was 1940's North Carolina, but no one in the movie had a Southern accent. Imagine one of the guys from Entourage, playing a saw mill worker in 40's North Carolina -- that's what Kevin Connolly did in this movie. Rachel Mc Adams's on-screen father, David Thornton really sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm in the Minority!","review":"Okay. Most of the reviews I've read have been A+, and I guess I really don't understand why. I can't remember the last movie I've seen that has affected me the way this one has. I'm not sad! I'm angry.First, the movie bored me to death. I thought it would never end. Second, I did not--repeat NOT--find the actors/actresses appealing, especially James Garner and Gena Rowlands. Third, I felt very manipulated. I knew exactly what was going to happen from moment to moment, and just about anyone who's seen movies for years (and maybe not that many years) can figure out the ending.On a positive note, I did enjoy the 40s stuff: costumes, cars, etc. And for that I give it one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best heart warming movie ever!","review":"Notebook is real life!

I enjoyed the parts about the old couple but when it switched back to the young couple I just didn't find them appealing or believable. It is not a movie I would keep in my library or ever look at a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to the hype","review":"Sorry to have to bring things down to reality, but the only reason I gave this two stars were for the main male leads being played by James Garner (one of my favorites) and the upcoming Ryan Gosling.The film may have \\"garnered\\" more stars if they hadn't blown the more-interesting subplot half way through the movie by introducing the children. If they would have held that to almost the end, the impact of their relationship would had maximum romantic and emotional impact. Instead, it became more of a case study of Alzheimer's disease."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"I think this movie is a better than the book and that rarely happens. Only a few minor problems, James Garner isn't nearly as old as Noah is in the book. The ending is different and I don't like it, but I didn't like the book ending either, so it really didn't matter. I love Ryan Gosling in pretty much anything, and Rachel McAdams holds her own. The movie is very sweet. Yes, there is infedelity, which isn't the right thing for anyone to do, no excuses, but it does happen in real life, and so it happened here. The only thing I didn't like was the online streaming from Amazon. The movie stopped every 30 seconds and was very difficult to watch like that. I watch streaming movies and TV all the time on other sites, this was my first time on Amazon. I didn't like it. Probably won't use the service again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Each Time","review":"Everytime I watch \\"The Notebook\\" I realize something new.

I'd have to say one of the best love stories I've ever watched. But at the same time it stirred the emotions for me as well. As my mother died from Alzheimers.

James Garner and Gena Rowlands brings not only the realization of this to life in the movie The Note Book, but also shows what true love is really all about! Standing by the love of your life thru the best of times as well as through the hardest of times.

I very rarely can say that about a movie based on a book, but I truly loved this movie.

The movie version differed from the book somewhat, and the ending was completely different, however I wouldn't change one thing about the film version. James Garner deserves an Oscar for his performance, and in my opinion this was his best performance yet.I highly recommend this movie to anyone.

The plot has already been covered, so I won't get into that. However, this movie has a haunting quality that stays with you the day after. I spent the entire two hours between tear spells. The only problem is in the anachronism (ex., manufactured brown beer bottles in the 1940s) and occasionally frankly fake Southern accents. However, if you can get past that, this is a very enjoyable movie for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Notebook","review":"Interesting and somewhat provocative story of young love lasting through old age, and extremely trying medical issues.

Boring romance; nothing really unique. I'm assuming the story is about the power of love, but isn't every love story about that? It lacked depth, and I've seen comedies that were sadder. Literally.Fortunately, it saved itself from one star I would otherwise have given by the redeeming (though sadly brief) role of James Marsden, just by his being so gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite movie based on book","review":"A beautiful movie from start to finish.

It really ought to have an \\"R\\" rating for sexual content and profanity. I have seen PG-13 movies and this one was racy. Ally as a teenager is allowed to run wild and free over the summer and gives up her virginity in graphic detail. She hates her mother and the only relationship with her father is being able to get anything she wants. Spoiled, rich, and w/o any apparent moral compass. Noah isn't much better as a young man. The story itself as told by James Garner in the latter years is pretty good as he deals with \\"his sweetheart\\" with dementia. I can relate to this aspect of the movie because my mother went through the same sort of thing. But Hollywood as usual has to ruin a good movie with sex scenes and profanity. I would not recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie ever!!!!!!!!","review":"The Notebook was the best movie I've ever seen!! I'm only 11 and I was in tears during most of the movie. I can't wait to own it. I recommend it to everyone, even guys. In the theater there was a teenage guy by himself and he had to walk out cause he was crying and didn't want anyone to know. That's how sad it was it made a feelingless male teenager cry super hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely involving and stunning","review":"I thought this movie would be terrible--like the book by Nicholas Sparks, or A Walk to Remember with Mandy Moore. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It was gorgeous--the breathtaking south carolina scenery, the costumes, the music, the acting, the love, the sweetness and most important of all--the innocence of this film, which relies on the simplicity of the story being told.

Their love survives the disdain of Allie's mother and a third party who temporarily wins her affection. The story is told in flashbacks by James Garner as Noah. He reads from a notebook prepared by an aging Allie as she sinks into dementia. Hearing their love story brings her back for fleeting moments. The couple die in bed together in the institution where she resides. I saw my parents and the passing of the World War II generation. This is a tearjerker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maudlin Manipulator Merits Mediocrity","review":"Cloyingly sweet tear-jerker that overflows with sentimentality that left this reviewer feeling emotionally manipulated. The first 20 minutes or so are soporifically boring as the two main characters meet and slowly fall in love. After that, the plot moves forward at a more rigorous pace. However, the plot revolves around the standard \\"rich girl-poor boy\\" device that has been done many times before, including their separation and reunion many years later. Then comes the dilemma of the woman having to choose between her current fiance and her previous lover. Snore.What is somewhat redeeming are the terrific performances by James Garner and Gena Rowlands who play the lovers in their old age. The ending is contrived, but will wrench tears from you nonetheless. Recommended for those seeking a romantic cry-fest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't buy it","review":"I don't understand how people can say that they want a relationship exactly like Noah and Allie's.There was hardly anything to show that they actually liked each other for their personalitites. There is even one part when they start fighting and then making out makes it all better. And they decide to get married because they have good sex??I just do not believe that they were really in love.I admit that the parts with the older Noah and Allie were cute and more believable. I also do not see the significance of the two characters dying together (I myself do not find that romantic).Something else that bothers me about this movie is that it shows that the \\"ideal\\" relationship begins with adultery.Of course I am not solely blaming \\"The Notebook\\" for all the problems with the way teens think about love, but it certainly supports the attitude that love=sex.And I don't support that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype.","review":"I heard good things about this movie. I finally got around to watching it, and when it was over I was left wondering what all the hype was about. The story is typical, and the characters are nothing fantastic. Rachel McAdams plays a particularly unlikeable character, a spoiled tart/southern bell. Ryan Gosling is just a lowly pauper child, who falls for this twit for reasons unknown. His character did not serve his acting skills any justice. The story line brings nothing new to the genre of romance. Also, the ending is beyond far fetched. Id even go to say it insults the life of anyone who has ever had Alzheimers."},{"rating":"2","title":"the notebook","review":"I just love this show i went to the movies to see it, and liked it so much i had to have the dvd"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Notebook\\" is my all time favorite Book!","review":"I have read \\"The Notebook\\" three times now.

I went to see the movie in the Theater and at the end of the movie was left feeling disappointed. I remembered things from the book that should not have been left out of the movie. And a few things were added to the story that should not have been. The fighting and making out for instance was not in the book and should have been left out of the movie! After watching the movie I reread the book to see how my memory was of the book. I was even more upset after i finished reading. The book really is so much better.

After about 10 minutes you get the message that they are in love and have tension, but the movie continues the same theme for an hour or more. I will NOT give away the ending which is very powerful except that my experience with an Alzheimer friend was very much different and very much more painful and depressing. The ending in the movie happens to about two percent of those whose lives are hurt by the disease. It IS one of the most horrible and painful sicknesses to loved ones than any other disease.May I add that if we diverted the money to AIDS which is 95% preventable and placed it in research for an Alzheimer cure/vaccine, which is 100% non-preventable and which afflicts the innocent, both victims and families, there would be a better chance of reducing or eliminating the non-discriminating disease."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie ruins marriages","review":"This movie is extremely detrimental to the institution of marriage in the United States:Jessica Simpson: 'Notebook' spurred divorceCNN website, February 5, 2007\\"She made that decision, she says, after watching the 2004 romance \\"The Notebook\\" on a plane ride home to Texas. \\"I just figured out the statement,\\" she says of the movie, starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as star-crossed lovers. \\"It was about that moment of desperation.

I love true crime but found myself skimming many pages of this book because the information was completely useless or repitious.The basis for an interesting story was here, but the author just didn't make it happen. It appears that, while mentioning it somewhat, Linedecker wanted us to view Roger Paulson (the victim) as a truly manipulated, prime citizen type of guy as his murderer, Lisa Miller Rohn, as skilled manipulator, lying, thieving woman who would do anything to save herself. Unfortunately, although mentioned only in passing, I was able to see that Paulson, with his claims of military service and exhibition of a purple heart (all lies), that the old saying sticks; that is, \\"Birds of a feather flock together.\\"It would have made the reading more interesting if Linedecker had played on ALL the information."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first and probably the last...","review":"I am not surprised that there is nothing on here about this book at all...it was terrible, just awful.

Other than that you get to read a lighthearted piece about people meeting through personal ads, recent advances in police work and DNA, several geographical lessons and also the really enlightened line that the victim was very good about keeping his cats away from his tropical fish tank.

And Paulson was not a saint, as the other commentator intelligently pointed out. Did it mention anyhwere in the book how Paulson tried to strangle Lisa? Was that cleverly left out?Yes, Lisa did have two more children. They are alive and well now if you really want to know. I know this probably won't get posted! Oh well.

For starters, Nicki French's singing ability is average at best, and her limp, lifeless remake of \\"Total Eclipse Of The Heart,\\" would probably make Bonnie Tyler laugh. The beats and melodies are also pretty tired all around, and even if this album were to be looked at simply from the perspective of \\"pretty face to sing mindless dreck,\\" it fails there because Nicki French isn't even particularly cute (at least I don't think so). \\"Something About You,\\" has a decent beat and is probably the catchiest and best song on the album, however, it's still nothing really special, and some purists may be soured by the fact that it was originally a Carpenters song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where do I find it?","review":"My originally purchased CD has become damaged and the title is \\"not available\\"?

I only listened a couple of times. I think she has a fantastic voice, but the songs are lacking in originality, which is one of the main points I look for in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Vampire Hunting Music...","review":"I first heard Nicki's version of \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\" while one a road trip with a buddy back in 1995. \\"Something about you\\" was getting some air play then, too. We would drive through some damn dangerous neighborhoods doing damn dumb things, and had a blast listening to this as our soundtrack. We coined her songs \\"Vampire Hunting Music\\" (for reasons too weird to go into here).Since then, I've been using the CD as my workout music. It's got a great beat and the songs are paced to keep me moving, then allow a little slowdown, and then another pick up for the next move.I agree that the Carpenters cover, \\"For all we know,\\" is a bit weak. I'm also a MAJOR fan of Bonnie Tyler (\\"It's a Heartache\\" was one of the first 45s I ever purchased -- yup, I'm old), but she wasn't a goddess! It is hardly blasphemy to cover \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart.\\" Yeeesh. Even Meat Loaf does a passable cover. So it's different -- get over it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"abysmal trash - one star is WAY too generous","review":"How did this person EVER get a record contract? She should be ashamed of herself when there are so many genuinely talented people in the world not getting anywhere. My fingers are straining to write 'trash trash trash' over and over again, and I'm using all my willpower to write coherently. This is abysmal awful gutter music of the lowest order. What were the record company thinking of? Rehashed eighties pulp for submoronic pre-pubescent factory fodder. It was dated and sad back in 1986, but to keep churning this bilge out is execrable in the extreme. Dismal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could enter \\"No Stars\\"","review":"Nicki French's rendition of \\"Total eclipse of the heart\\" is one of the worst corruptions I have ever heard in a remade song. Bonnie Tyler's \\"total eclipse...\\" has heart and wrenches tears. Knowing how it is supposed to sound makes Miss French's version sickening and detestable. A teriffic song was simply butchered. If you have any affection for the Bonnie Tyler version, avoid French's at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I'm with the last person who commented, I heard \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart,\\" and I was beyond hooked, I was obsessed. Today, I called a radio station after they had played it and got the D.J. to tell me who the artist was, and now I'm here. From what I've heard, the other songs on this alblum are as good as the first, and I'm going to search all the music stores 'till I find a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nickster rules!","review":"After buying the single in early 1995, i have become a huge fan.

The book is OK for beginners who need guidance on very basics.2. I can't think of anything else good about this book.Negatives:1. The book has very few sample questions2. The introduction to each section is useful for very beginners. Anyone who has read kaplan or OG would not find the theory interesting.3. The most important: The answer choices in critical reasoning/reading comprehension not similar to actual test. Some of the explanations are actually silly and it's hard to agree with the book at several places.I would not recommend this book to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PR's Verbal Workout kicks ass","review":"Verbal was all I needed to focus on for the GMAT.

The book spends too much time on how to \\"game\\" the test instead of teaching you the basic building blocks and strategies to solve the questions. The practice questions hardly resemble what GMAT verbal questions are. In many cases, the explanations confused me more. The only bright side is that the book has an extensive list of logic phrases and grammar which might be helpful if you don't them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich Versus Poor Rehash","review":"Superficial drama of a teen and mom having to move away to grandma's leaky shack.

This is a good book, but a little too reliant on history in explaining present day Russian culture. The book really shines when talking about the Russians outside Moscow, but more and more the Moscow business elite seem to take their cue more from the New York or London elite than from their peasant ancestors, as this book contends. Overall, however, this book is as good any for gaining a better understanding of Russians and the Russian bureaucracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes My Dog Puke","review":"I purchased this product in hopes that it would help my dog's hips and joints.

They were more expensive, but appeared to work very well on our 13 year old Husky. After reading the positive reviews on this product we decided to try and save some money and purchased Nutri-Vet Hip & Joint. Our dog is not a fussy eater, and has never rejected any type of medicine or treats. She spit these out immediately and refused to eat them. I broke off a piece and tasted it myself and found that it had a very, very strong citrus flavor. I can never recall seeing anything citrus on any dog food or treats.

The latter one, Save the World, is a hymn to woman. \\"Aisha has found the words she wanted for her belated feminist subject.

I broke the stem from one of them when I was staking it to the ground. The outside is made of steel but the connections are still made of cheap plastic..

I'm a fan of vampire novels, but the vampires in this story were all evil. I just didn't care about any of them, and they spent most of the time killing and murdering each other in gruesome ways. Also, there was too much head-hopping. I would just get used to one set of characters when the author went off to discuss another group. Perhaps if I were a big white wolf gaming geek I might be overcome with interest about what one vampire clan was doing to another. But as fiction goes for the uninitiated this bored me to tears. 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, original, sensual&#65533;","review":"Of the five stories, the first one about the author's boat escape from communist Vietnam in 1972 was the closest to reality. The other four stories are fiction works describing the turmoil that gripped the refugees and transformed them from victims of a tragedy (war, fall of Saigon) into killers or perpetrators of violent acts in an unreal, disjointed, and sensual world.Could this be true? It is ... in the mind of the author. This is to my knowledge the best description of what could go through the minds of these refugees who had suffered so much throughout the war and were forced to escape communist Vietnam under frightening circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone the way of fantasy writers....","review":"As others have stated i'm a long time RA Salvatore fan and enjoy reading and on occasion re-reading his books. This book however just drags on. Meeting Kane. and King Gareth's crew was good, but went no where. Mustering for the big battle scene sounded great, then died off. This book sounded to me like he was forced into throwing something together intime for the pre-holiday season. Another small issue i had with this book was the graphic adult content. I know personally several youngsters who have loved reading Salvatore books. Not sure this new one they've been ranting about is good for them. Just my 2 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expect more","review":"Am I the only one who notices that \\"Gareth Dragonsbane\\" and the whole \\"Bloodstone\\" thing was ripped straight out of an old D&D module (Bloodstone Wars, I believe). Is Wizards giving license for their authors to use old material and pass it off as their own? I expect more from the author who pounded out the Icewind Dale Trilogy and the Dark Elf Trilogy. (I gave it a 1/5 only because it wouldn't let me give it a 0)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salvatore keeps the sword a swinging","review":"Another good book in the Forgotten Realms series featuring characters found in the Drizzt books. I like how the author has continued to develop Artemis, although there are times I just want to slap the hell out of the character. One gets the feeling that Artemis feels trapped within a world moving faster and faster. It is nice, however, to note the human side of this assassin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Confusing plot, uninteresting characters. Too much dead weight. I love RAS other novels nd read the first two in this series but I'm stopping in the middle of this book. Just doesn't capture my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally Exhausting","review":"When I finished the last page of this book I actually felt sick to my stomach. I hadn't realized until that moment just how emotionally tied to the characters I'd become. This isn't just a story about lots of cool action, but one about growth of the individual, and the price that you sometimes pay by entering into a friendship.While I believe the intent of the story was to really focus on Artemis, who he is and why he is the way he is, Jarlaxle goes through quite a lot of personal growth as well. There are several spots where he finds himself becoming increasingly empathetic to those around him. It surprises even him. His origins are much more clearly explained, and he even makes a few very humorous blunders (the bakery scene is priceless).While the ending seems to be pretty final in one sense, I'm hoping that at the very least we'll be seeing more of Jarlaxle and his new dwarven companion. I just hope that Mr. Salvatore takes it easy on my emotions next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing....","review":"Not the most exciting book from RAS but the story is packed with intrigue and deception. The story feels a little rushed at times, because so much ground needed to be covered, but little was lost. Best part of the book was that it wasn't predictable at all. The plotting will leave you scratching your head at times, but than again what doesn't that involves Jarlaxle. No great big battles or powerfull enemies if thats what your into. All the excitement comes from the deception going on in the background or the dialog between characters. My only complaint, without spoiling anything, would be that the ending is a little boring for such an exciting duo."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great fall off from the first two books in this series.","review":"I am a great fan of R.A. Salvatore, but this book is a disappointment. It starts off very well, only to die out in the middle. Salvatore does a great job of building up events to epic proportions, only to have an anticlimactic ending. For the rest of the book we plod along looking into Enteri's past. It could have been interesting, but it was too slow and drawn out. Maybe it was just out of place in this book. And don't even get me started about the strange handling of the love interest! Oh well, I guess you can't knock them all out of the park."},{"rating":"1","title":"Respect, but is WOTC forcing you into sabotaging your signature characters??","review":"I would to start by stating I have the upmost respect for Bob Salvatore's writing and success. This book was painful to get into, slow traveling and painful to try and finish. The mid-life crisis like ranting, guilt and emotional exploration just didn't pan out. It's sad when one of the most brilliant fantasy writers of our time is virtually forced to write about his characters til the series crashes so WOTHC can make their money. WOTC give the writers back the copyrights to their characters, that would include Tracy Hickman, Margaret Weis, Jeff Grub, Douglas Niles..need I say more?

If you enjoy the series, you should like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grant County series- one of the best there is!","review":"The Grant Co series is one of the finest mystery series that there is. The triad of main characters, Lena, Jeffrey and Sarah, are a fascinating mix of vulnerability, strength, good and bad. What I love about this series is that not a single one of the main characters is totally good or bad. Like real people, they screw up, and sometimes never make it right. I can not wait to get to the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and dragging.","review":"Way too much backstory about unlikeable people. There is not one character that rings true.

Most of the characters were irritating, especially Lena, who seems so conflicted with her personal life that she can't focus on her job. Not having read the earlier books in what seems to be a series, a lot of the drama was lost on me. Sounds like Jeffrey cheated on his wife, wife's mother cheated on her husband, wife may or may not be natural daughter of wacko cult patriarch who is now in a wheelchair, men routinely beat and terrorize their wives and daughters, women are victims in general -- all way too much for me.

They have been romantic, thought provoking, and suspenseful. However, I have found her comments on religion disturbing in the past and this book is the strongest yet on Slaughter's view that spirituality is for the weak, stupid, and perverted. As a Christian, I was offended. By the way, I don't belong to a cult, and I have yet to see a preacher or fellow Christian act as crazy and evil as the religious characters in Slaughter's books. This book is good, but I felt her obvious agenda against all those who believe in God disturbing. Don't know if I'll buy her next book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and drawn out","review":"This book started off really well, just like a lot of her previous books have. Problem with this one is that after the first 50 pages or so, things seemed to veer off on another direction and the book took on a whole different story. There were so many characters in this book and, in my opinion, half of them didn't need to be there. This book could have been 200 pages, not 400. I was just really disappointed with the story and the let down ending. I don't think I'll be continuing with this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"I care about her characters.","review":"I do care about her characters and it's not because I identify with any of them. They are real and surprise me. The story is original and current; something I'm genuinely interested in. She leaves a clue or two, but usually the mystery is unique. The point of view is easy to read and offers enough perspective for a good overall observation of what is going on without revealing too much at one time. A good read and hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One!","review":"Geesh! This should have been entitled Family angst with a small dose of murder on the side.

Here are some words it doesn't have: over, ladder, fix (but it has fax), light (but it has lesbian), cut, knife - these words seem pretty basic to me.The section that teaches you whole phrases is good only for laughing. It has the most useless, ridiculous phrases - but let me give you some examples: \\"Those kids have already become snobs.\\" \\"We want to see you, but not until my daughter leaves.\\" \\"You must inform the family about our recent marriage.\\" \\"I have a few cats under the house.\\"I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a how-to book.

For me, this is the jewel in an immense array of \\"self-help\\" books out there. It is so much more that it falls beyond that catagory.

It is very light. The buttons are very small and the button holes are a bit too large, so it unbuttons itself just about as fast as you button it up. For what this suit cost, it should be better made and thicker material. Look elsewhere and save yourself the disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great vendor - not so great product","review":"This vendor, East Valley Apparel, is the first Amazon shipper I've found to ship as fast as Amazon, which is quite a feat.

I have replaced them all but one set on my basement door. Thought I would paint the door and just reuse the deadbolt and knob. After an hour of trying to re-install the deadbolt, I threw it in the trash. The design of these things make no sense at all. The hey side does not fit into the latch so you can align the screws. You have to blindly navigated the screws through two parts and into a third. Nearly impossible. The parts are sloppy and cheap.

I have used it several times and I really like it. First of all, I love the way food comes out in this cooker. So far, I have really liked all the recipes I have tried. Second, it is pretty easy to clean up. Althoguh it says in the manaul that the cooker can be washed in the dishwasher, I prefer to hand wash. I also use a bit of mineral oil on the seal after each wash to help maintain it. The instructions for use are pretty straight forward too. I just need to find some more recipes to try out and I will be all set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to use/clean","review":"It looks decent. But it is not as good as the plain ugly-looking pressure cookers I used 10 year ago. Better in looking, worse in functioning. And it is time-consuming to clean it - at least 10 minutes. In a word, I regret that I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"The instructions were limited and vague. The timing a basic roast was way off. It is VERY difficult to clean. If anything burns to it, it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove. I soaked it, scrubbed it for 2 days then broke down and used oven cleaner. Wow, not convenient. I will stick to my slow cooker from now on. The only pleasing thought is that I only wasted $39.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first purchase thru Amazon","review":"I am a retired nuclear engineer and have heard about Amazon, but had never had a chance to use it until I bought a pressure cooker through Amazon. A friend of mine in Korea asked me to buy a pressure cooker. I like the first purchase experience very much for the following reasons: First, I got a very good deal for the product. The price I paid is much lower than I could get it in a store. Secondly, it was very nice that Amazon did not even charge a shipping cost (*must be a special sale at the time). Thirdly, the proptness of the delivery and easy handling of the whole process. So I plan to use Amazon in the future when I want to buy something."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun to cook with","review":"This is a great little cooker. I had fun learning how to use a pressure cooker and this one is not too big and not too little. The recipe book that comes with it is not all that impressive, but it did give a few good ideas. It is not really big enough for canning and big projects, but for a simple meal or a great pot of soup, this pot rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal for the price","review":"This is my first pressure cooker and I am quite impressed. The weight is sturdy and and the cooker well made. I have done numerous recipes in the cooker and works fine. I only had one burnt recipe with chowder but that was due to my own mistake. The time and heat savings are considerable. I never gave any thought to the timer but it is convenient.The only problem is that the lcd display are going bad and will not last long. Since it is not an integral part of the cooker not all is lost. My only worry would be getting spare parts like the seal since they are not as widely available compared to the fagor pressure cookers. Just a note on the cooking time for previous reviewers. The T-fal only does 13PSi compared to 15 PSi of normal cooker recipes so adjust your time accordingly"},{"rating":"2","title":"T-Fal Cooker","review":"I found the cooker one of the best pressure cookers we ever used.

However, folks should know that this unit's max pressure is only 13 psi - the usual standard is 15 psi. I've compensated by increasing cooking time a little, and it doesn't bother me much. I'd still recommend this cooker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This is my first pressure cooker and I love it. Perfect size and nice designed. I love it's smart timer and different settings for different types of food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible shipping","review":"I bought many stuff from Amazon. I was expecting this product anxiously but I got it today and there was a crack on the cover part. The product deserves 5 stars but shipping deserves less than one star.

I'm in Cali 88 degrees bright and sunny. Looked out my window when it got dark and I couldn't see the handtruck. Total waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"It will glow...mostly.","review":"Application: It sprays out thick and quickly so keep at least a foot away and move quickly. It naturally has a coarse texture so be ready to sand with 600 grit between coatings if you want it smooth. The good news is that it is sandable in 5 minutes. With several layers, the color (on a white backgroud) is best described as Dijon Mustard.Glowing: It works as well as I had expected, but not as well as I'd hoped for. I used it for trim on my motorcycle and left it out all day in the sun. About an hour after sunset, I had to cup my hands around it to see a dull blue glow. But if I take samples directly out of the light and into the hallway or bathroom, it performs well enough.Overall: I have a dull yellow racing stripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tool For The Every Day Manager or Supervisor","review":"If you supervise even just one person, you will find this book helpful and insightful.

I have now to call sears and pay for another genuine part and for someone to come in and install it for me. My agitator is not moving at all but you can hear it skipping on the agitator dogs. It worked very well to start with but only lasted very LITTLE!!!. Customers be aware don't buy this please go straight to sears and order a genuine part and save yourselves the misery. I have a load in the washer right now that is stuck and have to wait for 4 days for the part to get here.

Brilliant album, with slow, mid and fast tunes. Key favourites - Footsteps and Suzanne . I listen to this a lot whilst travelling to/from work on the trains, but it doesn't stop my feet-tapping, head-nodding and hips-swaying to the beat ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stansfield Remains Spot On","review":"Lisa Stansfield's third domestic release(and fourth overall) finds the soul-pop diva offering the most consistent balance between slow and uptempo material since her debut. After the nearly all-ballads approach on her previous set SO NATURAL, it's a nice change of pace to be reminded that Stansfield is equal parts soul balladeer and dance queen, handling both roles with ease. Highlights of the set include 'The Real Thing', 'I'm Leavin', 'People Hold On', and two first-rate covers--one of Barry White's 'Never Never Gonna Give You Up' and the other a sterling reading of Phyllis Hyman's 'You Know How To Love Me'. Though it didn't win back much of her early nineties audience, it remains her best album to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa is wonderful!","review":"I have heard her on the radio and realized I was missing out not having her music in my collection.

All the things that Focus was known for are featured in this album that was originally issued as a two record set incuding pop, progressive rock, jazz, classical, and even 17th century English folk (Elspeth of Nottingham). Two singles, House of the King and Sylvia may be recognizable to some as they had been used in TV commercials as background music back in the 70s & 80s.

Contained within are most of the better-known Shirelles tunes with the notable exception of \\"I Met Him On A Sunday\\". Coming from Europe, there are a few cuts included that were not top-100 hits in the U.S. but this does contain a few that are not often found on other Shirelles CD's, \\"Are You Still My Baby\\" for one.Overall, the sound quality is reasonably good with tracks 1,3,9,10,12,13,18-20 in mono, the remainder in stereo.
