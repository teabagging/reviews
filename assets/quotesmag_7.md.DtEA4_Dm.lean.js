All this does is twart other TP productions by showing bad profit to other companies who may have been interested in producing something TP or Lynch related. If you buy this, you are a fool. My advice: buy the VHS set, wait a year or two til you've got yourself a DVD burner, and convert them yourself. Concidering how long it took them to put out this subpar set, you have nothing to lose. You'll have the set on DVD sooner than 2020 and, burner included, it will cost you less. It may even be better quality and on fewer discs. I don't know what I was expecting here. Wait, yes, I do.

I would have appreciated a sticker or a warning label on the set, or at least some mention on the box that it was incomplete.So the CD's will sit on a shelf until I get around to ordering the poor quality import.I actually find myself feeling pretty mad that they try to gloss over the fact that they don't include the pilot with a little card that says \\"The Story Far\\".

It is a production you would need to watch from the very start to follow the complicated twists and turns in the plot.... But it is well worth the effort. Twin Peaks is about the investigation into the murder of local girl Laura Palmer. As the story unfolds it becomes apparent that no one is as they appear in this town (and that includes eccentric FBI investigator, Agent Dale Cooper).To say the characters are quirky is putting it mildly, it may be more accurate to say they are verging on the insane which certainly makes it impossible to figure out who the murderer is...most of the population of Twin Peaks have secrets they don't want exposed.This series became cult viewing in the 90's and it is easy to see why. David Lynch has produced a masterpiece that dares to be different and makes no apology for it. Brilliant, bizarre, funny, moving, it will make you laugh and cry. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"great tv show","review":"great show, but the first season just isn't enough to be satisfied with. you never find out who kills laura palmer in this season..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orange on Orange?","review":"A superb show--very refreshing and original. The acting of some of the minor characters was less than excellent. But to be fair, these were only television episodes, not full-blown movies with multi-million dollar budgets and an all-star cast. My real complaint concerns the menu page. The type is orange on a similar orange background, making it extrememly difficult to read. I've had to use the trial-and-error method to find the features. However, once found, they've proven to be rich complements to the show. If you don't consider the price too steep, then I recommend making this purchase.

Any Twin Peaks or David Lynch fan should love this. My only criticism is that the flesh tones of most characters blend seamlessly with the wood paneling in the interior shots (sherrif's office, the lumber mill, the hotel, etc.). This doesn't happen any other time (TV, VHS, DVD), and I have a nice TV set as well. I don't think I want to adjust it just for this series, but this still rules.

It's not for developers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very shallow presentation","review":"The authors spend a great deal of time (and many pages) going over XML under the guise of preparing the reader to understand the underpinnings of BizTalk. In reality, they're clearly just filling out the book.They then touch upon BizTalk itself in as shallow a manner as possible, after which they switch to talking about the BackOffice 2000 offerings that will interact with the BizTalk Server.Again, the BackOffice products are covered with incredible shallowness.The case study at the end is more of the same - basically, the user wanted openness and flexibility, so they used XML and BizTalk. Again, no real details.Unfortunately, there is very little out yet about the BizTalk server. Even so, only the most uniformed managers will learn much new from this book. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful!

Not only does it bloom from spring to winter here in Texas, but it doesn't get out of control like most of the others do. No sprouts coming up from the roots all over the yard plus it doesn't seem to set-seed either. A very pretty burgundy color with blue-filaments showing off from the white center. Just a spectacular plant and a fast grower.I highly recommend ordering from Hirt's Gardens. Excellent and fast service - I received my plant in only 3 days from the time I ordered. The plant arrived in \\"perfect\\" condition.

My only complaint would be that to me this is not an album but more a collection of songs, it does not have a definite flow to it, but then again most rap cds these days don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing.

But now, on the third, the constant fighting is not only exaggerated,but getting a little old. How many times is it funny to hear Frank wish Marie dead, or listen to Debra nag (I cringe whenever she starts that whiny voice) or to watch Marie, once again, favor Ray while poor Robert sits in a corner? It seems things alsolean more to the mean spirited side, and man oh man, it's just getting so not funny anymorethe whole 'Debra doesn't clean, Marie and Frank always barging in.' The jokes seem recycled. Don't know if I'll be buying anymore seasons after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I beg to be different","review":"I cant believe one reviewer asks why people put negative reviews. Well because this site is meant to give readers a critique of the product. That is why. What would be the point of posting 5 star reviews only, lets face it most people are unquestioning fans who post those reviews anyway. The people want to read both sides before they spend lots of money on the DVD.What Ive written in the other Everybody Loves Raymond DVD, I still stand by. This is a creaking not very funny vehicle for the \\"Droopy of comedy\\" (ie sloooow dull delivery) of Ray Romano. Its very bad 1970s in style, and thats not good. The Cosby Show for the 2000s...and that ISNT a complement, trust me.Still that is my opinion, and I am entitled to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love *Everybody Loves Raymond*","review":"I can remember being on a flight where episodes of ELR were being shown.

I regret that I didn't watch ELR on the plane--it would've made the flight more enjoyable. My entire family enjoys this show, including my little sister who is 10 years old. I'm 22 and am in love with the show! It's truly something the whole family can enjoy. You just can't find comedy like this anywhere else. I am anxiously awaiting the release of the 3rd season!

Each of the characters continues to develop, and there are several key episodes in this season (the highlights include Robert finally moving out, the season finale depicting how Ray and Debra first met, and the infamous toaster episode). Definitely the best season of the show up til that point, and they just kept getting better (for the most part)."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unimpressive Presentation to a Good Argument","review":"While I may agree with the overarching principle of this book, I thought the presentation of the arguments and much of the evidence used was unconvincing. Clearly the authors have the idea of time spent verses outcomes produced right. If the book focused more on that, and perhaps on some other social issues, and along the way gathered more convincing evidence, I would have found it more appealing. For me, this book reads like the sour grapes of affluent parents who would much prefer to sip wine at the dinner table after a hard day at the office, or hit the slopes on vacation than help their children with simple and boring homework. And that's a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homework is how you learn","review":"In the classroom the teacher presents material. At home the student learns how to use the material on his own. That is the goal education. If all work were done in the school, the student would not learn to use it without the teacher.Great athletes do not become great because of the drills that the coaches teach them. They become great because they go home and practice those drills on their own time. The greatest of them practice on their own more than anyone else. The same is true of any discipline."},{"rating":"2","title":"They help you build a case","review":"Whereas Alfie Kohn uses the large body of research compiled throughout the 20th century to bring forth an argument against homework, Sarah Bennett and Nancy Kalish show frustrated, frazzled parents how to take the argument to school and approach teachers, school administrators and board members. They give parents ideas on how to organize parents into a cohesive front. The book is filled with case studies depicting ordinary people who have effectively spearheaded homework policy changes in their children's schools (including Bennett and Kalish). This is a very easy read compared to Alfie Kohn's book \\"The Homework Myth\\", which guides the reader through volumes of research data. \\"The Case Against Homework\\" makes its case in an enjoyable and interesting read. Sort of like..... Alfielight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, good points, more people should read.","review":"This book has a lot of truths about the uselessness of homework and the ruining of childrens' love of learning that our current education system has created."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous territory","review":"Although the research says there is solid evidence to prove that homework is more harmful than helpful, and I hold an Ed.D, I disagree totally with the premise of this book.How can you teach kids responsibility or good study habits when you don't give them any?If families feel that the policy of their particular school system needs work, they should get involved with school site councils and work on agreements with teachers and administrators.

It was suspensful, fast paced and full of surprises. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much.","review":"This book had the potential to be an intriguing suspense however too many characters, too many subplots and an anticlimactic ending made it a disappointing read. I didn't count but I believe there were at least twenty characters introduced with a brief explanation of his/her history and at least three sub-plots.I found myself scanning the subplots to hurridly get to the main plot of murder and to the main characters of Sam, Caitlin, Dina and Frank only to lead to an ending that left too many unanswered questions and the reader,me, who lumbered through the 438 pages actually wanting to read more to get some satisfaction and closeure to the story. I found it too cumbersome to remember how everything and everyone related to the main story if in fact they did. If you enjoy stories within a story you may tolerate this. It wasn't my favorite. I am not however, going to let this one book, since this is the first I've read by this author, dissuade me from trying another by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Okay, the first few pages of the book, I am thinking \\"Cossacks?? In London?? Chasing a girl around and no one is noticing anything wrong??\\" But THEN enter the hero and WOW, this book takes off.

This book was boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL . . . AND AWFULLY LONG","review":"This is the first, and last, novel that I read by Ms. Foley. It took me over a month to read it, while I read and re-read several novels in between. I finally made myself finish it by skimming through most of it. The plot is thin and contrived. The first 24 hours of the action take over half the book, and it is a long book at 467 pages. Issues that could be resolved in a few pages took several chapters and the detailed descriptions of everything from clothes to houses only served to pad the book and bore the reader. The heroine is too precious and the hero is perfectly tortured. The \\"love\\" scenes are deep purple and uninspiring. Nobody is concerned with the proprieties and the actions of the heroine regarding her reputation are anacronistic and unrealistic, even by romance novel standards. This book went straight to the trash and I won't waste any more time nor money on this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Ever since I read Gaelen Foley's Pirate Prince I was hooked. I loved all of her books on the Knight family and this one was no different. She delivers every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best in the series.","review":"This latest entry in this series is the best since The Duke and Lord of Fire. I must admit that every book since those first two has been a disappointment. Finally, One Night of Sin recaptures some of the originality and depth of those first two. I was surprised, but not upset, by what seemed like much more graphic sex and violence.My only criticism is that, from the very beginning, Alec seemed a little too self-aware. He demonstrated an emotional insight that was clearly 20th Century, from understanding how his mother's abandonment scarred him and affected his relationships with women, to being aware that his life lacked meaning and that saving Becky would help him regain his self-esteem. Not very credible. It would have been more interesting and satisfying for him to reach that understanding, with Becky's help, more slowly.Otherwise, a very entertaining read. I hope this signals that Ms. Foley is back on track!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT! 5 Stars is not enough!","review":"The Knight family is my all time favorite and this book about them does not disappoint.Alec and Becky are great together. He is a lost soul and she is just the one to save him, even though they end up saving one another. The chemistry between them is excellent and the love scenes are classic \\"Gaelen\\",Damien and Lucien made an appearence...they are both my all time loves!This is a great book and I highly recommend it to all.I can't wait for the next Knight installment about Jack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this upgrade really worth it","review":"I bought this product thinking it would be a great upgrade to my Front Page.

The film progresses at an agricultural pace: sometimes people take a while to speak their piece, and scenery that merits contemplation gets its due. The filmmaker performed most of the score himself, and to splendid effect.The subject is an individual man, and the filmmaker captures a remarkable range of moments and moods--from singing in an empty silo to a poignant time-lapse sequence of nursing-home care.\\"Hybrid\\" is wonderfully quirky at times. Anyone with a soft spot for the American agriculture decades past will probably be as entranced as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connie Brown sings Patsy","review":"This CD is a throwback to the budget record albums (found in supermarkets & bargain bins) in the 1970's, where popular tunes were \\"played & sung like the original hits\\". The only difference with this release is that Connie Brown is not trying to sound like Patsy Cline. She sings the twelve songs in her own pleasing style. Featured tunes are \\"Crazy\\", \\"Sweet Dreams\\", \\"I Fall To Pieces\\", \\"Walking After Midnight\\", \\"Your Cheatin' Heart\\" (I associate this tune with Hank Williams, not Patsy), \\"True Love\\", \\"Always\\", \\"Faded Love\\", \\"Love Letters In The Sand\\", \\"San Antonio Rose\\", \\"She's Got You\\", & \\"Side By Side\\".

They are both great books but Herbie is a hilarious book. It was a great read and it is funny, realistic, sad, and suspenseful. I would recommend this to someone who wants a nice light read and who wants a few laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine and funny novel about adolescent adventures","review":"Set in the Bronx in 1928, this Herman Wouk novel (his second) is all about Herbie Bookbinder and his experiences growing up during that time period. The scenes are warm and humorous, and move from one to another like the episodes in a good situation comedy. Two of my favorite funny scenes from the many to choose from are when Herbie and his friends are trying to get home on the subway and they don't have the nickel to ride, sneak on, get caught, and promise to send the nickel to the subway authority the next day (which they do); and the school play about the surrender of Lee at Appomattox, which has too many hilarious components to summarize. The writing is light and breezy, yet very assured, and Wouk keeps himself out of it so it doesn't come across as nostalgia in the form of a novel. It's an interesting book about growing up and childhood experiences, and deserves a place on the shelf next to TOM SAWYER and the stories of Jean Shepard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"i stopped reading this book because I was so bored with it. It just wasn't interesting. WINDS OF WAR is his best book by far, no comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great pleasure to read","review":"Herman Wouk is an incredible author.

A lot of fun and I found myself laughing outloud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to find, but worth it you do","review":"This is a difficult album to describe, but I'll try anyway. If you take the instrumental sophistication of progressive rock, the confrontational political stance of punk, the agression of heavy metal, and the weirdness of alternative you may come up with some that doesn't sound too far from SFI. Highly recommended for those who like stuff Dream Theater, Watchtower, Spiral Architect, Cynic, and other intellectual and technical bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird...","review":"I was given this CD being told it was Death Metal, which I am an avid fan of. Well, it wasn't death metal, but it was something very different. Its thrash/punk/progressive rock,- it's weird. The songs are quirky and frantic, as in time changes are very abundant. It's an interesting listen and definitley weorth your time, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!","review":"I love Don Cherry.

As a matter of fact, it is the one I lend to people considering Yoga. I have been enjoying my foray into yoga and this tape was the most complete and informative. Sara is pleasant, informative, clear and concise without being condescending. She is attractive and capable without being \\"intimidatingly\\" fit. I feel that is especially important to people that feel they are a bit \\"behind the fitness curve\\" and for men that are a little shy about what they may perceive as a \\"womans\\" activity. An Excellent purchase that you'll be able to come back to again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"why so much???????????","review":"My wife and I love this dvd. We have taken classes in the past and this dvd is a nice alternative to leaving the house when kids won't let us. We had previously borrowed it from my mother in law and decided to purchase our own. However in searching amazon, we found the dvd listed at well over $40. ???????? When looking at other websites this dvd is priced at $10-$12. I was just wondering if the case was made of gold or if it came with a real life yoga instructor?

The Yoga for Dummies tape was so basic it gives you instructions on how to stand up. The workout was too simple even for someone who has just practiced yoga half a dozen dimes. I would not recommend this tape to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could get my $ back","review":"I haven't excercised in years & thought this dvd would help me ease back into things. I played the dvd & began to follow along. The instructor gave very detailed information regarding the poses. Too much, she never stopped talking!

After that it is doubtful it will be of much use."},{"rating":"1","title":"yoga for dummies (literally)","review":"sarah is dimwitted and slow talking, spending the majority of the tape rambling on about things rather than just getting to the point of doing the exercises. this tape is perfect for people who want to watch yoga but not actually perform it. i like looking at sarah, and there are plenty of close ups of her face (always the critical part of the body when doing yoga exercise). i am returning my copy, and will wait until sarah does a sequel \\"Nude Yoga for Complete Idiots\\" before buying again (. . .)"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I love Sarah.

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yoga Video I have ever seen","review":"Yoga for Dummies with Sara Ivanhoe is really a fantastic video. I have tried many previous Yoga videos, but allways found that they assume a lot of previous knowledge concerning yoga. This is true even of the other \\"beginning\\" yoga videos. The great thing about Yoga for Dummies is that it assumes absolutely no knowledge. It starts with the basics and makes them fun. Sara is delightful, funny, and attractive. This is great way to start to learn Yoga. I am hoping that she will make a more advanced version once I am ready for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm going to get rid of my other yoga video tapes","review":"I have several yoga tapes. The problem is that they are often too difficult for me. This tape, like the Yoga for Dummies book, has basic yoga poses that are a good \\"daily dozen\\" that I can do.

I recommend it to anyone who is interested in trying yoga!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"This is an excellent DVD to get you started in the basics of yoga. It shows you each pose in detail so you can do it correctly and not injure yourself. The only downside is that once you master it, you need another program to move on. But if you're just learning it's the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This is an excellent introduction to Yoga. It is a great flexibility workout, but relaxing at the same time. Sara is easy to listen to and encouraging, and the poses are explained extremely well. There is only drawback to this dvd, and it is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5... Once you've done it a few times, and are familiar with the moves, the DVD moves too slow... I almost wish there was a routine with lots of explanation for the beginners, and then the same routine that just moves through the poses... i may actually start doing the daily dozen without the DVD when the moves are perfected!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOR BEGINNERS!","review":"My husband and I wanted to start doing yoga and knew absolutely nothing about it. \\"Basic Yoga Workout for Dummies\\" is great! It takes you through twelve basic yoga poses and describes your posture and breathing technique for each pose. It's slow enough so it doesn't leave you behind. The instructor give you tips along the way to modify your poses too, if your too restricted to comfortably do some of the poses. This workout may get boring after you've practiced through it several times, but for a beginner, still a great one to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"I had never tried yoga before, and after reading several reviews I decided to try this DVD.

This DVD is a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga for Dummies","review":"I tried a yoga class a couple of years ago and didn't like it. I thought it was just sitting in uncomfortable positions for as long as you could stand it. With this DVD, I've learned to love it.

I'm alternating it with the Pilates for Dummies workout which is a great combination for me - someone who hates to workout but knows the health benefits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doing Yoga at home.","review":"After just a few classes of yoga from a local instructor, I was unable to continue attending. This video has been perfect! I have needed step-by-step reminders about positioning and breathing. This grandma has definitely become stronger and more flexible. I have tried more advanced videos, but keep returning to this for the basics. I would recommend it to anyone who is beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying & Unrelaxing","review":"Don't buy this DVD unless you can stand annoying sounds & images popping up on the screen while you're working out. I like the Dummy books & their icons, but the icons do not belong on a DVD. If you want yoga for relaxation, this is not the DVD for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe better for just viewing","review":"The constant instruction during the moves was irritating. There was a good bit of talking. I was more tense after my session than before I started. For a beginner who just wants to see the moves and study correct position, maybe this is helpful. Personally, it made me so hyper-aware of form, I couldn't concentrate on relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Video for beginners","review":"After suffering several injuries last year and just finishing up with physical therapy, this video was just what I needed to get back into shape gently. It shows you, step by step, the correct and careful posing of the yoga practice, and it built up my confidence so that I felt comfortable enough to join a yoga class. After all...yoga is a practice! Through this video, along with circuit training at my gym, I am now also doing Pilates for Dummies with great results!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the Beginning Beginner!","review":"-This is for the Beginner who has yet to begin, lol. Buy this tape as a pre-yoga instructional. The workout focuses on 12 basic poses, and is very easy to follow along with. The explanations accompanying each pose are excellent!-I was amazed when I learned the correct way to breathe during YOGA! She explains perfectly how to breathe, move, change positions, etc.-For a very first-timer, this will give you a workout. You will feel a tiny bit sore in certain areas the next day, but not too bad. I suggest buying some other beginner YOGA tapes/dvd's for after you master these 12 basic moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I am a martial arts instructor and free-lance writer. I own several yoga tapes and use each one for a different purpose.Yoga for Dummies is wonderful for clarifying the various elements of the basic 12 movements. Many tapes just start right in as if you already have the knowledge of how to do a particular move. Sometimes just doing is not enough. For those of us who want an explanation behind the move, Yoga for Dummies does exactly that.As a writer, I love doing the basic 12 right after a six-hour session behind the PC. It thoroughly loosens my neck, back and legs, it recharges my mind and it just plain leaves me feeling good.And if you are a martial artist, you will be happy to discover that the poses quickly add new flexibility.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic Yoga Workout for Dummies","review":"The program is nice the first time through, but the demonstrator adds so much commentary that you have to fastforward extensively whenever you use the dvd to perform the program."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ONLY way to start yoga! Easy to learn!","review":"My husband has wanted to start yoga for a long time. We took out videos from the library, got books, even got a set of \\"yoga cards.\\" The problem with all the videos was that they went way too fast, even if the poses were easy ones, you need some time to figure out where to put what, and get used to it. And watching someone do it is much better than reading about it in a book.I just bought this for my husband for Christmas, and now we're both doing it! It shows you 12 do-able poses, not all easy by any means, but easy enough for beginners to do without collapsing. She goes through them slowly and you really have time to figure out what you're doing. You feel like you could do it again by yourself.I highly recommend this DVD. We're finally into yoga thanks to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great for the REAL beginner","review":"So many videos and books say for the beginner. But, they really require some previous experience and a lot of coordination. This one treats you like an adult but takes things slow. You are able to perform almost all of the positions on your first try. Maybe in the modified way but still doing them. I have three children and had back surgery 3 years ago- so this is something to be able to get through the whole tape. The guide speaks in a relaxing tone and shows even the smallest steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best beginner yoga intro","review":"If you are like me, new to yoga and fairly inflexible, then this is your best intro video. The others I have tried don't seem to understand the term \\"beginner\\" and try to plunge you into difficult postures and concepts to quickly. The instructor frequently reminds you that you should only move as deeply into the postures as is comfortable for you and that you shouldn't view the practice as competitive. Excellent use of video technology: modifications are offered in pop-up windows, either to increase the difficulty of certain postures or to make them easier.Hey, one of these days I might be able to touch my toes without bending at the knee. Well maybe...."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for begining","review":"Its a great video to learn some of the posses of Yoga. I would recommend getting another video as well or schedule a class as this video doesn't do much beyond teach you the poses.

We are a hearing family. My daughter is going for her certification in ASL and watched it with me. She liked the way the woman in the DVD signed the carols. It is not pure ASL; there are also Home signs thrown in there to make it fit with the music. My younger daughters are learning ASL, but the songs in this DVD are too difficult for them. I was hoping they could learn a few carols in Sign for Christmas. I will keep it on hand, though. Maybe they will be ready by next Christmas! I appreciated that the songs she chose were actual Christmas carols, and not just \\"holiday\\" music. It was a little pricey for a 15 minute DVD, though, but there are not many DVD's around like this, so I think it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"After the excellent 'Beauty Myth', I found this book to be a great disappointment. It may be useful for those women who have college degrees and now want to break the glass ceiling in the high powered business world, but it has nothing to say to those of us who are still trying to get access to equal pay and decent jobs. Wolf is a white middle class American and it shows - she can talk to other women like herself, but in this book she has absolutely nothing to say to the rest of us. Susan Faludi's book 'Backlash' is far more worthwhile for addressing issues that matter to the majority of women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, powerful, and practical","review":"If you read one book on feminism, read this: Fire With Fire clearly explains how women today are in a battle for equality-- and what women can do to help themselves succeed. Naomi Wolf's style is direct and straightforward, and hits the nail on the head; she rejects the ivory-tower academics and the poor-me victims in favor of concrete examples of real problems, the damage caused to women (and to men) and specific suggestions of what could improve the situations. I recommend Fire With Fire most highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Randal Terry proxy","review":"Wolf's religious conversion to the anti-choice cult winning citations from Priests for life among other seedy sources makes her a good candidate for sermonizing at a Promise Keeper rally.

The pulpy format of this paperback compliments it's content."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip off","review":"The book is very hard to read and sometimes I don't get the author's discussions. Her analysis is complex and very opinionated. I found the book distasteful and very feminist. The author's attempt to level off the feminism in her book and her pessimistic view of men by the sections full of achievements of women is obvious and poorly concealed. This is the book for the feminist and for people who don't know the difference between good and bad books."},{"rating":"1","title":"bull...","review":"The card came to me damaged and when I tryed to get a refound I had to pass through a lot of burocracy, I'll never buy anything from this people again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, great price, and the last of the PCI video cards","review":"I searched everywhere for a good PCI video card.

This text is indispensible to anyone seeking insight into where China is headed in the coming decades. It is, however, written in a journalistic style. Therefore, those seeking an academic, scholarly examination of the Tiananmen Square Massacre and the socio-political impact that followed will not find it here. Schell is extensive in his examination of events, one might even say exhaustive. He masterfully paints an image of the modern movements in China and it is for this reason that Mandate of Heaven is a valuable work.As a passionate student of History at Indiana University, I had hoped to find, as indicated above, an academic work studying modern China. Schell's perspective is essential to such an understanding, but Mandate of Heaven does not take a scholarly approach. The book was nonetheless an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schell delivers...","review":"Schell is a sensitive observer of events. Schell is putting his undergraduate training in Chinese to good use. I am the process of comparing works by Bernstein, Butterfield, Fraser, and Schell, and I have been impressed with Schell's works so far.

Overall, a very good job"},{"rating":"1","title":"so this is literature . . .","review":"Gentlemen, I am not impressed. I understand that Russians worship Pushkin as the be-all and end-all of their literary language, assigning him much the same significance as we do to Shakespeare or Germans, Goethe. If Pushkin is the best they have to offer, they'd better do some serious searching: perhaps a contest for a $10 prize would ferret out something deeper. True, Pushkin is a decent writer--and I recognize that, having a very sketchy command of Russian and not having read his prose in the Russian original, I cannot begin to capture a fair idea of what he actually sounds like--but I was utterly underwhelmed. And I gave the man a fair whirl: I read his complete tales of Belkin (of which, to be fair, The Undertaker was a reasonably funny stint) and a supposedly entertaining novella, The Captain's Daughter. I have been exposed to a wide array of Russian writers--some titanic, some less known, some quite obscure--and I have yet to find cause to jump up and down.

It appears to have everything necessary to make it a great film. The problem appears to stem from the producer's desire to include every cliche concerning the gay world.

Beautifully done, and extremely well acted.

The makeup and outfits were a bit over the top for someone just coming out.The biggest problem I had with the DVD is that it is basically unwatchable due to the worst digital transfer I've ever come across. The picture begins to pixilate less than half-way through the film. Shortly after, the sound begins to fall out. After the loss of sound, the D/A converter becomes so overwhelmed with the jumble of data that everything freezes with no way out except to stop the disc. Somehow I was able to fast-forward past the frozen spot, but it froze again less than a minute later, with the pixilation happening the whole time. As a result, I can say I've never really seen the entire film due this mess of a transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Get It","review":"What was the point of the movie?

I was a little interested in seeing what it was like to be gay when I was a baby, but for the most part, I found the film to lack luster and...well...lame. It was trite in the manner in which it delivered its message. \\"Edge\\" was almost trying to be the American answer to \\"Beautiful Thing\\", but wasn't. It had its moments, however. The lead boy gave a solid performance. The script was sprinkled with laughter inducing lines (but no belly laughs here).

Aside from watching an extremely handsome kid turn himself into a Boy George wannabe, and several cliche scenes that have been repeated either in the exact same way or much better in 1000 other films, there's nothing left. Worth a rental in my view, not a purchase. Or at least Strand needs to seriously rethink their pricing for this film.With that said, the acting is excellent all around, especially Chris Stafford who made the most out of a truly mundane script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"Bland, bland, and more bland.It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark.

The only detail omitted which matters to me is a description of Jack, Eric, & Ginger's various brands and models of instruments/amplification.

So, I waited about an hour and used the tube brush, but nothing happened. At that point, I put in another cleaning tablet and waited overnight. Again I used the tube brush and still no affect. Granted my tube had some tough algae which had been in there for a while, but I expected some of it to be removed.

Rather than using glue dots which are easily liftable so that the list may be removed and stored inside the tin, the list is rather securely glued to the tin.

At first I thought I'd fast forward through the stretch exercises in between the weight lifting exercises, but I soon realized how great the stretch exercises were so that I didn't wear myself out by the time I finished.

We have had issues in the past with our pump getting clogged with lint and hair which leads to leaks. The product certainly traps lint but the issue was keeping the filter attached to the hose. The velcro attachments do not hold well and once they get wet they are even less effective. The picture shows an orange zip tie and white filter however we received gray velcro bands and a black cloth filter (which made it harder to see the lint when cleaning). I also found that the filter was not easy to clean, the lint just sticks too well. This means you will have to replace the filter often. We are back to using nylon socks and attach with zip ties or a strong rubberband. They are also much easier to clean and seem to last longer for us.

That being said, it only cooks on the left side. The right eye is useless, so multi-task cooking is not happening. The only result you're likely to see using two eyes is a tripped breaker. I would assume this means it is not a very cost-efficient device. The left eye (larger one) gets incredibly hot, even on the medium setting.

I also ordered \\"Don't Shoot the Dog\\" by the same author and was more than pleased with that book. I guess if you have never trained your dog and your dog is a puppy, or doesn't have any problems and you just want to teach it some tricks then this book is a good intro, but if you get the two other books I mentioned, the \\"Getting Started\\" book contains no new info and is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"clicker training for dogs","review":"I chose ths book because I am familiar with the author. therefore I bought the book to learn more about training dogs with the clilcker method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Item Sent!!!","review":"I don't hate it.

First, for the way that a person's entire thought process can change and how engrained believes can change because of 1 simple encounter. Second, for the way that the pure isolation and lonliness of this dog (or any animal) was forced to spend his days because of human greed and lastly, because of the bond created between a person and an animal which can be life-changing (both good and bad) in so many ways.

It pulls emotions without being manipulative and has a tenderness to its voice reflective of the story's heroine. She is an unforgettable character as is Damien, the book's four legged hero.

The ending is even more far-fetched than the plot.

It is extremely well written and carries a very important message for both animal lovers and non animal lovers alike. Ms. Jessup obviously knows dogs well, as the main character, Damien, is so well portrayed and life like, his journeys evoke every emotion in the reader, as any well written book should. Although this book is fiction, real life scenarios such as in this book are played out everyday and we all need to wake up to the plight of these helpless animals. The Dog Who Spoke With Gods also shows the true spirit of the dog, the feelings and emotions he shares with the human race and the kind of relationship that humans and dogs can and often do share, despite the claims of those who have never had the privilege of experiencing this kind of a bond with a dog.

They say imitation is the best form of flattery, but I found it disturbing that Worley couldn't have been more imaginative in putting her book together, especially Chapter 6, which tells the story of Amy Boyer - this was covered much better in Net Crimes & Misdemeanors in Chapter 9. Visit www.netcrimes.net and see the difference for yourself with the sample chapter there.

So she wrote this book instead. And I'm glad she did. I'm a Christian Zen practitioner and really enjoyed and related to Boorstein's experiences and musings.I also recommend Boorstein's \\"It's Easier Than You Think,\\" a quirky, anecdotal, practice-oriented introduction to Buddhism.

Although I'd like to give the movie three stars just because of G-Baby's smile, it isn't good enough. Aside from its departures from the real-life story, the movie is too conventional, formulaic and disjointed and the acting from the lead is painfully awkward. He careens wildly from dark desperation to a mediocre Jerry Lewis impersonation to Knute Rockne-type speeches, which are delivered with a peculiar stiffness, except for the arms, which resemble someone signaling a taxiing airplane.

The only thing they ever did that was ever fun....was play baseball. Bad News Bears it's not!

The soppy ending ruined whatever chance this movie had of being different from the others, but it just fell flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardball","review":"The movie proved that Keanu Reeves is very capable of expressing emotions on screen, contrary to his harshest critics. He was able to convey his initial attitude change from someone who was only coaching a kid's baseball team for money he desparately needed, to someone who genuinely cared with subtle finesse. It wasn't a cartoon character performance. The child actors also performed at a professional level not expected from their age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for aspiring poets","review":"This book coinsides with the legend that is Jim Morrison.

Abstract and vague, tending toward rambling private lines, _Wilderness_ simply isn't poetry. Rather, it is a collection of ideas and insights by a man who was truly talented. Morrison could write SONGS--not poetry. Perhaps he graced us with \\"The End,\\" but poetry is not his forte. I am always moved by \\"When the Music's Over\\" and \\"The Unknown Soldier,\\" but with the maudlin and confused lines offered in _Wilderness_, I can't help wondering exactly what Morrision had in mind.

I was excited to get \\"Wilderness\\", but when I finished it an hour or so later I was quite disappointed. I'm sure Jim would not care that I didn't like it and I still have the highest respect for him even now. I think the people who put this volume together was scraping together whatever was left over to make a buck off of Jim's estate. I'm glad I only paid $4 for it but I feel cheated of the hour I spent reading ever word cover to cover hoping to find \\"The Mojo\\".

I'm gonna guess there's only one man who knows what the majority of these poems are about. I like poetry too, but alot of what's here seemed almost like random words thrown together. Some of it literally was. I did notice a number of times lines that ended up in Doors songs, portions of lyrics. I'll take hearing some of his poetry backed with music anyday over just reading it. I just recently heard singer Neko Case refer to Jims poetry as high schoolish. That might be a little harsh, but she's not far off. The pictures in the book we've all seen before.

Because of his spending history (pork project spending) I find the book hard to take for the auther seems to be condemning Presidents for their spending practices; when in fact it is he (he is the ranking member of the Senate Finance Commettee) and other Senators who must OK the spending requests of the President.

Just for kicks, I continued the procedure and found extreme difficulty getting the motherboard to slide past the screen glass without damaging soldered-on chips. I know that micro-soldering is not my strength - so I consider my mini a loss. The product looks good, but technique is critical.

The battery works great and my ipod is FINALLY holding a longer charge. I can now use it for 7+ hours and still have battery life, before it was down to 20 minutes. I highly recommend buying a replacement battery rather than buying a new ipod. It's a much more affordable way to go and I'm so glad I did it.

By contrast, the original battery had a lower rating of 630 mAh, but it delivered 20 hours of continuous play time when I bought my mini 4 years ago.Another issue is the dimension of the battery, which is a few millimeters wider than the original EC007-5. After the battery was squeezed into place, the circuit board was bent to one side due to the tension buildup by the bigger battery. Although the curvature is small, it caused the LCD screen to press more tightly against the glass panel.In short, I am very disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money.","review":"Ultimately you will ruin your ipod by taking it apart with their tools. battery will work but the controls will not!!

If the pasta dish doesn't turn out, I think it will be worthwhile to try the recipes with just meat and veggies, adjusting the proportions appropriately.

The itinerary layouts, the author provides suggested \\"tours\\" or itineraries of the various beaches, were well done and assisted us greatly in deciding what to see and visit. Upon leaving the Normandy area, we slowly made our way to Arras through the countryside and the old Somme battlefied. After having the book for the Normany area, i was disappointed to not have something as detailed to use for the area of the Somme (i had not purchased the Holt's Somme book).

For anyone who enjoys reading about the history of the original colonies along with it's notorious characters, this is excellent reading.

My personal favorite is Lord Have Mercy On A Country Boy, as it sure is the truth about everyone that grew up in the backwoods and it's great to see a guy who isn't afraid to hide being from the backwoods of North Carolina, instead he fully embraces it and it just makes you fall in love with that voice all the more!We can only hope that his son, due in the fall will inherit that voice!!!I look forward to hearing more out of Josh Turner, as his voice just never gets old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait!","review":"Country music doesn't get any better than this!

I had high hopes for Loretta Lynn's Lincoln but it turned out to be the worst song on the album.This is not country, the only thing country about him, and the only thing this guy has going for him, and the only reason he is famous is his voice... too bad he's wasting a good voice on horrible songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of his 3 albums","review":"This is not a \\"amazing\\" album by any stretch.

Season 2 went more into science-fantasy instead of science-fiction. Irwin Allen realized that too, I think, and went back to more of a science-fiction theme in Season 3, but not to the extent it was in the inaugural season. I was retunctantly going to buy Season 2 so that I would have a complete collection. However, Fox's unsuppported and illogical decision to split Season 2 into two volumes, has made me postpone my decision to buy Season 2. I've never heard or seen such a thing. I hope Fox releases a decision as to why American buyers are being subjected to this version verses UK buyers, who are not. Unfair! I may just wait and purchase Season 3 and forego Season 2. Just seems too much of a hassle and effort to have to wait and buy two sets for Season 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grumble, grumble - UK fans fared better with LIS Season Two","review":"Another twist to disgruntle LIS fans, who really wanted LIS Season Two in a single complete second season DVD set. Why is the Season Two Vol 2 set selling for more on Amazon than the Season Two Vol 1 set? In total, buying the two separate Season Two sets are more expensive together than the single Season One set was at issue. That is just what many buyers feared would happen. Enough said. I'm fortunate to have a multi-region DVD player, so I bought the single box Season Two set from the United Kingdom release.

It's a shame that people might see this movie, without having first seen Dr. Strangelove, Lolita, The Mouse That Roared, and/or Being There. This movie might mislead people into thinking he had no redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top notch acting, poor direction","review":"The acting is stunning. Rush is almost as amazing playing Peter Sellars as he is playing the other actors. He plays the other actors in terribly conceived bits where he (Rush) takes on the roles of other characters as they step out of the story and comment on it. The film fails for a few reasons: the take on Sellars is relentlessly negative, so we never care about him; the music is ham-fisted, the script is laughable. But everyone shines, Emily Watson, Charlize Theron, Stanley Tucci, Miriam Margoyles, everyone is great. Too bad this doesn't make the movie watchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"love peter sellers, hate this film","review":"Peter Sellers next to Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd is the best example of comedic talent in the world.

My biggest fear is that a customer who is new to opera may buy this CD and think that these tinny voices are what opera is about. In my opinion, the sloppy, commercialized remixes are a mockery of all the beauty opera possesses. The \\"Babes'\\" voices are terrible, too...poor technique and no ring. If you'd like to listen to some opera, try Puccini."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"This album promises to deliver and truly does not! The 'rags to riches' story is cute but their delivery of music is far from that. With so many wonderful albums now available to classical and classical crossover music lovers - such as AMICI FOREVER, JOSH GROBAN, MARIO FRANGOULIS - all with a unique, honest sound and with lush orchestrations, yet true to their roots I fail to understand how your reviewers can rate this album! I can only assume they have not bought any of the others I mentioned so I seriously suggest they do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully modern introduction to Opera","review":"this album is great for any crossover fan. The Operababes with their own unique story sing beautifully together on this CD. Many of the songs are given original lyrics, like Ode to Joy, and new twists, like the Flower Duet. Any opera fan can appreciate the wonderful aria \\"un bel dì\\", as well as new listeners. It is a great buy for any music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm","review":"From a classical vocalist's perspective, I was fairly appalled. I have never thought of myself as an opera snob per se, but I really didn't understand this album. I was listening to the Flower Duet, which I have performed many times. Not only did I not think their voices blended as well as they should, but the disco beat--which could be an interesting feature, I will admit--didn't even line up with the music. I don't know, I don't want to completely write off the entire \\"popera\\" genre, because as a hopeful opera singer, I hope this will draw people towards a greater appreciation of opera as an art form. But the disco beats combined with Lakme just sounds contrived, not honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy renditions and amateurish","review":"I heard one of the selections on Sirius and liked it so I bought the CD. Upon hearing the entire CD I was disappointed that the only selection I liked was the one that prompted me to buy the product. The voices are nice but they are simply adding voice to opera masterpieces that do not fit. They are certainly not of the caliber of Sarah Brightman or Charlotte Church and don't look for that. Their sound is mellow, dim and without the emotion that does an inservice to the opera pieces they sing. I found the CD lackluster and in all honestly very \\"amateurish\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Voices - Heavy Arrangements","review":"The story's great - who doesn't love the Liza Doolittle-like twist. The singing's good - these \\"babes\\" are obviously talented and well-trained - but the arrangements overpower and distract from their singing. Hope they get to make another album that displays their singing a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource.","review":"This was a excellent purchase. All that I had hoped for.

I've learned more about turkeys and turkey hunting that I expected, and it has helped me understand some of the mistakes I have made in past seasons. I'm a better turkey hunter because of this book, and there are few how-to books that have helped me so much. There are some things I am still trying to figure out--like the gobbler yelp that the author refers to a lot--but a bit of internet searching cleared that up, and helped me understand some of the other calls.

The instructiosn even sat to hold the candle at an angle. This allows the wax to flow from the flame down so it looks like you are getting ear wax. We held one vertical and wax ddi not flow.Oh yea, not only does it do nothing, it has a five inch flame. Be careful that you do not set your hair on fire.

It is an academic book, not a popular book, although it is accessible to the lay reader. But its primary interest is for the student of history of ideas, as its contributions have been absorbed into the literature and its flaws are therefore that much more obvious; it is now very much dated. Contrary to the previous review, there are several case studies in this book. Four stars for its contribution, rather than its current relevance."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I thought this book was soooo bad. I like some of what Lasky writes, but this was just a waste. It contained advice that any person with a brain would know.

She was a very smart leader, who could speak: English, French, Italian, Latin, and Greek. Under her rule England's power increased greatly.

She is sent to Hatfield and writes to Queen Catherine about bringing her back from exile. Soon, she later will join the Court back at Hampton Court.

It is written in diary entry form. It talks about Elizabeth's friends and family and how they affected her life. It also talks about Elizabeth's fear of dissapointing her father or making him mad and being sent into exile. Elizabeth's relationship with her sister Princess Mary, who does not like her, is also a fairly large part of the book.

This combines the author's imagination with the true story of the young princess Elizabeth. I love the mixture of fact and fiction. This book makes Elizabeth seem less like historical royalty and more like a kid. That could be both good and bad, depending on your point of veiw. There are also some fabulous pics at the end as well as a Tudor family tree. I used this book on a report of King Henry VIII.

As in her believing she will never be queen and her never wanting to be married.

I bought it as soon as I saw it and read it as soon as I had time. People know the history of Louis the XIII, but hearing Elizabeth's view is truly unique. People of all ages will inevitably enjoy this wonderful reading experience. It's not like the dull history teachers at school, it's colorful and interesting to read.

It tells the story of Elizabeth, daughter of King Henry VIII, and how she struggles for his attention and approval.King Henry has had 6 wives in sucession, trying to have a male heir. Elizabeth has never really known the love of a mother for more than a few months or years, and her father is too busy most of the time. Elizabeth wonders why she has to be so educated, since she is third in line for the throne, but does believe that she could be a better ruler than her brother or sister.I really liked all the little facts about wig bugs and bathing. Also, the family tree, photographs (paintings, actually), and facts at the end of the book is very helpful for reports or just more information. Kathryn Lasky never ceases to amaze me with her accurate portrayls of people in history.

I am glad I read it. If you didn't know the real history it was a good mystery because halfway through the book you wonder if she is going to be banished or have another stepmother die. It is considered fiction because it's written as her Diary. However, I learned alot about her and her family. Although it was fictional it had alot of true facts in it which were very interesting. I recommend this book for people who don't like history because it seemed to be written from the point of view of someone my age. Once you've read this book you want to know more about this period of time. I felt as if I became her and began wondering about the same things she did.

Picture looks dark and dull in many places, but it is acceptable, though.It has 4 chapters, Aquarium 1, 2, 3 and Bonus. They are all equally good.

I SAID LOGICAL FALLACYbut, apparantly according to greene, when three logical fallacies ALL HAVE THE SAME CONCLUSION, then the conclusion just might be true. ...I can't believe how utterly retarded our contemporary physicists are when it comes to breaking the mold. dont watch this show.they should have recorded a lesson on electromagnetism instead .

I found it so amazing I feel like I need to start studying this subject more. Since I am a complete newbie to this subject I can't comment on it's credibility or accuracy, but I can definitely say it has inspired me to learn more about physics in general.The subject matter is complex to say the least, but this documentary's presentation explains the concepts in such a way that total novices such as myself can understand them. It shows some of the equations used in these theories but doesn't go into depth about them so as to lose me in their complexity. There are plenty of real world examples used to explain each concept.Anybody with even a passing curiosity in science and/or physics should check this series out. And even if you have never been curious and just want to watch something different, check this out.

I've been a fan of his books because he is very good at explaining complex concepts in a very simple and tangible way. This first episode is an engaging one hour full with historical references that Brian is able to tie into the modern age of theoretical physics. The special effects are worth a thousand words alone because they are able to convey what would be otherwise very complex ideas into something the viewer can comprehend. As an adult I found The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space to be very engaging and I think a high school student who has an interest in physics and science would also find it amazing. I am looking forward to purchasing the other episodes in this series. Why didn't we have stuff like this when I was in school?!Please keep up the good work at PBS. It's works like this that inspire."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still don't understand it","review":"\\"The Fabric of the Cosmos\\" is an interesting, clear, and sometimes even eloquent description of physicists' view of the universe. For people with imagination, there is some fantastic stuff here, like the \\"frozen river of time,\\" as opposed to our usual concept of time as a flowing river. In the \\"bread slices\\" of time-space, everything that has ever happened in the past is preserved, but we can't get to it. Think about it! My dead grandparents, my two dead husbands are still there, somewhere, on this frozen river, but how can I ever find the ice-skates to glide back to them? No. This is not allowed, not possible. This is an awesome and puzzling concept, like most of the concepts narrated in this video. I don't quite understand it because I've always been bad in math, but I am still fascinated by it. The physicists' universe is so different from ours! It is so hard to digest it in a real, day-to-day way, but it is, as I said, totally engrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, I have an understanding of string theory.","review":"This series is welcomed illumination for a non scientist on topic I have been trying to sort out for years.

There is not a track I didn't like (unusual for me). Not perfect - I think the tracts could have been organized on the disk - but an truly outstanding first effort from a new group, none the less.

While great musisians, most of the songs sound very similar and \\"popish\\" - you can't hear any of their great banjo or Dobro in all but one or two of the songs on the CD. I think they could be great, but were trying too hard for the mainstream MTV / CMT crowd on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing negative","review":"like one of the other reviewers I saw this band on 60 minutes this evening.

This is NOT bluegrass. If you're expecting something a group of youngsters as talented as Nickel Creek, or as authentic as Del McCoury Band, you've definitely come to the wrong place.While this album maybe be an interesting example of cross cultural exchange, this album sounds more like Wilson Phillips of 80's fame, and less like bluegrass. There has certainly been a lot of hype around this album (NY Times article, 60 minutes piece) -- I wonder if the other reviews were written by similar hype-makers. I bought this because my interest was piqued by the NY Times article -- I'm always interested to expand my music collection.Sadly, my copy of \\"Bering Strait\\" is going up for sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost all you could ask for.","review":"This book is almost all you could ask for.

The guitars, bass, drums, and orchestra work amazingly together, and the vocals almost act like a 5th instrument! Everything is perfectly in Sync, and the end result is a powerful, Medieval style metal album. The lyrics resemble poetry, as each verse doesn't quite relate to the other, in a structured sentence sort of way, but it sounds very appropriate the way it is conveyed. This album has got everything from cool Orchestral breakdowns, to good old thrashy riffs and harmonic, and of course very death-metal like growls. A great CD to add to your collection!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but...","review":"I'm not going to lie.

Elaine McHale is supposedly a high power attorney but she is having an affair with a despicable married man. There wasn't one redeeming character in the whole shoddy book.

The LP recording was a preview of the first World of Music, Arts, and Dance festival (WOMAD) held that year in Somerset, England to focus wider attention upon the traditional and contemporary music of non-western culture. The selections are by both western and non-western performers and reflect not only their own traditions but also the cross-pollination of other cultures. It was my first real exposure to what is now classified as World music. It remains an excellent introduction to this wonderful and diverse genre.

After Lydia Cabrera's EL Monte, there has not really been any good serious books on Afro Cuban herbalism out there...especially in English. I must say despite the effort, I found the book dissapointing for a couple of reasons. 1. The information is extremely sparse and general when it comes to the spiritual use of the Afro Cuban herbs. 2. One or two vague uses of the herbs are given with no information on what parts of the plant is used and how. 3. With such a big book, I was suprised to see so little information on the herbs and no pictures. There was so much white space on the page that I felt bad for the poor trees who were cut down and used for this book. A person who has no knowledge of herbalism would probably have more questions than answers after reading this book.

I wouldn't be surprised if it was made on a $60 Sony Walkman with the built-in mic, from about 50 feet back in the audience. The signal level is so low that there is significant rumble and hiss.

It worked fine, but the next time I tried it the gears had jammed up again. Also, you will notice metal dust in your ice cream and rust will start to form on the crank case after your first batch, even if you wash and dry it thoroughly.

The 'genetics' discussions on color (which includes people, chickens, horses, and dogs - all of it suspect) and mutts vs. purebred dogs are total claptrap! I confess, I couldn't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies.' WHAT?? A waste of my hard-earned $. Having read those parts I cannot believe anything that went before or that follows, not that I'm reading any further. How is a multi-published author allowed to put such uneducated 'information' into print? And now she's influenced readers -- a terrible situation. Publisher, where are your pre-publication reviews? Shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, But Can't Recommend It","review":"While I admit this book has fascinating information that I had not seen before, I was distracted by the emphasis on the meat packing industry. That's only logical since one of the authors has spent 30 years working on more humane ways of handling animals. It's not the whole book, but it was almost enough for me to put the book down. In terms of autism, I have to agree with other person who said that they felt she got off the topic. There are just so many times she can say that being autistic, she is more visual than verbal. Ok, I get it. Then she says it a second time, a third time , fourth, .... Better editing would have improved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply....Incredible!","review":"This woman blows me away. Her insights not only into the nature of animals, but into the human realm, are astonishing. Grandin does a fantastic job making the scientific backround material fun to read. By this review,you've got the message that she literally translates how animals see and feel the world and because they are our partners in life and thru history, we owe it to them to treat them as humanely as possible. We literally cannot get along without them. If you read the book, the last 5 or 6 pages sum up the whole thesis. It's about how dogs and man are the closest of partners for over 100,000 years, how we taught and shaped the dog. But amazingly,the dog taught and physically shaped us. Read it, it's true. I even feel good about a tasty steak now."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!","review":"This is a terrific book. I learned about animal behavior and autism. I am a science teacher and I gained understanding of my autistic students and my pets and insight to share with students regarding animal behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"When I heard a review of this book I had to have it. I own a hunting dog and thought this would be a good read. I'm always looking to get insight into his head. This didn't help. In fact I couldn't finish the book. She uses her experience with cattle handling and projects it onto all animals. Sorry, I don't buy the fact that cows get scared of the same things dogs get scared of.And most of the \\"scared\\" examples are from the meat packing industry.If you want insight into your dog..spend an hour with him/her on a long walk in the woods-not reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My oponion of Animals in Translation","review":"Absolutely fascinating reading. A remarkable insight into autismand animal thinking. Perhaps most amazing is how well the author writes despite the handicap of autism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be","review":"I thought this book would help give insight into animal's minds to help with understanding our pets better. It gave some good tips, but they were far and few between. This book focused on issues with animals at meat packing plants...not something I enjoy reading about. I felt like I was reading a school book- too much technical information- not enough down to earth advice/lessons. I hope her 2nd book \\"Animals Make us Human\\" is better because I bought them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating look at animals and autism","review":"I was drawn to this book because I have an interest in animals and autism. Temple Grandin's book did not disappoint me. This is filled with fascinating anecdotes and interesting theories on the animal brain. References to her own autism are very interesting. Grandin has worked with animals in industry (the meat industry for one), and many of the stories are from this world. While this was interesting to me, I expect that most people will read this because they want to know how their own pets (dogs, cats) think. There is some of this, but less than the cover picture of a dog implies. I suppose that the dog cover will sell more books than a cow illustration. Overall, this is a must read for animal lovers. I wanted to learn more about my dog, and I got that plus lots more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book ever on animals","review":"The BEST book ever on learning the insights into animal behavior and their emotions. Anyone who loves animals should read this book...and keep it for a life long reference! Temple's insight into the world of animals is very profound and really makes you think about your animals life and well being. Covers several species of animals and is filled with info on studies done on both humans and animals that are so very interesting and informative. I cannot say enough GOOD things about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"Temple Grandin is a brilliant author and despite her autism an unbelievable communicator to those whom have difficulty visualizing with her perceptiveness. She is able to open the eyes of those blind to an animal's point of view to see the world from a new perspective. This book is highly recommended for those whom want to understand that their view of the world is not the only one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An animal lover's must read","review":"What a delightful book! I couldn't put it down; and I learned so much about animals. I think that the greatest benefit to me is that the book validated some things that I had not even been able to express about my own pets, especially the idea that animals see details and not the big picture that we humans see. It explains why my Hadley dog barks at balloons, garbage cans, especially ones rolling in the wind, and wheelbarrows. And it verified my idea that dogs have to be socialized at a young age or they'll never do well with crowds, children, or other dogs.If you have a pet, you owe it to the animal to read Animals in Translation; I can't remember when I consumed a non-fiction book with such enthusiasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guidelines for the Food Animal Industry","review":"I love books and documentaries about animals, but this one was a BIG disappointment. It should be subtitled, \\"If You're Going to Kill Animals for Food, Here's How to Slaughter Them with as Little Inconvenience to Yourself and Distress to Them as Possible.\\" I'm not saying that the author's topic isn't worthy. However, the title is misleading. She seems to have limited experience with the behaviors of companion animals or wild animals.I'm uncomfortable with an author who sells her services to the slaughter industry. How can she expose herself to humans killing animals on a regular basis and stay attuned to the thoughts and messages of animals? Perhaps I'm not as evolved as she is, though.I couldn't finish the book, and I'm not about to give my copy to anyone as a \\"gift.\\" It gave me a bad feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"turned off to Temple, Animal Behaviors and Autism","review":"Where's the beef? It is taking me so long to read this book. Expecting it to connect, relate or explain Autism. That is, when a Ph.D authors a book and subtitles it Using the Mysteries Of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior you would expect to learn more about this mysterious inflection and evidence that it does or does not relate to Autism. I learned more about large clinic animals then I cared to know about and nothing about Autism.Ms. Grandin is a role model for many families who have children with Autism. However, the author mislead the audience by leading us to the meat packing industry and leaving us there. She has Autism--the co-author has two son's with Autism--where's the beef? tell us something new related to Autism . Temple , us how you see the world-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Party Line","review":"This is probably the worst and most negative book I have ever read concerning animals. It is a party line using statistics that are outdated and unproven and nothing but hearsay by those who are in the business of destroying animals for profit. Her concept of dog behavior is way off base. She obviously is listening to others and has little or no hands on experience and if so with breeds that are cited in the book but not part of her experience. It is a shame that such a book will reach those who are seeking real help will receive negative information that is not true. Associations and professionals that exploit animals for profit are usually not very good sources and always crunch the numbers to accommodate their own gain. Example: neutering and spaying dogs. All nonsense. I find this book offensive but will keep it as a reference to the negative side and an example of what is not true. I was required to choose a rating star but I had to choose 1 as minus is not available. Barbara Sanders"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book of Temple Grandin's Guesses","review":"The first sentence in the book is \\"People who aren't autistic always ask me about the moment I realized I could understand the way animals think.\\"It should have been \\"People who aren't autistic always ask me about the moment I SOMEHOW GOT THE NOTON THAT I could understand the way animals think.\\" There's no proof in this book, no good evidence, just Ms. Grandin's anecdotes and speculations.Noticing a lot of detail because you have autism and being able to use this ability to design humane slaughterhouses does not translate into thinking like animals think.The book does offer many clear, simple descriptions of scientists' research. So if you don't know anything about animal research, these descriptions could be a good place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccuracies regarding canine behavior makes me question less familiar areas.","review":"Because of errors regarding canine behavior and the amount of anecdotal evidence she provides to prove those inaccurate points, I'm wondering about the accuracy of areas I am less familiar with. There's too many things she states that are out of date and inaccurate regarding canines. The dominent Alpha Wolf model of canine behavior she advocates is based on a badly done study. It's been widely discarded by Animal Ethologists today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"This is a beautifully written and incredibly informative book. Temple Grandin is brilliant and I thank her for enlightening me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technical at times, but interesting and insightful","review":"I saw an interview with Dr. Grandin on Book TV recently and she referred to this book sighting similarities in behavior between autistic people and animals. The read provides an enormous amount of insight into how people and animals think and I find it very interesting and entertaining. I relate to Dr. Grandin and like she, think in pictures and have often wondered why I was so different compared to most people I've known throughout my life. I will probably acquire other books of hers to learn more about her experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonder to Read","review":"This book will open your eyes in so many ways. You will be mystified by the abilities of Temple ~ and see all the possibilities and hold a great respect for all autistic people. You will wonder why we do not encourage autistic people to use the unique skills they have, which those of us who are \\"normal\\" find ourselves sorely lacking in. My eyes teared. I recommend this book to all Future Farmer of America members, 4-H members, animal shelter workers, animal rescue workers, and any person who thinks they understand animals, even down to their own dog or cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential reading for animal lovers","review":"I put Temple Grandins books on animals on everyones \\"must read\\" list. I'm not sure why these books are getting a bad reception for including other animals than cats and dogs. Understanding predator and prey animals is important no matter what your studying. Temple explains animal behavior from the basic standpoint of these two categories, prey animals and predator animals. There are plenty books dedicated to dogs and cats, but this book offers a basic rundown and lets you think on your own. To me, that makes this book invaluable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animals in Translation","review":"You have to have an interest in learning about educational and interesting studies and facts about animal behavior. You will gain insight into human and animal behavior. It is not a warm fuzzy book about behavior which I found to be filled with fascinating information about how humans have created several problems in messing with nature to increase their business/personal profits."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed....","review":"Honestly, I thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive. The author's main point, although interesting, seems to me like it would fit into an essay. Also, the particular print of the book that I purchased, has a dog on the cover, I was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior. Instead, I felt I little duped. Most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments/theories or anedoctal accounts of \\"My Friend's dog Fido, one day did this...\\" I hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population. I mean, the author doesn't even have a dog!! I suspect that I, who have had a lifelong history with dogs, have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author.I don't recommend this book to all the dog lovers out there. Now, if your \\"thing\\" is cows.... Get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for Pet Owners","review":"I started reading this book out of curiosity, but it turned out to be serendipitous. Our older dog had recently died at 14, and we didn't realize that our younger dog had concluded that she was now the alpha dog until I started seeing her newly problematic behaviors (including lots of growling at people, which she never did before) on the pages of this book. I used the theories I read about to demonstrate to her that I was the dominant one, and within a few weeks, the problem was gone.Aside from this practical use, I found the book extremely interesting and often funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"an illumination of the mind and world of an autistic person which gives the reader an insight into a different, yet constructive way of seeing and being in this world...and the amazing contributions that can be made"},{"rating":"2","title":"Temple Grandin is my idol","review":"I've bought as many of her animal books I can get my hands on. As a student studying to be a cattle specialist myself, her insight is invaluable. She also talks about domestic animals like dogs and cats, which is very helpful for pet owners without much knowledge to better understand what their pet is thinking! If you love animals, you'll love this book, and Temple's many others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just about animals - people too","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read and I recommend it to everyone.Don't let the title mislead you. This book isn't just about animals. It is about the fundamental nature of thought, and most of the things this book talks about apply to humans too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Trainer Approved!","review":"As a dog trainer, this book changed my life and how I work with animals. This book taught me so much about how the animal brain works in comparison with humans, their developmental stages, and how I can apply my training in more effective ways. At my level of education and experience with dogs, I thought I had learned everything there was to learn. This book surprised me and taught me so many new things and helped me grow to appreciate my tail wagging clients, and their humans so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you think you would like it, you'll enjoy it!","review":"We are so fortunate to have Temple Grandin's insights. In Animals in Translation, she goes on at length about animal behavior (mostly farm animals and pet dogs) and animal/human neuroscience. Along the way, she sprinkles in observations and insights about autism, including the differences between how visual thinkers solve problems vs. how verbal/abstract thinkers solve problems. Even though this book isn't primarily about autism, people interested primarily in autism might find the whole book worth their while."},{"rating":"1","title":"just...poor","review":"I wanted to like this book. I was awed by some of the reviews, fascinated by the notion put forth by many reviewers (as well as TG herself) that she has some special connection and understanding of animals. No. Frankly, I don't believe she does.I have read many books by people who work with animals (Jean Donaldson, Suzanne Clothier for starters) that share a wealth of information and understanding.Honestly, I was more than disappointed in this book. I could not find an insight that was new, and there were some statements that I found simply bizarre.Moreover, there is a basic disconnect here in the idea that a person with a supposedly fine-tuned connection to animals could spend a career developing better ways to slaughter them. I was willing to suspend any judgement on that while reading the book, but I return to that question again."},{"rating":"1","title":"No understanding of canine behavior","review":"Please do not use this book as a guide to understanding your dog. Dr. Grandin does not appear to know anything about dogs or even like them very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Grandin speak at a conference not long ago, and I was amazed. She is an incredible person, educator and captivating speaker. Her passion for animals, and devotion to educating others was evident in every word she spoke. I highly recommend her latest book, and consider myself lucky to have heard her speak in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I was very impressed with this book. Grandin cites lots of new research in autism and applies it well to animals. She amazes me with her wealth of knowledge and how new the research is that she discusses. While I felt some of her connections seemed a bit of a stretch, overall it was highly insightful. the basis for her relating autism to animals seems to be the similiar way they process the world visually.I highly reccomend this book for those with an interest in autism and who like animals. For animal lovers who do not have an interest in autism I wouldn't specifically reccomend this book unless they're willing to branch out a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"As both Author and Veterinarian....","review":"Over the years, I've read countless books written about animal psychology, physiology, and behavior: some scientific and dry, others full of treacle and nonsense. So it is rare to find one that still manages to offer a unique viewpoint. More importantly here is a book that offers insights into not only \\"all creatures great and small,\\" but also into who we are--both as animal and human. I still continue to work with my local humane society, volunteering my services, spaying and neutering. I've recommended this book to my co-workers at the shelter. I also recommend this book to anyone who has compassion for animals--whether large or small--and who wishes to delve deeper into the mystery of our role, relationship, and responsibility to those who share this globe--both human and animal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe-inspiring!","review":"I am enchanted with this book, one of the most exquisite books I have seen in a long time. The photos are beautiful and thought provoking. The carefully chosen texts reflect not only the scientist's natural bias toward the provable, but also the respectful awe of the scientist who cannot totally explain the observable phenomena. It is a book I want to share with many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Photo!!","review":"I purchased this rain gauge based upon the photo as I was looking for a rain gauge that had measurements in both inches and mm as shown in the photo --what I received has inch measurements on both sides and not what is show in the picture.

It also does not look at all like the picture shown on various web sites.It is a piece of crap and Taylor should take it off the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the gauge pictured","review":"Plenty of reviews before mine pointed out that the picture is not what you get. By the time I looked at it, the first picture is wrong, but the other 3 show the right one. Just in case, I looked it up on the Taylor website, and it is the curved body with the yellow background. Since I mounted it on the fence outside, we've had a few rainstorms, and I am completely happy with it. One thing my wife and I both like is you can get a decent reading from a fairly sharp angle. My 5 star rating is for how it works, not Amazon's pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rain gauge","review":"The rain gauge has been in use outside for the past month and has been relocated several times. Thus far, it has held up very well and is very easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of online description","review":"You may want to check with the vendor about what exactly you're getting before ordering this gauge: I purchased two because of the metric AND english gradations and the price was right - what I got was an inches-only gauge that did not have nearly the precision advertised. Heck, it wasn't even the same shape or color as pictured!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems durable but doesn't collect rain, only bugs","review":"I have owned this for over a month now and we have had multiple heavy rainstorms. When the storms are over, I check the rain gauge and I have never seen water in it, only bees and other bugs that have managed to die in it.

This should be required reading in high schools throughout America. I make this last comment as the concerned parent of teenagers who are being taught history from a decidely globalist and socialist perspective in our schools, which are paid for with hard earned capitalist dollars. It is truly a shame.Perloff describes beautifully and with a proper sense of wonder some of the history of John Birch. Yes, this is the same man for whom the society is named.

James Perloff systematically shows an in depth picture of how the Federal Reserve was formed and the evolution of politics directly effected by the Fed. This book is packed full of concrete facts that are easily verified. The only difficulty in digesting this incredible information is in not wanting to believe that these people would deceive us so badly and for so long. Propaganda/patriotism is a strong tool used to keep us in check.

It is positively Satanic, no more no less.Mr.Perloff: PLEASE get back to work and write the sequel. WE MUST get this book in our schools and save our kids and our country. Look at us today.

Strait's vocals are as good as ever and so is his band.He does smoke on Milk Cow Blues and the parts where he sings on All My Ex's but I could have done without Buffets parts on that song . I don't want to even start on what the 3 of them do on Hey Good Lookin. that rumbling is Hank Spinning in is grave.Alan was Alan on his songs and strong as always.

George Strait, Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffett are kindred spirits who have all worked together in the past and shine in the various combinations here.This is a perfect, laid back, summertime tailgating outing. Nothing too serious, much tongue in cheek as the three headliners comprise the perfect mutual admiration society. Everyone one stage is having fun, the audience is having a good time as you will in the comfort of your home or your truck.The stars came out to play and now all you need to complete the fun is some fried chicken, greasy burgers and beer and a pitcher of margaritas and count the days until summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MUSIC FOR A GREAT PRICE!","review":"You just can't go wrong with this one.

A range war is the result and evil powers see their chance to interfere for their own benefit. Elmore Leonard is a master storyteller.

Rather than carrying around a handful of the lower-capacity NB-2LH's, add a BL-2L14 or two to your inventory instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good battery.","review":"It's a good battery.

I am quite interested in this topic: the boundary between humans and machines, and especially developments in artificial intelligence as combined with robotics. This books does so much more than just explore that boundary, although it does that very well, too. It provides an insightful overview of the shift in artificial intelligence to \\"EMBODIED artificial intelligence.\\" In order to do this, it explains the importance of embodiment for \\"human intelligence\\" and also gives an \\"embodied\\" reading of the bible which is quite informative. Foerst's ideas about the ramifications of being the \\"story-telling\\" or \\"narrating\\" animal to our sense of self and how this allows us to incorporate significant others into our sense of sense is a powerful argument, deftly expressed. The book also raises interesting ethical questions about how we identify or fail to identify with others, not only machines. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial, trendy","review":"Easy reading with God in the title and a hook to science. I guess everyone is entitled to an opinion, and if one bothers to write a book, of course one would want it to sell well and get a buzz in the popular press. I confess that I suspect this is another example of an ambitious young person in the humanities needing a gimmick to get exposure. The many references to prestigious people and institutions at the beginning are a good tip-off to this sort of thing. Why spend time reading fluff, when there are so many good books out there?

This band writes the coolest, hookiest stuff I've heard in years. They have amazing voices and their harmonies blend very well. A few of the songs on the album are world-class like the album's opener \\"Driving South.\\" Other songs on the album like \\"Come Down Lovely\\" \\"Like Opium\\" and \\"After School Special/Coda\\" show the true depth of the bands songwriting. Unlike most CDs (where you struggle just to find more than one good song) this record has a lot for the listener to sink their teeth into. Also as an extra-special bonus: the production of this CD is really good. If you're into heartfelt guitar pop that rocks, you've come to the right place."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the love of 80's Music.","review":"If you are an 80's music enthusiast you will love this CDs.

I had previously spent about fourty dollars on a cheaper model put out by another company. The ice cream came out lumpy, and often was difficult or noisy to make.This model, however, was well worth the money. The ice cream was quick and easy to make. Easy enough, infact, that even kids can help out. This makes it a perfect summertime activity for those kids who seem to have tried everything. It's even easy to clean up one you finish. Best of all, it tastes delicious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap material made in China","review":"Have owned and used a White Mountain Ice cream maker built in 1975. It is terrific.

The iGo is flimsy, unstable, and - unlike Rain Design claims - not ergonomic at all. Too many plastic parts, nothing fit in smoothly, the keyboard tray slides out too easily. The plastic stand for the MacMini was a ghastly yellow color instead of clear. The legs were scratched and so was the base of the stand. It feels like a child's toy. The iMac monitor sits too close to the user - this is far from ergonomic. The keyboard tray is too low, even at its highest position. I would love to return it. I most likely will, even though Rain Design's return policy is just as horrendous as their product - 15% restocking fee and I have to pay for the return shipping.

I had already removed the stock exhaust from the cat back, so I will not include that in my installation time. It took me 40 minutes to install and tighten and test this exhaust. The pipes fit very nice and snug. I only had to jack up the rear a few inches to slide the pipe under the back and over my axle. The supplied hardware and instruction were excellent. I have no complaints about any facet of this item or of its seller, AutoPartsWay.As for the products performance, I am again very pleased. There is a definite increase in throttle response but just a noticeable increase in growl.

The menu is easy to navigate and the features are easy to access and don't leave you feeling like you wish you had a degree in astro-physics.My only complaint after owning this for about a month is the *very* low power of the FM Transmitter. I have friends with other brands of recievers that have no problem using them in situations where you must recieve the signal on your FM radio. If you are buying this unit for that application I would pause and do more comparisons with other units first.In summary, all in all this is a great little radio and I would buy it again if I had to do it all over.

Story is set in a future scenario that includes such fantastic technology as intergalactic space travel, chip based personality transference, etc and yet we're still shooting bullets? Main character is inconsistent and dull. Gratuitous sexual references are clumsy and do little to develop character or plot.

You could almost see Morgan pushing to get the cover blurbs he had in mind (\\"A new, stylish writer and the heir-apparent of Philip K. Dick and Neal Stephenson!!\\").If Morgan could turn down the faux over-the-top style and perhaps team up with another writer who could moderate his Bi-polar tendencies we could be looking at some good sci-fi here."},{"rating":"1","title":"standards are dropping","review":"I give this book one star and that only because it was late night reading before I was ready to nod off.This is pseudo cyberpunk meets the wild west. It should appeal to the gadget hungry Yugeo set, those who invent plots and tech where and when you get into a corner.Extropians and techies will love it because it has one of every possible idea once we find that we can download the human mind into a chip which is not much more than the portable media we carry on a watch chain today.Oh, yes, move over Bester, we can travel mentally into stored replacas or any other body where the chip has been removed.How does the author extend this story to over 500 pages? He watches the cartoon series shown on afternoon TV.Give Rambo access to James Bond's store of gadgets. Wind him up and turn him loose on some pseudo renegade mission, inventing subplots to keep Rambo on his carnage campaign and you have the story. Don't bother worrying about any substance; just revel in the carnage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written - will buy more from this author","review":"Author put together good writing and concepts that fit well within a detective styled book, then combines it with a nice bit of scifi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"\\"Altered Carbon\\" is the story of Takeshi Kovacs, whose mind has been downloaded to Earth and placed in a stranger's body so that he can fulfill the job of figuring out why an uber-rich, centuries old man who knew he couldn't die would kill one of his own bodies. What promises from the reviews to be a complex and intriguing story turns out to be 500+ pages of superficial scenarios that are poorly stringed together. I only bothered to finish the book because I assumed events would come together for a grand finale, but the ending was just as blasé as the rest. The scenes, with their gratuitous weaponry and violence and cartoonish characters, generally read like a graphic novel (no offense to the good graphic novels out there) and the writing is so shallow that I just couldn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing loudness","review":"I very much wanted to like this book, but found it a disappointment. The central character is as cliche as they come - mysterious military/assassin past, tougher than everyone else, etc. The central mystery was intriguing, but the book was all action, all the time, with little character development. It was like reading a book ALL IN CAPITAL LETTERS, ALL THE TIME. The main guy goes from battle to battle, each one trying to be more outrageous than the next. Beheading! Rape! Set on Fire! Vivisection! etc. Finishing it was a struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"like Asimov on steroids","review":"As a kid, I abolutely loved theRobot Trilogy: The Caves of Steel, The Naked Sun, The Robots of Dawn, but I always wanted the story to move along faster.

This is especially true of authors like Richard K. Morgan, who bring a lot of new ideas out in their work. The tech in this book is great and points to some interesting possibilities for future books based on the same world view. State of the art gene tailored tech ninjas, back alley body mods, AI controlled hotels with overactive self defense systems, telepathic advertising, virtual snuff. This was a fun read.The fact that Mr. Morgan only has one release is going to give me a nervous breakdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brief comment","review":"As A. Ross's excellent spotlight review noted, this is a blend of science fiction and the crime novel. I think it's the best example of that I've read, in fact, since Alfred Bester's novel, The Demolished Man, won the Hugo Award in the mid-50s, or perhaps the great short story, \\"Fondly Fahrenheit,\\" also by Bester, whose fiction was ahead of its time. The writing is top-notch and the story is a real page burner. Overall one of the best science fiction novels of recent years, and well worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Sci-Fi Cyber Novel","review":"Richard Morgan's Altered Carbon is an excellent, intriguing novel that straddles multiple genres, and straddles them well. It's science fiction in that it takes place in the distant future when individual consciousness can be downloaded into a new body (or sleeve) should the need ever arise. There is plenty of space travel as the protagonist and narrator, Takeshi Kovacs travels from his world to what we know as earth. Altered Carbon is also a crime novel, as Kovacs has been hired to find the \\"murderer\\" of a centuries old wealthy man, who's consciousness was simply downloaded into a newly cloned sleeve. The story is well-written, compelling reading. Very enjoyable and imaginative."},{"rating":"2","title":"great 1st outing.","review":"I went into thus read skeptical after a friend ranted and raved over it all night at a party. He's got questionable taste.He at last got his hooks in when he emphasized how truly the book fit in the noir category as easily as it did sci-fi.Takes some time to get the slang down since it's presented immediately and without context in many cases. But that just builds the atmosphere after one figures it out.Excellent read. I'll be getting the others in this series as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Phillip Marlow of the Future","review":"The film noir of Cyber-punk!! I could hardly put this book down. The ideas in this book about cloning, digital consciousness, body modification, and immortality made for fresh and exciting read.And even if there was no \\"sci-fi\\" part of the book, the \\"mystery\\" of this book, I feel, held its own in the mystery genre. The plot moved smooth and steady with no \\"slow\\" spots. I think being written in first-person made the mystery more entertaining than if it would have been in third-person.Richard Morgan did a great job of not giving too much away but keeping the reader interested with great ending. For those of you out there in cyberspace that love sci-fi and love a good mystery, this is a must read!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Succeeded in some areas, failed miserably in others.","review":"Morgan's novice novel has a lot of excellent ideas with the rockets from the seediest hellholes on Earth, through virtual reality torture, into several gory firefights, and on to some exotic sexual escapades, however, the writing doesn't have the maturity that you expect for this kind of money. Morgan succeeded with some of the essentials attempted, but others were full of potholes. It did become rather dull with some of the details, and needs to be more dedicated to the development of the overall story, then it would be an excellent work, but unfortunately, it doesn't have the maturity it should have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Who edited this garbage mascerading as a book? \\"Altered Carbon\\" has to be the worst book I've ever read.

It's since moved to second, but considering I read it 6 months ago, that's pretty good.Taut action scenes in a nicely fleshed-out future world make for a great read. At the same time, the well considered implications of technology that offer drastic changes to the way we view the mind and the self make for a much more thought-provoking and interesting read than your traditional hard-boiled detective novel.The day I finished the paperback edition of this, I was online searching for the sequel. Too bad the UK gets it first! But a March release in the US promises to make an excellent birthday gift to myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Edgy Sci-Fi","review":"This was a great story, no doubt about it. It's the 25th Century, and amongst all the technology that now exists, the most radical is that which allows people to store their personas digitally on surgically implanted cortical stacks, and move to another body should death occur. Thus, it's very difficult to die a final death, and the ability to transmit one's persona between solar systems at the speed of light and arrive to be loaded (\\"resleeved\\") into a cloned body has revolutionized interstellar travel.The backdrop is astonishing, and amidst the adventures of mercenary Takeshi Kovacs, we explore every implication of the new technology: Do people ever die? Can a human persona inhabit a computer? Can you make copies of yourself? Can computer viruses infect your cortical stack? What implications does near-immortality have on religion?Very good book. I'll recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Sci-Fi I've seen in years","review":"Get this book! I don't review well. I never know how much of the story to give away to make my point, but I'll try. In the future, people have the ability to download their consciousness into other bodies. Our hero, Kovacs, is downloaded into a body on Earth to solve a murder. What makes this novel so great is the way Kovacs moves through a world that is completely recognisable, though it takes place in the future. Richard Morgan gives us a future that isn't all bright lights and polished chrome; but rather a future where the dark and seamier sides of life have advanced technologically along with everything else. This is an incredible read, whether you're into sci-fi or detective novels, and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Brilliant stuff. He had me hooked and mesmerised from the first line, basically. Happy to read anything he writes, currently. I can still vividly recall the first scene from the book. An ex-mercenary with special 'psychological chameleon' type abilities to blend in locally, is now hired to find out why an incredibly wealthy functionally immortal man was killed. People have the ability to load their personalities into other bodies, or new bodies, and this is how people travel from planet to planet, at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyberpunk meets Crime, Well-Written","review":"Richard K Morgan pays homage to all who came before him in this exciting pulp-crime drama set in the far future. Even Takeshi Kovacs himself, the protagonist and hero of the story, is an homage to an anti-authority rebel from The Day of the Jackal.The science fiction in this story is innovative and the idea of a classed society based on both wealth and longevity works well.The prose is crisp, strong, with no wasted words, and even if the characters seem too gritty, too stereotyped, too noir, it worked for me because I love those stories, and based on the reviews so do many other people.Come on, this was a fun read, a great story, and fantastic writing. Richard Morgan is a powerhouse of a writer and will be in the genre for many years, and many novels to come - you may as well join in on the fun ride instead of being a standoffish snob.CV Rick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa!

A definite must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious soporific","review":"For me the most distinctive feature of this novel is not the gory storytelling referred to by many reviewers, but the relentless detailed description of every scene, every meal, every person and every piece of clothing. These descriptions seem to serve very little purpose and do not advance the plotline at all. I agree with many of the reviewers that the characters lack motivation for many of their actions moving from one pointless action to another, although this does not seem to bother many fans of violent fiction.I rarely fail to finish a book but gave up on this after 44% despite a concerted effort to finish a book that was strongly recommended by so many reviewers! Don't waste your money, especially at this price!Finally I would like to comment on the fact that the earliest reviewers of this book seem to have supplied negative reviews, check the first twenty or so reviews and compare with the later reviews. Odd how it improved as more people read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull cop story dressed up with maybe 2 new ideas","review":"It is worth prefacing my remarks on this book with this: I am a huge fan of cyberpunk style science fiction. I wrote my MA thesis on Bruce Sterling's and Neal Stephenson's work.Unfortunately, this is really a cop story - not science fiction. The author seems to need to work in cops that are unchanged since 1970's TV, and are always \\"one step over the line.\\" There's an especially dreary passage where there is a discussion of this line stepping over phenomenon. BORING! I got the impression of the author as someone who read _Neuromancer_ and then said, \\"I'm going to write my own book. Only it will be different because I'll tell it in the first person...Oh and the people can have different bodies...And I'll play up the cop story. You can't have enough cop stories.\\"I don't like cop stories. Dull, dull, dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but Philip Dick he isn't","review":"Slow. Ponderous pacing. One dimensional characters. And one intriguing idea (resleeving). Too bad most of the atmosphere is a redo from PD (as are some of the character ideas). Easily twice as long as needed to play out the plot. I was disappointed in the whole mesh-mash given the level of adoration this book garners. I hope the forthcoming movie does more with the book that the author did.BTW - I got about 300 pages through and couldn't finish it. Real glad I got it from the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad Sci FI","review":"What ever happened to good old fashion SciFi? After reading the reviews I wanted to like this book. I wanted to read a cool novel with new futuristic ideas. This wasn't it. After about 100 pages I couldn't even read it anymore. The writing was poor and disjointed and the story is totally uninteresting. I would never guess that someone could make sci fi this boring and take any kind of wonder out of it. After the main character has sex which is described in graphic details like a 13 year old writing to Penthouse, I pretty much gave up. If you are looking for a better written, more interesting novel on having disposable bodies then read the Kiln People by David Brin instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for those in an escapist mood on a long winter's weekend","review":"\\"Altered Carbon: A Takeshi Kovacs Novel,\\" the first novel by Richard K. Morgan, makes a great read for those in an escapist mood on a long winter's weekend. I won't bother recounting the premise except to say that Morgan has created a fictional concept of immortality and consciousness that allows him great latitude to play around with.Following the ever weaving plot takes some doing at times, but by the time you finish, half a dozen or more images will be seared into your mind, which may or may not be a good thing. His overarching theme----what is it to be human?----remains front and center throughout.Morgan's writing has a crisp, no-nonsense leanness which is refreshing in a genre that often yields to ponderous overwriting that causes stories to collapse under their own weight. As a whole, his melding of elements from hard-boiled detective stories and sci-fi works better than one might expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't care less","review":"This book was loaned to me as the best sci fi book this person ever read so my expectations were very high. I will return this book without finishing it. Honestly I couldn't care less about what happens in this book. None of the characters is remotely likeable or interesting. The main character is a cold killer. His employer is a guy who has lived so long he has turned terminally boring. His wife is the token \\"hottie\\" added in the mix as excuse for the usual run of the mill sex scenes. Add the usual mix of bad guys and you see how I didn't care if any of them lived or died. Then the plot: solve a homicide which isn't really a homicide because people can just hop from one body to the next, so the victim is actually alive and well. Mix in some cheap violence and sex and out comes this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but sequels are better","review":"I recently picked up all 3 books in the trilogy and listened to them back to back. I found the first one enjoyable, but a little jumbled. Some of the detective work done by Kovac made no sense and several obvious routes of investigation were left unexplored. Often I felt like the Kovac just stumbled onto answers.As set up to the universe and character this book is fantastic. I enjoyed the depth to which the author explored all the various impacts re-sleaving would have upon a civilization. The book was good enough to make me want to listen to both sequels, which I think are more enjoyable books.I recommend getting all 3 books. It's almost necessary to fully understand Kovac's character.Hope to see a fourth book someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seizes you by the Buckyballs","review":"which for those of you who know my work, an other one of my hilarious puns actually featuring altered carbon. Magic.Anyway, it does exactly that, this is an ultra-violent future cop-noir type offering, well written and realised, and with a series of nice plot twists and set pieces. I can actually picture the characters in my head, sadly what ruins it for me is that I picture Kovacs (the \\"hero\\") as bloody Jason Statham which cannot be a good thing for anyone. Pound to a penny he get the role if they film this one! The plot rattles along at a pleasing pace and the body count is impressive. There is a pleasing amount of backstory and the Envoy Corps surely must be ripe for a spin-off franchise, although the idea is ripped off David Gerrold at least (and I'm sure off many others!). Still, this is an above average crime thriller with plenty to commend it!Oh, and the guy is called Kovacs and he doesnt even have a lollipop, bloody let down that is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Find","review":"I like to discovery new authors and Richard Morgan is a great find. This is a genre I don't read to often but Altered Carbon crosses over so many genres. The mystery and suspense is as heart catching and page turning as any classic mystery or thiller. This science stuff is easy to get into and never goes over your head. The main character is a classic as any anti-hero private eye. By the end, you're rooting for this guy. Great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too violent and sadistic","review":"As another reviewer said, this author is no Gibson (or Heinlein). The graphic sex was over-the-top, but bearable. The violence and torture were unnecessary and distracted the reader from what is a clearly interesting and unique central idea for a sci-fi book. But what the heck is an Envoy? A soldier, a criminal, a freebooter? It's never explained clearly in the first third of the book (as much as I read before being too disgusted with the violence to continue). If you want great SF, read Neuromancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought to myself, hey pretty colors.","review":"Not only will you get seizures from looking at the cover you will get them from waiting diligently for this story to pick up. I am not going to explain the book because chances are you have already read a summary. If you want to read the book where it should have started (And I don't recommend it) open to page 250. You won't have missed a thing. The only reason I gave it a 2 was because I enjoyed the run of the mill sarcasm. So if you like a strung out story and mediocre sarcasm read on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"Outstanding first novel. Richard K. Morgan has just made a fan for life with this book, I hope we will see a series featuring this character.Filled with everything I love in a book, sex, violence, a little mystery and a little romance, and a [tough] character that takes no [guff].In a future where people are able to \\"download\\" themselves into different bodies (what they call sleeves), Tak Kovacs is a breed a part from the rest. Being a former Envoy in which his mind is conditioned to exert itself and any \\"sleeve\\" he wears.Great idea, however I have seen this played out before in a couple low rate movies. Namely \\"The Sixth Day\\", in which you wonder if humans are only made up of the product of there memories. I would like to have seen Morgan dig a little deeper into that realm.However you will enjoy this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Dirty SF/Noir-esque Post-Modern Fun ...","review":"but not a work of genius. I enjoyed it a lot though, if only because I liked saying \\"TAK-shi Ko-vach\\" to myself everytime the hero comlained about someone mispronouncing his name.I also enjoyed the steampunk frisson that I always get from reading a novel set in the future US in which everyone employs 21st century British locutions.Like I said, lots of fun, although those inclined to nitpick probably won't enjoy quite it as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"yay","review":"It was strange, although I liked a lot of the ideas, and the details. They are fairly realistic. I think that Morgan, the author, has had a few psychology classes, it's a very human book. A lot of futuristic books you can't relate to or anything like that, but in this one, the people make sense. It also has a great mystery-type plot, which is very tricky, and I can see how it might be confusing. In the end it makes sense for the most part, and most everything is solved and done. I enjoyed reading it, and might read it again someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"High concept, beautiful writing","review":"Wow. I wasn't expecting it to be this good. Morgan had better keep writing! His character is durable; good for a series. The images are powerful and striking and the ideas are thought-provoking, which is what we want out of sci-fi. The concept of re-sleeving into body after body is deep; who are we, really? I'd say one flaw is too much preoccupation with torture (I skipped those parts), though it is consistent with the idea that [ending life] has become illegal. Lots of depth to other concepts: what do we become when we are rich enough to live for centuries? How would that distort our thought-processes? This novel was a page-turner. I want him to write more so I can turn some more pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious CyberPunk","review":"I have read a lot of science fiction in the last 40 years, and I have a passion for CyberPunk so finding a good book is a joy. Finding a new author is like finding treasure. Morally ambiguous characters, odd technology, post-information society, social despotism, and large caliber handguns! The internal narrative voice-over adds nicely to the neon-splashed visions. The tone and tenor of the writing blends styles across many hundreds of years from Gulliver's Travels to dectetive noir. Many lines can be read as 'homage' rather than text and that adds to the post-information blended quality of the world that is the backdrop. The story line is neither straightforward nor linear, but always moves along the tracks toward some not-so-clear conclusion.This is a fully-formed world at all scales, from interplanetary politics to virtual porn. Read a book, be a book. This book is a nice place to be and should be considered a CyberPunk standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sunglasses","review":"These are not sunglasses.

Not only is the music so loud that you can hardly hear the man talking, but the workout is entirely too easy for any regular excerciser.

Advertisements in fashion magazines are annoying, but supplements can be unhealthy and dangerous. These ads may have something to do with the target audience of the magazine... It seems to be directed to women who are hard core about weightlifting and fitness, to the level of competition. A recent article in the magazine was talking about what percentage of body fat was too low for women. Some of the women had body fat below 10% - I'm trying to get mine below 30%. It's just a different fitness/weightloss league completely.I like magazines like Fitness and Shape better because it sets more reasonable goals and provides more reasonable advice. I can substitute toast with jam for bagels with cream cheese. I can't drink protein shakes for breakfast and lunch, eat 10 servings of protein a day, and pop potentially dangerous pills.

For someone to admit that they enjoyed the magazine and then to be turned off by one article about low-carb diets is wrong. Buy the magazine, read it, and establish an overall opinion. Sure it has too many advertisements, but it is an income generator so just turn the page. :) Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I read some comments about oxygen and get mad at the people who write them. Oxygen is a great magazine for women who just want to be fit. Whether that is toning up or is interested in doing a fitness competion.

Oxygen states multiple times through out that women can work out at the highest level for days and days and days, you WILL NOT get big like men. Women naturally cannot get BIG.

You can't accurately write a book about a bunch of 18 year old Marines or any Marines with no profanity. You may not like it but to censor it is not writing true history. I respect that he may not have used profanity himself and was deeply religious but you can't describe a true event of a Marine getting wounded or seeing a buddy killed and him not letting lose with a number of nasty words.

I was with 1st Marines but we often had 5th Marine units operating under our command so I have a pretty good idea of what they were doing. As Clark writes in his book, it was a very busy time in the war and the 5th Marines were in a lot of the fights in I corps. Clark does a good job telling about the fighting at the small unit level with just a bit of fudging. (looking up to see artillery shells just overhead? I don't think so.)This edition added an epilogue to the 2002 edition that renames many of the Marines mentioned in the earlier book and states that some of those earlier characters were actually two individuals.

It's very engaging and well written. The scope of the book is a tad narrow, and the references beyond the immediate experience of the author are limited. For example, the substance of occasional discussion of the politics of the war are narrow and shallow, but personal. The book doesn't pretend to be a treatise on the US involvement in Viet Nam. The references to the author's religious life are welcomed even to a reader, such as myself, who doesn't share the author's perspective. His inclusion in the narrative of his religious challenges and success add to the journey. Good solid Viet Nam story telling without anything out of place.I enjoyed every moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"I haven't read a book for pleasure reading in about 10 years, but I am joining the military myself and I thought I might try picking up a war book to read over the summer. So much for the book lasting the summer, I read it in three days. The accounts of war from the narrator are incredible and you feel like you are there fighting in the jungles and on the hills of Vietnam.

The second time I used it, the motor made an awful sound, like the bearings must be completely gone. I called them and they promptly sent me a new one. The third time I used it the pressure latch on the bucket came off in my hand. My daughter purchased one not too long before I did and when she used hers for the third time, the motor made the same loud noise. Unfortunately when she called them hers was more than 1 yr old and they would not warranty it. They wanted $90.00 to replace the motor!

The ice cream was excellent! Motors are very loud and definitely should be used outside, which we did. A week later, we used them again, and one of the motors made a terrible noise as if parts were loose inside--so bad that we didn't think it wise to use it. The other one sounded OK (although loud, as I already stated). I contacted \\"returns,\\" followed their simple instructions, and received a new ice cream maker expeditiously with no charge to me, not even shipping.

On disassembly I found that roller bearings are not used in the motor, instead an oil soaked felt type bearing that failed. The parts book said you could order the motor alone,but when I attempted this I was told you had to order the complete motorizing unit for a cost of $90 plus shipping.

I see now the manufacturer is selling a different color motor unit that is advertised as \\"commercial grade heavy duty\\". Until I see White Mountain offer a pathway for former buyers to replace their broken motors at a reasonable price (not $100 plus), I will not volunteer to be their guinea pig again. 7 failed motor units in 2 years is not just a trend, it's a warning to all.....you buy one, you'll be sorry.

Their subscription model doesn't seem worth it, but the free play isn't bad. Definitely wait and see on this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid! Read on...","review":"It's really only a complete game if you pay for full content and online play. And that's the good news. The bad news is that Hellgate's online play is administered by the incompetent Ping-0, a division of Flagship Studios of San Francisco.So, don't pay $40ish for the game, plus another $10/month *every* month (or, more likely, 52 bucks for each 6 month block) just to learn what I'm willing to tell you for free: No game is good enough to justify high fees paid for poor service and incompetence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Combination","review":"I just bought this game over the weekend and I downloaded all the patches and updates and it runs perfectly fine for me. I'm not sure what all the reviews about the flaws were, with the game crashing and such. Maybe there was a recent patch that fixed most of the problems. The graphics are good. Alot of the creatures are very similar as mentioned. It is very much like a combination of diablo and oblivion with FREE online play. Even online you don't have to team with a bunch of nerdys. You can still play solo at your own pace. It has all the rare, semi rare, legendary, common etc etc drops from creatures and rare monsters. Enjoy the game. I've put about 10 hours into it and online is fun except for the spammers trying to make money off of selling game items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not finished.","review":"This game isn't done - it was clearly pushed out the door before it was ready. I had really high hopes for this one, it's got a heck of a pedigree but the developers don't seem to have taken into account how games have evolved since Diablo. It's got a lot of potential but it's at early beta stage - no where near release ready. The mutliplayer elements in particular need a whole lot of work.On the up side the subscription is optional, so pick it up when it's $30 or less, or 6 months from now, whichever comes first - might be worth it by then."},{"rating":"1","title":"May go out of business!","review":"The future of this game is doubtful. You may not be able to play it!From the Hellgate forums on 7/19/2008:\\"It is with deep regret that I must announce that Flagship Studios has laid off most employees. However, the core management and founding team members are still at Flagship.\\" said Bill Roper, CEO of Flagship Studios. \\"The past five years have been an incredible experience for us, but unfortunately, we couldn't sustain the size of the company any longer.\\"...\\"Due to the current situation, Flagship will not be taking any new subscribers for Hellgate: London, and all current subscriptions will not be billed.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell isn't very exciting.","review":"I played the game completely through, and in the end, decided online play was worth a shot. Being an Engineer had many perks, many interesting flying drones to do half the work for me as I mercilessly slew thousands of demons, reminiscent of the good old Diablo 2 days.Something told me I would get more out of the game by logging in to the online server. But for some odd reason, the Hellgate London website would not run from any of my consoles.Hellgate London has no customer support or online play. That is, unless you're a citizen of South Korea. So, if you love Hellgate London any more than I do, move to South Korea and apply for a citizenship.Do not buy this game. Sellers won't dare mention to game has no online support, all for good reason. They want money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell Is Disappointment","review":"I have been playing PC games for over 20 years now, and this is quite honestly one of the most disappointing videogames I have ever played. On it's own merits, Hellgate would just be completely mediocre and dreadfully dull, but due to it's infamous production history, developer troubles, and distinguished pedigree, the game manages to underwhelm at every possible facet of play.Now, thanks to a public IP struggle, and the recent layoffs of all the developers at Flagship Studios, even that pitifully substandard gaming experience is in jeopardy. Give this game a wide berth and just stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. Every map looks the same.","review":"I never played Diablo much but I know this: Every sewer in this game looks the same. Every building in this game looks the same. Every city area in this game looks the same. That's it. 3 maps, basically. And monster variety? PLEASE. I could count 5 monster-types you'll see 80% of the time. And, this is a huge huge turnoff for this game, there is NO RESPEC. Read. Investigate. Study. Spend hours and hours reading because when you put a skill point somewhere, you ain't never gettin' it back. No way. No how.

And haven't touched it in maybe 7 months. Given that take this review with a grain of salt.The game out of the package can only be described by one phrase. Not complete. I have heard there have been large patches and updates. I don't want to go too much into the details of the game upon release because it was so long ago, I just want to say. Try before you buy. Find a friend that has it and try it out, it has the potential for a great game but when i played it out of the box, it just was not there yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Disappointment","review":"Nowhere did I see that this game could only be played online.

To rate Hellgate London I can't really give it any stars although the rating was manditory to post a review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try the Demo first","review":"If you want a lot of headaches then buy this game outright. If you want to be smart about it download and try the demo first. Different people like different things, so you may love this game or hate it, gameplay-wise. What is not in dispute though is that the game is definitely buggy. That point has come through in review after review, so do you're self a favor and install and play the demo first. I expect we'll see a patch and a re-release of the demo in the near future, due to these issues. But testing your system out with the free demo will give you the \\"heads-up\\" as to whether or not the game will be stable enough with your drivers/system specifications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of bugs. Huge disappointment.","review":"This is the buggiest piece of software I've ever dealt with. When it runs, the game is some fun, and the graphics are OK--not bad, but certainly nothing special, even with DX10 and all graphics options maxed. In terms of concept and gameplay, it is precisely Diablo 3. But it is virtually unplayable due to all the bugs. It crashes to desktop, randomly locks up, and many quests are bugged, making them impossible to complete. Before buying this, have a look at the official game support forums for an idea of the problems people are having."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very reminiscent of games from seven years ago","review":"I will confess that I did not play the full game, but instead played only about forty minutes of the free demo. I found it to be a little \\"primitive\\" actually, and some of the graphics looked every bit of nine years old. The gameplay had some silly contrivances, like putting a \\"headstone\\" down where you \\"die\\" each time. A much better game where you're gang-rushed by enemies and have to use all your twitch-gamer reflexes is the first Painkiller.With so many other spectacular new games coming out now, like Call of Duty 4 and Crysis, I just can't see spending money or time on a game like Hellgate: London. Truly, it's not to be seriously considered to be in the same league with the others in any way I can think of."},{"rating":"1","title":"The price is under five bucks!!","review":"...However, seeing that the company's death had a LOT to do with the price-drop (Currently @ $3.88) I'll still hold off until this baby's @ least $2.50-3.00 before a purchase..And I have prime membership to boot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you played Oblivion, this will seem like a 2002 game","review":"Circa 2002 graphics and character models that look nothing like the quality in the cut-scene movies (think Unreal2); you can only configure a few of the controls; no voice acting on most dialog (you read and flip pages); boring linear levels that are not even atmospheric or spooky in 3rd person; lame AI. I guess if you like fiddling with complicated character attributes and inventory this might be for you. This will be in the clearance $19.99 bin in about 2 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money!! Play the demo first!","review":"I was excited about this game until I played the demo. The graphics are good but overall game play is boring. Those of you that love Diablo 2 you will find this game lacking the intensity. Overall don't waste your money, or try looking at Call of Duty 4 demo or TimeShift Demo. Those games are better FPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was entertaining, but buggy as hell...","review":"Grabbed 2 copies for my wife and I on release day a year ago. We tried playing for about a month. The party functions were just horrible, most of the time we would both jump into the same zone only to not be able to see eachother. Atleast 2-3 bugs found a night with casual play.It might have been entertaining as a single player, but not for the $50 I paid for it.Now that they are shutting down the servers (which is true, I got the announcement from them), it's more of a fancy coaster if anything. You won't be able to download the patches and the single player game will be horrible without them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"Well the online server is going down next year and the idiots never offered Lan support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Just to give potential buyer's a head's up, Flagship Studios gave pink slips to its entire development team and this game is now in a state of flux. The servers are still up as of 16 Jul 08, but continuing content updates are now unknown. Might want to save your money until this situation resolves itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was great once upon a time","review":"This game had a shaky start but was one of the most fun games I've ever played on-line. The single player game however left much to be desired and was barely worked on. This presents a large problem to the current game considering all American and European servers are now off-line leaving you with just about nothing to play. Only buy this game if you wish to play a shaky single player game with absolutely no support at all due to Flagship Studios mishandling their company budget and going bankrupt. That had nothing at all to do with the player base, the game was very popular quite often having around 50,000 people on-line at a time but evidently they pocketed the money and did nothing else with it and pulled the plug on the game way before they ever added much content to the game. I'd still play the game today if they had not have simply pulled the plug on the game killing all their subscribers off in one blow."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK","review":"The online servers for this game have been shut down.

It's more an interesting take on military life before the war. Although Burt Lancaster headlines (and has the most famous beach scene kiss with Deborah Kerr), this is just as much a Montgomery Cliff movie. Sinatra is also very good in his award winning performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"An everlasting classic!","review":"Thanks to that legendary classic whose possesses merits are widely known: The superb acting level by the whole cast (with special mention on Montgomery Clift and Frank Sinatra), the torrid romance with the bitter visual metaphor of the beach, the splendid photograph, the towering artistic Direction, the admirably coupled script, the astonishing Direction, the impeccable edition and the magnificent realism, worked out as formidable link respect other bitterest films (think about Anatomy of a murder, for instance) which exceeded the well known conventional barriers.One of the most smoldering dramas ever filmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic","review":"With an all-star cast led by Burt Lancaster, Donna Reed, Frank Sinatra, Deborah Kerr and Montgomery Clift as the rebelious protagonist, this film is a true WW II romance/drama classic. Set in Hawaii just before Pearl Harbor, it tells two stories of love, friendship and honor. The famous scene with Lancaster and Kerr in the Hawaiian surf is just one of many memorable moments in this film. And it is by no means a \\"chick-flick;\\" there is action and some tense moments.

Talk about over acting; Sinatra has no subtlety at all. Now Lancaster is terrific, a soldier's soldier and Deborah Kerr slips into the part of a lonely wife of a louse effortlessly. The script of the James Jones book is a mess. The Lancaster-Kerr romance works almost, but the Cliff-Donna Reed love story is hurried and unbelievable. She's a dance hostess my a**.

I refuse to purchase any film on DVD that is not provided in Widescreen format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This is the most overrated Academy Award winner for Best Picture I've ever seen. It's a soap opera! Ooh, the bad wife, the good hooker -- talk about setting women back a thousand years. And Prewitt was a poor excuse for a main character -- waaah, I don't wanna box anymore. Suck it up, soldier! The boxing had nothing to do with anything, it was only in the story to please the macho men in the audience. Sinatra was unconvincing. Borgnine was one-note. The big romantic kiss on the beach was laughable. There was only one good moment in the whole movie -- when Borgnine pulls a knife and Lancaster breaks a bottle. A war movie without a freakin' war at least needs a little action -- and then even then, nothing happened! Totally disgusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Test of time...","review":"The trouble here is the test of time.... Of course this movie is great, otherwise it would not have won 8 Oscars.But to watch it nowadays is.... strange. The acting is not up to today's standards. Chaplin's movies got older much better than FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, for example.I watched it again yesterday and I liked it, but I came nowhere close to such excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch this movie until you read the book!","review":"This movie does a complete injustice to the book and even maligns it. The book is indescribable and must be read. However, the movie throws it completely out of whack. The characters of the novel should not have been played by big name Hollywood actors of the era. It's not their fault, but they just don't fit the characters right. Also, the movie comes of as a typical old romance movie. All though there are important elements of romance in the book, there are more important messages about humanity. It took me two days to watch the movie because I couldn't watch it without getting entirely frustrated. Read the book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST!!!!!!!!!","review":"I read the novel first wondering how they could make the transition from paper to film but they did it,and did it beautifully. The cast was superb, especially Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, the chemistry they had on camera is tough to find these days. the movie did tone down a little but not enough to noticably change the story,and the last scene of the movie is one of the most tragic heart wrenching moments in film history you'd have to have a heart of stone not to feel something at that moment. This film just goes to show you that hollywood of today cannot compete with the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really brought back memories as I saw it many years ago and only have basic cable","review":"Since I am now in my late seventies and only have basic cable I remember seeing it in my youth and now I can view it whenever I want."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Here to Eternity","review":"Others will give a better low down on the story, cast, quality, etc...but outside of the drama and romance, this comes very close to garrison life in the US (brown shoe) Army during peace time.

This movie would lose some effect if it were in color."},{"rating":"2","title":"About as close to perfect as movies get","review":"This is a fantastic film! As a current active-duty servicemember, I find that many of my civilian friends (through no fault of their own) do not understand the sacrifices and struggles that define soldiers' lives during both war and peace. I can think of no better primer to these issues than this movie (although the book also does an excellent job, it takes a while to read). On every level, this is a great film; even if you know little about the Army, this is an excellent drama with first-rate characters and directing. Furthermore, it provides a reasonably critical perspective on the Army that illustrates both the virtues and the vices of servicemembers. Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me why I joined the Army.P.S.

There is no apparent purpose for the servant other than to stand around, but it bugs me and 2) the \\"bad guy\\" is the mayor's wife. It doesn't really make sense why she hates the dinosaur or why the police go along with her wishes and make him leave.

It reads like McCabe simply got stinking drunk one night, fell asleep, and wrote this book after waking in the middle of the night.

It was not \\"An American Psycho\\" which of course depicted an amusing protagonist with 'an axe to grind'a cultural icon necessary for the books purpose.

From what I've read (which is a lot), this is one of the best anti-oxidants and anti-glycating nutrients available. Glycation is the reaction where sugar molecules (from carbs) bind to proteins in the body. This alters the proteins, creates free-radical damage to cells, destabilizes hormone receptor sites, and lots of other nasty things. L-Carnosine will help prevent the very process of glycation AND neutralize free-radicals, so you get a lot of benefit from this.The only reason I won't give this 5 stars is because I have found slightly better deals out there, and it is a bit expensive.

I think it is and there is of course no tingle associated with it. I am using it in combination with creatine. I feel creatine gives me 1-2 reps per set while the beta alaninie/L carnosine helps fight fatigue and allows me to run or lift a bit longer from an overall time perspective.

A non-fiction account of their experiences, it is a refreshing and terrifying tale of the Marine platoon's daily life and death in the early years of America's combat troops' involvement in the Viet Nam conflict.

Shermer seems to have a major problem with God and people who believe in God, which obscures the points he tries to make. It was well-written and a good read on a trip, but didn't really answer the question posed by the title. Overall somewhat unsatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up and THINK","review":"An interesting, fun read. It's hard to imagine how you could believe such, well, weird things. It also shows people not to confuse skepticism with cynicism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but gets redundant","review":"This book is a great read for skeptics and non-skeptics alike. Toward the end of the book, I started to feel like some of the points had already been hammered home, but the examples were always different and interesting. As a side note, if you ever get a chance to see Shermer in person you should definitely do it-- he is a great speaker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"debunkers are losers!","review":"debunkers are loserswhats the difference between debunkers and Christian fundamentalist..there isn't one there!there both cults!there is an esoteric side to life that the scientist don't know much about..I have had experience with ESP,OBE and helped make 2 documentary's on UFO phenomena.The reason people believe in strange things is because TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION!I have no time for sceptic debunkersOBTW it's possible to get 3 pairs dice correct in a row!

Shermer seems to make a lot of the same flawed arguments against the \\"weirdos\\" that he criticizes them for using.There's interesting stuff in here, but it isn't stitched together in any kind of coherent way, and there are no great insights to be had. Save your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why people believe in weird things","review":"A drawn out jumble of words needing the dictionary taking too long to get to a point. Not recommended for the casual read or reading for relaxation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Skeptic, Good Debunker","review":"The overall grade for this book is good, I recommend it, but it could definitely be much better. Shermer is one super skeptic fellow, and one that respects most of the people whose claims he tries to debunk. Through the book he can't deny his psychology background, since he continually makes reference to different psychological concepts (and their application to scientists like Tippler, or to holocaust deniers), this is not bad, but the truth is I wasn't expecting a pseudo-psychoanalisis on his opponents. The book is really entertaining, and has a lot of interesting anecdotes and experiences as well as good bibliographic investigation to support every case. Once again, the book is entertaining and enlightening at times, I surely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cleverly Crafted Analysis","review":"Dr. Shermer looks into the reasons why people persist in believing things even when those things are bizarre or even blatantly proven false. He examines the physiological issues at a level that the layman can understand.I highly recommend this book for people who find themselves constantly frustrated by acquaintances who insist on telling them the newest conspiracy theory, forwarded glurge, or other easily debunked story, and who seem to never read the debunkings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I needed this book for a crtical thinking psychology class and it's pretty interesting. Definitely keeps you thinking.

I skimmed through it and read the parts on Ayn Rand, Creationism vs. Evolution and the Conclusion. From what I could glean, this book does little to explain why people believe weird things. It talks a lot about weird things that people do believe, but that makes the title very misleading. Who are these people that believe weird things? Does a small group of people believe a lot of weird things? The author never delves into these questions. When reading the sections on Creationism and Holocaust Denighers, I had to put the book down as I could not bear to waste my time on the people in question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shermer incorrect about creationism","review":"I have perused this book in the bookstore, though not actually bought it and read it; so that's my upfront disclaimer.I like some of the things Shermer says, the way he categorizes common errors in critical thinking. What he doesn't seem to realize is that his arguments regarding creationism commit these same errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Highly recommended for its logical, scholarly and well-grounded analysis of the human psyche's predilection for belief over rational thought. Shermer's explanation of the purpose of science, and what it is that scientists do, should be required reading for everyone. Purchasers of the 1997 paperback reprint of this book should be aware that there is some text missing at the bottom of pages 218 and 222, which makes Shermer's discussion there difficult to follow. Hopefully this will be corrected in a later edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book.","review":"I have read widely in mass hysteria, hypnosis, persuasionand similar topics and this book ( I bought it for a GF whothought herself the super SKEPTIC!) this book was a dissapointmentto me intellectually and in practical examples as i recall. I either gaveit away or threw it in the round file."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book for the Everyday Skeptic","review":"I just finished reading Micheal Shermer's book, and I found it very insightful and entertaining. I thought his responses to creationists were well structured and practical. Overall, an excellent and educational read. May be slightly boring to those who are not skeptical-minded. I feel it could have been improved with more anecdotes regarding how pseudoscientist and paranormalists have been debunked in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Michael Shermer","review":"I found Shermer's book to be an excellent yet basic treatise about the nonsense that passes as truth in some circles . It's disturbing to find that there are people out there (even some who are otherwise well-educated) who believe that the Holocaust never happened or who toss aside science from 1850 forward in favor of creationism. And yet Shermer shows us that they not only exist but that they are trying to infect others with their \\"pseudoscience, superstition, and other confusions.\\" I think one reason some of them are actually successful is that there are not enough people like Michael Shermer out there explaining the difference between science and pseudoscience. Finally, I appreciate the fact that Shermer points out that not all skeptics and believers in real science are atheists as the fundamentalist Christian right would have the American public believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why people believe in reading this book... I don't know","review":"Why people believe in reading this book.... I have no idea. Although the concepts were intriguing, the overall dry tone and expected commentary came off as pompous and elitists. Reading this book seemed to have no sense of rhyme or reason. Each topic seemed to simply pop up and there be no emotion attached to many of the opinions. With the exception of the holocaust deniers, the book seemed to dehumanize those that believed \\"weird things\\". So what if someone believes in vampires? Maybe their home life is negative and the person finds oasis in their fantasy world. Near death experiences, although have biological definitions, are excuses for people to improve their lives and keep normally distanced people closer. Overall, unless the reader themselves are elitists that look down on those that may not completely live in a scientific mindset, don't bother picking up Why People Believe Weird Things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chapter on Ayn Rand is Terrible","review":"How can you spend a chapter talking about how morality cannot possibly be a science. and not mention any of Rand's arguments. Thanks to the author for at least reading her books. It seems like he has from his writings. Most of rands critics havent. But he doesnt mention her response. We know the argument against her philosophy. We want to hear her reasons why ethics is a science and if this author thinks they are wrong then refute her arguments.Here's where it starts. \\"Values arise ONLY because living things face the alternative of life or death\\" Trust me there's much much more! (Crazy huh? She has arguments for why she believes these \\"weird\\" things)Now tell me why you think that's wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The title of the book seemed promising. But the book its self was very disappointing. It is not well organized and the scope of the book and the material presented seem far from each other. What I did not understand was if this was a book which through scientific reasoning showed that people believe in illogical things why include 2-3 chapters about Holocaust??? What's that have to do with it? Is this like a jewish propaganda or something ???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gould's name is on it, that says it all...","review":"Gould kids himself, he violates critical thinking in all his books.

You subtract the printing, storage, and transportation cost and somehow magically the price increases $12.49. That makes no sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"There must be a reason for the title.","review":"It's interesting reading. Schermer is a self-admitted skeptic, but he's fair and sound in his reasoning. I'm not quite finished with the book, so am still looking for some of the reasons he thinks people believe wierd things.He talks about the pros and cons of creation vs evolution, holocaust deniers, and even ufo abductions. He certainly presents a variety of subjects to pick from.All in all, worth the time to read because it really can make a thoughtful reader stop and take another look at what might be some pet beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABD pads","review":"found these for 25 cents per pad, and it's the same grade as the ones used in the hospital where I work...thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disco is still alive and kickin'","review":"What a great concert this is and the quality is supurb!!

As a professional tour guide, I have done lots of research on Harlem, and believe me, no other source provides so much information so concisely in such a useful format.The book is typical of Dolkart, a Columbia University professor who wears his erudition lightly. The history of the City, economic forces, changing architectural tastes, trends in race relations -- all these strands are woven together to offer a multi-dimensional view of the community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loses some of the flavor of the 1st edition. . . and of the trilogy","review":"These rules are more complete than the West End SW 1st edition. They will satisfy gamers who just HAVE to have a rule for everything. These rules also include information about events beyond the original trilogy. By the time this book came out, the Timothy Zahn novels had been published, and Dark Horse was releasing the Dark Empire stories. If you want to role-play in the New Republic era, this one is handy.Overall though, these rules are less elegant than the 1st edition. The people who created 1st ed REALLY understood Star Wars, and seemed to have a good grasp on how to make an RPG. The makers of 2nd ed seemed to understand what an RPG needed, but didn't quite GET the original SW trilogy.This edition is fine, but the original is a timeless work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"West End Games has always had one of the simplest systems to jump in and play.

Black is low key but his main goal is to get money and take care of his family. He ain't messed up about the rest. I love the closeness of the familial ties, even down to their mother's relations and how they scuffle to make it in the drug game and keep family first.Mr. McNair gives plenty details and has a host of characters. The storyline keeps the curious mind's attention awaiting the outcome to this saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"can we pick up the pace a little","review":"This book moved too slow and it lost me in just a few chapters.

They provided a very nice light that was not too bright or dark, but after a week they began flickering badly. After a few days of this one side's tube had almost all but burned out. There was still some light, but for the most part the light was gone and the other one started flickering. I took them out, tried again, and ordered two more. Same problem occurred.

The best tutorials are by Felix Nelson, because they are original and unique. Scott Kelby's stuff is kitsch. He copykats what graphic designer's are doing today and recreates a cheap knock-off tutorial for this book. Best Buy, American Pie's Logo, etc. Why the hell would I want to make a logo that looks just like American Pie's logo? Or a logo that looks just like EA Sport's logo? How trite. But if that's your thing to steal, mimic, and make crappy versions of the original then go ahead. I used to respect Kelby, mmm not so much anymore.

I could not recommend them more to a Photoshop user, whether it's for print design (which is what I do), digital photography, or web design. The reason why I praise this book so much is because of the ease of use. The tips are step-by-step and easy to understand. Mr. Kelby does not fall into speaking a language that only professionals understand, and for that this book is a great tutor. While it can be compared to learning how to play music without actually knowing how to read musical notes, the information is definitely invaluable."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fonts","review":"It's a great looking book when you pick it up , seems like a lot of great tutorials , how to's except for one fact .

First, the author subjects his readers to the most juvenile, inane humor(insert question mark here) in the introduction (\\"Preamble\\") and at the beginning of each chapter to make us believe he not only is the Messiah of Photoshop but also way cool. Second, most of the effects in the book are geared for graphic designers. There's very little usable information for the digital photographer. What is written concerning improving or tweaking an image is gimmicky and really doesn't do anything to improve the overall image. As a photographer, I wouldn't recommend this book at all for someone who is looking to improve the overall quality of their images."},{"rating":"1","title":"You really read the book and still gave it 5 stars?","review":"After receiving this book, I can't believe what the positive reviewers are saying.

The effects included in this book are tired and cliched, and easy to figure out from PREVIOUS manuals about Photoshop!What a waste of money.

The use of the word encyclopedia in this book's title is extremely misleading and dishonest in trying to drum up sales to unsuspecting victims. I expected this book to contain a vast amount of information on at least all of the major artist's albums. There are hardly any albums in this book at all with only one album per band or singer if that artist is represented at all. I don't know how the author decided on which albums to appear, there doesn't seem to be any logic to what is in and isn't in here. The albums aren't the biggest selling, ones which were career breaking or anything like that. This book seems to just be a list of the author's favourite albums.

In a remarkable career that spans four decades, the release of this album marked a period of great commercial and critical success for Ross. Coming after her huge hit \\"Diana\\", the Michael Masser tunes returned her to her love song roots, highlighted by \\"It's My Turn\\", a hit single and one of her strongest vocal performances in this genre. Her covers of \\"To Love Again\\" and \\"Come In From The Rain\\" are very fine. \\"One More Chance\\" builds to a strong finish, with drama. Included also are other Masser tunes, such as the signature \\"Theme from Mahogany\\". Previously released on other albums, \\"After You\\" and \\"Never Say I Don't Love You\\" are unexpected delights included in this very good and wonderfully strong set of love songs from a major pop performer."},{"rating":"2","title":"She said \\"stay with me\\" and i did for the last 20years.","review":"This has to be one of the greatest collection of lovely songs known to man and woman...I have been in love with her voice for most of my life and today iam proud to be the owner of this masterpiece...highly recommended to all lovers of great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those \\"one more, one more\\" at the end of \\"One More Chance\\"","review":"To me, this is Diana at her best. I had this record in vynil from the 80s and I was so frustrated because I couldn't listen to it (I used to do it in a horrible recorded tape I did) and some of the songs here featured were not available in any other cd. Well, in my opinion, apart from terrific songs & lyrics, Diana's voice never sounded better. Those \\"one more chaaaaance, one more, one more\\" at the end of that song are really impressive. Her voice NEVER sounded so brave (don't know why, but in the RCA years she sounds less... powerful). Another interesting detail: those photographs in the cover... she is fantastic. To think she had appeared some months before in the cover of the diana-Chic album with jeans and wet hair! This album is among my faves of Diana (number 1 in my personal rank would be The Boss. For me, that is one of the best albums ever recorded.)

Now, this reissue is the best in years. Added are \\"Together\\" and \\"Dreaming of You\\" with Lionel Ritchie that I thought would never reappear. Both are winners.If you only ever buy one post-Supremes Diana Ross CD, buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to judge this one on your own, but do it!","review":"If you like Ross, and I do, this has some great moments, of which I noticed previous reviewers don't all agree on what they are. That alone I'd say makes it worthwhile. I've been waiting forever to get one of these on CD, yet no one mentioned it here. The song Never Say I Don't Love You, has long been one of my favorites, and the haunting arangement just compliments it perfectly. The copilation has much of what eludes Ross today, good materiel more suitable to her generation (some of which was showcased on the last new CD) It's a must have if you're a Ross fan. The choices for selection are in my opinion stylish and effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boss at her exquisite best","review":"Exceptional in every respect. These lovingly crafted songs were designed for Diana and Diana alone. Tender and soft ballads build, in some cases to dramatic belt-it out endings laid over soaring orchestras or rhythm sections.

Her Father makes her move because it's his home country and he wants her, Rafik, and her brother to know about it. Also, I think that he missed his home and finally had enough courage to move back. This book had a great way of displaying things, but I find they should show more of both sides than leaning all the way to the Arab side. It would make it less boring if it compared the Jews and Arabs thoughts much more then it does now. This book was still Ok, but I myself wouldn't suggest it to people if they want the exact story line. Personally, I like reading fantasy adventure books so I look at it from a different perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Abboud&#65533;s Move","review":"Habibi is a book about the Abboud family and they are going to live overseas. For a quarter of the book it takes place in St. Louis, and then the rest of the book, it takes place in Ramalah. The issues this book brought up were the prejudice between the Palestinians and the Israelis. I thought that this book was a very good example about what prejudice is. I liked the book because it had a nice story line, and it was very easy to understand what was happening. My favorite part of the book was when the family was learning Arabic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Abboud&#65533;s Second Life","review":"Liyana is a 13 year old girl that live in St. Louis, but her dad decided to move back to his home Palestine.

It is hard for them to stay friends because he is Jewish and she is Arab, and in Palestine the Arabs and the Jew's fight all the time. She wants there to be peace between Arab's and Jew's, and wonders if it will ever happen. This was an ok book. It was a great book, but it's not really my type of book. I like myisteries and action books. I think Rafik is the coolest character in the book. He is nice, funny, and dosen't care what people think of him. The writing style was good, and the subject matter was a good subject to talk about. The characters seemed to be real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetic fuzzy-headed thinking","review":"As a tutor for middle-school and high-school students, I thought that this book would be an age-appropriate, poetic introduction to the complicated history of Palestine and Israel as told by a teenager. I was appalled to find that this book is very slanted toward Palestinians, portraying Israelis as either ashamed of their actions or brutal, mindless hoodlums. As a feminist, I was also irritated by the non-portrayal of the mother, who is two-dimensional at best. If you must have your students read this book, please pair it with a book written from a Jewish perspective. Or, brush up on your Middle Eastern history, so you can bring some depth and nuance to a complicated problem, and not the simplistic stereotypes as found in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"the words are expresive","review":"HabibiBy: Naomi shihab nyeIn my whole lifetime I've read a lot of books, but the book that really captured my attention is the book named Habibi.

Its portrayal of history is either inaccurate or missing. It presents no context for the actions of the Israeli soldiers, just talks about how mean they are. It justifies suicide bombing as the correct response for frustrated people. It gives no explanation as to the reasons for the conflict. It misquotes Golda Meir and provides no explanation for her statement that there was no Palestine, i.e., a country called Palestine before 1948. The story is somewhat interesting, but sorely lacking in context and history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Habibi","review":"HabibiThe book was not really that interesting to me.

Being an Arab makes her friendship with Omer who is Jewish extremely hard to maintain.

These books have excellent information tables just like Machinery's Handbook, while they aren't as crammed with information you really don't need that was mostly added just to justify yet another edition. Not only that, this book in its elegant burgundy color with gold trim, will match other McGraw-Hill handbooks from that era e.g. American Electrician's Handbook.

These are remakes that are \\"fairly\\" close to the originals, but different enough to tell the difference and really bug you if you were looking for the originals.

The end result is that the music is very easy to listen to but feels light and I feel that it sounds a bit to much like movie soundtrack music. The book-let is quite well done and the painting on the front is splendid. The liner notes and the essay inside are well done and it is not overlong or too verbose.

While some of the better names do make very good bits, I found the Whiteside superior. Right out of the box they are very sharp, excellent quality carbide (and excellent overall quality), stay sharper longer, no chatter and burn marks are very rare. Also unlike some bits the marking (on the inch shanks is easy to read). If they get mixed up (happens to me all the time despite my organized storage system) it is very easy to see which is the vs. 23/32 straight bit. It is marked with the PN so you do need to look it up. The may be a little more expensive but it is definitely worth it. If you haven't tried Whiteside I encourage you to try them and put it through its paces.

Simply, too much words, and who told him he was a song-writer? Some of this \\"songs\\" are nothing but \\"moans\\".I like to listen to Yanni's soothing music while I'm working and defenitively this CD could not meet that purpose. It would distract me to the point of having to change the CD.All I can ask and wish for is that Yanni becomes aware of this and returns to his original new age style, no words, no strange aborigine sounds but plain instrumental, relaxing and soothing music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playing By Heart and touching mine!","review":"I always look forward to each new Yanni release with great excitement and so far have never been disappointed, so I was glad to realize with Ethnicity that the streak would hold. I love this recording. Playing By Heart is my favorite. It just makes me feel happy (at one point it almost sounds like the Violin is laughing) I also love Rites of Passage and Almost a Whisper on which the vocals are wonderful. Anyhow, I'm not great at writing reviews, I can only say that this Yanni release once again lifts my spirits and touches me in a way no one else's music ever has or probably ever will. Yanni is a genius in my book, he is truly gifted and I for one am very thankful for his great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not as we used to hear from Yanni","review":"He used the vocals too much in this album that seems to be no music, and the emotions of this album buts you in the junglethis is not Yanni's styleI think this is his worst album,tracks 6 + 10 are very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It has been a couple of years since I have purchased a Yanni album, as they often had songs on them that I already had. I guess I got behind in the changes with Yanni. Last week, I bought four albums from Amazon.com, and I received \\"Tribute\\", and \\"If I Could Tell You\\" yesterday. I loved both of those albums. Today, I received \\"Ethnicity\\", and was very disappointed. Most of the music highlights vocalists. I particularly disliked the grunting man's voice in \\"Almost A Whisper\\". Hoping for better things with \\"Truth of Touch\\" which I have not received yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great album by Yanni","review":"Ethnicity is a wonderful album. Yanni has used a lot of human voice in the songs of this album, and this makes it a unique production and a nice change of style in Yanni's music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total disappointment","review":"If you loved Yanni and if liked his style and music don't buy this CD. This album has nothing to do with what he has done so far. This is not new age, not pop, not jazz, not classic, I just don't know in which category you could put this album.Most tracks are with vocal and lyric. Yanni,s music is just in the background and on the top of all the recording is very poor. Try to listen before you buy or you may get very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"I'M SO DISPLEASE WITH YANNI'S NEW CD. I WISH HE HAD CONTINUED TO LET HIS MUSIC SPEAK NOT THE SINGERS.VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING. I ONLY HOPE HIS CONCERT DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY OF HIS NEW RELEASE.

NO MORE TO GET...I JUST LOVE THIS EDITION AND THE BONUS DVD IS EXCELLENT PIECE OF ART OF YANNI'S LIVE CONCERT AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL IN LONDON...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another step downhill","review":"His last release was still decent but a bit overly limited to midi and drum machine instrumentation. This CD gets away from that only slightly by the addition of more ethnic instruments and WAY too much vocals. The drum machine is obviously still present. The first 4 cuts are just plain gastric. The vocalist has a good/not great voice. With this much emphasis on vocals he should have worked harder to get a better singer. Just not very pleasing, and kind of irritating. There are a few good songs on the disk, but sadly not enough to justify the purchase. Here is my recomendation. He is just starting his world tour. The songs that are worthwhile will get ironed out and humanized on his followup Live CD after the tour. That one will be much more worth listening to. Charlie, Ric, and all the other greats will really flesh the good songs out. Just don't waste your money on this disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethnicity","review":"The sound is different then his previous albums. It really caught my attention because it was different and made me really want to pay more attention to it and listen. It is upbeat but relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Fabulous! Fantastic!","review":"You know how sometimes when you eagerly await the next album from one of your favorite artists, and the album finally arrives, it's not as good as you were hoping? NOT A PROBLEM HERE!! I've just finished listening to the whole album through the first time and I have enjoyed every single track. In the past, I have liked Yanni's instrumental work more than the pieces that feature vocalists. All the tracks on this album, except \\"Playing By Heart\\", contains human voice in some form, but I still love it. The instrumentals and voices really complement each other, with fabulous results. Additionally, I think I would characterize this album as a little higher energy than many of the previous albums; that's ok by me, too! The 2nd disk is a 25 minute DVD containing concert footage from Albert Hall. Looks pretty good on the PC, need to get it home to watch it seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vocals are not as bad as the reviews say.","review":"Just give it a shot. This is a nice album with 4 or 5 good tracks to its credit. My favorites are Rainmaker,For all seasons and Playing by heart. Yanni should stick with instrumental music. My guess is that instead of taking it seriously Yanni just experimented with a different style other than his own unique style. Come on Nightbird!!! you can do much much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethnicity is awesome! Listen to it LOUD!","review":"I love Yanni, I love this new album, I have worn out my CD and am here to buy a new one because I listened to it so many times. My favorite song is Rainmaker with David Hudson's didgeridoo. I love the blending of cultures on this CD...from J'averi to Rainmaker to the Promise....its simply beautiful and flows with harmony and uplifting emotional strength.The Live Concerts left me high on life for days an unable to sleep because I felt so energized! You all must see Yanni Live!Keep making more albums...! I cant wait to buy the Live version of this CD, and hope we get a new DVD to watch soon too!Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure essence","review":"I loved this CD. Some of Yanni's stuff is a little out there but this CD was absolutely incredible. I think i've listened to it 100 times."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"Like many others, I looked forward to the Ethnicity CD with great anticipation. Prior to its release, my friends and I--all big Yanni fans--bought tickets to his Ethnicity concert as soon as they went on sale. We actually had seats in the 9th row! When the CD was released, we all hurried to buy it. After listening to it a few times, we decided to sell our tickets on e-Bay (at a loss, I might add). The vocals just don't cut it, especially when he added them to an old instrumental that previously had been a great piece of music. Yanni, I hope you will read some of these reviews and take note."},{"rating":"2","title":"ignore the naysayers who want to live in the past","review":"I almost let the lukewarm response of fans lamenting his changing style disuade me from buying Ethnicity. That was even after I saw him on this new tour in Tampa. Then I saw him again in Phoenix and I bought it the next day. Yes, the music is different but every artist changes, just as we ourselves change. The concert opens with On Sacred Ground, which has even prompted me to pull that CD out (my least favorite) and start listening again. Ethnicity is magical. At the Phoenix show I brought a friend who was only marginally aware of who Yanni was and he walked away amazed. And a fair portion of this tour is from Ethnicity! So buy it, leave your Yanni \\"sameness\\" expectations at the door and be prepared for magic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new (hopefully temporary) direction for Yanni","review":"I just hope Yanni is taking a little detour with this CD and will soon return to his usual style. This CD is totally different. I'd never guess it was Yanni. I like it, but at the same time I was a little disappointed. I don't know what else to say other than listen to the samples before you buy it.I just updated my review, after listening to it a few more times it's growing on me. So give it a chance before you rule it out. That said, I still prefer the instrumentals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on You","review":"When I first listened to this CD I asked myself, what is Yanni doing? It wasn't what I expected as a few of the songs had lyrics that sounded uncharacteristically commercial. After playing it a few times I especially enjoyed \\"Play Time,\\" and \\"For All Seasons.\\" \\"Rainmaker\\" is also very interesting, though the chanting is a little comical.I have to say I enjoyed his last CD \\"If I Could Tell You\\" more, but I do very much enjoy some of the tracks on this album. I can't help but feel the fire and passion in Yanni's music isn't nearly what it used to be. It's probably because he broke-up years ago with Linda Evans, his former flame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Yanni we know and Love","review":"I listened to this in the car and couldn't wait to get home to write a review to warn people. This CD should have been called \\"Tribal Chants with Yanni\\". This is NOT the music we are accustomed to hearing from this incredibly talented performer. The tracks were all rather redundant. The vocalists are very fine indeed, but that's not what we enjoy about Yanni. I enjoy his melodious instrumentals as a way to relax. I have never found chanting a way of relaxing. In my humble opinion, this is just not the Yanni we know and love. I am quite disappointed in this music. He should have stuck with Linda Evans because evidently she knew what his public enjoyed! As far as I'm concerned, his best music was Live at the Acropolis (which I know Ms. Evans had a hand in), mostly because the full orchestration gave his music such depth and body. This is my favorite and it's going back into my CD player and \\"Ethnicity\\" is going in the trash! Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yanni Touches the Soul","review":"Listening to anything Yanni takes me to a place only his music can. Ethnicity is a cross-cultural blending of various instruments and sounds from around the globe. And, wow! Yet again, Yanni mesmerizes with his soulful approach to his music. His work is unique, uplifting, inspiring, and at times, hauntingly beautiful. Ethnicity is a must-have for any Yanni fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn. Another Yanni Album.","review":"Well, I was looking forward to this as I always look forward to new Yanni albums. But more and more, I am disappointed. Go back about four albums and play them all together and they sound the same. There is absolutely nothing new here. There is absolutely nothing exciting here. Yanni used to be new and exciting and his music was exhilarating. No more. Two stars instead of one is because Yanni is Yanni and you know what you're getting now when you buy a Yanni album. Sweet background music. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lose the lyrics","review":"Yanni is NOT a song writer. adding lyrics to 3 songs in one album is NOT a good idea.vocals adds up to the music in Rainmaker, Rite of Passage and others.- SUGGESTOINS: no lyrics. less vocals. more \\"Rainmaker\\".- BUYERS: you will certainly love some compostions. like others. but i still find it hard to enjoy the lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the only yanni album that blows","review":"this album sucks cuz it has too many words in it and it doesn't sound like real new age music. I suggest that people out there who read this that likes no words music then this album isn't for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many vocals","review":"I bought this album a while back and was very dissapointed with how it sounded. It did have his relaxing keyboards but it also had too many vocals and they were drowning out his music. I want to listen to an album that has no words and very relaxing music. Vocals ruin the album altogether. Especially when a young girl is singing. He could've done a much better job. If his next album doesn't improve. I'm gonna have to step off the Yanni elevator"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the usual","review":"I really liked Acropolis and \\"Best of Yanni\\", so when I heard the vocals in this CD, I was *very* disappointed...Yanni fans may like it, but I don't care for it, over all. I bought if for my husband as a gift, and he didn't care for the vocals, either. It distracts from the beautiful compositions that are Yanni's signature sound, in my opinion. Buy one of his older works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves Me Questioning","review":"Yawni (as I like to call him) was a pretty cool fella when he was dating Linda Evans and her shoulder pads but since the break-up he has gone straight down hill. As a belly dancer who once lived in Borneo, I truly love ethnic music but Mr. Yawni has taken out the city and left us with ethni which makes no sense to me.I like the African influences and the ethereal female vocals but other than that I can find no use for this album. I can't even sleep to it because it keeps me awake wondering \\"why, Yawni, why?\\".I prefer Niki Nana because it reminds me of my sweet ole granny with her support hose falling down around her ankles as she taught me belly dancing to the raging rhythms of \\"Never Dance with a Stranger\\" (something granny taught me never to do because men, she'd say, are like whiskey and cigarettes - bad habits hard to break). Therefore, I belly dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"a shocking album for yanni fans","review":"I wonder how could a great musician like yanni allowed this album to appear.Although i am a super yanni fan, I couldn't find any lovely music in this album.In fact I found ugli music & I started to wonder if this is the same yanni who produced Acropolis,tribute or if I could tell you!The instruments are very poor,the crying (vocals ) is excessive & boring + the themes are not good, in fact they are poor.I advise all yanni fans to buy this album, listen to it 4 to 5 times & then send their openion to yanni.Finally I hope that yanni put his fans'openion in his mind & think over with himself ( AM I ADVANCING OR GOING BACK ? )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lo mismo de siempre...","review":"Para quienes oyen por primera vez a Yanni les fascinará (o extrañará) oir muchos coros y vocalizaciones en este ultimo CD, pero para quienes estamos acostumbrados a su musica instrumental, a la meditacion dentro de sus ritmos electronicos suaves, es un CD que no trae muchas cosas nuevas. Esperé oir algo como la continuacion de \\"If I could tell you\\" que me parecio un CD mucho mejor que este, o incluso sus CDs anteriores, en los que no se cansa de repetir y repetir canciones, que aun así, siguen siendo clásicos del New Age.Yanni tambien, pone ritmos mas diversos en este CD, junto a las vocalizaciones, incorpora algunos fondos con acento irlandes o de esas regiones (intuyo) pero esto le hace dar más un aire de superficialidad que de originalidad, y no por la incorporacion misma de esos elementos, mas bien porque no queda con su estilo. Me quedo con los CDS anteriores"},{"rating":"1","title":"My god! What a disgrace!","review":"I bought this album because, even though I'm more a metal fan I do like music that will relax me. I've heard some stuff about Yanni (mostly from old ladies and such..) that he is a very talented musician. So I got the album and at night I played it. My god! I couldn't sleep. His vocals are so weird.. I can't tell if it's a a 5th grade girl, or if it's him! Since that album kept me up I took my car and ran it over the following week. The only reason I didn't run it over sooner is because I tried let it sinking in. Didnt work. I advise you not to buy this alubm. It is no where near the relaxing music I was hoping for. Terrible sounding instrumentals and odd annoying vocals make this album \\"the SUCKsess\\" it is today. Hmmm...

Buy something by Madonna, J Lo, or Shakira instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A departure, yes - but a wonderful one","review":"I bought this CD strictly because I greatly admire Yanni's prior work. Yes, it is quite different from \\"traditional Yanni\\", but I find this CD very uplifting and inspiring and the vocals enhancing and not at all distracting.

I have rarely been so let down by an album. The very heavy use of the keyboards is very annoying, along with the fact that all the songs sound the same. If they all sounded like the same really good song that would be OK, but they all sound like the same boring, uninspired, and very UNcatchy song, which is NOT ok. This album sucks, pure and simple.

Rautavaara's music has modern elements for sure, but it is very often tonal, tuneful and beautiful. He honors and continues classical music. His \\"Angel of Light\\" Symphony is one of my favorite Rautavaara works. Movement I is ethereal; it has you soaring like you do when you listen to a Mahler Adagio. Movement III is the musical equivalent of \\"shimmering.\\" Movement IV, to me, conjures up visions of the summoning of spirits. A great listen from beginning to end and one that definitely conjures up visions of space and the heavens. The sound and playing are great. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull...Zzzzzzzz....","review":"I am a fan of Ruth Rendell and Barbara Vine and fortunately have read some of her wonderful novels. If \\"The Rottweiler\\" had been my first Rendell novel, it probably would have been my last. The book is just plain dull. The plot goes nowhere and plods along at a snail's pace. I wanted to finish the book so I stayed with it, but it took me forever because I kept falling asleep trying to read it. The characters are one dimensional stock caricatures. They are a sad lot with none having any redeeming qualities. I ended up disliking all of them and I wouldn't have cared if the book ended with the killer doing away with every last one of them. One of the problems with the plot is that there are too many subplots going...even the main plot (the murders) is more like a subplot. The many plotlines are never really brought together in a satisfactory way. It just leaves you with the feeling, \\"thank goodness that's over.\\" Yawn..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rottweiler has plenty of teeth","review":"This is a late (for the book's age) review, but I wanted to add my admiration for Rendell's unfailing ability to construct wonderful stories that are even better character studies. Her principal characters are usually way off center, but not perceived as being as dangerous or as bizaare as they really are by the rest of the world. \\"The Rottweiler\\" is a very good example of mundane/normal/boring vs. crazy/malevolent.

The best, however, being the return of the planet killer. The idea that it was sent from just outside our galaxly into the heart of Borg space, preferably straight through the Terran system as well, was awseome. Also, having the spiked doomsday machine destroy a Tholian web was astounding! The Vastator of Borg character was a great added bonus.

But, alas, no, David chooses to burst their bubble. To me, the entire crux of the story was not the spirits of the Planet Killer, but its abilities, and how they might save the Federation. The author of this book is clearly too timid to establish a precedent--that is, the existance of a ship that can defeat the Borg, with impunity, despite their adaptability. For those readers who are more concerned with the so-called \\"background\\" ( the politics, battles, inventions and etc. of Star Trek), this book is only worthy of burning.

The only disadvantage is that it tends to be flimsy since it wobbles when it scrubs/polishes the tiles. But for its price and performance, it is ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional","review":"I specifically went in search of the hoover floor shampooer as I remember mom and grandmom using this type of hoover.

What they call an on/off switch was defective. Actually, there is no on/off switch, you have to tilt the handle to turn it on -- very inconvenient.

Haven't tried it yet, really don't care how well it works, since the way it is built it won't last very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad news","review":"Bought this product as used item, but did not expect it to be broken beyond repair. Contacted the seller, who promptly issued a return label and gave me a full refund. Apparently they were not aware of the damage either. The seller even gave me a gift certificate for all the trouble I went through with this machine.Even if you find a new one I would not buy this product. The handle is very flimsy and wobbly. The gears are plastic and you cannot get any replacement parts for it when anything breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floormax","review":"This is a great machine for cleaning, scrubbing, and buffing. Its only downside is that it's not a wet vac, too. But it's inexpensive, so I can't complain.I use the scrubber for my carpet, then go over with my steam cleaner vac. I also scrub my deck with it.

Also the cord is quite short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carpet cleaner???","review":"I recently ordered this machine on line and eagerly awaited it's arrival as my fairly new carpets now needed some TLC. It was sinple to put together, lightweight and inexpensive. I used this machine first on my harwood floors (the entire first floor of my home). It worked wonderfully, although you do need to mop/buff them dry. Then on to the rugs...the braided area rug I have was a breeze and came out beautiful then when I was about 1/4 of the way through the second room (my low pile area rug)the machines brushes would not spin along with the mechanism nor stay attached. I tried to call Hoover for help/information to see if this was a quick fix and it lookes like my 4 hour old machine will now need service. How disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT Works Great!","review":"It does the job. This old house has wood floors and the Hoover F4300 is an excellent tool.

I found that if you tighten the tank that holds water/detergent too tight, it leaks on floor when not in use. It runs automatically after plugging it in and pressing lever on bottom but it runs with less resistance backwards. It would be better to have a switch to turn on. It would be better if it ran with little resistance forward rather than backward. Since it does not pick up dirt, it would be better to buy a steamvac that actually sucks up dirty water rather than leave it in carpet or floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover F4300 Floormax supreme","review":"This product is not worth the money.

He was also a self taught naturalist, cut down in the prime of life by an illness that waxed and waned and which was diagnosed as MS, but which fulfills the diagnostic criteria for Lyme disease (often misdiagnosed as MS today). Beyond offering the opportunity for medical sleuthing, this little book opens a window into a rather interesting mind.

After detention and being grounded by my parents, I was lucky enough to find an original copy, which today, taped up and falling apart, remains a favorite book.

Then I'd read what was making me laugh (and a lot of times, I was laughing so hard I wasn't quite clear)-- I think he finally read the book himself!And tonight, on a whim, I typed the title into Google and found that I can still get it here!

This bok has everything. Those of us who have been through the typical military antics will see that we were not the first, and we will not be the last. Right through to the last page the reader will see how things sometimes get done by pure dumb luck. My original intent was to mail the book to a friend who is retired from the intelligence circles, but after reading it I think I will just send him the link instead and have him get his own book. So if you may make this a gift, you better buy two. It is a book I shall read again.

Simon Hall's book doesn't give as many proofs and doesn't cover the subject matter as much (dealing more with functional analysis). Royden is probably better, but I have not read it much, and I think it is less advanced from what I hear. Folland didn't excite me either.Maybe it is just a difficult subject to write a good text on, but I bet someone will come along and write a better one to take over, like Gallian replaced Herstein in algebra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuine Hoover belt works as expected.","review":"It's a vacuum belt and it works and it's made by Hoover.

Mispelled names of people or yachts involved was just one of many things which was distracting and annoying.I know conditions were deadly, appalling, and life threatening, however, this book (for me) played up on that fact way too much.It read more like a rollercoaster, darstardly, murderous whodunnit puncutated with overflowery, repetitious slang rather than a real-life event which really happened to real people.But hey, everyone's different.

Making promises is much more effective than setting goals. There is also a wealth of information on how to formulate and implement your promise plan. I saw him speak at the Tom Hopkins Boot Camp in August 2007 and it has stuck with me ever since.

The book was published in 2005, by then he already had the \\"how to lose a billion\\" experience as in the Fortune article (link below). He still pictured himself as a self-made billionare, which was on paper and lost because of possible fraud.[...]There was some good material, but without integrity the book can only be rated as one star"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on the Money!","review":"Bill Bartmann gives advice for the small business owners to the corporate giants!

Articles about California history and culture are always well researched...as a California historian, I am very particular about this aspect.2. The travel stories and section are the best: they offer the touristy side aa well as the lesser-known aspects.3. Excellent advice on gardening (flowers, fruit and vegetables) relative to the actual climate where people live.4. Food/Recipes section often offers ideas and recipes for doing something new with common ingredients, especially seasonal ingredients.There are other features that represent a variety of interests: Entertainment outings, conservation issues and just about any thing else making the news on the West Coast.

My wife and I frequently turn to the current and past issues looking for reciepes, weekend getaways, gardening, and ideas for design and decorating.

Sunset has great ideas for your life on the West Coast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good... A little too comercial","review":"I've always thought of Sunset magazine as the type of magazine you'd find in the back of an airplane seat. The kind of magazine with flashy pictures, expensive wines and places you can never afford to go to. This is a good magazine, but I find level of advertising annoying. Also, the reviews of hotels don't strike me as that reliable. Last month, based on a review in this magazine about an inn, we stayed the night at this location and found the service was awful, the 'rooms with fireplaces' not functional and the room smelled bad. These facts were conveniently left out of the review which touted the friendly staff and the great rooms. So I guess, ultimately, I'd take reviews and articles in the magazine with a grain of salt.I DO however like the recipes, particularly the ones which come out around harvest/Thanksgiving time.4 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recipes","review":"I finally subscribed when I realized that I was buying every issue! The recipes are great-- simple ingredients, quick prep, healthy. The featured gardens are an inspiration. The travel ideas are good too-- practical, and always with a range of costs for accommodations at each location featured. This would be great for someone new to the west who needs ideas about where to go and what will grow in their garden. For native westerners, it always offers fresh ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Travel and Gardening Information","review":"Sunset really is a great source of information for Travel and Gardening. I have taken dozens of their recommendations on destinations in the West and have never been steered in the wrong direction. Sunset offers insight into not only where to stay and eat, but great hikes and off-the-beaten-track shops and cafes. Well-researched for sure. The gardening information is so thorough and right on that I adhere to it like gospel truth. It will tell you exactly what you need to do each month to keep your garden going, whether you live in southern California or Northern Washington. I wouldn't subscribe to Sunset for the recipes -- they are not that inventive nor are they very inspired. But, Sunset is second to none on travel and gardening topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware auto-renewal process","review":"I was not informed prior to the auto renewal occurance and they would not let me cancel after the renewal.

Two things really make this DVD different from the rest of the basketball instructional tapes - the recognizable players from yesterday (Magic, Kareem, Kenny Smith) and today's stars (Rip Hamilton, Amare Stoudamire, Carmelo Anthony) and the quality of the production. It is really movie quality which we found kept our son's attention. Because of the amount of information on the DVD, some of it is more advanced and probably better for a junior high or high school player, but there is also plenty for the beginner to get better.

Ambersons was a logical \\"next step\\" for Welles as a director. His breathtaking Citizen Kane detailed the life of a power hungry man. This same strain is played out through an entire family in Ambersons, and the symphony Welles has composed is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petition to get this on DVD","review":"Yes, it's a crime that this film isn't on DVD in a deluxe edition.

(See the new edition of ENCHANTED APRIL -- just out on DVD by popular demand.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I do not know why this movie is so highly rated by so many people. It is a boring story, poorly directed, photographed darkly and mostly over-acted. The Wells style, used so effectively in \\"Citizen Kane,\\" is totally botched here. Wells style of having people talk over and interrupt each other (used for realism) is effective in \\"Kane,\\" but badly misses here. Even the redemption scene at the end does not get the message across.

Too bad so much of it was cut before its release."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unkindest Cut of All","review":"It is too bad that RKO cut this work of genius Orson Welles. We are perhaps able to imagine what could have been viewed if allowed to be released in its original form. The second unkindest cut of all is that it is not available in U.S. format at this writing, on DVD. There are possibly two generations of Americans who have not seen it. Those lucky foreigners who DO have the movie. It is a great and bittersweet story of a family at the turn of the century, their relationship dramas and the trauma of going from a pioneer society to an industrialized one--one that we are similarly going through now because of the techno-revolution. Products become outdated as soon as they are manufactured, fortunes are lost, new fortunes are gained, the \\"haves\\" trade places with the \\"have-nots\\" and back again several times over. The acting is superb with a special thank you to Agnes Moorehead, a real pro. The thing that gets you in this movie, is the camera work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finger-pointing","review":"It's difficult to see what Orson Welles was upset about when his 1942 film version of Booth Tarkington's novel was released to poor biz as they say. Welles had departed after the shooting, to work on a South American documentary, and left the cutting to the RKO craftsmen, mainly Robert Wise, later an eminent director. Welles later claimed thirty minutes had been cut out and that a different ending had been substituted. In reality virtually the entire novel is included in the movie and the ending is barely changed at all. It's a visually dazzling period piece which unfortunately overlooks the main theme: Tarkington's loathing of the automobile. Tim Holt gives a good performance but is miscast, as is Anne Baxter. The rest of the Mercury Players do their usual outstanding jobs, especially Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Version is EP speed and has massive edge damage.","review":"The tape is new and was delivered promptly.

The Criterion release on Laser did a fine job in presenting Well's original storyboards and ending and it is a pity that we do not have that on DVD as of yet. My review is of the idiot who puts the names of obscure actors in place of well-known stars of the film. Is it is his idea of sick humor? This is certainly not the first DVD on Amazon to recieve such ridiculous treatment. I only wish that I had kept track of the other classic films that have suffered such an un-knowlegeable fate, but if you are a true film buff, I'm sure that you have run across them on this website.

It's a fine film and I'm glad to add it to my collection but I'm so disappointed with Warner Brother's release. It has no commentary, no extra features, it doesn't even have any chapter stops! No chapter stops! Are you serious. Warner Brothers you used to be one of the good guys releasing a wide range of films with quality and care. My how you have fallen and let down your customers.

The gel insert that it comes with is fantastic. I immediately ordered 10.Unfortunately the pen feels like a made in China giveaway, not a $100 pen. No, I wasn't expecting a Mont Blanc or anything, but I was expecting better quality.What specifically? The top feels thin and bends real easy, and because it's so thin it's sharp, I already have a wear line half way through the pen because I like to put the top on the back when I'm using it.The \\"chrome\\" looking pin on the side is plastic, and very cheap.

The shape is very attractive. The color is nice. The texture is interesting, and nice. Cross offers a variety of refills for this pen, including ball point, roller ball, porous point, and highlighter. I like the roller ball refill a lot. It is smooth and consistent. I wish that there were more colors available though.The main problem with this pen is value. It just seems way over-priced. I appreciate that the pen is made in France and USA, that makes it a little special. I would feel better about the price if the material was a bit heavier and thicker.One other concern. To use this pen, you remove the cap and place it on the end of the body, as usual. I cannot detect any bushings or pads that would prevent scratches. I don't know if the cap will scratch the body, but it is a concern. The blue finish is a major attraction for this pen and scratches would look bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"With simplistic, stylized color illustrations","review":"Greece! Rome!

The songs on this album, along with John Denver's other early albums, are characterized by strong acoustic guitar playing, and this particular album also features some bluegrass sound as well as lovely harmonica work. \\"All of My Memories\\" is a John Denver hidden gem, which is reason enough to get the album. This album desperately needs to be released as a cd, and can only be found as an import from Japan, or otherwise a vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of JD's Best","review":"Critics panned this album as too short, too sweet. But perhaps that's its charm - this 1972 album truly is short and sweet. Aerie cemented Denver's status as a pop-folk star, with such hits as \\"Starwood in Aspen\\" and \\"Friends\\". In those days, his music was essentially performed by a trio - Mike Taylor and Dick Kniss on acoustic guitar and upright bass, and Denver picking his big Guild guitars (he was highly under-rated as a player), but this LP was fortified by the sounds of bluegrass musician Eric Weissberg and harmonica virtuoso Toots Thielman, plus some other drop-in friends.Oddly, this beautifully melancholy album has never been released on CD in the US. It took me 3 years to find a Japanese copy; expensive but well worth it. To a true John Denver fan, Aerie is the holy grail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth my search for sure!","review":"WOW! Definitely worth every cent I spent! I had been hunting down this CD for years, in every avenue I could think of, and was THRILLED to find it finally on amazon.

Having treasured the album for decades, I am amazed that I'd forgotten how many beautiful songs are on this one. Can't name a favorite, but I'd say Eagle and Hawk, along with Readjustment Blues and All of My Memories are right up in the top three!

This is especially fun while you're on the road for business.When the device crashes hard, in some cases it can be put into a looping reboot that is not easily recoverable. The steps on the PalmOne support site instruct you to blow away all your data, then download a THIRD PARTY tool to go in an manually remove some databases, then reinstall all your data.

I've abused the phone and have been impressed that it keeps working. Example - a few weeks after I got it I carelessly dropped it into a fruity beverage, but even though it was completely submerged (briefly) and was covered with sticky fruit I was able to clean it off and it kept on working and still works. I'm very happy with the features and the convenience of having my calendar with me at all times. The battery life is good.

I purchased the 650 in March 2005 and have had to replace the unit twice now. Problems include: headset port failure, rebooting while using the phone and calendar as well as very poor blue tooth support. Keep in mind, that the poor \\"bluetooth \\" support rules out using a bluetooth headset. And now in order to have your Treo 650 repaired, Sprint is requiring more $$s / month, in the form of a maint agreement.

My guess is that you need to sit on top of a cell tower in order to make a call.Since there's no reception and it's useless as a phone, that makes this a $500+ PDA, which it clearly is not worth despite its pluses.

Something I found to be a lot of fun on my own but quickly became extra awesome with a friend.

I've never played a game where the camera angle is the biggest obstacle in the game, but that is the case here. It's a struggle to get the view you need to accomplish certain tasks.

Two minor gripes, however: (a) the 5.1 surround mixes make much less use of the back channels than other relatively recent 5.1 releases, e,g., Queen \\"Night at the Opera\\", or anything from the 3 Genesis retrospective box sets - however, I do consider the source here; (b) it would have been nice if the set had included a live disc of some sort. That's it, otherwise - overall, I'd recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough guide for anyone wanting to start his/her own business","review":"Like most Nolo products this book is clearly written. It's very detailed and covers just about everything you'll need to know (trade names, home offices, licenses, taxes, how much to charge, insurance, hiring employees, accounting, and retirement).Sometimes the author provides too much detail, especially when it gets to taxes, and the result is confusion. Still, I'm confident anyone seriously wanting to start a business will find this book to be an excellent reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent guide to taxes for small business owners","review":"I immediately found this book to be helpful. Not only does the author spell out in clear and approachable language the tax issues that small business owners face, the book also explains different types of corporations an owner can form as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each. Fishman also provides sound advise for how to price services, how to reduce income taxes and how to be aware of other pitfalls and advantages of being self-employed. This is an essential book that every self-employed professional should have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good resource, dense information, but doesn't replace professional advice","review":"As a small business owner, I was very interested to see what this book might have to help me avoid legal pitfalls. This book has a wealth of information for anyone starting up their own business, clearly written and well organized. There's advice for selecting a physical location, choosing a corporation type, writing contracts and agreements, keeping adequate records, and other administrative management. This is vital information for staying on the right side of the IRS, and it's very helpful to have it all gathered in one reference guide.For my purposes, I didn't find a lot of new information here. This guide seems best for those completely new to contract management or start-up business concerns. For those, this could be a very important part of their reference library, especially to help educate them before any (expensive!) meetings with their legal and tax professionals. As such, it's money well invested in a start-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nolo delivers again","review":"I was fortunate to receive a review copy of this book from Nolo. I've been in business for myself before (on a very small scale) so I know just enough to recognize that this book breaks down all the necessary info in an accessible way. Although I was familiar with many of the ideas & laws, I found that this book clarified details & concepts that I had not thoroughly understood before -- such as some of the finer points of home office deductions. The insurance section is very helpful as well. I have not finished reading the whole book -- references like this are not designed to be read cover to cover like a novel, at least not in my experience! -- but what I have read, together with my previous experience with other Nolo books, gives me confidence that the rest of it will be just as informative.My only quibble is that I wish the book design could be less dull. Reference books don't have to look boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resourse guide.","review":"I bought this as a gift for my daughter-in-law who is starting a small business, she liked it very much.I have also gotten some great ideas for myself.

Not everyone who goes into business is good at record keeping, taxes, and the organization that can save you so much time and money.This useful book lays it all out--clearly and with necessary detail--including a Contract Agreement/Amendment form and a Disclosure form. There are also some samples for figuring out important issues related to your workers, as well as the ever-looming IRS agenda.The large format (8 1/2 x 11) is much appreciated as the content is clearly laid out in two easily readable columns per page, with type that does not strain the eyes. This makes it easy to follow and use the examples--something especially important given the exhaustive use of tax information and explanations.Here, it is readable and manageable and Fishman does an excellent job of making complex (and tedious) financial information and partnership/employment details easy to follow and easy to do. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent information for people on the go","review":"\\"Working for Yourself\\" provides you with answers to all of your basic questions regarding starting your own business. It is not a substitute for discussing things with accountants or lawyers, but it provides you with all of the basic knowledge you need to make the proper decisions and will make those discussions more fruitful (and cheaper). Because the book covers all of the different aspects of your independent business, it also can serve as a great reference book in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Text","review":"This is a great book for anyone with any interest in being self-employed.

The whole time while its heating up, the pot/pan will be heated ONlY in the center, leaving a gap about 1/8 inch untouch to the surface.

This book I would highly recommend to everyone whether you are a singer a Choral Director or a voice teacher you can really learn from this book on how to sing and also how to warm up your choir.

If you've heard their first single 'Out of My Heart', you can tell the whole CD is going to be good too! BBMak has changed their music just a tad bit, but more pop-rockish!! A lot of upbeat songs, and a few slow ones. Each BBMaker has their own singing parts in the songs, sounds really good harmonize-wise! BBMak has done a great job writing ALL of the songs!!! If you LOVED \\"Sooner or Later\\", you'll love \\"Into Your Head\\"!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This is one of the best albums i've heard.

AGAIN!!!","review":"in my opinion, BBMak hasn't written or sung a bad song on either of their CDs. all of their songs r catchy and TOTALLY KICK (...)_AWESOME!!! their new CD is just as good if not better than the 1st. you could play either of their CDs over and over again and never get tired of them. i strongly recommend u buy this CD and if u don't already have the 1st one... get it!!! u won't b dissapointed!!! it even has the music video 4 out of my heart which is an awesome song and the music video's even better this CD totally rox and its definatly worth while 2 buy!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply sublime!","review":"BBMak's second album, INTO YOUR HEAD, is even better than I had hoped. This talented trio showed real potential on their debut album. But here, they have transcended even their best qualities to deliver a cohesive, thoughtful package of well-written songs and fantastic harmonies. The first single, \\"Out of My Heart,\\" is pure bliss, with a soaring chorus that embraces the listener completely. The rest of the album, particularly \\"Staring Into Space,\\" is just as strong. INTO YOUR HEAD proves what we BBMak fans have known all along -- that this is a band, first and foremost, and a darn good one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add this to your collection","review":"For months, I looked forward to owning BBMak's CD, \\"Into Your Head.\\" I was not the least bit disappointed when I finally picked it up. The song, \\"Staring into Space\\" made me feel like I went through a time warp to a beach in the 1950's with Annette Funicello. Also, the track, \\"Sympathy,\\" is an incredibly beautiful symphony. All the tracks on this CD are well worth listening to in their entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly recommended album!","review":"Are you looking for great music from a very talented band? Look no further than \\"Into Your Head,\\" BBMak's sophomore release. It is the must-have CD of the year! Filled with infectious, catchy tunes, the album consists of a mix of uptempos and ballads that are a combination of pop and rock. The lads from England have certainly outdone themselves this time. My choice picks from this album include \\"Run Away,\\" \\"Staring into Space,\\" \\"After All is Said and Done,\\" \\"She's Everything,\\" and \\"The Beginning.\\" This album is filled with so many solid, strong tracks, that it's hard to pick just one or two favorites, as you can tell from my aforementioned selections.If you don't already have \\"Into Your Head,\\" I suggest you go out and pick up a copy right now! It's well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was pleasantly surprised!!=0)","review":"I love this album!! It is amazing from start to finish!! Absolutely no filler here! It differs from the boy bands because the music is a lot more guitar driven and some of the songs have a 70's feel to them (\\"Staring Into Space\\", \\"I Still Believe\\"). Especially \\"Staring Into Space\\"! It sounds like it belongs on \\"That 70's Show\\", which is my favorite T.V. show! The rest of the tracks have a soft alternative rock sound! Not too poppy, but not so much screaming rock music either! If you're looking for a CD with something a little more meaningful for a change, then this is a good choice!! Push aside everything anyone's told you about these guys being \\"just another boy band\\". Just keep an open mind and I promise you, you will also be pleasantly surprised by this album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Man-Band\\"","review":"The sophmore album of the trio proves that they are anything but your everyday boy band. Young, good-looking faces on the album cover might trick people into thinking that these \\"boys\\" are just another *N Sync or Backstreet Boy prototype, but don't be fooled by their innocent look. These boys are anything but your typical boy band. They play their own instruments, write their own music, and even sing and play live at their concerts.Songs such as \\"Staring Into Space\\", \\"Out of Reach\\" and their hit single \\"Out of my Heart\\" prove that this is no pop show. Strong vocals and lyrics are accompanied by electric guitar solos and slides. Each and every song, regardless of the pace of the song, is jam packed with guitars and give off the rock vibe. Even songs like \\"Sympathy\\" and \\"I Still Believe\\" give a new meaning to Pop/Rock.These guys are anything but a boy band. If anything, they are a man band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brit boys back","review":"Into Your Head is the follow up to the globally successful debut from the British trio.BBMak have headed for a more \\"rockier\\" sound with their second album, but yet still managing to capture the amazing haunting vocals and lyrics previously heard.The album opens with the first single to be released \\"Out Of My Heart (Into Your Head)\\", this is a catchy, uplifting melodic tune which would be more apt if it had been released during the summer.The second single \\"Staring Into Space\\" was co-written with the hugely talented Guy Chambers (former writer with Robbie Williams), this again is an upbeat tune, with a great guitar rift. The song in essence, could be compared to hits by The Beatles due to its retro feel.The rest of the tracks on the album are less uplifting, and the trio head for a more emotional sound.The track Sympathy is a heart-rending track with haunting vocals from Mark Barry.BBMak are back and look set for critical acclaim and success with this amazing album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As Last","review":"Please don't take this the wrong way, I'm not dissing bbmak or anything, this is just constructive criticism!I have Sooner or Later and I thought it was excellent, and Out of My Heart sounded great too, so I got the CD. It wasn't what I expected to say the least. On most of the songs the music was so loud that you couldn't even hear what the guys are singing, and the songs all sounded basically the same. I think they've gone more acoustic with this album, if that's the correct word. They're probably changing their sound from pop to a beatles like thing, in which case Out of My Heart sound out of place as the only poppy song on the album, and you'd wonder why they released that as the first single if they didn't want to market themselves as a pop group. Also, Into Your Head's missing all those great ballads, like the Ghost of You and Me. And the album's pretty short too.In short, buy the first album, don't buy this! ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but too wide ranging and not detailed enough","review":"The book claims to be a comprehensive guide to writing test items in several areas. It covers a diverse range of test items, from multiple choice questions to setting and scoring student portfolios. What it says is interesting, but it covers too wide a ground to be able to be comprehensive with its 260 pages in any one area, and ends up being useful as an introduction, but not too useful as a comprehensive resource.For example, it has 22 pages on statistical analysis on item responses, which is enough to whet the appetite, but not enough to answer all or even most of one's questions. I also found the layout and style slightly confusing.It's not a bad book, but it's not really clear what the book's purpose is.

The book is well written and evokes lovely images of place and time. However, the story is awful, and put me in a bad mood for the entire day. **SPOILER ALERT** The beginning of the story is fine, but in the end, the family completely abandons the old man, leaving him to live with strangers. They never go back to visit, not even after Grandma dies and Grandpa writes to say he's all alone, doesn't know what to do, and wishes he'd died too. They don't keep in touch, and a few short years later, their son has all but forgotten his grandfather.

The new ultra high resolution transfer is simply glorious in every sense of the word. The picture is so crisp and clear with beautiful bold colors, you'd swear the picture was made yesterday. Even with the modern filming technology we have today, you still can't beat the old 3-strip Technicolor process in the quality and depth of the color. The monaural soundtrack has been very beautifully cleaned up for this release -- no distortion whatsoever (a problem that the most recent VHS release--at least my copy of it--was plagued with). There are many extras in this set, something for everyone. Let's hope the EASTER PARADE DVD set, due out sometime in 2005, is just as glorious.It is a SIN to not have this in your collection.

I already own the Two-Disc Edition of this movie, an upgrade to my previous copy which is packed with extras. So what excuse can be offered for the failure to include them on the blu ray. Unlike my shelves, it is not so limited in space, so that's not the problem. It can't be the cost of producing them since it's just a question of including all those from the previous release.

Pilotepisode with Celeste Holm, Tab Hunter).Fazit: Its a must have it!!!P.S: I would sell my old dvd but can't because I got it signed by Margaret O'Brien ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful and enjoyable film for the entire family!","review":"I highly recommend this film.

Being a Judy fan from way back I just knew that Warner Brothers would do a bang up job and they did with this musical. I has been completly restored with all the vibrante colors back in the dvd. I had the vhs version and it was pretty washed out. The special features on disc 2 are outstanding. Although they could have had more trailers on the disc but thats ok. This movie will always be a timeless classic!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"audio dropouts","review":"Like some other reviewers I encountered a problem with audio dropouts. These dropouts occur during most of the songs, such that the soloist singers are not audible. The problem is due to the operation of the Blu-ray player: mine is a Samsung BD-P3600. I found that the problem seems to be related to the digital conversion from bitstream to PCM. When I reconfigured the player to use the Bitstream (audiophile) digital output rather than PCM the dropout problem was solved. Note that this solution requires one to use a receiver that that can decode DTS-HD Master Audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"We love older musicals in our home.

He has torn a lot of it up, but that was half the fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond expectations","review":"Besides the fact that Emmanuel was enjoying a time then when everything he touched became gold, there also was a puertorrican composer & producer named Glenn Monroig, son of crooner Gilberto Monroig, who had something to show. They got together in this album and created what I believe it to be his best work. Listen to the style change that Emmanuel tries here and enjoy the freedom that Glenn encourages. You will love the latin beats, and the jazzy balads. This is an album that you could play and people will ask you: Is that Emmanuel's new work? It transcends time. Buy it with confidence, it won't let you down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy. Has expired codes.","review":"Don't buy these cards! NCSoft has marked these cards as expired despite the claim that any NCSoft time card can be used to add time to any NCSoft game.

I suggest to be careful about older NCSoft time cards as well, since those may be expired too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Recording","review":"The quality of the recording is poor. You can hear flutter in the string passages, which is 90% of Mantovani's music! There is also hiss noise, and pops in piece transitions... Amateur transcription from tape to CD's, is my guess. Someone else made bad reviews regarding the poor recording on the same record label, so my suggestion is to stay away from the label Madacy Records."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best of the Mantovani Orchestra (vol 1 & 2)","review":"The Madacy Label has betrayed Mantovani's genious, and substituted poor recordings in these 2 CD's.

The combination of older standards with \\"newer\\" (such as Stevie Wonder's \\"For Once In My Life\\")is great. This is the stuff that is usually mocked as \\"elevator music\\" but also considered by many good romancing background music. Many of these arrangements were heard on a local Beautiful Music FM station where I live before the format change. The only negative I have is for a \\"box set\\" there is no write-up on the Orchestra. It would have been nice to read about Mantovani and what inspired his arrangements, and the orchestra personnell. My copy was made in Canada by Madacy. Maybe someone who has contact with that company could recommend a booklet for any future copies made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat lacking","review":"I found this documentary lacking in a number of ways. While I would not describe it in any way as propaganda, it's really just a video about what Unarius's believes, teaches, and some of their history. There is little to no discussion about faith or how the organization has coped with it's failed prophecies or other demonstrably false claims that have been made. The description of this film says it is \\"a sympathetic look at faith and how people justify it in different ways\\", however, I found no exploration of how people justify faith in the eccentric beliefs taught by Unarius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy Hatvany is becoming one of my favorites!","review":"Great story.

I like the fragrance. The top note of citrus, Bergamot and neuroline are pleasant but that is where the story ends. The Heart and the base note does not seem to exist. The perfume does not have a lasting power. After a couple of hours the fragrance is gone, at least for me. I was expecting a lot more from this perfume in terms of its staying power. Where are the sandalwood, tonka bean base notes ? Did they forget to add it to the batch that I purchased ??

As a director for the stage I have long envied the resources available to playwrights, actors and others working in the theatre. There is little practical help/advice/guidance out there for directors. Well, not anymore. This book is a wealth of information on training programs (professional and academic), how to start your own company, and the in's and out's of New York's scene, and the regional theatre world. The only drawback to this book, I would say, is that there is comparatively little information for choreographers. As a director, though, I found it extremely informative, and recommend it highly. Thanks to the hard work of those who put this useful guide together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality and perfect for every day carry.","review":"First off I am left handed and this is not set up for a lefty but do no let that stop you from purchasing. I have found that the knife works well for a rapid open in the left pocket. It will take a little practice but worth the time. I am a repeat Cold Steel owner and this may be my favorite one yet. The SNAP of the lock and the ultra sharp point makes a very clear statement that this is a weapon not a tool. It work well as a tool and is okay for every day carry but to be clear you are buying a weapon designed for a very clear purpose .Small enough to carry in all types of clothing.Light enough to be comfortableSharp edge and secure locking systemQuick deploy from pocket or handIt is a good primary or secondary weapon to carry daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, well-balanced, well-made knife","review":"What a great looking knife...not very versatile, but perfect for a daily legal carry that has some actual use in self-defense.I have been carrying this knife daily for a few months now. It is easy to open, sharp, and simple to use. The tri-lock safety system is not as difficult to close as some prior reviews had indicated.My only gripe would be the sharp, serrated edges on the pocket-deploy thumb-studs (manufacturer calls this a \\"quillon\\"). Every pair of pants I have worn now have holes in the pockets where the thumb-studs have cut the pocket lining repeatedly. If the thumb-studs were more polished and the edges rounded a bit, they might be less of an issue. On the other hand, rounding the edges on the thumb-stud might decrease its likelihood of opening when you catch a thumb-stud on your pocket, which is counterproductive...Paid less than $40 from Amazon new.

Yes, I have accidentally cut myself with the knife before, and 1 time, the knife got caught halfway as I was opening it and it cut my thumb. I did have to take it apart and oil it a little, but besides that, it's a great quality knife able to protect you if needed, though if it's protection you want, you probably want something with a better reach like the 6 inch Ti Lite.

I was excited to receive it, but that faded quickly as I checked it out. It doesn't really open all that easily as advertised. The tang that is supposed to catch on the corner your pocket for quick opening is so sharp and edgy that it will rip the corner of your pockets apart in no time. Even using the tang with your finger or thumb is edgy to the touch. One thing I will say though is that it arrived very sharp and the blade appears to be of high quality...although with a significant amount of wiggle. There is no way this knife is worth the $70 retail price. With the $40-ish cost from Amazon...you decide. I decided to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tactical Knife","review":"The knife in 4\\" version is just right for concealed carry, and it comes razor sharp.

Locks up quick and tight. I was impressed, the knife was on sale for $39.00 when I bought it. True value for the quality of the product. I would buy another and recommend to a friend.

I suspect that is because they were written before that movie came out. The recording date for these performances by the Polish National Radio Symphony, under Antoni Wit, is listed as 1997. And the date of this release on the Marco Polo label is 2003.What's more remarkable, though, is that this very same set of wonderful performances is about to come out at budget price on Marco Polo's sister label, Naxos. If you're at all interested in buying this one I'd strongly suggest you wait for the Naxos release--it's listed here at Amazon as only a few days away from the date of this note--and save yourself some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there a second dvd?","review":"I loved this series but is there a continuation?

No where in the ads that I read on their site at the time told what system this could be used in therefore I ordered it only to find out my system wouldn't handle it and parts were missing from it and the box had been opened and the bar code cut out and taped back on. I wrote and asked could they just send the missing parts and I would give the unit away, they told me to return it. You have to pay return shipping when it is their error and they also charged a re-stocking fee so this product that I couldn't use cost an additional $18. If you want to try it, don't order it from TD and be sure to check the system requirements as it takes a powerful machine to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned","review":"I recently purchased this product.

Yesterday, I just went to a backup burner and kept working; if I had NEEDED to get the job done, and I had not previously developed a strategy of always keeping a backup device handy, I'd have been in a seething, hair-pulling rage.

She informs and teaches with delightful wit and an elegant style. Most importantly, she asks the questions we ought to ask ourselves about color, but are too uninformed to know how to, even better; she gives us smart, intelligent, useful answers. What a package! Where else do you get the Questions and the Answers in Life, or in this case, in color?Brava, Leatrice. Thank you again for giving us all a wonderful tool.

If you are careful when assembling it, it will be fine - just be careful or you could break some small delicate parts.The bottom of mine is not perfectly flat, and has some wobble to it - not much, just a bit.

A collection of virtually unknown guitarists (except Vai and Freedman) that are literally all copying what Jason Becker did (and many others) in the eighties did a long, long time ago. There is only so much you can get from sweeping arpeggios and speed picking before the listener gets bored. One track on this CD by Daniele Liverani is embarrassing. To speak about Jason as being some kind of guitar god on this style of play is an incredibly stupid statement. To sum up, Steve Vai is the only original musician performing on this record and his track is fantastic. As for most of the other players, they all seem to sound like they are copying each other, and I couldn't see any of them being big on their own, as there is absolutely nothing original about their styles of play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing mind blowing on this.","review":"I have listened to this CD 3 times now and cannot find anything different to it to what I have heard in the past.

In addition, we continue to learn more about the beings which inhabit the galaxy \\"long ago and far away\\". I agree with the reviewer from New Orleans that a couple of parts of the story rush a bit, but suspect that publishing constraints may have been a factor here. I am looking forward to the next two volumes!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be disappointed!","review":"Having read the first two books in this series, I anxiously awaited the release of the third title and once I had found it and read it, I certainly wasn't disappointed. This story flows right from the Dark Rival which is second in the series and still maintains the continuity of the characters. Again it is well paced and keeps you eagerly turning the page even if you are 36 and not 9 years old. It was especially enjoyable to see glimpses of Qui Gon's humor in this one. He certainly keeps his apprentice guessing. There's also a poignant chapter in which Obi Wan is held captive and faces the rather cruel fate of having his memory erased. He tries to be so brave and remember everything important in his life. Meanwhile, Qui Gon, not being able to free him suffers right along with him. Don't pass up this series because of its age recommendation. I can't stress that enough!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Age group? What age group?","review":"This book is literally amazing. Jedi Apprentice and Dark Rival were great, but this book really outdoes itself. The plot was fairly original, which is more than I can say for certain \\"Adult\\" Star Wars authors. I wish we could have seen more into Qui-Gon's thoughts when he was afraid that Obi-Wan would lose his memory, though. Maybe then he wouldn't seem like such an icicle. But the description of the memories was great, and it really gave you an insight into Obi-Wan's past.Note to certain dissatisfied readers: There IS a reason Qui-Gon is so distant from Obi-Wan. Remember *Dark Rival*? A guy named Xanatos? Qui-Gon let himself care about the kid, and basically got his fingers burned. After all that, who WOULDN'T wait a little while before trying it again? It makes perfect sense to me, but them I *AM* a teenager, and therefore I know everything in the world. ;)May the Force be with y'all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best in the series, but far from disappointing","review":"Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan continue their adventures together in Jude Watson's second installment in the Jedi Apprentice series, this time as Master and Padawan. They must overcome dangerous odds and face off against a ruthless and powerful faction in total control of a planet. Obi-Wan really shows special talents in this title, and it is yet another interesting look into the bond between Jedi, especially at this critical early stage in the relationship.Unfortunately, however, this book just seemed to lack the uniqueness of the others. It is exciting, but almost all the other books contain life-changing or crucially important events for the Jedi. This seems like just another mission. It does leave you wanting to read The Mark of the Crown, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cool","review":"Woah, was this book neat! I loved every minute of it.

It was purchased September 8, 2009.Currently, my wife is complaining that the vacuum is not providing enough suction to pick up the dirt. The bag in the back was emptied so we know that's not the problem. Time is going to be spent trying to figure out what's wrong with it, and it may be finished das far as I know.My impression of the vacuum over time hasn't been that great. It performed rather poorly on hardwood flooring from the start, and I can't say I was overly impressed on carpet. It's clunky to move around, and when the bag approaches full it tends to tip over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka Vacuum Cleaner Review","review":"I bought this vacuum because I had bought a similar Montgomery Wards vacuum cleaner (made by Eureka) over 40 years ago which just gave out.I like the new vacuum because it is lighter than the old one. It seems to do a fine job on carpet.I'm not so fond of some features: it only has one speed instead of two, which means that it is too powerful for throw rugs. Changing the height didn't seem to help. That may become less of a problem as the bag gets full.Also, the cord now comes off the bottom of the vaccum, while it used to come off the top. It is in the way more with the new configuration.My old attachments don't work either because the method of attaching them has changed.But for the price I think it is a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does a great job on my carpets!","review":"I am very happy with this vac, as it gets my carpets really clean and it is lightweight enough that it doesn't provoke my grumpy back.

Nonetheless, I'm totally happy with the vac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay no attention to the picture","review":"As has already been stated, the photograph for this item is incorrect.

The best part of it is, though, that it is written by the Pythons themselves. This is no second hand fan book, it is THE comprehensive reference to one of the century's funniest comedy troupes. I was a bit skeptical that The Pythons might just be a cash-in by the Python gang, but I was wrong. The book is beautiful and complete.As a fan, I was delighted to see that The Pythons included recaps of my favorite bits, while also giving me the background story behind them. Reading what John Cleese has to say about coming up with the dead parrot sketch is almost funnier than the sketch itself.For casual fans, The Pythons is an amazing starting point and for die-hards the pictures (it's LOADED with them) and the behind the scenes access makes this a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"After a short time with this tome...","review":"...I can already tell you it's amazing and worth every penny.As a lifelong fan of Python, I know the skits, have read the scripts, seen the flicks, watched the specials.But this book brings so much never-before-seen, heard, or read information that any true fan of the boys will practically cry with happiness.However, as another reviewer said, this is NOT a \\"Monty Python Book\\" per se, full of skits or songs. It's a book about the boys: growing up, meeting each other, and being Python.But this doesn't mean it's not highly entertaining! Just the jacket notes had me laughing out loud. There are plenty of serious moments but they are rendered with the remarkable wit of very funny people. Even the sort of bits that should be dull in a biography are worthwhile and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The audio book is wonderful!","review":"I listened to this audio book this week & found it to be very enjoyable.

When I opened up the package and did a quick look-over of the book, I almost passed out with joy. There have been *many* Python books that are good or OK, but this is just fabulous. The information is right out of the mouths of the Pythons (much like \\"Monty Python Speaks,\\" but to an even greater extent). The pictures are new (to most people) and beautiful. It is obvious that somebody took enormous pride in the making of this book.Other than the GARGANTUAN size of the book, there is nothing negative I can say.

Always making a gallant effort to complete any book I'm reading, I was relieved to finally reach the end of the book and say goodbye to the superficial characters contained within."},{"rating":"1","title":"high hopes for an insipid book","review":"When you finish a book hating every single character, you know you wasted precious time. This book came highly recommended by a friend who usually steers me in the right direction with book choices, so I came in expecting something well worth reading. This book is not worth the time or money. It is so off the mark in every conceivable respect. I can't think of one redeemable characteristic, it is that bad. Actually, I only kept reading because I expected there must be something that makes it worthwhile at the end. Far from it. The end was the biggest let down of all, and that's saying a lot considering how poorly done the rest is. This should have been a good book, even a great book. I don't understand how an editor would let this book go to publication without more revision. Tom Wolfe, you need a better editor, one who can help you build on a premise and flush out full-bodied characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...This was really bad","review":"I can't even believe that this obtuse load of garbage came from Tom Wolfe. I generally love his work, but this...this was so verbose, so overbearing, so self-involved that it was pretty much unreadable. So bad. His characters are caricatures, and he belabors every single point that the book is trying to make. Pages and pages to make me understand that our heroine is poor and her roommate is rich. Pages to let me know there is racial tension on college teams. (Wow!) Just awful.And, as other readers have noted, Wolfe seems to be too far out of touch with the universities of today to be able to write anything meaningful about them. Classes are dumbed-down for jocks. (Incredible!) College is a breeding ground for binge drinkers. (Shocking!) Kids have sex in their room. (Scandalous!) None of this is news, nor is it particularly interesting. Certainly not interesting enough to merit 600+ pages.Don't waste your time with this terrible read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, and at times just plain boring","review":"AS I was reading this book, I kept wondering where the editor was. Didn't anybody edit the thing?!? It was way too long for what it had to say, which was ... well, I couldn't tell exactly what it was the novel was trying to say. At the beginning, Charlotte is a naive savant virgin who desperately wants to fit in -- and by that, I mean she is consumed with what others think of her and her desire to have a boyfriend. At the end, Charlotte is a somewhat less naive, somewhat less savant re-virgin who still desperately wants to fit in, and is consumed by what others think of her and her desire to have a boyfriend. Personally, I didn't see much growth in her over the course of the book.I guess if you like to read the word f*ck a lot (and by that, I mean A LOT), you might like this book. But if you think it's reflective of actual college life, you'd be sadly mistaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry as heck this didn't turn out better","review":"I have long been a fan of Tom Wolfe's writings--though I have always preferred his non-fiction to his fiction. This novel, however, falls off a cliff. I'm cringing having just tried to read all of it. I was initially impressed that he, a 74 year old, would tackle contemporary college life, but having read this vapid, sad and very, very long tale, I'm feeling that perhaps he wouldn't have written this had a had a few more editors and assistants at his side saying \\"Don't!\\" or \\"No!\\" or some such thing that editors and assistants do before they become utter sychophants. This novel is Wolfe's Russian Offensive, his \\"EYES WIDE SHUT,\\" his OVER THE RIVER AND INTO THE TREES, his GODFATHER 3 or whatever other embarrasing thing that comes out of the creative energy of a talented man who no longer has anything or anybody around him with which to do a reality check. Well, Mr. Wolfe, the reviews and sales are going to be your reality check, alas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"Although there are bits in this novel that are very funny, it is a chore to read. The satire is so overblown that it gets ludicrous and tiresome, and the characters, who never become anything more than plot devices, are so shallow that it's impossible to care what happens to any of them. Tom Wolfe has written some great novels, but this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your valuable time","review":"A friend lent me this book and I decided to read the online reviews before devoting myself to the almost 700 pages. Since the reviews were quite mixed, I wanted to see for myself. It started off with well and the characters of Charlotte, Adam, JoJo and Hoyt were well developed. I enjoyed the first 1/3 of the book. but by the end, I could barely stand to read another word. This book could certainly be cut in half and it wouldn't lose a thing. The biggest disappointment was that after all Charlotte went through to belong to the \\"popular\\" crowd, she didn't learn one darn thing. At the end, she sat at the table with JoJo hoping to be noticed by the popular girls. She sat at the basketball stadium looking around to see if people noticed that she was JoJo's girlfriend. What a sad, sad way to portray an intelligent young woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEED TO KNOW FACTS!!!!!","review":"I realize that this book is ment to be fiction, however for someone who supposedly did a lot of research I find this book far from the truth. I am from Sparta, North Carolina, hardly an impoverish town. It is not the biggest town true. I went to a major university and am now in professional school. There are, I dare to say, no nieve country bumpkins from this beautiful town then this book would make you believe. Us university girls from Sparta are hardly out there for sex and a Mrs. degree. Maybe Mr. Wolfe would like to actually visit our town and see if he changes his mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tedious Cliche","review":"I guess this is meant to be a portrait of current campus life but I found it to be a thin cliche of situations and personalities one might find on the quad. Charlotte the overachiever country girl set adrift on an adventure she is ill prepared to take. Beverly, her all too sophisticated roommate who only gives Charlotte more grief than she can bare. Jojo, the athlete stereotype that gets turned around to greater things. Hoyte Thorp, a legendary BMOC and the easily predictable relationship with Charotte. Adam, the archtype nerd also figures in this going nowhere story of campus life. As if the story needed to be worse it is over full of the campus patois which is most distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save a tree, don't buy this book.","review":"Tom Wolfe is a talented writer. But why he has to subject us to 650 pages of profanity is beyond me. He must have used the F-word at least 3-5 times per page. Save a tree and your money. Do not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"75 year old man attempt about a college his daughter went to","review":"Crisp writing is the only positive remark I can make about this book. 75 year old men should lay off trying to write books that are blatantly insulting against a particular school that they have never attended and honestly know nothing about. I'm a student at the school and this book is a horrible and wrong representation of our university. Write about something you can actually relate to at some level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devils must die","review":"Tom Wolfe is a devil (AKA a fat white conservative bastard). Now, what can you do with devils? It's quite simple - you can take those devil-made guns that they put into our hands and turn their barrels upon them. The only good devils are the ones six feet under."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This was a very entertaining and fun book, and I enjoyed reading every page of it. I felt like it portrayed college life relatively realistically, and I was able to identify with each unique character. When I finished the book my only disappointment with it was that it wasn't longer. I would love to read a sequel to it. Thanks for a great book Mr. Wolfe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No, He's Not","review":"Very disappointing writing from an author whose previous work I enjoyed and admired. My overall impression is that no one actually edited this book: most of the scenes and descriptions go on and on and on, sometimes repeating phrases verbatim (\\"traps, delts, pecs, lats...\\"); there are also several places where abrupt changes in subject in the same paragraph simply don't track. [Maybe Wolfe is of such a stature that he doesn't need an editor, the same way that the title of his book doesn't need to appear on the cover.] Wolfe also seems not to get quite right the mindsets and motivations of many of his characters, many of whom are 1-dimensional parodies of their prototypes, seeming, mostly, just overwraught. To me, this book feels as if it were an experiement in \\"can I write about people from social milleaus I don't know and situations I haven't personally experienced?\\" I'd say, not convincingly. The book feels long, long-winded, unconvincing, and only intermittently pleasurable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wolfe in Charlotte's Clothing","review":"I have not read Mr. Wolfe in years as I am not a fan of most popular fiction. I have read some of the Snicketts collection thanks to my children and I find that Mr. Wolfe has simply re-written \\" a series of unfortunate events\\" and presented them via a cast of far less credible charactors.My interest in Ms. Simmons started to flag at about the halfway mark and the rest was pure drudgery. The highlight of the entire near 600 page effort can be summed up in three words,only two of which I will include so as to retain some sense of suspence: eleemosynary and hypnopomic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Overdrawn","review":"I just finished reading this book and I could not wait for it to be over. Several times I was going to give up but had to finish to see how it ended. I skipped over many pages due to the long drawn out writing that I found simply uninteresting. Charlotte Simmons is far from the ordinary college student. While I agree that Tom Wolfe did get some views of college life correctly, I don't believe he purveyed it in the correct light. If you want to be truly bored and read a book that lacks interest, this is the book for you. Lots of drama but really no plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad old Tom Wolfe","review":"This book was such a pathetic attempt to be hip, to write about life on the campus today. All of Wolfe's characters are shallow stereotypes. And does he think we need to have the many ways the f word is used explained to us? Where has he been? Does he think we live in a vacuum? His self-satisfaction at describing it as f-patois is only made worse when he uses the word \\"schadenfreude\\" over and over again. And again. And naming all the muscles the athletes work at developing, ad naseum.... The book is like a cartoon that has been written down, tediously.If it hadn't been my book club's pick, I never would have finished it.reader in Sewickley PA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an Editor","review":"An exploration of the college years, that difficult period between adolescence and adulthood, should provide an interesting read in the hands of an established author. However Wolfe's stereotyped characters lack depth and often don't ring true. The writing is is lazy and repetitive; some sections read like a rough draft. Too bad no editor had the nerve to tell Wolfe that revisions might have been useful for character and plot development. I was left with the feeling that I'd been dragged through a marathon frat party by several whiney, self-absorbed sock puppets. Also Mr. Wolfe's incessant fixation on a spot several inches below those endlessly exposed navels which he devotes so many pages to, leaves the creepy impression that Wolfe enjoyed himself way too much doing voyeristic research for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Wolfe by a wide margin","review":"There are books where the author takes on the persona of the teen protagonist--Salinger of course, but more recently Tom Perrotta's JOE COLLEGE and Curtis Sittenfeld's PREP come to mind. Then there are books that sound like a 70-year-old man pretending he remotely has a clue about the culture and social norms of today's teens. I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS is most definitely the latter.The latest by Tom Wolfe misses the mark in almost every conceivable way. He doesn't know how today's kids talk, act or interact with their peers. It's one of the more disappointing novels I've read in 5-6 years. If Wolfe's name isn't attached to it, this manuscript doesn't see the light of day."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Mark","review":"For many of you who think Tom Wolfe was hugely \\"over the top\\" in his saga of Charlotte Simmons, I can assure you he was more on than off the mark. My own perceptions of campus life come from the rough naratives submitted by my freshman comp students. A few weeks ago I came across a student text that could have been lifted right out of Wolfe's novel. It was replete with the same drunken campus scene with its nudity, pink vomit, and loud cheering - was Hoyt waiting behind the door? Campus talk is crude and the jocks rule. And as Wolfe so carefully observed, students all have cell phones glued to their ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too late","review":"I read this book with no expectations at all. I'm not a huge fan of Wolfe's work in general, but I was pleasantly surprised. It held my attention, it was exciting, I cared for Charlotte, BUT... He's about ten years too late in his expose of campus life. Tom Wolfe went on the Daily Show discussing how wild and crazy campus life is nowadays, when, in fact hasn't changed AT ALL (according to THIS book, at least) since I was in uni, which was a while ago. I found it well written, but dated. It was exactly what an old man might observe once he actually decided to pay attention to the here and now."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only Book I Have Ever Give Up On","review":"The central premise is wholly naive: We are meant to believe Charlotte Simmons is a complete innocent (simply because she comes from a small town - what, it doesn't receive MTV?) and that she is exposed - for the very first time - to the morals of her generation at large when she attends university. I found her moral superiority both annoying and unbelievable. I gave up on this book halfway through mainly because it read like an elder trying too hard to be hip, trying too hard to make a point about a generation he doesn't understand, and shouldn't be writing about. The end result is patronising. I'm not saying Tom Wolfe isn't a masterful writer, but he should remember that old saying: write what you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I am Charlotte Simmons\\" deserves a D+","review":"Like many of the other reviewers I am a Tom Wolfe fan. I was especially excited to read this book after seeing his interview on the Daily Show with John Stewart. What a let down!The characters are way too stereotyped and contrived. Charlotte herself is a naive snob and in no ways redeems herself in the book and I think causes all of her own drama. Even at the end of the book, she remains a snob and pratically gets off on the Dean of the DuPont and other \\"VIPs\\" noticing and staring at her.I graduated from undergraduate 3 years ago and I am currently a graduate student. I found very, very little of Tom Wolfe's DuPont in either of my higher ed experiences.Though I do disagree with another reviewer that suggested that Harvard, Yale and Stanford students are not preoccupied with hard bodies and drinking. All colleges have students that obsess over these things. Get your head out of the sand."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK! Great! So What!","review":"Tom Wolfe has done something special here, and something lots of people don't like. He has ambitiously tried to write in the voice of an 18 yr. old female escapee from the set of the Beverly Hill Billies to the Iviest Ivy college that never existed. He's been criticized for getting things wrong(because they're wrong), for stating things that are right (because they're trite or banal).My main reaction was delight that I was not educated in the U.S. and the hope that some readers will take his message of the corruption of the US college experience - socially, academically and philosophically to heart and try to remember why they thought they needed to go to college to begin with.P.S. the things Wolfe was always good at: regionalism, self-delusion of all types and pin-pointing 'the problem', are done superlatively well here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hide Your Daughter!","review":"Set at the fictional equivalent of Duke University (or Stanford or Michigan, per the notes above), Wolfe's latest novel tells the story of a brilliant freshman from rural North Carolina trying to deal with the alien world of a big-time (academically, athletically, socially, sexually and economically) university. \\"Hide your daughters!\\" seems to be the primary message. Wolfe works hard to get the college lingo and lifestyle right. Carried by Wolfe's style, I breezed through this one quickly, but all I could think along the way was \\"Hide your (my) daughter!\\" I'll leave it to the reader to find out what happens to Charlotte."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Far Cry from Before","review":"Let me first say that Tom Wolfe is one of the greatest living writers in the world. I love his stuff.This book, though, was bad- really bad.There's been a secret to Wolfe's success- he's shown us a world we knew little about or didn't even know existed. Early space, bond trading...these were interesting and foreign to most people. A book about college is not. If the big bang of a novel is that college students do nothing but drinking and sex, you've got a problem. Everybody knows this about college life, and they don't need 500 pages to find out about it, either.The plot is also disappointing. Several interesting sides of the story, like the one about the Republican governor of California's acts at the college, were not explored enough. In fact, this issue resolved/ended itself so quickly that you almost get the impression Wolfe just wanted to finish the darn thing.Well, so did I. I was pretty happy to be done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"College students view","review":"I found the book to be amazing, but this may be because I am experiencing the very things Charlotte Simmons is reading. I can understand how a different demographic might enjoy the books less, but this is a must read for the 18-25 set."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Grotesque Caricature","review":"Tom Wolfe clearly has not been to college in the last 50 years, because his portrait of college life is so vastly overblown and beleaguered with every stereotype assigned to today's world of higher education that the story itself is completely lost. There is little that is original or even interesting is his truly one-dimensional novel about a girl who can only be characterized as the single most nave college student on the planet, complemented by every jock and frat boy stereotype that exists in nature. I happen to be familiar with the university this novel is based on and I can say that he appears not to have really delved fully into his research in regard to what college life is like there. I feel a more realistic and not so oversexed and oversimplified novel could have been a successful book. But this just reeks of an old man outside his generation grasping at what he thinks people want to read about college life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible story","review":"Wolfe takes on American elite Universities and the book has some good parts about the excesses of athletics, intellectual and social pretentiousness, etc but the characters and situations are such gross caricatures of anything I have seen on a campus that the satire looses its power. The evolution of the central character seems quite unlikely and I lost interest halfway through the story. I forced myself to keep reading, hoping that Wolfe would come up with an interesting twist in the story but the end was even weaker than the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am (a) Tom Wolfe Fan . . . But","review":"I loved \\"The Right Stuff\\" and \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\". I liked \\"A Man in Full\\". I thought \\"Charlotte\\" was a very watered down version of characters already played out in previous novels. I also got very tired of the cynical point of view of the narrator. Every character is VERY self centered. Any minor character that is a good person, is made into a characature to be avoided (i.e. Mom, dad, mentor, friend). I also was very aware of Mr. Wolfe's age in writing about such a Bohemian college. I was not sold on his version of college life today. In summary, I found his characters thin, his storyline boring, and the ending nothing to write about. He has written much better novels. I was very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"So shallow!","review":"I could not finish this book. As a college student, I was looking forward to reading this- I was hoping to be able to relate to characters and experience something new and fresh! However, this book was just the opposite: stale and shallow. The characters had all been done before, but this time they are just exaggerated stereotypes of what a 75 year-old man might think they would be. I kept reading, hoping the characters, who were supposed to be endearing, would expand and develop, but they continued to become more and more frustrating. Completely unrealistic and uninteresting, in my opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The novel of the decade.","review":"As I write this I have not finished reading the novel yet I can already tell that it should be the novel of the decade. When I was at Rice University in the 1970s things were not as bad as they are at Charlotte's fictional (and current) DuPont, but you could see the present day coming. Humans have difficulty achieving balance, and therefore it only stands to reason that once banality becomes acceptable it will be pursued to its logical end. \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons\\" makes it pretty clear that the logical end of our banal culture is not far off, and it makes you wonder what the aftermath will be like. \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons\\" is not just a scathing attack on collegiate culture, but on broader American culture as well (after all the super hoops players in the novel have FANS), and must rank alongside the great Billy Wilder Films \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" and \\"The Big Carnival\\" as a a cultural critique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!! Couldn't put it down!","review":"Tom Wolfe's latest novel is excellent. His cynicism and wit makes it a book that I couldn't put down. I feel like I am suffering depression now....just like Charlotte. I have spent the last week living at DuPont University and now it is over. Now what do I do? Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable- NO STARS","review":"I actually listened to this on audio CD. Do you know how many CD's it takes to get thru this mess? 25. Yes, TWENTY FIVE. Why 25 CDs??? Because Tom Wolfe loves to hear himself. You know the person at the party or in the meeting who won't shut up? The guy who drones on and on and on? That's Tom Wolfe. Tom, we got the point. Move on. PLEASE move on. I don't need to know every detail of every tree, every article of clothing, every chair in the library. To make it worse, the characters themselves are not likeable. They are whiney. They are self-centered. And there seems to be no redemption. There is just NO ONE to root for. There is no reward for listening to the 25 CD's. It's just a big pile of YUK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time","review":"Tom Wolfe lost it here. A respected author drops to his perception of an 18 year old freshman in a made-up college, sophmoric result at best. Given the substantial work the author has produced, this amounts to a career suicide attempt. Given the length and scope of his career, the attempt fails, but save your time and money and avoid the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the vicarious types","review":"Having gone to college in 70s and having three children, one just graduated from U. of Mich., I eagerly awaited the \\"eye opening\\" novel of modern college life by one of my favorite writers.What did I find; boring, verbose, uninformative novel. I am glad that college life through the eyes and research of Mr. Wolfe has been tamed since my days in college. The novel was so hard to read. One feels that the overly descriptive verbosity of Mr. Wolfe's characters dilemmas are for the sole purpose of making the book longer than need be.The novel is predictable in every sense with no suspense.My main question is why did he need to do so much research to write this garbage?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be our Tom Wolfe!!","review":"Dear Tom,Nice try, but no....This is not up to your standards and we are all very sad.Please start writing a new novel soon.

Imagine spending the bulk of a Thomas Wolfe novel describing the very unlikely pairing of a country girl and the \\"coolest\\" frat boy at the out of town prom-or drunken weekend orgy in D.C. Ok, ok, she explored life with booze and sex. These descriptions were as cliche ridden as a second rate romance novel.I'm so disappointed at Wolfe's attempts to somehow link nerds, frat boys, jocks, rich kids, and staff into a coherent tale of the 21st century. Sorry, as much of a fan as I am of Thomas Wolfe, this one just didn't click."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost, but not quite","review":"Tom Wolfe may have captured a generation in some of his previous novels, but he certainly didn't capture mine. As a recent college grad, I found myself often rolling my eyes at how often he had gotten it wrong. I felt very much that a 70 year old man was trying to describe today's college life. Though he may have gone to great lengths in his research, but he missed the boat. A previous reviewer mentioned Wolfe's lack of understanding of female sexuality and I have to agree whole heartedly with this point. In addition, the characters in this novel were too transparent, and well, basically too shallow to get behind. I actually found them all extremely annoying. While the plot was very interesting, there didn't seem to be a point to this 700 page novel, as another review mentioned. Is there really any reason to read this novel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice book","review":"not a very complicated but a nice booki liked reading it ,not my regular kind of book i think im not the \\"target reader\\" of this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not timeless","review":"Love Tom Wolfe books ... but guess I should have read this one years ago.

I was so disappointed. Having recently graduated from college I expected to identify with or at least recognize some of the experiences depicted in the novel. Nope!

Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Wolfe needs a new editor","review":"When I started this book, a friend of mine said \\"He needs a new editor\\". And I couldn't agree more. This book could be called \\"Bonfire of the Vanities Goes to College.\\" It's pretty much the same book, but this time Wolfe skewers college students and athletes instead of investment bankers and radical ministers. The characters all share the same \\"one-noteness\\" which seemed new and interesting in Bonfire, but seems forced and a tad boring in this book. And he does go on and on and on with his descriptions. What would be funny if done in a sentence or two (e.g. , the scene describing the gym habits of the basketball players) turns tedious after the third or fourth page. The story was also predictable. While worthwhile as a cautionary tale for anyone going or sending a child to college in this day and age, the same effect could have been accomplished in far less pages and with far greater success."},{"rating":"1","title":"long and drawn out","review":"Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in this book. I was expecting to be enlightened and learn something new. Instead, I found a plot that was nothing different than other college/highschool storylines. I had a hard time finishing the book, and in the end, I didn't really care what happened to the characters. I ended up skipping alot of the pages just to get to the end. A redeeming quality is how well Mr. Wolfe writes and brings characters to life. Too bad I didn't care about them in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to Convert to Reader's Digest Condensed Version","review":"Too bad that this book is so surfacey -- it never gets down to any insights about human nature or the individuals involved. The characters are shallow and one dimensional. I just got tired of it. And it would be SO easy to convert to a Reader's Digest Condensed Version (if they still made those). All that you would have to do is to take out half of the Fxxk's and it would be just the right size. Reading them all was tedious. Oh yes, he did a lot of research for the book.

That, more than race, class, or wealth, is the theme that unites Wolfe's three novels.I must take issue with the reviewers who refer to the novel's happy ending. The close of the book is absolutely chilling - Charlotte, debauched by peer pressure and the jaded, cynical materialism of her Nobel-prizewinning neuroscience professor's theories, doesn't simply lose her soul. She forcibly pushes it down, smothering it under a pillow of noise and stimulation, fannie-shaking cheerleaders and Serbian jugglers.

I am confident that young men and women currently enrolled at America's fine colleges and universities would have appreciated a more thought provoking story from Wolfe. My first thought after finishing this book (as difficult as it was) was to ask T. W. \\"What were you thinking??\\" But, I quickly realized he wasn't thinking at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word to describe this book: bloated","review":"SOMEWHERE in the publishing world, there must be an editor with the guts to tell Tom Wolfe:1. He needs to cut this book by at least 30%.2. The first time he uses a metaphor (\\"winking navels\\"), it may be clever; the second time it may be a slip up; the third time it becomes a cliche; the fourth time, annoying.3. Placing the same event in different settings (a dorm room, a frat house, a tail gate party) doesn't make it unique each time.4. People don't plow through 675 pages for a \\"happy ever after\\" ending.5. Stereotypes are boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlotte Simmons","review":"Tom Wolfe's portrayal of Charlotte Simmons' struggle to hold onto her identity and moral values as a student in contemporary academia is right on. After spending forty years on six university campuses across the country as a faculty wife, I can testify to the veracity of his depiction of higher education. Yes, the fraternity life is typical Tom Wolfe social commentary--exaggeration, but the pettiness and corruption of camput politics are accurate.Every parent considering college for a child should read this book and think again--and choose carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very accurate and very very funny","review":"From the opening paragraph, Tom Wolfe grabs you and doesn't let go. I read the first hundred pages nonstop, ready to twist the head off anybody who dared laid his greasy paw on the fetching heroine, and finished all 600-odd pages in a week. Having kids in college, finding myself at parents' weekends and (accidentally) eavesdropping in on their conversations, I can assert that Wolfe mastered the slanguage, manners (?!), and (wet) dreams. Reading 'Charlotte' will clarify for you just why college students didn't vote in the last presidential election. They were glued to ESPN, Cartoon Network or each other.If there's a single quibble I have with 'Charlotte,' it's not as well plotted as 'Bonfire' or 'Man in Full.' But this is very much offset by the richness of language. If you thought Wolfe wrote well before, he's great in 'Charlotte.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yup","review":"I agree with all the other reviewers and I would just like to add one thing... the characters are SO UNLIKEABLE. They have no depth and they think they are better than everyone else because they are an athlete/smart/in a fraternity/virgin. Some of the thoughts Charolette has when observing other students just make me want to shake her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny Soap Without a Single Likable Character","review":"Wow - what happened to Mr. Wolfe? A brilliant social observer, a man who loves assuming the role of stranger in a strange land delivers a novel unworthy of the word. At first glance it seemed to have potential: a naive, gorgeous, aw-shucks gal with 1600 SAT scores enrolls in an ivy-league university and quickly finds herself facing a multitude of integrity & morality tests. A setting fat with material for thought-provoking commentary, wouldn't you think? Well you'd be oh-so-wrong, my friend. This was page after page of mind-pickling tripe. Whiny diatribes about the unfairness of teachers, the duplicity of boys (gasp!), the thrill of being popular. Who cares???? Even when I'd given up on depth of insight, I still hoped I'd encounter someone for whom I could root. Nada. Not only did I not enjoy this book, I actively disliked it. Aaron Spelling, I've found your newest writer. Take him - please."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I've been a fan of Tom Wolfe's work, but this was terrible. The characters were all so conceited, poorly developed, and annoying that I couldn't bring myself to care what happened to them. It was clear the novel was written by someone who doesn't understand what college kids are like. It seems like Wolfe got some \\"insight\\" from other people and then tried to force that into just about every line of the novel. The whole novel felt forced and was almost painful to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overmarketed, overwritten, overwrought","review":"Mr. Wolfe just came to not one but three bookstores near me to sell this book and I must say, I can see why he needs to. In fact, all the bookstores emphasized that he WOULD NOT sign any of his other books--I could sympathize with the earlier review about the fan who was harassed in the library (a library?!)for trying. Having been able to get his other, good books, onto the bestseller lists without having to personally sign each and every one, Mr. Wolfe seems to be exerting great labors to sell this one because it takes great labors to read it. I finally gave up on page 300, tried, and tried again, but after the umpteenth jarringly \\"off\\" cultural reference and umpteenth rapturious description of male \\"abs and pecs,\\" and umpteeth cardboard do-people-really-talk-in-expository-sermons character monologue had to slam it shut forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Fair","review":"Mr. Wolfe's effort ,this time, misses the mark. He is always very readable but the substance of this effort is far below his previous standards. The prose is good and the story is somewhat compelling but , in the end I felt as hollow as many of the characters he created. His portrayal of the students of DuPont U. does not ring true to any college student I know (and I do know quite a few). He paints his portraits of his characters in broad strokes and seems to find no one of substance. I was very disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK Book","review":"These are all things that I do regularly in college. It's not a big deal. Everyone does it! I guess I was expecting more than I got out of the book. The System by Roy Valentine is a better book on college sex, partying etc. But don't worry about Charlotte Simmons - she'll grow up to be a good boring desperate housewife like she was taught before going off to college."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not literature,but not bad.","review":"My only comment is that the text (font or whatever) was extraordinarily faint. The least tilt of the page in relation to your lamp made the text almost disappear. Luckily, the writing is so grade school without an eloquent sentence that you'll get through it quickly. And if you miss a sentence, you don't miss much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate Waste of Time","review":"You will finish this book if you start it, but you will not be happy. Wolfe portrays pieces of college life accurately, however he is overly simplistic. He really doesn't understand what he is writing about, and it is a painful read as he tries to write as a maturing women. Charlotte is so annoying at the end it is nearly unbearable. I found myself muttering \\"Get over it!\\" constantly.The greatest offense in this book is Wolfe's characterization of African Americans. Every African American in this book is an athlete and he constantly refers to the fact that they are black (we got it after you mentioned that the first time Tom). He clearly did not do much of his much talked about research with any African American students. His portrayal of the African American student as a dumb athlete, fresh out of the projects, just trying to make it to the league is just an old, tired stereotype.This book was a big disappointment and a real waste of time at 676 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlotte Simmons - agh","review":"This was beyond vulgar - I usually find Tom Wolfe amusing, a good \\"train read or beach read\\" - I am Charlotte Simmons was a complete waste of my time - I would have been better off reading recycled news in the Daily News for the hour I'm on the train in the evening. It almost made no sense - who was the good guy and and who was the bad guy? They all were abhorable characters - even Charlotte Simmons herself (most of all)! Don't waste your money - if you are that curious about this book, get it from your library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad that I burned it!","review":"I am not even going to waste the time to get into the details of this book.

However, it was PAIN-FUL. You read and read and read and want more and expect more and then NOTHING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"I found little if anything to redeem this long laborious diatribe against the American college system. If it is intended to be satire, then it sorely lacks the humor necessary for satire to be effective. If there is a serious metaphor here, then it is so deeply buried under the moutains of useless words that a crack team of the world's best archeologists wouldn't find it.There isn't anything new here once the reader peels through the layers of over-exaggerated caricatures, and what is presented has been done better eslewhere. Once the reader slogs through this quagmire of verbiage and vitriol, the reader finds that the journey wasn't worth the effort.A personal message to the author: you are too good for this. Next time you feel the need to produce a work of this nature, try prunes first."},{"rating":"1","title":"College Prof and parent of college-aged and pre-college children","review":"Save your money, buy a more interesting, more believable, more relevant book. It was only mildly entertaining, which is why I gave it 2 stars. First, Wolfe tries so hard to sound young and hip, that he shoe-horns into the text what he believes are phrases young people use today. I can tell you, based on my experience with college-aged people, he tried way too hard and was completely ineffective. He sounded like an old man who was trying too hard to sound young and hip.I resent how he portrays the main character: he starts off strong by telling a tale of a young woman who is bright and ready to take on the world, then turns her into a confused, weak, babbling idiot who LIVES for the Big Man on Campus. More disturbing is how he portrays date rape...his amazingly cavalier attitude is disgusting.I kept waiting for the \\"good part(s)\\" to happen. I was still searching for it after I read the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother...","review":"This is one of the most annoying books I've ever read.

It's a penetrating insight into present-day coed college life. It could have been tragic but it's not. In Bertolt Brechts words (translated):Happy ending, nice and tidyIt's a rule I learned in school.Even so, it's worth reading and mostly remaindered now. So it's cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable characters and obvious conclusions","review":"Tom Wolfe's mastery of the language makes him a great storyteller. But don't expect anything from this overly long book than one-dimensional characterizations and predictable plot resolutions. You've met every character many times before. There's the snooty, self-absorbed rich girls; the hormone-charged dumb jocks; the angry, middle-aged Jewish professor; the angry feminist; envious, cruel girlfriends ... etc., etc., etc. You can easily predict what will happen and how the subplots will play out. The only intriguing person is Charlotte herself. Yet Wolfe betrays and trivializes his title star. In the end, her final actions seem out-of-character and, for the reader especially, totally unrewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very weak effort...","review":"Tom Wolfe has written some terrific books over the years, but this isn't one of them. The characters are mostly wooden and shallow. The \\"shocking\\" material is cliche. It's as if he cobbled together this novel from a bunch of 10-minute interviews with hungover trust fund brats. In between the parties and basketball games, most college students I know are struggling to pay the bills and find some career path that will allow them to rise above a job at Wal-Mart. Charlotte Simmons herself is little more than a paste-up figure trying to illustrate a cautionary story about \\"the smart working-class country girl who gets swept away by the sinful, dishonest elite on a big name (imaginary) campus.\\" In my experience, the working class rural kids are a hell of a lot more savvy about the realities of life than most of the \\"daddy bought me a new Beemer when I turned 16\\" set. Dull, predictable stuff. Try again, Tom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I have to admit that this book was entertaining, having recently graduated from a Big 10 university, I can relate to a lot of what went on in the book's \\"Dupont.\\" I only wished that the main title character were easier to sympathize with. At times she became a bit annoying. (I don't care how small of a town you grew up in, you can not be that completely ignorant.) All in all though, the book was entertaining and easy to read. It's not exactly a thinker, but I would recommend this for a light read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolfe has tanked","review":"I hope this novel is not the end of Tom Wolfe's gifts to us, but it certainly seems like it. This is embarassing and out of touch. Wolfe never finds his \\"voice\\" in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found the book to be unbelievable in its many stereotypes. I was a lot like Charlotte (valedictorian of my senior class, and even a Church of Christ attender as she was!) when I went to college. I saw a lot of immature behavior, but even back in the dark ages of the '80s, I wasn't shocked or surprised by it. My roommate pledged Chi Omega, and she was never around, either. Surprise! Even though I attended a party school (University of Texas at Austin), I found LOTS of students who were serious about school, and enjoyed college without making fools of themselves. I recall being in only one class with a football player, and that was electrical engineering! So much for the \\"dumb jock\\" stereotype. As I read the book, I kept thinking that the subject had a lot of potential, but Mr. Wolfe failed to develop it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed!","review":"i bought this book because i have heard all the hype about it and figured it ought to be pretty good. normally i'm not a picky reader, as i usually pick up a book one day and finish it the very next! but this one was so hard to get into! first of all, it was WAAAAAAAY too wordy! half the time he'd spend time explaining these very minor characters that really only appeared once in the story! i kept bypassing those long, drawn out descriptions! and i NEVER just skim paragraphs or sections, but i knew i wouldn't miss anything important. then there was just NO climax at the end of the story! it just sort of...ended. VERY disappointed and i do not recommend wasting your money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Refers to abridged audio version","review":"From what I did get to listen to, this book seemed to be a pretty accurate portrayal of college life ( coming from a 04 graduate). Perhaps a bit judgemental, but I mean, my generation is that of loose morals and we deserve it right? Anyway, the abridgemnet of this book is so terrible, it completly jumps from place to place to place and really loses any semblance of a storyline. Go with the unabridged version if you plan on buying the audiobook, as this one will surely annoy you if you care about continuity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Poorly Spent","review":"This book would be better used as a weapon on intruders than it was as a novel worth reading.

Honestly, one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old writer does not know anything about campus","review":"You will never believe anything in this book, to suspend disbelieve is impossible. First of all this old man (the writer) has no idea what he is talking about. E.g.: The totally happening roommate Beverly moves in with all this terminally hip technology as there is \\"a portable CD player and a fax machine\\"!!!!! No teenager would lug around a fax machine in the age of email and instant messages. A fax machine is something I could envision in the office of a real old writer. And a CD player would not exactly be very hip either, she would have an iPod. With other words this old man has no idea what he is talking about. And the must have item on campus is a pair of Diesel Jeans for 80 Dollar? He really doesn't have a clue.As for the rest of the novel: It just moves from one faulty cliché to the next stereotype. To put it mildly, this is a really, really bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to anyone. The book is long and involved, but definately worth the time investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm....1 star is the lowest?","review":"I am Charlotte Simmons is a waste of paper, ink, time and money.

The first third of the book was interesting and made you keep reading to discover how the characters would develop. Unfortunately they did not develop and instead spiraled further into their own stereotypes.

Skip this book and read Mr. Wolfe's more worthy novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored with great writing","review":"Tom Wolfe is an effective writer with a great knowledge of the English language. In fact, it's so great, I not only had to carry this 2\\" thick book around, but also had to carry my 2\\" thick dictionary. The learning experience would have been worth it had the book had anything meaningful to say, but 700 pages of college kids using bad language and screwing each other is pretty academic and sophomoric (excuse the puns) to the overall scheme of things.Having grown up in the NC mountains (Boone) about 20 miles from Charlotte Simmons homesite, there were some poignant chapters and Wolfes geography is correct. Other than that, this story is not up to his previous ones and his wit was not as sharp. Lots more enjoyable books out right now (Grisham, Buffett, Griffin)."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Name is Charlotte Simmons","review":"This book is tedious at best. It was apparently not edited by either the author or his editor. It might have been interesting if it had been edited IN HALF. As it is, it deteriorates to redundant dribble.

The novel starts well -- several stories being weaved together -- some interesting characters, including the only white kid starting on the basketball team at this Duke/Stanford-like University. But, it becomes a tedious soap opera -- and over time I didn't care what happened to Charlotte or any of the other characters. I finished the book, but, could have easily put it away about 300 pages in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-press that white suit...","review":"Tom Wolfe was hip back in the day. Well, this isn't that day. You get more insight into college angst by watching an episode or two of Dawson's Creek reruns then by this drivel written by someone completely out of his element. He can definitely turn a phrase now and then, but my recommendation is to pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbose, predictable and a struggle to get through","review":"The subject of the book will never go out of style and will forever be a hot issue amoung both students and teachers. The core issues have been the same since college education came into being. The presentation style is what I have trouble digesting - way too verbose and repetitious. Sometimes it seems that Mr. Wolfe forgot that he had said the same thing before, be it informing of a character's feelings or when describing a situation. Frankly, often I felt like skipping the pages here and there only to stumble upon a repeat of something else. This 'I may have told you but here I am saying it yet again' obscures a relevant topic. It is very clear that Mr. Wolfe does not believe that brevity to tbe the key to a good story. This is not a book that had me interested as many characters are predictable, presented in black and white, thus making getting to the last page a great relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"an enjoyable listening experience","review":"Need something to get you through some horrific task?? Name it. sorting, planting, washing, sewing, chemotherapy. . This book did it for me. I do not mean to demean this literary effort. I loved this book. It was so entertaining.

After completing the novel, I cannot help pondering what the point of the book may be.Certainly, Wolfe is a skilled writer, and his skills are obvious even in I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS. His ear for voices and dialect shows through, and his complicated subplot structure is here too, if not as complicated as in his earlier works.Still, I keep wondering what propelled Wolfe to tell this particular tale--in which the story begins with a detailed description of bowel movements.Other than the title character, those who populate this novel are uniformly unlikeable. So what if Wolfe gets teenspeak or athletespeak or even blackspeak?All of Wolfe's skills merge together to form this unpleasant and uninteresting novel. What a waste of talent!

Was blown away. Its right up there with Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities. I believe anyone who has been through a college experience will empathize with Charlotte's plight and the inanities of college life. Wolfe convinces us that the this is a very rich country indeed which can afford this level of waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't make it past page 85....","review":"For the record, I have read every single Tom Wolfe book ever written. I, of course, had high hopes for this one. I have only been out of college for 5 years, but I couldn't STAND to read this horribly cliched novel. I feel sorry for the parents that read this and think that their new college kid will have to go through what Charlotte does. It just isn't represented accurately.

I'll be back for your next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"As I write this I have not finished reading the novel yet I can already tell that it should be the novel of the decade. When I was at Rice University in the 1970s things were not as bad as they are at Charlotte's fictional (and current) DuPont, but you could see the present day coming. Humans have difficulty achieving balance, and therefore it only stands to reason that once banality becomes acceptable it will be pursued to its logical end. \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons\\" makes it pretty clear that the logical end of our banal culture is not far off, and it makes you wonder what the aftermath will be like. \\"I Am Charlotte Simmons\\" is not just a scathing attack on collegiate culture, but on broader American culture as well (after all the super hoops players in the novel have FANS), and must rank alongside the great Billy Wilder Films \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" and \\"The Big Carnival\\" as a a cultural critique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the edge it could have had. . .unfortunately","review":"This book could have found an edge, peering into the college youth and their habits, twists and early, media aged wisdom.

Want edge? Read Bukowski."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I haven't read Wolfe in years (Kool Aid Test, Bonfire of the Vanities) and looked forward to his new one. What a shocking disappointment! The story is shallow, the characters are passe, and only occasionally does Wolfe come up with a meaningful sentence.

He has indeed outlived his reputation and talent.Dr. Dean"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Trash","review":"This book deserves 0 stars, but that is not an option. Mr.Wolfe has written some of my favorite books, including Bonfire of the Vanities and A Man in Full, but I can't even believe he wrote this. After the first couple of pages, I started skimming, and after skimming for about 100 pages, I gave up. Bathroom humor, bathroom functions, profanity-laced dialogue, not my thing. If this is a slice of college life today, I feel especially sorry for college women. Lowest common denominator is what comes to mind here. Mr. Wolfe you have more class than this, or not? This book is unreadable and disgusting. Don't throw your money down the loo . . . Very disappointing, foul, profane and just plain gross!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Having read and enjoyed all of the author's previous work I anticpated this book with pleasure. But, alas, this sophomoric over written, padded, volume is a monument to the notion that\\" you cant win 'em all \\". The story line is essentially non existent. The dialogue is jejeune and offensive at the same time.The satire is overblown and not at all funny. In a real sense it is an insult to our best centers of higher education. The never ending expletives, the repetitive descriptions of athlete's muscle bound moronity, the prolonged passages devoted to wild, drunken, sex oriented parties are totally boring.In short I regard this effort as a piece of c--p.

You'd do better to pick up another book and fulfill your craving for trashy stereotypes and obnoxious characters by watching an episode of the OC.

I couldn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comic without meaning to be!","review":"Tom Wolfe has always been a bit over the top, but at his best with his peculiar brand of non-fiction. His two previous novels (Bonfires of the Vanities & A Man in Full) were pretty boring, something that is hard to do when the writing is so good. With \\"I am Charlotte Simmons\\" he seems completely out of it, so much so that the writing is pale, dull and foppish and the dialogue is laughable in its triteness. Either TW has lost his talent, phoned it in or is trying a new style that fails miserably. It appears as though his research, which was said to be extensive, was ignored or poorly done. He is out of touch with today's college scene, and so much so that if he had placed it in the sixties it might have done better as a spoof. My advice to TW is give up fiction and try another \\"Electric Kool Aid Acid Test\\" so we can see if the talent is still there or gone forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"shockingly bad","review":"Did Tom Wolfe have any editors under 60 review this text?

No one explained that identity politics are passe? Was Wolfe's \\"research\\" renting John Hughe's flicks? The embarrassing jumble of stereotypes and chauvinism are played off as the character's prejudices, but really just betray Wolfe's condescending old-man world view. No character even approaches 3 dimensions.Oh, and if I ever read \\"F_ck patois\\" again, I might scream, but will definitely close the book, turn off the computer and/or through away whatever paper or magazine prints it.

I found Charlotte to be pathetic and miserable. I also found myself rooting against her. Also Wolfe spent far to much time on details. You can skip chapters in this book and miss nothing. The ending of this book came out of no where and this is not a good thing.Wolfe uses one cliche after another and ends up really saying nothing. The black dumb basketball player, the virginal country bumpkin, the drunk rich girls...I went to the college that allegedly was the inspiration of this book and trust me Wolfe got it all wrong.

But there is a basic flaw in the premise of this book: Charlotte is a brilliant girl, a star of her high school, read deeply in many areas, but hadn't actually prepared for college, it that she hadn't read a bit about how prevalent drugs, alcohol and sexual activity are in colleges today. The book is therefore without surprises except that such a smart, supposedly strong woman would only judge herself by how she is rated in the eyes of men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachel's Prayer","review":"Rachel's Prayer is the fifth in the series of books that chronicles the life of the Wortham family and their friends and neighbors. It retains fresh storylines while keeping the characters true to their original personalities. Each book has expressed messages of faith while exploring the frailties of the human spirit. I will read about this group of characters as long as Leisha Kelly writes about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Series","review":"Of all the books about the Wortham and Hammond families, this my favorite, next to the first one. I like the way the characters are developed, although some of them don't turn out very well. I especially like the growing love between Sarah and Frank which is so special. The only complaint I have about the book, and the series, is that I think Leisha Kelly could say the same thing in a lot less words. She tends to be somewhat repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"I have enjoyed all of the books in this series. This is the last of the series.

It's so beautiful, and so much fun to read that I'm sure it would have been my favorite. I got it for my grandson, so I'm enjoying reading it with him, and watching him point to his favorite pictures. I think the best way to learn to count is when you have really cool things to count, like the adorable creatures adorning each page. This book is so cheerful that you can't help feeling happy when you read it with your child or grandchild."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gear!!","review":"I just bought this backpack and I find it awesome, the small one fits perfectly my 7 pound beagle and it looks fair durable, I think for the price you are buying a very good backpack, it has adjustable straps and the side pockets have a nice size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous, moving and realistic","review":"This was a wonderful movie. I visited Rwanda in August and traveled throughout the country with my daughter, who lives and works there. This movie so reflects what I saw and learned about the genocide. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to understand what really happened, what the Rwandan people went through, and how the US, UN, France and the Western world utterly failed the Rwandan people. Beautifully acted, too, by all actors. The special features were very moving and educational, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful movie about the Tutsi genocide","review":"This movie was recommended to me by a Tutsi pastor in Africa. The movie was graphic (although not as much as I thought it would be) but powerfully moving. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who would like to learn more about the genocide of the Tutsis in Africa. Obviously, there has been wrongs committed on both sides here, but the Hutus' referral to the Tutsis as \\"cockroaches\\" over public radio is outrageous--as well as their inhuman treatment of the Tutsis that is very similar, in my opinion, to the Holocaust of the Jews. What is even worse is that the nations of the earth didn't respond to this until it was much too late. United States, where were you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"stunningly true","review":"I am in touch with quite a few people who do work in Rwanda.

It is heartbreaking but a story that everyone should see and understand. What an important film this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow moving but effective","review":"As I have read many books and watched other films and documentaries on the subject, this particular film is easy to watch, albeit somewhat slow at times.A mixture of factual information and fictional characters, so it is almost an intermediary between a movie and a documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Left CANNOT do history........especially involving genocide","review":"SOMETIMES IN APRIL(2005) Directed, Produced and written by Raoul Peck.Starring Debra Winger.A generally bad four hour film about the Genocide in Rwandawhose main flaw can be identified in that Peck once made a biofilmpraising communist dictator Patrice Lumumba so obviously his take ongenocide is and must be.......ah........shaded.An obstructive smoke screen, the viewer will still, after this 4 hour film is done, not knowjust why the genocide happened nor will be able to name itsarchitects--its Himmlers, its Heydrichs, its Eichmans(whom one mustassume would be Black Africans). Somehow, according to Peck, it is allBelgium's fault and all the rest of those honkies.

Before you go all hater, hear me out. Watching Courtney Cox, Christa Miller, and Bill Lawrence talk about the show and how it quickly evolved from something cliché into something amazing convinced me to give it a second chance. Even from this DVD you can tell how much they love the show, but more importantly how much they love each other!It was so funny to hear Bill Lawrence make fun of Courtney during the questions, but at the same time really explain what they are going for with Cougar Town - showing the importance of adult friendship. I would never have gotten interested in the show if it wasn't for the Paley Center, so I guess I owe them a big thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"liberty hardware","review":"Liberty Hardware was sent to us very fast.Liberty Hardware puts the finishing touches on your wall"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun fun","review":"This game (although seems a step back compaired to most games these days) is alot of fun, i enjoy the challenge, the \\"rules\\" the story.its a little slow as you walk through the map, but with patience it's a great game. a wonderful past time"},{"rating":"2","title":"fast","review":"got it fast from the site. i was playing the game a few years back and wanted to see the graphics again since at that time they where as HD as other are these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many talking heads!","review":"I had high hopes for this documentary, but it is pretty disappointing. There are very short clips from various concerts and appearances but they are always interrupted by some vapid comment so that you can't hear the song or see the performance. Many times you will have the full screen performance going on without sound--just someone talking about how great he thought it was. Let us hear it! We can tell how great it is. It was apparently done as a television show because there are breaks where you have a little teaser, then the screen goes dark, and they come back repeating what they just said. If you don't know anything about Bette Midler and want to hear some background information, I guess you might like to sit through it once. If you are like me, though, and have seen every one of her concerts since \\"Clams on the Half-Shell\\" and are hoping to relive some of those moments, forget it.

Every story reaches out to you and you can relate closely to so many. In fact, one story in particular was very, very touching. It made both my husband and me cry. It was a story about a dog that meant alot to a woman and her experiences with that dog and then the sad end to the dog's life. Well, it just so happened that I read that story to my husband on the eve of our one year anniversary of losing our family dog of thirteen years. It was so like our experience that it sent a shiver down your spine and finally we both cried. It was as if our dog was saying hi to us in his own way, that we hadn't forgotten him. Anyways, I love all the stories in your books. I've read Chicken Soup and now a 2nd helping. So, now I am reading Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul. I can't wait to read them all!!

I got the 2nd helping and found it to be depressing and full of backhanded insults. Full of stories of parents who go to extraordinary lengths for their children, I think it might make less self-extending parents feel guilty for not doing such things.

The story and the pop-up illustrations captivate my one year old daughter like no other book out there right now (and we have many!). Also, content aside, the craftsmanship of the book is superior to other pop-up's, as this one withstands the tugging of a toddler extremely well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great message but not enough pop-ups!","review":"A valuable message to teach children and adults too to feel proud just being who they are. However, the message is not completely obvious or emphasized. The writing can be more thought out. Creative though. The illustrations are colorful and well done. But, the pop-ups are not enough. Only 5 of them (crocodile, snake, giraffe, parrot and zebra). I wish the book could have more. I feel slightly disappointed and misled because the book says \\"a one-of-a-kind pop-up book\\".

I choose not to view all of it. Always remember that you are what you watch. You think what you view and what you listen to. Let me say that it is the sexual acts in this movie that are immoral, not the nudity. None of the men who had sex with her were married to her. That is what makes it immoral.

Where I should be shocked, I wasn't. Everyone just meandered through their existences. There was no redeeming vale to the main character. An apathetic creature. My goodness, she was a terrible friend. Perhaps that was the intent of the movie. She had no emotion until the end of the movie, and then it was out of character.

I just couldn't believe how deeply disturbing this film was and I'm usually a big fan of celebral/artsy movies but this one is so unsexy and completely pointless that I lost interest halfway through the film.

How am I doing on the detailed good review demands given to us by this darned fine firm which does not sell anything of quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abominable and More Abominable","review":"The Abominable Dr. Phibes and Dr. Phibes Rises Again are two great classics from that early-70's British Nicholson/Arkoff film group. Aside from being fairly cheesy, these two do a good job of not taking themselves too seriously and they are strewn with that dry Brit humour that was so popular at that time. Reasonably well done, these films are not bad enough to make it to MST-3K -- and of course Vincent Price is delicious as he hams it up just enough to let the audience know that his tongue is firmly lodged in his cheek. The production values are good and the video transfer is what you'd expect for an older film. Be nice if it were in stereo, but I just can't imagine anyone forking over the cash to restore the film and rework the soundtrack. These are good films to watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"I have searched for this movie for a while. Glad to see it together. Loved Vincent Price in the second one, very tongue in cheek.The first one, I loved the sets, Art Deco. The set designer did a marvelous job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie - Bad Price","review":"I love these campy Vincent Price movies from the 70s and was delighted to find them on DVD. They were sold here on Amazon through a third party vendor for close to 30 bucks. When I got the movie it still had the factory wrapper....along with a Blockbuster price sticker still on the package for $9.99!!!! Man, at least remove the sticker so your customer doesn't feel like a total moron for being ripped off. I almost felt like the vendor was taunting me for being an idiot. First and last time I buy an old movie through a third party Amazon vendor. Looks like I just need to start surfing the bargain bins at Blockbuster instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"I saw this film when I was seven years old. And it scared me.

But, it's a movie that has a plot you don't have to think too much about & you can just sit back and enjoy the genius of Vincent Prince. I recommend to the 1st one over the 2nd, hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The great master .........","review":"Vincent Price is one of the true masters of his art. I've never been disappointed in anything I've seen him in.

What exactly is her motive? Then there's a side plot in which Joanne suspects that fishermen killed her husband, even though we the reader know Charis is the killer from chapter one. And this is all author Mitchell Smith has to offer us for some 430 pages. Like other reviewers have mentioned, I was able to skim entire chapters and not miss a thing. Smith has an impenetrable writing style that failed to engage me in the story or let me identify with the characters - these don't seem like real people at all. Even though I slogged through the whole thing, I was rewarded with a putrid, stupid ending. It's the sort of ending that makes you wonder why the author even bothered writing the story to begin with.Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obvious? Maybe, but Smith wasn't being subtle.","review":"This is largely a review of the other reviews on this page. They complain that Smith's novel, \\"Reprisal\\" wasn't a mystery. Well, it wasn't supposed to be a mystery. It had poetry in it. Oh, my goodness! Imagine, someone forcing you to read a poem! Unconstitutional, certainly.This book is about an extraordinarily disturbed human being. The fact that her identity isn't a mystery is irrelevant. What she does, and what is done to her in reprisal, is the subject matter of this excellent novel. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Couple Hours I'll Never Get Back","review":"Simply one of the worst books I've read in a long time. Smith's writing style is cumbersome, him making use all too frequently of fractured sentences. Don't be fooled by the so-called suspense or mystery as to the Charis character's motives....you can see this one coming after a couple of chapters (if not sooner). I mean come now...how many motives can there be for a this Charis woman of whom we have no backround suddenly start killing Joanna's (...)? And what's with Smith's odd fascination with women peeing, both him writing it and the characters talking about it? Who cares? Skip this one and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I received this as a birthday gift and like others have said, it worked for tweenty minutes and then said chicken was over cooked. When I pulled the chicken it was pink. To top it off I grabbed it from the closet for Thanksgiving and I couldn't get it to work at all. I think the thermometer fried on first use. What a waste. Weber should recall these, and at the least quit selling them. Don't waste your money. Great idea, bad execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one","review":"I bought this Weber unit hoping for Weber quality. What I got was the same junk that most of the other reviewers here got.

The preset temps for different meat products is handy. I don't have to look up the proper temps in a book anymore. The radio remote works well throughout my whole house, and even down to the mailbox at the end of the driveway. I gave the product 4 stars. I would have given it 5 except the device presets do not let you adjust doneness for chicken or pork (only one setting-well, for these) That should be my choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"WO(RST PRODUCT I'VE EVER BOUGHT","review":"Weber should be ashamed of themselves for selling this trash. Mine worked ONCE, then same as everyone else. Flashing 199 degrees on display, and constant beeping.

Judging from all the complaints listed here, Weber has got to know what garbage this is, and yet they don't seem to care about doing the right thing and taking one's word for it. I will NEVER own a Weber product again if they are that unconcerned about their customers!

This thing has a hard time keeping communication with the probe over ANY distance down to a few inches. Weber says that it has a range of 100 feet. Baloney.Using it is an exercise in frustration. Do yourself a favor, if you want to buy one, just burn the $30 it costs. At least you will not waste your time trying to get it to work.This is the second Weber accessory I've bought that is worthless. Also bought the illuminating handle for gas grills. That melted.I think these guys only know how to make good grills. Nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very displeased!","review":"You can't choose the temperature, the thermometer decides. Well, I don't WANT my beef cooked to a minimum of 145.

Being an engineer, I was dubious that you could design properly at a cost the average backyard griller would pay. After reading the reviews, I'm not going to screw with it. Just tossed in the garbage. Probably wouldn't trust it anyway. You can get a good meat thermometer for $25 that will last your cooking lifetime, more or less.Cheers"},{"rating":"1","title":"simply a piece of crap","review":"This thermometer worked for about three sessions before failing. The wireless signal either is not being picked up or theres a short in the probe as so many other reviews comment on. This was truly a waste of money and it annoys me because I believe its due to incompetent design on webers part. You know if webber were to charge another ten bucks and actually build something that works they would have a lot more happy customers. I have little patience for incompetence and I chose the Weber brand for the reliable name but got some piece of plastic off shore crap.

Good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor execution.","review":"I received this as a gift after I bought a Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker. It worked great the first two times I used it, then the probe failed open (high resistance). Accuracy was a little questionable which could be an issue, especially for smoking at a low temp. I work with delicate instumentation and electronics on a daily basis, and I handled this one \\"with kid gloves\\"....never closed a lid on it, bent it, twisted it, dropped it, spindled it, or anything. My personal opinion is that the probe/wire portion of this device is too thin and flimsy for its purpose (or any purpose). All of my other Weber accessories are outstanding (Rib Racks, Roast Rack, Smoker itself, brush, Chimney, etc) but they really dropped the ball on this one.The bottom line is that the wireless thermometer is a great idea.....but pay a little more and get one that will last.

It tells you when the meat it done so you don't overcook it on the grill. However, after about 3 months of moderate use (I think we used it about once every 1-2 weeks), it just died. We tried to reset it, changed the batteries, etc., but nothing worked. It would turn on, but it wouldn't read a temperature. We finally threw it away.

Initially, it was difficult to set up, and a little confusing. I got it working, and it seemed good. After about 20 minutes with the probe in the meat in the grill, it started going crazy, saying everything was overcooked. I checked it, and it seems the wire had melted. it had not been misused at all, I used it exactly as the manufacturer suggest I use it (on my Weber grill no less), and it melted into uselessesness."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real lemon.","review":"Used it 4 times and it worked great.

The nominal temperatures for various degrees of \\"wellness\\" do not agree with the temperatures published in Weber's cookbooks and they're NOT adjustable.

Since then I have replaced the probe 3 times. The last probe only lasted 1 time and then failed in the middle of the prime rib I was cooking, leaving me to guess! Weber should think twice before putting their name on this product. There is no reason why these probes should fail as I have used thermocouples in industrial applications that hold up well and are inexpensive. Weber has replaced 2 of the probes, but are now saying they will charge for the next one. They take several weeks to get and cost about $11.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the limitation!!!","review":"I returned mine. Why? Because it does not give you a reading for anything over 199 degrees. I purchased mine for use in a Weber smoker. I wanted to measure temperatures up to 220 degrees inside the smoker. This timer only registers to 199 degrees. After that it just beeps to tell you (as the directions say:) \\"out of range\\". It worked fine below that, but it was useless with any temps over that. It says the probe can register up to 480 degrees or something, so why limit the readout?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then a temp. fork","review":"I have used this in the BBQ & the Oven and it works great.

I had a similar probe from a Williams-Sonoma oven thermometer that worked fine with the Weber, so I know it was the Weber probe that was defective.Second, and more important - you cannot program the temperatures for the different foods (beef, chicken, etc.). The pre-programmed \\"FDA recommended\\" temperatures are all too high - they produce dried meat. My Williams-Sonoma thermometer allows you to change the temperatures to your own liking - so you can produce a rare steak.I bought the Weber because it is designed for grilling, not just ovens, but these flaws caused me to send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brand new broke before I used it,no replacement parts","review":"The instruction tell you only in very small print that if the probe touches the metal grill that it burns out the thermister and they dont offer replacement parts so you buy a new one and read the instructipons fine, fine print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great for first 5 times","review":"I am a Weber fan I have a Summit(Gas)and Weber Bullet Smoker which are FANTASTIC!

Going into the fifth time I used this; it quit. I've tried another one and the same thing happen? I'm shocked that Weber would have a quality control issue. If you can get one of these to work for a reasonable amount of time I would buy one again. Now I have to check the traditional way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I can't believe Weber put their name on this piece of junk. It worked two or three times (maybe).

Lousy design, inaccurate - I would seriously look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't wish this product on anyone - Stay Away!","review":"Ordered one of these, and it worked reasonably well the first couple of times I used it, but then the receiving unit stopped getting the signal from the probe, I changed batteries, tried multiple times to get it to work again, but no dice."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY allows preset temps!","review":"I was very disappointed by this product. The reviews I had read mentioned that it has presets -- but so do my car radio and my oven, and I can change the presets around how I like them, or set other options on my own. The reviews did NOT mention the most crucial thing to know:This thermometer ONLY allows you to use the presets. There are no other options. If you don't like the presets, you're out of luck.It also plays food nanny -- there's no setting but \\"well done\\" for hamburger, for example, and although the setting for rare beef is _correct_, you actually need to take a steak off the grill about 5-10F cooler than that because of carryover heat.This was a gift for my husband, and both of us are disappointed. It won't get any use at all, and because of the type of packaging, we can't even pack it back up to return it. Big thumbs down, and an annoying waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wire Failure","review":"Do not purchase this product! I bought two of these units.

I have read the negative reviews about it failing eventually but so far I have used it numerous times in a Big Green Egg for chicken and lamb roasts at grill temps around 350F with no problems. The remote functions well at a good distance and through an outside wall. I agree that the factory set doneness temps (that are unchangeable)are not ideal (as with most other digital meat thermometers). CONS: No timer built in and no way to set up a user defined temp alarm but I guess for under $30 what do you expect. Also will not tell you grill/oven temperature because max temp reading is only 199F.Look into the Maverick Et-73 for a remote dual temp (meat and grill) thermometer - but almost twice the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weber \\"Professional-Grade\\" JOKE","review":"If you're looking for a decent digital thermometer to cook various items I'd recommend buying this one is you'll only use it once. After that, this thermometer will fail to tell you the current temperature of what you're cooking. PLUS, if you're looking for a thermometer to alert you once the meat heats to a specific temperature that you desire, you'll need to look elsewhere. The fine folks at the Weber company, apparently, don't trust your ability to gauge what temperature corresponds with your desired level of doneness. This thermometer will only alert you on four levels with Beef and one on all other meats. So, again, this is a $35 let down and a word of advice for the Weber company: stick to making grills!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working after 10 minutes.

The trouble is that it never works. In my case, the remote unit doesn't recognize the sending unit at about 20 feet.I've used mine about 3 times and it stopped working. I can't believe that I paid almost $50 for this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works","review":"I'm on my third one and am opting for a different brand now. The first one I bought worked fantastically for the first year or two. No issue - very easy to use, worked like a charm. One day the probe got soaked in water and stopped working. No warranty coverage and no way to buy a replacement for just that part. So, I bought a new one. That one broke within a couple of weeks. In a thanksgiving/turkey emergency, I bought a third one. Now that one is broken also. Overall, if you get lucky, this could work great for you, but if it breaks, you're pretty much out of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 1 use","review":"Received this as a gift.

Found it useful with my new grill to establish cooking times. Easy to clean. Bought it at local mega store so I could return it easily if it failed.Reason only 4 star---does not have a timer-can't set your own temp, must choose one from menu (lowest setting 135, doesnt read higher than 199 degrees).-if cooking for over an hour or so it does seem the probe gets hot enough to heat the surrounding area, giving a higher than true reading.-probe is thick so it will cause juices to run if repositioned.*update- after 6 months of sparse use the probe died, webber sent another after some prodding. IMO not durable -- would now 2 give stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"a piece of junk","review":"used this thermometer one time, ever since it automatically reads 199 degrees, do not buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this item!","review":"This is made by \\"Oregon Scientific\\" with the Weber name attached.

This book is not a book about Illinois plants at all, rather it tells you what plants you can plant from other regions that can thrive here. For example, Barberry, which is native to Europe and Asia (two different species), is an invasive plant that has found its way to the forest preserves in Illinois and crowds out native plants. Barberry will create a thicket of thorny shrubs where other plants cannot survive.If this book did not claim to be about Illinois gardening, then it would not surprise me if it had non-natives, but since it is supposedly about Illinois gardening, I would expect them to list species that actually belong in Illinois."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Monster Fan's Dream","review":"This was a fairly good book, listing every imaginable monster and creator, and in short everyone who has done anything with them.

Nolo has published a number of new books for businesses, so be sure to check out the various ones to see which might be best for you to pick up.

Here is the first single from Lasgo, and I'm hoping its the last, because Lasgo is nothing too impressive. I hear many people compare Lasgo to Ian van Dahl, but there is a MAJOR difference betweent the two. That difference is that Ian van Dahl is good. Ian van Dahl isn't exactly the number one composer of all time or anything like that, but there is some really great trance/techno music generated from that area. With Lasgo, the titles are all used up, nothing is new, and the lady cannot sing. She sounds like Tiffany, remember, the I think we're alone now girl?

The lights were purchased to add to the Westin Bull Bar I added to my 05 Ford Ranger. The install was straight forward with no issues. It is hard to get the lights tightened to the point where you can not turn them by hand.After 6 months, one of the plastic lamp housing broke off at the base. I have sent several emails to Hella trying to get this issue resolved, but so far no response from them.I would not recommend this product because of the plastic housing and mounting hardware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Webb Pierce","review":"Webb Pierce, being one of my favorite honk tonk singers, I just had to get this set. I wasn't disappointed. Some of the songs were nothing special but with Webb singing, took me back to the 50's. After a couple of listings I have found Drifting Texas Sand to be my favorite. His voice hasn't matured to the deeper nasal sound that became part of his signature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover Your Ears","review":"The Harrison Act's \\"A Sign of Things to Come\\" might possibly the worst album I have ever listened to. Imagine the Barnum and Bailey circus on crack. Although the lead singer has potential, but needs to master pitch before he attempts to hit keys that are clearly out of his range.

You won't be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Just Awesome!","review":"Well, what can I say! Truly the best! My fav. part is when Obi-Wan gets locked in the freezer! I got this book a little late so I also have the 5th book. The only person in this series who frustrates me is Qui-Gon! He's WAY too serious! I just wish he would be a little more understanding! Something that is really funny is how Obi-Wan loses his lightsaber in every book! Get this boy some SUPERGLUE! Take it from me, a huge Star Wars fan from age 5, who had to sneak the book past the Star Wars haters, all the way down the hall to my best friends, the Star Wars lovers!

Obi-Wan being my age, I wish he could have a girlfriend =)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book in the Star Wars Jedi Apprentice line!","review":"This is definetly a good Apprentice book, in fact, you SHOULD read it. It features many unique characters, and a good scenario. If you ever wondered why Obi-Wan is left alone so many times in Episode 1, you'll find out here.

Betrayal, dueling, drama, its all in here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"It is a great book but Obi-Wan doesn't have a good bond with his master like a reader before me said.

I enjoy it as much as my children. My daughter is 6 and my son is 8 1/2 and it is all they want to listen to. The message is so important and this album says it without hitting you over the head. It is like a full musical on CD - scenes, songs and sound design. If we listen to it in the car my children don't complain about how long it takes to get somewhere. I so recommend this product. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"iPod Killer (just kidding)","review":"Look, chances are most people end up reading the reviews for the same device, black version, which are all negative. Since you were lucky enough to make it here, let me tell you: this is a great player for the cost. I would not recommend it for music, especially if you can afford a famous brand mp3 player. But this is a wonderfully cheap way to TRANSFER DOWNLOADS from your computer to a \\"Walkman.\\" Pop an SD card in your computer, transfer that download of this week's Economist that you've been dying to hear, pop the SD card out and slip it into this player. \\"Get's 'er done!\\"Even though I have fancier music players, this is perfect for taking spoken word mp3's to the beach, or to bed.

A compilation of hundreds of newspaper articles, it is interesting to follow the personal opinion of some of the journalists. Some of them aren't even looking for the truth, they just want to give the gory details. The book shows articles, starting with the discovery of the bodies untill Lizzie's death. I guess no one will ever get to know the truth, but isn't that what makes the story of Lizzie Borden so great?"},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful","review":"This book deals almost entirely with contemporary news sources of the Borden murder case and trial of 1892-93.

Midnight Oil is super hot and soooo delightful and funny.

The questions in this study are difficult to answer, don't point towards the scripture or toward God and take way too long with too little result.

Therein he makes the same mistake as his anti-rational subjects: he confuses the principle of uncertainty in the physical sciences (as described by Popper)with the relativism which has infected the social sciences.Windschuttle demonstrates the power of falsification throughout his criticisms of postmodern pseudo-scholarship.

The last three chapters in particular are outstanding summaries of the philosophical issues behind the titanic struggle being waged in these disciplines. He outlines importance of Fukuyama in turning the Marxist method on its head using its own tools (quoting Perry Anderson), and incisively deploys David Stove to show how the Popper-Kuhn-Lakatos-Feyerabend nexus is built on shoddy thinking. Recommended for those interested in the Culture Wars, especially those dismayed by so many aspects of the Enlightenment project."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is basically an anti-intellectual reactionary tract.","review":"Winschuttle's closed-fisted insistence that there is absoulte TRUTH to be found in history attempts to push historicism and literary criticism back 30 years.

Try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Depressing and Anger Filled Book","review":"I respect the author and was sympathetic to her struggle. However, this book was so filled with anger that I had to stop reading it. Prejudice, whether against all fat people, all black people, all gay people, is heinous and warrants anger, but I needed to get to the part where she grew emotionally from her struggle. I have no time for Bitterness, this is a toxic emotion and leads to illness.So, instead of this one, read Fat?So! and read The Fat Girl's Guide to Life. those are awesome, funny, and empowering for those of us who have struggled our whole lives with the delusion, forced upon us by society, that what we weigh actually matters. Who you are matters, not what you weigh, and the only way to overcome prejudice is with humor and dignity.Also the book,Such a Pretty Fat is okay (not great, but definitely okay), and I'm Not the New Me, at least is neutral, not angry, and is a good book.

There are about two songs that are worth mentioning. T.I's Im A King feat Big Kuntry and Lil Scrappy and the very goofy but catchy Booty Language by Juvenile, Wacko and Skip. The rest of this album is filler. I dont know why they decided to put Terrence Howard's character's songs from the movie on the soundtrack but I can honestly tell you that they suck. Whoop That Trick, It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp(this song won an award?) and Hustle and Flow(It Aint Over) are about as dull as Djay's character. Even 8-Ball and MJG drop the ball on Tell Me Why. T.I had the only verse worth talking about on Murda Game with P$C and Carbon 15's A.K.'s Mac 11's by Boyz N Da Hood sounds like leftover that was left off of their first album for a reason.

There is an outright redundancy to the use of similar, derogatory street language that after a while just falls flat and takes on an immaturity that is undenyable on the inspiring art chart. All of the phony lines about murdering, drugging, robbing and living outside (meant to be above) the law seems to drone on, as if expressed by untalented, whiny bitches, rather than true musical innovators. The album does contain some bright spots, so it doesn't appear a total loss, but if you are looking for the kind of raw heart that the actual movie had, you may just be disappointed here.

I gave it a spin in my CD player and realized it didn't sound much like Incubus. Instead, I found a really cool new band that has been added to my favorite artist list. It has similar elements as Incubus. You would enjoy it if you like music that switches from heavy guitar riffs to melodic tones within songs (kind of like Incubus's \\"nebula\\"). Really good new sound. Definitely worth the money. Each song is different and each written very well. I am surprised that they are not famous right now.

Beside the \\"Shinobi...\\" song, which really rocks out, I was very displeased by the remainder of the songs. The music felt stagnant, and really lacked direction.

The sheer brilliance of how everything blends together so well and fluently is the best part.

If you are lookin for a wicked CD that will keep you buzzing for months, buy this, NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Start Something Hopefully Is Better","review":"After I heard Last Train Home (which is AWESOME), I decided to find out more about Lostprophets. I bought this CD, even though Last Train Home isn't on it. A few songs are good, but nothing is incredibly fantastic. I liked the interludes, though. To the people who compare it to Linkin Park: I'll quote another reviewer, but I love Linkin Park, so it's in an opposite light; OMG, what are you thinking?!?!Bottom line is, a few songs are worth listening to. Download a few first, then decide if it's worth buying the whole album. I suppose they're not really my thing. ^^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocals are Horrid","review":"I cant believe you people are so lost. I checked them out because of Shinobi.

On a note I bought this album without ever listening to a single song by the band but from the british rock magazine Kerrang!. I would recommend this album for anyone who is a fan of: old school Incubus,Linkin Park,older Staind and old (3 Dollar Bill Y'all) Bizkit"},{"rating":"2","title":"thefakesoundofprogress","review":"This Linkin Park \\"Hybrid Theory\\" close gets off to a promising start with the first track, \\"shinobi vs. dragon ninja\\". It immediately catches the ear of those interested in alternative rock and particularly with early LP. By the third track, \\"five is a four letter word\\", you've come to the realization that lead vocalist Ian Watkins has a whininess to his voice and lacks the melodious aspects possessed by LPs Chester. Still, most of the vocals work well on this album. \\"...and she told me to leave\\" is perhaps the best song on this debut, even despite (or because of?) it being a love/breakup song. Some more aggro-rock with touches of sequencing and electronic noodling follow and \\"still laughing\\" shows off some potential future promise of the band becoming something like Underworld. (I haven't heard anything past this album and I am curious but I don't know if they went to a heavier electronic and sequencing sound.) 3.75 stars.Absolutely great title for an album BTW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The orginal more metal lostprophets","review":"Its seems like forever since lostprophets last made a record, and finally they made 'start something' which has been a fairly large hit in America. The Fake Sound of Progress was done only 3 years ago (2001), and i like it much more then ss. I own both cds, and start something is much more of a 'rock' cd, compaired to fsp which is more metal. Some of my favorites on the cd are Shinobi Vs. Dragon Ninja, The Fake Sound Of Progress, Kobrakai, and Ode To Summer. I highly recommend this cd. If you like start something be sure to grab this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Any Other Vacuum is a Waste of Money!","review":"My DC15 Animal is incredible. Everything this machine touches becomes immaculate. We vacuum weekly and our new Dyson sucked up years of ground-in dirt with the first use. Our carpets didn't need cleaning, they needed a real vacuuming. Housework is actually fun when you can really see a difference when you are done. Get one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Dyson!","review":"I recently purchased the Dyson DC 15. It is lightweight and did a great job picking up my Dog's hair. The price at Amazon was the lowest I had seen for this product. The swivel design makes it easy to pick up dirt in tight corners and very easy to use. I only gave it 4 stars because this is my first Dyson and I've only used it a few weeks. Overall, very happy with the price from Amazon and the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Animal!","review":"This machine is an animal! I could not believe the performance. It is worth the $$ and I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I think the Dyson Animal is an awesome product for the most part. I have some issues with getting the attachment hose unattached from the vacuum so I can use the attachments. The ball makes it very easy to steer. I really appreciate that the power cord is much longer than any other vacuum I've ever had. Emptying the contents is VERY easy with absolutely NO mess! I would suggest this product to anyone who has an animal with long hair, as it picks up the hair very easily, and doesn't get clogged unlike any other vacuum I've ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To The Hype","review":"I purchased this vacuum about a year and a half ago and curse it everytime I take it out of the closet. Yes, it has great suction for dog hair and dust but don't try anything much larger. You might as well pick it up by hand. But that isn't the problem here. This unit in addition to a questionable design has one of the CHEAPEST power cables you could put on a vacuum. At almost six hundred dollars for this unit I am appalled. The plastic I can deal with but not putting on a high quality power cable is just wrong. Dyson should be ashamed of themselves. On top of that forget using the attachements. It is just dumb. Obviously designed by someone who thought they were clever but doesn't live in the real world. Forget cute and make it work. For $250 this would be an ok machine but at $599 it just isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good suction but scratches floors badly","review":"Have had this vacuum for several years now. Worked great on carpeted floors but we recently remodeled our house with all African Walnut. Unfortunately the Dyson has resulted in significant scratches on the floors due to the very small hard plastic wheels under the head. Now looking for something more hardwood friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greate Vacuum","review":"I think this is a great vacuum cleaner for the price. I love the fact that all attachments are located on the vacuum and that you can use them very easily. The ball design is by far the best; you can easily navigate furniture legs and twist it in and out of corners. My only complaints are, the rug agitator doesn't dig into the carpet enough and the construction of the vacuum seems questionable. However, my concerns about the construction are but at ease with the five year warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dyson Animal is a Dog","review":"I bought a Dyson animal and initially I was happy with it. The first time my roommate used it, he damaged the attachment cover. Then the wand handle latch snapped off. This machine was used rarely. (I'm not the best housekeeper). A two year warranty won't help you when the plastic construction shatters in your hands! This was not an inexpensive purchase, and I expected a decent product.GayleAlexandria Virginia"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but heavy","review":"It is easy to maneuver, the ball works great! The on board tools are easily accessible but sometimes get knocked off. The way the hose extends and packs away is very convenient. The fact that the power brush is automatically on at power-up, forcing you to turn it off in many instances, is a nuisance -- it should be the other way around. The machine is a little heavy, but can be accommodated. Overall performance is fantastic. The carpet spray works better on set in stains than the dry cleaning product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great.","review":"This is my second Animal that I have purchased from Dyson. One for upstairs and one for downstairs. My first Dyson does not have the ball and the second one that I just purchase has the ball. I don't know how but this Dyson works better then my other Dyson. The new vacuum works great and is very easy to move around furniture and other items on the floor. The suction is great and the vacuum is very quiet. The 5 year warranty is another plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Vacuum I have ever owned!","review":"I have 4 dog's and one cat and every time I use my Dyson the carpet looks like it has just been shampooed. It works really great!!I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suction, great buy","review":"Having two cats, their hair and sand from cat litter had always been an issue. This has completely changed since the arrival of Dyson DC15 Animal. It is amazing how much this cleaner can suck in such a short period of time, and you can actually see how much you collected through the clear dust bin. After vacuuming, it feels like a new carpet! I never knew that vacuuming could be this fun! Though indeed pricy, we can definitely recommend this item, especially for those who have pets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine clogs","review":"My Dyson Animal clogs - incessantly. And it has from almost the beginning. It was not close to worth its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention pet owners and parents","review":"Okay, so it did seem crazy to spend so much on a vacuum but I now understand why we did. I have two long hair indoor cats and two young children so I really appreciate a vacuum that can clean up whatever they leave behind (ie hair and crumbs). I laugh because when I initially received it, I can say I vacuumed a few times a week. I cannot believe how much stuff was actually in my carpets. Now, I only need to vacuum once a week to maintain. I really enjoy the bagless feature and the ease of emptying/reconnecting the canister. The extended wand alows me to reach my high ceilings and the attachments make it possible to vacuum around my curtains and everywhere in between. This vacuum is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If only I could knit...","review":"This is a great product. The previous vac left lots of cat hair behind (2 Birmans). This vac picked up enough cat hair for a baby sweater, but, alas, I can't knit. It is the most maneuverable vac I've ever used. I used to have to move the coffee table to get between it and the sofa. With a flick of the wrist it got in the narrow space and worked fine.I agree with a recent reviewer that the manual is deficient. The diagrams are too small and the words are too few. And there are errors. The manual says that the on/off switch is yellow. It is red, with a circle that is sort of yellow if you look hard.Despite the manual I still think it is great.The only improvement I would like is a retractable cord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best vaccum I've ever owned!!!","review":"just recently perchased a dyson dc15 upright; best vaccum i've ever owned. It's easy to use, virtually quiet, and eats up dirt and dust like a real vaccum SHOULD."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does suck","review":"The best vacuum I have ever owned. Was using Wind Tunnel Self Propeled but this puts that to shame. It is very easy to change from carpet to bare floors with the touch of a button. One of the features I like best is it will go over throw rugs without sucking them into the carpet brush. I guess this sums it up. I have two dogs and a cat. I was emptying my wind tunnel bag about every 4 or 5 times I used it. I have to empty the Dyson almost every time because it picks up so much more pet hair. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Dyson!","review":"Not worth the money. Too heavy to maneuver, doesn't pick up all the dirt, there was one piece of dog kibble on the hard wood floor and it didn't even move it. It could suck up an army tank but if I can't use it, it is useless to me. NOT user friendly for this grandmother. It doesn't maneuver well from rug to hard wood floor or even wooden floors to linoleum. Worst investment we ever made. My Hoover did it all and it only cost $74 back in the day. A lot of hype for no bang at all. By the way, the instructions aren't very clear either. They tell you how to attach things but not how to unattach them. Poor investment and Dyson should consult women (especially us older ones who clean all the time) to upgrade his machines. It's heavy, cumbersome and I think it is possible that someone could get hurt using it. I am telling all my friends about this terrible product. Shame on Dyson for charging so much for something so difficult to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for people hair!","review":"Sadly I have to say that human hair can be just as much a pain as the beloved furry friend's hair, but this machine is AMAZING!! I have had long hair all of my life and have constantly dealt with nearly ruining vacuums because of my hair. Very user friendly for taking the beater bar area apart to clean around the bar as well as the wheels themselves. Easy empty and LOVE to use. You'd think that I never vacuum my house with as much as it collects with one pass through. Definitely worth saving for!My only issue is that I haven't quite figured out how to use the extension for the attachments. I get the hose out okay, but getting it back together and all back in place takes me a bit to figure it out, but I eventually get it and then I'm happy again. Not bad enough to dislike it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dyson DC 15","review":"Great product. Works very well. Only down side is that it is very loud.

I found that it wouldn't pick up M&M's that a kid had spilled on the floor or small pieces of paper, it doesn't have an edge cleaner, it blows lint up into the air, and the hose and attachments are not easy to use. Not to mention, it is bulky and won't fit under furniture or cabinet edges. It took me awhile to figure out how to \\"drop\\" the base so I could push it around, no foot lever! I had to place one foot on the base to hold it down while I tipped the body back. I'll stick with my Hoover Wind Tunnel for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this overpriced vaccum","review":"I bought the Dyson DC15 animal vaccum about a year ago as I wanted a realgood vaccum cleaner after going through 2 Hoover Windtunnels in about 4 years.

I have finally cancled my order for thebrushbar and I am going to throw it in the garbage where this Dyson belongs and will go out and buy another brand.

It weighs a TON and has the DUMBEST, lousiest design ever.1. cannot vacuum under furniture because it is so large,2. the hardwood floor attachment pushes stuff around because the bristles block the suction3. the hose and entire design are incredibly akward --to get suction the hose will bend and block air, thus you must often hold + unbend the hose while simultaneously vacuuming.4. you will injure your back with the weight of this beast.5. save your money, it breaks just like the cheaper brands, and the hose replacement is well over $1006. So after 1.5 years of a broken back, you can have my piece of dirt for free and I'm going to buy a new cannister every year as they break all the time anyhow."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"unfortunately this vacuum does not work as well as an old dirt devil it was designed to replace. the canister \\"dump\\" is nice - but suction is not as advertised - and unit is heavy and difficult to use.may be good compared to many - but would not purchase again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!","review":"This is such an amazing vacuum cleaner!

One of the big things that seriously annoyed me about my previous vacuum cleaners was the noise level. The Dyson is much less noise. It is also very maneuverable, which can take some getting used to, but once I figured it out, I don't think I can go back to a regular vacuum cleaner again. It is lighter than my old vacuum. the only possible negative thing I can say about it is that I don't quite get how the hose and attachments work just yet, but with a little more practice I'm sure those will be no problem. I would recommend this vacuum to anyone. I was a little put off by the price, but it is so much better than my old vacuum cleaner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I purchased this pen in hopes that my penmanship would improve...and it did..dramatically!

I have tested two Namiki Falcon pens with different inks and several papers. The problem was presented with all ink/paper combinations to a lesser or greater extent.

This one is the first that meets all of my expectations: it flows beautifully, has lovely thick and thin lines, is light, and is made for a smaller hand. Any handwriting with this pen looks fantastic. Used with Noodler's Black ink, it seems to never clog, even after going unused for a long while. It doesn't leak ever, even on the airplane. I use it for general writing, sketching, inking illustrations, etc. I was able to try this pen vs many others in a pen store in Manhattan, and this was able to make finer lines than any other pen I tried. The flexibility of the nib makes linework very organic and beautiful.

His vocals have a lot of passion but don't sound overdone due to his vocal capabilites. This means that these songs are very touching. Also, there is a 1989 gem, a live version of \\"Something's gotten hold of my heart\\" duet with Marc Almond.

Leaks of possible bamboozling (kispus) of funds by opponent's husband to the press leading to tragic end, victim is kept on life support, wife is hospitalised , son is bought to stay away, all this in an attempt to secur power with all arrogant manners possible. The real character of this politician is exposed by the journalists but still gets another high level position. All in all entertaining movie. Those who likes this type of movie might want to check out Borgen , another danish TV series about political intrigues, similar to previous american White House series."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"I have several corrugated scratchers and sisal posts in my home.

I came across the Big Mama's Scratchy Box while just browsing. When I received it I didn't hold much hope that my cats would use them. I was wrong. I unpacked them, sprinkled on a little bit of the cat nip that came with them, within one minute my first cat got on his, scratching and rolling around. Soon my other cat got on his. They not only scratch on them, they nap on them. I did not realize that the scratchy pad was going to be made of corrugated board and my cats fling little pieces of it around, but it's still better than attacking my furniture. I figured that they would last about a week, but I've had them for about a month now and they aren't destroyed yet. I'll buy more when these are gone. I love them and my kitty's love them. My housekeeper...not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Cats Love It!","review":"The size of this scratchy box is perfect, even for my horribly overweight cat. She loves sitting on it. It's her favorite place to be. The free toy is great, too. My kitten had a blast playing with it (until he lost it). I'm waiting for the cardboard to wear down so I can buy another. It's a win-win.

The other two (same brand, but the ramp and a over the door hang) he could care less about, but this box? HE LOVES! Ran right to it and scratches on it every day. He puts all his toys by it and even naps on it from time to time. It was PREFECT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitties LOVE this","review":"My three cats love this thing!

Definitely enhances his healthy cat-like instincts. I've only had it a few days and he is already loving it. He goes and scratches on it and lays on it all day long, throughout the day. An absolutely fabulous product that every cat will love! Not only that but it looks great too with the little tassles and cute cat drawings. I think my cat thinks its his little throne :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsessed Cats","review":"I bought this for one of my cats to replace a cat scratcher that she had no interest in. My cats love this brand of cat toys so I thought I would try out the double wide size. Not only did the cat I order it for become obsessed with it but my other two cats are in love with it too. There has already been many stand offs and fights over the scratcher. I will say the cardboard will start to come apart quickly if your cats are obsessive pickers.

Both our cats loved this from the get-go and we haven't even added the catnip yet. One of our cats uses it as scratching post while the other immediately curled up and went to sleep on it for several hours.

It's an excellent way for a beginner, even someone who already knows non-optical communications, to begin learning about the optical communications space.It covers all the optical components, including fiber characteristics, LEDs, lasers, photodetectors, optical amplifiers and more. If you're looking for a good introduction to optical communications, this is it.The only negative is one common to all books on optical communications. The book was actually written in 1998 and earlier. While much hasn't changed, much has.

Having mercifully been able to block much of that from my memory, I found Joel AChenbach's witty play by play of the shenenagians much more informative then I remember the media's reporting at the time to have been. This book is worth the read just to read Al Gore's impassioned call to open all the foil reserves so every American can have a baked potato with all the trimmimgs! A wickedly funny look at a time that needs to be remembered so its follies will not be repeated.

I used this book in my first year Legal Research and Writing class and found it extremely helpful in learning the basics of effective legal writing. Additionally, I often referenced this book during my summer positions as a clerk for a federal judge and an associate at a large law firm, where I receieved consistently positive reviews of my writing. I owe those successful results to the tools and insights I learned from this book. It is useful both during law school and throughout one's legal career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great legal investment","review":"This book taught me how to legally write during my first year of lawschool, and I still reference it. Rather than just stating this is what a certain section of a memo should contain, the book contains a variety of examples of legal memos. The examples really helped me learn how to legally write and serve as a great reference point when I now have questions on my writing. Additionally, the TREAT format that the book proposes recieved great reviews from employers. For anyone learning to legally write, this book is a great investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISHONEST REVIEWS","review":"The reviews of this book are dishonest and deceptive--because of the recent publication date, many reviews are plainly erroneous.The book was first published in July 2005, which means that nobody except 1Ls who just started their summer jobs a few weeks ago have been exposed to the book. Therefore, all the reviews that say users have used the book during their summer associateships, or for multiple years are either mistaken about the book they used, or they are fraudulent reviews.Earlier in the year there were bad reviews of the book, but they have been deleted. THe book is very poorly written and organized--in a book that is supposed to teach about good, clear writing, there were countless embarrasing errors.

I will offer a disclaimer, though - I couldn't tell you if the traditional IRAC is any better. To give these authors the benefit of the doubt, I bet it's equally lousy. But if all they're doing is dressing up the same old stuff in different packaging and calling it their own for more than $50 a pop, I'd rather pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Waste of Money","review":"If you're looking for a legal writing resource, look elsewhere.

This is VERY disappointing. I was really looking forward to using this book and now I have to send it back.

It had a decent plot, no rising action, a predictable climax, and a twisted ending. It would have been wise to concentrate on one or two characters. However, this books was maybe 300 pages but had like 20 different characters. Prince is the only artist that I know who has the ability to drop new material every three monthes.

The cover looked interesting and seeing that 50 Cent wrote it, I thought it would be a good book to add to my repertoire for reluctant readers. I was excited thinking I had really ran across something that my teen students would gobble up. I realized after reading the first 3 pages, which describes in much detail the main character having sex with his girlfriend, that this book wasn't going to fly. AFter reading a few more pages, the language and content aren't something that I would want my students to be exposed to.

However, these mysteries are old news for a genius such as Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr. Watson. Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is an interesting film, but the overall picture lacks the usual spice that Wilder used to combine into his creations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not you're average holmes....","review":"Is Holmes gay? That's the first thing addressed in this movie. Fans of Sherlock Holmes will be dissapointed with this rendition of the famous detective. Though his performance is bearable, it's not faithfull to the character. Even less is the portrail of Dr. Watson as a hotheaded and sour man, who gets so flustered with holmes he almsot attacks him. totally out of bounds!The plot it'self is rather conveluted, and mundane, and in the end nothing exciting happens after everything they built up. The first 30 mins of the story is unrelated to the next hour and a half save for establishing that holmes doesn't like women. Which is suppose to shock you as he semi-falls in love with the female protagonist.A boring movie with more of a spoof of holmes than an actual rendition of the character. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regional Prejudice","review":"Those 'extras' on the DVD look fascinating - so why, oh why are they not available outside Region 1?

It should be added to the ranks of \\"The Magnificent Ambersons\\" as a tragic loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Basis of the Film","review":"Having not yet seen the DVD I have, however, seen the film on its first theatrical release (double billed with MCKenna's Gold). Most folks reviewing the film mention Miklos Rozsa's fine score. Few realize that Billy Wilder based the plot ideas for the film on the Miklos Rozsa Violin Concerto and that Rozsa adapted the Concerto themes to form the basis for the score. Find the 1955 Jascha Heifeitz recording on RCA (available on CD)or look for the 6 minutes adapted Fantasy recorded by Rozsa. If ever there was music to inspire a Sherlock Holmes story this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Sherlock","review":"Very funny if a little uneven comedy with a rather weak ending. The scene between Holmes and the Prima Ballerina is brilliantly funny as is the fall-out from this with Dr. Watson. This movie for me is really underated and is a classic. The plot is driven by Holmes ambivalent sexuality never quite being defined.

This is the worst Sherlock Holmes movie ever. I did watch this movie all the way through, but only because I will watch any Sherlock Holmes movie. Most everything about this feeble attempt is lame. Christopher Lee is good as Sherlock's brother, but he can't overcome the weak dialogue. The thing I like the best about Sherlock Holmes movies is all the little detecting that Sherlock does using minor clues that nobody else notices, but Billy Wilder seems to be scrupulously avoiding this integral part of the Holmes character. Holmes is not a detective in this one. This plot is implausible and silly. The principle actors are miscast. (Watch for Stanley Holloway as a grave digger) The dialogue is absurd. This is a humorless, flaccid movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"When writing, it felt 'extremely gritty'. It was not fluid at all.

In this short book, I learned a great deal about that tulmultuous period of Scottish history, the individuals involved, and the geography (helped by having visited Edinburgh). The story is told deftly, with the author able to keep the events clear and exciting, even though there are many complicated details and a great number of individuals who play a role.

No Ronald Reagan, no Eisenhower, no Calvin Coolidge to counteract such Leftism...not even James Madison. And then when one opens the book, one can see that George Bush was hardly quoted at all, despite serving two full terms, while once again, Barack Obama is quoted extensively, despite him barely even getting into the White House when this book was published.

Then, midstream, the narrative abruptly changes and begins detailing the protagonist's self-destructive behavior, ultimately culminating in a poorly conceived trip to join the circus. The writing throughout is strong, but I wish the author had stuck with the original plotline, without devolving into a _White Oleander_-esque parade of horribles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think about it for a second...","review":"This book was not engrossing at all. It was descriptive in the uninteresting parts and too quick in gliding over the parts that needed more explanation.But the worst part of it all is explaining to another person what the book is about. So, half the book is about a girl, her odd family, and the way she encounters religion. Suddenly, her brother dies. She ends up working in the cardboard factory with her father and starts dating a 30-something year old. The parents find out and she's shipped off to college where she stays for about two pages before running away to the circus. She wants to become a clown and is sleeping with the fire-breather.

They should be a place where we have accountablility to one another, and have a chance to serve. At the same time, they should be more than just a place where we gather to exchange opinions about the Bible -- we are looking for God's truth, not just man's perceptions.

It also is impressively devoid of any overabundance of self-pitty, yet aptly captures a feeling of isolation and loneliness. There are inherent similarities to other notable titles that capture the growing pains of coming of age: \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", \\"Lord of the Flies\\", \\"My Fractured Life\\", and \\"A Complicated Kindness.\\" There is a strange salvation in the lyrical bleakness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sympatico - Tom Freund","review":"Tom Freund is a very talented musician - he's a bass player and a good song writer.

Unfortunately, that is not the case. This pump bareley provides enough flow over a 3 1/2 foot high urn style fountain even though the specs say good for up to 4 feet - even at maximum flow setting and clean piping.Would definitely suggest going to a much larger model - even twice the flow rate, and dial back if necessary to suit the need."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first review was deleted.","review":"The picture of this pump and the actual pump are not the same.

Everytime these two join together, you can always expect something great to result. Volver is no exception. After such mediocre American films, it was nice to see Penélope Cruz go back and make a Spanish langage film. She is absolutely fantastic in this movie and it is perhaps the best film of her carrer. sShe plays the role with such honesty and heart it is difficult not to feel and understand what she is going through.

Leading the cast is Penelope Cruz as the domineering Raimunda...a woman who is not below burying her dead husband before the police can ever ask questions. Equally good as Irene, Raimunda's mother, is Carmen Maura, whose facial expressions give us some of the most wonderful moments of \\"Volver\\".

It is great to see a movie that has explored something new, plot-wise. I don't want to reveal the plot, there are twists...!I enjoyed it very much and am now buying it for my daughters.

The film is a paean to women's strength, like a more mature. complex \`Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'. Full of wonderful images, moments and plot twists, from a murdered good-for nothing husband who must be disposed of, to a long dead mother who returns as a ghost to explain the past. Or maybe she's not quite dead. Full of fun scenes, and terrific performances.But - for me - something gets a little lost in the last 20 minutes - plot elements that need to be explained never are, while things I didn't really care about, or liked the unsolved mystery of, are explained in great, literal detail that somehow lessens the impact. None-the-less, yet another imaginative, creative, funny and thoughtful film by Almodovar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Volver a verla!","review":"This was an awesome movie! The family dynamics are intriguing and you'll love the mystery of the mother that returns from the grave. There is one scene of partial nudity and some sexual content.

The mass decontamination scene was fairly accurate (your birthday suit and a fire hose; some people not hearing about no eating drinking or smoking until after decon too late) as was the training exercise and the reality gap beweeen the prime minister (local government)and the fire department. For use to depict to non-professional emergency responder personnel the overall complexities and harsh reality being faced daily by government and firefighters/paramedics/etc., this is an excellent movie.

The album is one of my favorites of all time. It's got everything. Relaxing, soothing, thought provoking music, funky get up and dance music, or if you just wanna chill and bob your head, this album's got it all. And if you ain't even into music and want to study a lyrical masterpiece, this album will accomodate you!

K-Os not only rejects commercial rappers, but also elegantly graces over any genre of music available.

From the production to the lyrics, to the paper album-style case it comes in, K-Os has done what no one else has ever done, created the most soulful genre ever.

This review is not about the film, it is about the product. I had a VHS copy taken off the TV and missing the last thirty seconds, so this DVD is technically an improvement. That being said, the quality sucks big time. I don't regret the purchase and hopefully you won't either, but it is far from the presentation this film deserves. It looks like it was shot off of a dupe of a dupe of a scratchy 16 MM print. If this is the best quality available then Just Imagine is one step away from being a lost film. I'm happy enough to have this DVD, but I hope somewhere, someone has a good print that can be the basis of a remastered version someday. This will have to stand in for it until then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotton Sci-fi Gold!","review":"For the time this was made, this movie has a lot of wonderful elements.

He is befriended by 2 guys who have romantic problems. One of them decides to go in a trip to Mars to win the love of his girl, and the 3 chums blast off to the red planet on a ground breaking journey.

This book appears to have been written more for the marketing manager who has database marketers reporting to him or her, but who has no direct involvement in the process. This book is just a basic overview of what database marketing is, with no practical use.Even the examples appear contrived and not actual case studies.Incidentally, years after purchasing this book, I took a database marketing course in my MBA program that was taught by the wife of one of the authors.

It is Franco Zeffirelli's nightmare of a wet dream. I am not a purist, and I like experimental opera productions, but this is just plain horrible. The cuts are too many to list (including Desdemona's \\"Wilow Song\\"), and they are not limited to scenes and arias. At times it sounds like every other note has been removed. There are extended pauses where they do not belong and two ballet scenes with mediocre music that is nowhere in the score. If there was ever a doubt over who-Verdi or Zeffirelli-had better musical and dramatic judgment, this travesty should settle it. The last act in particular sounds like it was run through a food processor. This movie should not be seen by anyone ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What? No Willow Song?

He was determined to use all the bells and whistles of which the new house was capable, and in doing so he upstaged the world premiere of the opera, to such an extent that the opera \\"failed\\" and has never recovered at the Met.All this is to say that he's done it again. Meat cleaver, as someone else has said, to Verdi's score and the libretto. Visuals may tell a story very well, but when the music which is presumably the raison d'etre of the film is sacrificed, something is clearly out of focus. Anyone looking for a film of Verdi's Otello will have to look elsewhere; this is Zeffirelli's Otello, first and last. A gigantic waste of visuals and a stellar cast.

When I came across this on Amazon at a relatively inexpensive price I thought I had found what I was looking for.Unfortunately, upon arrival, the needle was pointing near the bottom, far out of the thermometer's scale. Hoping that full deflection of the needle might correct the problem, I placed it in the oven and set it to 500 deg F. It was low by the same amount as it was at room temperature. After letting it cool down, the needle went to the original (wrong) position. It did not catch at room temperature.

I have nothing against sex scenes in a story but this time it bothered me. But the main issue that wanted me to put this book down is the inwoven politics.

Every sentence has the exact same ominous-sounding, Dragnet-style tone, regardless of whether she is reading something about a suspected murderer, or the characters' discussions over dinner, or bedroom love-making! It was absolutely dreadful narration.As for the story itself, which was tedious listening due to the abysmal performance by the narrator, it was not very exciting to me.

The deal breaker for me is that it gives off a very strong smell of mothballs. Mothballs themselves would probably work if you ground them up. They cost more than the Snake Away. We unknowingly put it where the fumes could get into the house via the air handler and it was pretty awful until the stuff wore off.So, if you have a problem with the strong smell of mothballs, then you need to find another way to control the snakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snake -a Way","review":"I ordered this product because my house backs up to a huge empty field and this year everytime I walked out back there was a different snake.

Unfortunately, that's where this book's only star is gained. Alston tends to chase himself around, over, and through his topics, leaving the reader with no line of thought that can be consistently followed. He fails to connect his theology to his philosophy of language. His philosophy of language fails to agree with or elucidate either common sense notions of language or linguistic findings, and his theology is nothing remarkable.

I did feel tingling as was mentioned in the product insert, so it was expected and tolerated well. However, I did feel the need to also use another more soothing cream inbetween or instead of at times. Maybe thats just me. I did like the way my skin looked using the product. Fine lines were definetly less pronounced. I think if you are one to tolerate the tingling I would say give it a try.

By far, it is the best skin-softening/resurfacing cream I've ever used. I use it only once daily, after my morning facial wash and apply it beneath my make-up. Throughout the day, it leaves my entire face soft, smooth, firmer with fewer pockmarks, and I believe it has helped to reduce (or at least lessen) the lines beneath and around my eyes. I apply only a Vitamin-E cream beneath my eyes at night and don't feel the need to use Skin Doctors a second time each day. All my life, I have suffered from acne and rough-textured skin ...

Every other page of the book is filled with the tearful faces of parents living without children, complete with unhappy faces plastered about the sky.Not only is the imagery unpleasant, but it is downright scary for young children to see broken homes and upset parents. Furthermore, it reinforces a highly co-dependent way of living.It does not surprise me that the author of this book has 10 children, with every intention to keep adopting more. It's clear that she feels the same way as the parents in the book: her life is defined solely by children, and she may be lacking in a well-defined sense of self. Watching her children mature to become independent adults may leave her with a hole in her heart, as the book's verses suggest, because she has not taken the time to know herself beyond her role as parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Crime CAN Pay","review":"True Crime sells, and you may as well be the one to write it.

If you are riding the fence trying to decide if the trucking industry is for you or not, I would recommend starting with \\"Secrets the Trucking Compoanies Don't Want You to Know\\", however if you have made your decision to go into the trucking industry this book is a \\"MUST READ\\" on how to get the most personal growth, fun, and excitemtent out of your new chosen profession."},{"rating":"2","title":"review truck book","review":"This is a grate book about the first hand observations of a USA truck driver.The writer is honest and intelligent, and writes of all the experiences he encountered whilst working as a truck driver and puts forward solutions to most of the problems, besides that - its a good read even if you dont want to work as a truck driver.The writer has a good perspective of truck driving because he has worked in many different fields outside of the transport industry. Im very happy with my purchase and recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Guide For Beginning Truckers","review":"This book is a great guide for anyone interested in becoming a long haul trucker. It helps navigate through all the government regulations and the red tape involved in obtaining one's Commercial Drivers License. Great help in dealing with truck driving schools and obtaining one's first trucking job. The book also details many of the pitfalls and associated problems of life on the road as a long haul driver. An interesting read for experienced over the road drivers, but no new information here for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to read! Funny and informative!","review":"Great book to read, even for people not interested in trucking whatsoever! Steve Richards is hilarious in the way he explains the truck driving industry, or the way he explains anything, for that matter. The book keeps getting better and better with each page and each chapter. I recommend everyone read this book because it is not only funny and entertaining, but it is also informative in the way it brings light to an important American industry that most Americans know nothing about. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good time flick!","review":"This isn't Fellini. Its spaghetti bolognese, low budget, cute, and funny.

The idea of the movie has potential to be hilariously funny or a great suspense movie; what I watched was neither. The story jumps around from place to place so fast missing key details that you almost feel lost at times. None of the actors do any good making the story believable. The acting was so forced at times that I felt like I was watching a very bad play. If ramdom people were picked off of the street you would get higher quality acting. From the very first \\"Mexican\\" scene on I was caught up in how over the top fake it was. The camera is never even held steady. The only descent job done in this movie was by the dog, although I never really understood why the dog was such a major part of the plot.This movie reminds me of a bunch of kids getting their parents video camera and trying to shoot a movie. It's just that bad. If I could have gave it 0 stars I would have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great direction!","review":"I saw this movie in new york at least a year ago, granted I did have several cocktails prior to seeing it, but it was hilarious.

This Omarion wanna-be has the worst voice I've ever heard in my entire life. His beats are whack, his lyrics are amazingly bad, and his image... HA, it's not even his image, it's Omarion's (of B2K).

Especially if you're the type of person that buys a lot of fish oil in bulk, you have to be careful as, generally speaking, the potency of the oil diminishes over time. At least that has been my experience.This product definitely works. I can feel it. My eyesight seems to be a little better, and my thinking a little bit clearer. Not all krill oil is created the same. I have had krill oil in the past that was not that much better than fish oil because of the low potency dose. So be sure to read the labels before buying krill oil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Krill Oil","review":"I have had various fish oil and I really like this one. It does smell fishy if you take a whiff of the open bottle, but it doesn't taste fishy and I've had no trouble with this one. My spouse likes this brand better than others we have tried. It has no wheat, gluten, soybeans, dairy, eggs, fish, peanuts/tree nuts. It does contain shellfish. The recommended dose is two capsules per day. My bottle says 400 mg Omega-3 complex (including 115 mg EPA and 65 mg DHA) and 50 mcg Astaxanthin* per dose. *Please verify my typing on the manufacturer's website."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's shell fish extract - of course it smells","review":"but not any more than if you had a shrimp coctail.I started taking this last year for arthritis and cholesterol, and I noticed in a month's time my movements were less painful and I felt better.only a couple negatives:the need to offer bottles of 180 caps or more so you can get a 3 month supplythe price - 30 cents a pill when you buy the 60 quantity.half that would make me feel alot better (no pun intended)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent product, just smelly when you open the bottle","review":"The Jarrow Krill Oil is from Antartic krill which some feel is a better krill. The only drawback with this product is its smell, but that is gone once you put it in your mouth and leaves no burpy fishy aftertaste. As to the benfits of the product I cannot speak of that because I have not taken it long enough to notice a difference or had blood work which would show any changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great size to swallow compared to Fish Oil capsules","review":"There is an abundance of research from many medical disciplines (e.g. Neurology, Psychiatry, Orthopedics, Cardiology, Pulmonology)that advocate the intake of Omega fatty acids (\\"Essential fatty acid\\"). Like Fish Oil, Krill oil is a source of two such Omega fatty acids, EPA & DHA. Some studies have found that both Fish Oil and Krill Oil are comparable sources of Omega 3 fatty acids. Some say that Krill Oil delivers more Omega fatty acids.Jarrow's Krill Oil capsules are a fantastic size for someone like me who hates swallowing large fish oil gel calps.It's difficult to tell if there is much difference between the Krill Oil or my Fish Oil supplements over such a short time period (<30 days), but it has been a pleasure swallowing these capsules!As a healthcare provider, I advocate not only food sources of Omega fatty acids, but also daily supplements. The health benefits are many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whales love it, and so will you","review":"Krill oil is a wonderful way to get essential fatty acids if you don't enjoy fish oil. The nutritional components surpass most fish oils, and there is no fishy aftertaste. I have to say that I use Nordic Naturals fish oils and never experience that, but many brands are not so fresh and easy to use. Taking these capsules helps with skin and hair health, mood, pain relief (EFAs are great for joint pain, cramps, etc.). They are one of the easiest ways to help memory and your immune system. I like that they are lower on the food chain, too. In addition, krill is abundant in our oceans; I feel better about supplementing my diet with Krill Oil than fish oil, if the truth be told, just from the standpoint of sustainability. Jarrow is one of the brands that I trust implicitly for quality and consistently well-researched supplements. Try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Salmon","review":"You're probably taking fish oil because of a sensible desire to up your intake of omega-3 fatty acids. Krill has two advantages over salmon from what I know. First, in krill, 30 to 65 percent of the fatty acids are in phospholipids, primarily phosphtidylcholine, which is absorbed better by our bodies, especially our brains, than the triglyceride form of omega-3 found in salmon. Second, krill are further down the food chain and are less likely to contain as many contaminants.Jarrow is a well respected brand but so isNOW Foods Neptune Krill Oil 500mg, 120 Softgels,. I'd probably comparison shop and go with whichever is less expensive at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those of you who wanted info on potency....","review":"I haven't used this product in this brand yet but I have just started using Krill Oil.

With all the rave reviews, I thought this was a bulls-eye purchase. Going on Jarrow's good reputation and good experience I had with their other products, I thought I'd give their Krill Oil a try. Well, as soon as you open the bottle you get knocked over by a overwhelming nasty stench of rancid fish. Putting one in my mouth was a hurdle, swallowing one down was a battle. Still, because of Jarrow being a good company I gave these a fair chance. About 1 week. Needless to say I can no longer stand the stink, the taste and I'm getting an upset stomach too. Rather than go through the hassle of returning the items ( I bought 2 bottles...stupid, I know...), they are going right into the garbage.Jarrow, you are a good company. Please do something about this horrible product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse smelling krill oil EVER!","review":"I can't even get it near my nose, let alone in my mouth.

If the viewer happens to be familiar with Post-WWII Berlin, all the better. Unless the movie is used for study purposes, I am not sure if a less than 50 year old viewer will appreciate the movie to the fullest. In fact the younger the viewer, the less he'll be able to enjoy all the subtilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cagney at his best, you never know where he's going next.","review":"This warped comedy, set in Berlin just before the wall went up, is one of James Cagney's best. His harried Coca Cola exec. is the poster child for stress. Tapped to take care of his bosses impulsive daughter, Cagney goes through the wringer trying to stay away from disaster. And just when both you and he think the situation cannot get any worse, the bosses daughter runs off and marries an East German Communist. Just wait and see how Cagney, spewing out line after line of rappid fire dialogue, gets out of this mess. Masterfully directed by Billy Wilder, this, unfortunatly, little seen movie is a must see for any series fan of classic cinema, and also for those who just want to laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT LAST!","review":"I have been waiting for this movie to be published on DVD since DVD was born. Suffice to say: my two daughters, who were 5 and 8 at the time, never wanted to watch a black and white movie until my wife and I introduced them to this comedic masterpiece (13 years ago). They laughed hysterically then and they still do. The term \\"rapid-fire\\" was invented to describe Cagney's delivery during the last act. Our copy that we taped from The Movie Channel is just about worn out. This gem is coming out at just the right time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good show, poor DVD","review":"We sent the DVD to relatives as a gift. We had seen the show before and really liked it.

Wilder's sharp direction and Cagney's top-notch performance give the film the needed oompah to rush it to the rapid fire ending. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the discerning, the funniest movie EVER!","review":"Ah, the absurdity of the Cold War. Let's remember that Billy Wilder was Austrian; who knew better the hypocrisy and stupidity of the two newly emerged lumbering giants. Unbelievably hysterical. Cagney is truly the ultimate comedic actor. How they kept up this pace throughout the movie is truly amazing. Five stars to everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes comedy from a gangister","review":"I never liked his gangister movies, but Jimmy Cagney is so funny in this movie it will leave you with a stitch in your side from laughter. I don't know why he didn't win a Acadmey Award for his efforts. Arlene Frances was also wonderful as his wife, trying to bring Jimmy back to the real world, and his family. A supersonic paced comedy if there ever was one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest movie ever.","review":"Greate cast, including unexpected early career actors. The last hour is non stop hilarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Cagney, at his Comedic Best","review":"James Cagney combined with Billy Wilder! Win-win.

One of his best films!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten Gem!","review":"This Cagney movie is a \\"forgotten Gem\\" but definately should not be over looked. With Direction by the great Billy Wilder, we are treated to Cagney at his best. This was his last movie before going into a 20yr. hiatus from Hollywood. Packed with \\"one-liners\\" and the great Cagney razor-tongued wit, it is a \\"must see\\"!!The rest of the cast holds their own but watch for Hanns Lothar as \\"Schlemmer\\". He steals the show at times.Filled with non-stop laughs and one-liners from beginning to end. It ranks right up there with Yankee Doodle Dandy and White Heat."},{"rating":"2","title":"one,two.three","review":"I like this old classic.

He brought tears to my eyes In Yankee Doodle Dandy and with this film he makes me laugh. Ladies and gentleman THIS is true talent. The supporting cast was equally great (does anyone recognize the voice of the guy who did the Boris Bad N Off from the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons here???). Both Pam Tiffin and Lilo Pulver are HOT more than enough to make one defect. CLEARLY this movie was made around the time of SOME LIKE IT HOT (the man in the dress gag).

That's ridiculous! Sure, this disappointing movie touches on a number of Cold War cultural/political issues, but only in a very lazy, superficial way. The comic situations are too forced and unimaginative, very few of the gags pay off, and most of the performances are shrill (only the great Cagney manages to shine in this mess). The whole project comes off like a rush job using a rough-draft script. It's an embarrassment coming from the director who gave us one of the great comedies of all time, Some Like It Hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but no.","review":"So, before the other reviewers jump all over me and accuse me of all manner of personal deficiencies, let me state for the record that I am over 40, remember the Cold War very clearly, am not a PC leftist, and am perfectly capable of enjoying wacky farce.That said, this movie just didn't work for me. The premise was good, but the jokes were only occasionally funny - most of them were lazy and feeble and just fell flat. And except for Cagney, the actors were too shrill and strident. Everyone was straining SO HARD to get it across that \\"Hey, folks, this is REALLY FUNNY STUFF here, can't you see us sweat?\\" Comedy needs to appear effortless. This movie is wearisome.Okay, let the motive-sniffing and ad hominem remarks begin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ship That Flew by Hilda Lewis","review":"I read this lovely, enchanting book when I was..... under ten yrs old and I've never forgotten it. I got it out from the library some months ago and read it to my wife and teen-age children, who just LOVED it. So now, at almost 50, I MUST have it in my library! If you have an opportunity, have a read; it will awaken the child fantasy mind in you again.It's a story of a young boy who falls in love with a model of a wee Viking ship, small enough to fit in his pocket.\\" \\"how much is it?\\" \\"All the money in the world, and a little bit over\\" said the shopkeeper.

A real gem from Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards at the height of their film relationship (i.e. three years after they made The Pink Panther)."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Mr. Bean...","review":"I have been a big Peter Sellers fan for most of my life, but didn't know anything about this movie until watching Ebert & Roeper, who named it a comedy classic. My husband asked me to order it, and we were NOT disappointed. The whole family enjoyed it tremendously, and while my husband and I had to do a little explaining about the 60's culture where everyone drinks and smokes, my kids enjoyed the slapstick qualities that they appreciate so much in the Mr. Bean videos they've grown up with. If you have fond memories of those hip 60's movies and/or are a fan of Peter Sellers' comedic genius, I whole-heartedly recommend this movie. We give it 4 thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine print","review":"Really was excited to locate this film. Bought it immediately. Would not play.Turns out it only works in the UK or something like that. Seller said read the fine print. Who does that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Party","review":"A very funny 60's movie. Peter Sellers is once again teamed up with Blake Edwards for a movie that has him bumbling through life not knowing the havoc he's causing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sellers","review":"Peter Sellers is at his best here. No one could play a funnier Hindu than him! I doubt any native East Indian could do it better. He has all the mannerisms and accents down perfectly! This is movie that could never be made today with all the hyper-sensitivity around. Perhaps this is why we don't have any great comedians anymore. This is because none feel they can take risks like this. Humor has lost its edge. Another reviewer got it right when they said this film is homage to old silent movies. It certainly is. If it were not for Seller's humor this would be just another dated 60s movie. Seller's makes it amusing and fun to watch. The body language is great. His Hinduisms will make you crack up every time. He has the line down perfectly. Only a Brit could satire members of a former colony like this and be able to get away with it! Watch for the humor and spectacle of it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"the funniest movie made","review":"this movie is made in the late 60's early 70s' it is friggin halrius. its the funniest movie on the market. Im 17 and hate old movies but this one is just halarius and made me laugh thruout the entire movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going... Going... Gone.","review":"Seller's is on top of his game with this 60's gem. Very rarely do we get to see a film that centers around one character but places the greater emphasis on the other actors. Granted it is a typical Blake Edwards \\"quick laugh - slow story\\" picture, it does give us a delightfully satirical look at a Hollywood that has not and never will change. What saddens me about a film of this calibre is that it is destined to be lost by future generations who just don't understand the 60's party scene. Without kegs and bongs, it just won't make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog Barf","review":"This is a terrible, terrible movie. It is not funny. It is not clever.

Let me say right off that I am a very funny person and totally sarcastic. I love British humor- John Cleese is cool. So maybe Peter Sellers is too stupid for my refined taste. But hey- isn't funny supposed to be funny for everyone? How can this movie be labeled a comedy? It made me cry-from the realization that I had just wasted two hours that I could have used in fulfilling my life. What a waste of little grey cells. Birdie Num-Num- in my mind that is akin to Barney humor. Total humor cesspool. This movie basically takes place in one room- how great is that? And then the elephant- just as I said \\"What more can they fit in?\\" out struts the elephant! And the bathroom scene- toilet paper and watercolor painting? How distasteful is that? How profoundly lacking in intellect. Anyone who watches this movie and actually likes it is a disgrace to humor. Please- don't watch this, don't buy this- spare yourself HELL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Brain Hurts","review":"This is one of the most retarded movies that I have ever seen.

I remember thinking it might seem dated and bland now. It is not!In fact, I recommend a new American tradition. Buy the DVD, invite over friends or family for a \\"The Party Party\\", provide a few snacks, and let the laughs begin. It might be their first and only chance to share in an experience that they would likely miss in their lifetime, and you could enjoy seeing the results.

For those of us who are tired of the over-the-top and under-the-brain stem humor of Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler, Sellers's subtlety and constant attention to comic detail (I could just watch his facial expressions for about fifteen straight minutes laughing) is a welcome, hilarious respite. The downside: the film does come off a little racist, as some of the humor is drawn from the character's Indian ethnicity. But, as they say, it's all in good fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Film, period.","review":"I remember this as the funniest film I ever saw.

I have and repeatedly watch all 5. Wanting more of the same, and after reading glowing reviews here, I ordered The Party. Halfway through, I just wanted to put us both out of our misery, but I persevered to the end. Ugh. I think I laughed outloud once or twice. Mostly, I just felt uncomfortable and wondered what was supposed to be funny about each scene. Trust me, I'm not politically correct. His portrayal of an Indian was just fine by me. It's more that the situations the hapless character found himself in made him seem more pitiful than funny--and not endearingly pitiful as Clouseau can be. I must be missing something. Maybe another view will hit me differently. But I'm in no hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The PartyBought this hoping to laugh.

This is clearly going to be an extremely unpopular opinion here, but I thought this film dragged and dragged. But worse than its slowness, was the motivation for this film. I'm actually a fan of relatively low-brow/slapstick, and while there were a few inspired moments of physical comedy, I just could not get over the racism of this performance. I don't think it's being overly sensitive or politically correct to point this out. I really thought the laughs were at the expense of his 'accent' and a white actor in blackface. We don't laugh at minstrel shows, why would we find this funny?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic and Classy Comedy","review":"Peter Sellers will forever be with us through two incredibly well done characters; Clouseau, The famous French Detective in The Pink Panther and Bakshi, the Mistaken invitee at The Party. Sellers portraying the roll of an Indian actor who misses everything but has a big heart reminds us of the wobbly French detective roll he did as Clouseau in The Pink Panther. Peter Sellers was so talented that not in one second, in my opinion, reminded us of Clouseau. He was 100% the Indian actor. The comparison comes only from the type of characters and here and only here comes the comparison with Clouseau."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Party DVD","review":"I remember seeing part of the movie growing up and thinking that it was very funny.

Not much on the special features but that is not why I bought the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Sellers","review":"THE PARTY is a relatively obscure Blake Edwards/Peter Sellers comedy. The obscurity is curious when you think about how many hilarious movies these two gentlemen have made. THE PARTY doesn't have much of a plot and it's a little slow at times, though. It's basically just a vehicle for Sellers, who plays a bumbling actor from India. As Hrundi V. Bakshi, he single-handedly destroys a movie set, then is mistakenly invited to a chic dinner party at the home of the movie's producer.Despite a thin plot and some slow moments, THE PARTY is a classic example of Sellers' comic brilliance. He stumbles innocently, but devastatingly, through the party in one funny bit after another. While it doesn't quite attain the level of Sellers' best known material (the Pink Panther movies come to mind), it's nevertheless quite funny. Sellers fans will love it, and I think most people looking for a good laugh will find some here. Give THE PARTY a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birdie Num-Nums...","review":"The most hilarious movie starring Peter Sellers is the Party. Film actor Hrundi V. Bakshi from India accidentally blows up the whole set in a movie (looks like they are filming \\"Gunga Din\\" almost) and is told he is \\"through\\" in Hollywood forever. Until he gets put accidentally on a dinner party list held by the movie's producer. The result is just as hilarious as the beginning of the movie; Hrundi can't help but screw everything up, spill something, tip something over, damage something or make some sort of funny social faux-pas at the dinner table.Peter Sellers really outdid himself when he did The Party. It's sheer comic genius, not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny movie that goes on about 15-20 min. too long","review":"This is a must for all Sellers and comedy fans. (Also. anyone into Austin Powers would like this.) The prologue is outstanding, as is the first half of the \\"party\\". Really great stuff.

It lets you create a varity of photos, from 8 x 10s to 5x7s, down to a sheet of wallet size photos. You can also create coloring book-like pages, and even order large prints up to 20 x 30 right from the software package. I took a bunch of photos of my kids and printed them on an Epson C80 printer on glossy paper. When you display them in a frame, you would never know you were using a digital camera and a printer.The only nuisance item is that the USB connection is behind a flimsy hinged door which seems like it could break if you are note careful.

Certain evidence was detroyed, many people won't talk, many people are dead. But then, surprisingly, she weaves a rich fabric of facts and insights. We end up learning a lot about this renegade socialite who, really as an aside, had a short affair with JFK, whom she had known for a long time along with Jackie.The book is really not about juicy sexual tidbits. It's about who Mary was, who she wasn't and possibly, what she knew that got her killed ...that is, if her murder wasn't plain old senseless violence. Interesting read for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, pedantic and filled with unnecessary detail","review":"It was difficult to plow through this dull and fact-filled account of Mary Meyer's life. I had hoped for more depth about the woman and her soul, her ideas, her feelings. I realize from reading this book that she remained detached and aloof so maybe no one really knew her thoughts and feelings. If her diaries/journal were published, perhaps we'd see and come to know the real Mary.

First of all the title, \\"A Very Private Woman\\", is completely misleading. Mary Meyer was not a very private woman she was an exhibitionist of the first rate. Her attempts at being \\"different\\" appear to merely be efforts to be recognized. From her early beginnings in a completely disfunctional family, to her own disfunctional family she continued to show herself as one who demanded recognition and would do anything to get it. If anyone wonders what's gone wrong in this country read this book about Mary Meyer and her many associates who appeared to be adulterers, alcoholics, druggies, and anything else you can think of, while at the same time deciding what the course of the country should be.

You would think so, but the author has succeeded -- if that is the right word -- in doing just that. This book is callow, trite and flawed in almost every respect. The author shallowly misunderstands every one of the subjects listed above and the history of the 1950's too. Her leaden prose and tin ear don't help. This is a dreadful mix of politically correct staitjacked thinking and PEOPLE magazine style fascination with the lives of people the author does not understand. It is a shame this book was published, as the underlying story is a fascinating one, and all this book will do is postpone the publication of a decent book that does justice to the subject.

Occasionally, the author tries to recreate scenes and conversations on a pretty slim set of facts, supposing what may have motivated very private people she never met.Oh, and Dean Acheson was not *Under-Secretary* of State! Did this woman read anything about diplomacy, the Cold War, or Washington society between 1940 and 1965?

The first chapter is almost entirely who attended the funeral. Okay, fair enough, perhaps such a synopsis is necessary to introduce everyone who will show up in later events. And then the second chapter tells you how as a child, Mary was forced to attend her parents' poolside parties where baby peacock was served on plates set afloat in the pool. Who cares?

My only disappointment is that author Nina Burleigh in her introduction says she \\"decided early on that (John F.)

This DVD is AWESOME... especially due to the fact that it put back the scenes that were cut out of the VHS version. BUT unfortunatly when they put in the cut scenes they took out the Subtitles that were in the VHS... so to get the full feel for this movie you really have to get both versions... the DVD and the VHS (this is the reason for the asterisk). But this movie still is one of the best ever... and here is proof... I have owned this movie myself 4 times on VHS (It was stolen from me or loaned out and never returned all four times) and now I own it on DVD (Never to leave the house again!!!). So if you are looking for a well thought out, acted, directed, and realistic Latino movie you must watch the rest first because after watching this one the rest are going to pale in comparison.

For those who enjoyed American Me, This movie blows that out of the water. The actors in this movie are really heartfelt. Throughout the whole movie your emotions are on a rollercoaster. The movie has some very devasting parts that break your heart, and some parts that keep you on the edge of your seat. The story of three chicano teens growing up, and how a couple decisions changed the paths of their lives. The only bad acting had to be Miklo, but the movie itself makes up for any flaws. This has to be added to any hispanics movie collection. If your not hispanic don't be discouraged, my best friend is white and he can quote every line in the movie. BUY this movie today. Before I go, does anyone know what's the deal with Benjamin Bratt on the back cover? He's holding a girl that is never shown in the movie.

Are we surprised that the Black prison gang is called \\"the Black guerrilla army\\" or that the White gang is an \\"Aryan brotherhood\\"? And then there are the usual altercations in the prison dining room. Yawn. Did I mention the homosexual Nazis? And yes, there is graffiti as well.

I was also ensnared by the concept of a lost tribe of African immortals having to prevent the acopalypse. Unfortunately, the premise and artwork are the best things about the book. Mr. Townes resorts to cardboard characterization and preachy dialogue in telling what could have been a great story. Instead of taking the time to craft the epic storytelling that the premise deserves, he fashions a slap dash assortment of abrupt and overwrought scenes, creating the literary equivalent of a B movie. Though the sheer cleverness of the premise does create some high points, I found this book to be the equivalent of landing a date with someone I've always had a crush on only to learn that said crush is callous and shallow.T.R.Braxton, author of Dirty Hands"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tribe is an ultimate page turner!!!!!!","review":"This is an excellent book that has all the ingredients a good book needs suspense, love, comedy , horror ....

Just returned from a trip to Bora Bora - harsh environment, bumped around in bag, etc. Not a single problem - shot twenty rolls of film in a week without a hitch. It doesn't weigh as much as you might think (even with the battery pack) and is very easy to use. The dials are well thought out in position and function. You can P+S or do your own thing. Lots of powerful (and useful) features.The eye focus is interesting, but mostly a \\"gee whiz\\" thing. I use it only about 1/3 of the time. Impresses my friends; mostly useful for shots of people.The built in flash is very nice. I used it exclusively in Bora Bora (for a wedding) and got excellent results. Works great as a fill flash outside. Although I do suggest investing in an external flash.Overall it is a fantastic camera and I highly recommend it. I have been very pleased with it. Make sure to get the battery pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing pictures","review":"This camera takes GORGEOUS photos! Such a lovely grain, great autofocus, and superb features make this one a winner!

I use ISO 160, it is great and contrasty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera!","review":"This is an excellent camera! It is a fantastic blend of professional and advanced consumer camera. Although not as well sealed or built as the EOS 3 or 1, it is a very sturdy camera, certainly better than the other EOS. The built in flash is handy, but if you are serious about your photography, invest in a 440ex Flash. The battery grip (BP300) is an acessory that you cannot live without. The autofocus on this camera may not be as fast as the EOS 3 or 1, but it is much better then Nikons. I currently have two EOS 7 bodies, both with grips, and I find them a joy and pleasure to use everyday. Not too heavy, with a well built exterior. All in all, an excellent camera, that opens the doors into a vast and comprehensive Canon system. Remember that the camera only holds the film, and the lenses are the most important part of the camera!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of all","review":"Talk about bang for your buck. This camera has everything you'd expect from a mid-range camera and some you usually only find on high-end cameras. The eye control focus works great though you do need to calibrate it many times in different lighting conditions. The controls are well placed and easy to use. The custom functions are relatively simple to set and allow you to customize how the camera operates. Functions like the true mirror lock-up and the 4 fps advance speed help place this camera securely in the top ranks of its class. The thing that surprised me the most was the near silent operation. Even on rewind you can only hear it if you place your ear near the body (unless of course you choose to rewind at the faster speed). Of course there are options I'd love to see added like a PC cable port and an interchangeable focusing screen but thats why there are pro class cameras. Like I said before, this camera is hard to beat for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check this one out!","review":"Absolutely the finest camera I have ever owned!

I put mine in the sun to warm up and become more pliable before putting them in the car and they turned dark like in the picture. However, once on the car windows, they never got dark (just slightly tinted). Todays auto windows have UV filters in them so unless you stick the shades on the outside of the window, they won't work. The concept is great though.I too have had problems with the suction cup type shades sticking. For the film type shades try this: First clean the windows. Then spray Windex on the windows again, but don't wipe it up. Instead, put the film shade over it (it will slide around) and with a squeegie type device (or credit card) smooth out the bubbles. Be sure to have paper towels on hand since it does get messy, and be careful not to tear the film.

When I took my daughter for a drive the tint on the shades did not turn NEARLY as dark as the picture on the box and she still had to turn her head away from the window becasue it was still a little to bright.

They don't really get as dark as in the picture.3. They are hard to install, and like somebody else said, they look like a very bad tint job.If you use windex, they will get opaque for the same reason you are not supposed to use windex to clean your tinted windows. I didn't think about that, and I used windex. They turned opaque, and I just tossed them in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"These shades don't stick to the window well and do not change colors.

This biography of Harper's Bazaar fashion editor Carmel Snow is everything a heavy tome should be: entertaining, insightful, and thouroughly researched. The writing style is a perfect match for the subject matter: Penelope Rowlands' prose is as sharply defined as a couture garment, and, as a result, reading her book is the next best thing to actually owning a Dior original.But the most rewarding part of the book is the revelation that elegance is all about gutsiness. In fact, if you look objectively at the clothes women wore back then (the book is rife with photographic documents) all those proper little wool suits and belted silk dresses look quite frumpy in restrospect. But what poise those girls had! Where did their get their attitude? Reading A Dash of Daring is a lesson in real coolness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dash of Delight","review":"This is a handsomely produced book, filled with wonderful photos, about a fascinating woman, the daughter of an Irish immigrant, who traveled the major capitals of the world and transformed Harper's Bazaar into one of the liveliest magazines of the 20th century.

The research she did for this book is outstanding but her writing skills could be more polished at times. I feel that the size of the book could be trimmed down a little bit, perhaps they should split it into two books, one biography and one coffee table book of photographs and illustrations. Ms. Rolands' view are also very biased throughout the book. She tried to discredit all Carmel Snow's competitors and critics in order to show Snow's greatness. It's unnecessary as Snow's work certainly speaks for itself and her contribution to the fashion industry is unquestionable.

The type is hard to read and search through, with the names in bold print being distracting after a while. It's fairly complete in terms of content, and the introduction and trivia bits are standard but nicely done. However, it isn't the \\"greatest baby name book ever\\" and I wouldn't buy it if I was looking for just one or two as reference copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, solid continuation of the formula established in previous seasons","review":"If you liked the previous three seasons of RED DWARF (I don't think the show really got underway in all its maturity until the addition of Kryten in Season Three), you will like this one. Apart from the absence of the spaceship Red Dwarf (the entire season is spent on Star Bug, which is searching for Red Dwarf), the show was the same old same old.By this point in the show there was a ritualistic familiarity to the characters. They managed to keep the jokes flowing. I did, however, miss Holly, the Red Dwarf computer avatar. I missed the familiar living quarters from the first five seasons. But despite the new settings on the Star Bug, the show, if it wasn't starting to feel tired, was at least feeling well-traveled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down Hill","review":"All series previous to this I would give 5 stars however, I can't explain why, this series losses something which makes it worse. It may be the fact that it relies on it's on past with the re-occuring jokes, like the core directives and Dwain Dibly (sp - you know what I mean - I hope!) that are less amusing each time, and become tiresome.Now, don't get me wrong, this is 4 stars.... that means very good, just not great. If you're a fan of Red Dwarf, you don't really need to read this, and if you just like it and are considering getting this, I'd first of all point you in the direction of the series before this, but feel free to get this as it is very good.Also, the fantastic extra's are great for every fan, but to the casual viewer they may seem a bit pointless, or indeed the casual viewer may enjoy them.Anyway, I suggest you get this as it is great comedy.Toodle Pipski"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating tongue-in-cheek goth.

The neat thing is it comes with everything. The carrying case, (...) and straps. I go the camera and was amazed by the features and things it could do.Great buy!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible camera; takes great pics!","review":"Strengths: Lightweight, easy to use from full automatic to full manual. Depth of field preview (excellent feature!), AE lock, quick auto focus for price range, seven focusing points. Countless lenses and accessories available both from Canon and third party mfgrs. If you have large hands, I recommend the optional battery pack ... which also doubles as a vertical grip with duplicated shutter control and port for remote switch. I simply can't imagine these features on any other camera at a comptetitive price. Thinking about a \\"point and shoot\\"? Save your money and get this camera instead.Weaknesses: Included manual not very comprehensive, but spend a few hours with this camera and you can figure most features out yourself. If you need written instructions, I'd recommend the excellent Magic Lantern guide....Also, try another lens, like a 28-200mm aspherical lens, if you want just one lens to carry around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Camera, Poor Quality Lens","review":"As an experienced former slr user I am very disappointed. This is a good camera with great features but the lens quality of the 28-90mm in the kit does not produce very sharp pictures. After shooting two rolls of film it became very clear that my old Fuji point and shoot was producing better quality pictures. Also, the built-in flash is a bit on the weak side. Flash coverage was not as good as my point and shoot camera. This is a big disappointment from Canon. Consider buying the camera body only and finding a higher quality lens to purchase separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Child Within: 9 Months of Spiritual Preparation for the","review":"Could not find where to read about this book on your website"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well built and sturdy!","review":"I recently moved into a small condo that has very little kitchen storage but reasonable floor space. This shelving unit allows me to store a lot of my kitchen items and small appliances, freeing up valuable cabinet and counter space. The shelving unit also blends in nicely with my stainless steel appliances. I was able to assemble this unit by myself in under 45 minutes. Even if I eventually move into a larger space, this shelving unit will quite likely continue to provide ample storage space as it is extremely sturdy, and the addition of the heavy duty castors makes it very portable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"These shelves are great. I ordered 3 for my storage shed. Before ordering I had asked my husband if he wanted me to order one for him but he wasn't interested.....that is until they arrived.

The shelf heights are adjustable and the wheels make it easy to rearrange which is one of my favorite past times. Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"The cart was easy to assemble, rolls easy and looks nice. There is plenty of room between the shelves for storage. I'm very pleased! It's not cheap and rickety, it's well built and sturdy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steel wire shelves - inspect the packaging","review":"These shelves exceeded my expectations. I read the manufacturers description, but I took it with the usual grain of salt. I bought them to set up a fish room for my aquarium hobby. I figured they would hold supplies and a few containers of water. I find instead that they are strong enough to hold the aquariums themselves, a load that can quickly become hundreds of pounds.They are quick and easy to assemble without tools, but require a second set of hands. You hold two loose plastic pieces in place as you lower a shelf onto it. You need a person at each end of the shelf to hold all the pieces together simultaneously.If the circular brackets at the corners of the shelves are out of round, they won't form a good fit on the plastic pieces that clamp onto the vertical bars. Check the packaging when you receive the shelves. An impact on the corners of the box could deform the brackets.I expect I'll buy more of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"The shelf unit is actually very nice, but when fully loaded (not over-loaded) it is dangerously top heavy. The little three (3) inch wheels are sadly undersized. You have to be very careful if you move the shelf / cart at all.Seville \\"offers\\" the correct four (4) inch wheels on their websight, but of course you have to pay for them, and with shipping it's close to $25.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior In Its Class","review":"The basic design of these shelves is not proprietary to Seville; I have essentially the same shelves from three other manufacturers. All are easy to assemble and are stable once constructed.However, these shelves differ in several respects from others I've used, and all the differences are negative. The screw-in \\"feet\\" do not mount flush with the leg, introducing the potential for diminished strength and stability. More significant, the \\"feet\\" have separate rubber caps, which do not fit on easily and do not stay on: They should be super-glued to the legs. Worse still, the plastic collars that snap together to hold the shelves are flimsy and do not always hold, necessitating an awkward removal of the shelf and a repeat effort to position it.To sum up: These shelves take longer to put together than similar designs from other makers, and the result is less satsfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for plants","review":"I purchased to use as a storage plant stand. We attached grow lights under a couple shelves and it works perfectly, saving space in the room while providing space for many plants to grow in front of the window. Just what I needed. Arrived very quickly and is very sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Product","review":"First, these things are pretty cheap and don't follow the instructions, I wasted a lot of time doing that. The biggest flaw is that the fasteners that keep the shelves in place are held by a tiny plastic ring, the shelves can't take much weight. I don't know why the manufacturer didn't just use circular vice grips, then we're talking a quality shelving product. All in all, I wouldn't buy this product again but for the moment they're holding up okay for the moment. I'm just scared to put any additional weight on them due to the plastic potentially failing. If you're looking for a strong, industrial style shelving system, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these units!","review":"These are a good price, and great for storage.

Assembling it is easy and no tools are required. I would suggest two people assemble it because it's pretty awkward with one, although it could be done. It's very study and with the wheels you can move a fully loaded unit around with ease. I'll never buy shelving without wheels again. (Of the four wheels two have brakes so you can lock them in place, if you want.) For those that would rather not use the wheels, they also include leveler feet you could install, if preferred. I just ordered a few more units! Also, the manufacturer has a website where one can buy all sorts of accessories like shelf mats, bins, hooks, unit covers...etc.I had no problems at all getting these shelves to me from Target. I've ordered them 3 separate times, for a total of 11 shelving units. Never a problem with any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"I have 6 of these units and I plan to purchase 3 more. I also have one larger one. It's a great way to organize the garage without installing permanent shelves. They are easy to roll around making it convenient to clean the garage floor or arrange a working or parking space. Holds tool boxes, parts, camping gear, etc. Two quality control issues I have noticed: 1. The grooves in the corner poles are not always deep enough for the plastic inserts to get a good bite and hold the shelves up. 2. The grooves are not always spaced the same in each pole, making one corner a little higher or lower than the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds stuff","review":"Easy to put together, took me less than 5 minutes.Very sturdy construction.

The poles and connectors were cross threaded, the grooves on the poles are not deep enough to hold clips and keep them from shifting. All in all cheaply made and extremely difficult to assemble. I have purchased several shelving systems from Storables and am very familiar with how to assemble. The Storables poles come in one sturdy pole / not several pieces, poorly grooved and cross threaded. I guess you get what you pay for -- but in this case wish I had stayed with the more expensive brand.

This game is very real, the object of the gameplay is to overtake the president of a new free Russian state after the collapse of the soviet union, i have never seen a game so intense and real, the game is not action packed but it is more psychological and the game seems to have a mind of it's own.If you are a person looking for a challenge in computer gaming i highly recomend this game.I dont know where this game is headed, but if it lives up to the potential that I think it posseses, it will be a masterpiece.In this game you actually feel like you are alive and lost in the game ready to defend yourself, ready to start a REVOLUTION!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work with intel processors!","review":"Don't buy this game if your Mac is less than 5 years old!

The author allows much of himself to show through this book, so although I enjoyed some parts of the book, I found myself disliking Barash as a person, and especially as a scientist. He loves data that supports his political stance, and ignores anything that threatens that position. Because of this, he overlooks some obvious material that would give a much clearer understanding of the topic.True to the book's theme, almost of his villians (enemies) are selected from the opposite end of the political spectrum.For someone who is naive about conflict studies, the book might serve as a general, if rather biased introduction., For anyone who has invested any time in pondering these matters, the book is a waste of time and energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic lesson in reading NASDAQ Level II","review":"The first 10 minutes or so and the last 5 minutes are not worth much.

I lived in Yellow Springs, Ohio (home of Antioch College - no,I wasn't a student) in the late 1960's and saw Brute Force in concert several times. They were mainly Dayton and Springfield, Ohio musicians - with Stan Strickland, the reed man as the driving force. Afro-jazz of the sort Alice Coltrane and Pharaoh Sanders were doing at the time. Beautiful, magical music. The second side is more conventional, kind of funk. Sonny Sharock is a great addition, but that was laid on in the studio. To my knowledge, he never performed with the group. They opened in Cincinnati for Herbie Mann on his Memphis Underground tour and blew him away. Unhappily, after finally getting on with, I believe it was Atlantic, they soon broke up. Lost my LP long ago and I'm thrilled to finally have the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Sonny Sharrock Fans","review":"This is pretty amazing. Some fairly interesting Funk-Jazz from the late sixties. The jazz elements are cleary influenced by the New Thing players like Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, Pharoah Sanders et al. What makes it special is that the guitar player listed as playing on three tracks is none other than the great Sonny Sharrock. The greatest guitarist of the era for my money, and there still, after all of these years, is not enough of him on disc for my tastes. To add to the delight, his playing is all over this record and not just on the three listed tracks. One of the great things about Sonny, there was no imitation, you will recognize his voice right away. If you too need more Sonny, grab this disc fast before it goes out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!!!!","review":"I love Cathe's tapes, she gives a great workout in a short amount of time!

Then there are the other bits of wisdom that fall quite short. In my experience, just about every book on fiction writing is different. Some will give you flat out \\"rules\\" for how to write quality fiction, while others tell you that there are \\"no guidelines or formulas\\" for how to write great fiction.

All of the conjugations and declensions were transliterations, leaving the student with no way to deal with actual Hittite texts. Further, many of the linguistic tidbits that the authors offered amounted to \\"that's just the way it is.\\" Rarely do such excuses give the only available explanation; in spite of potential evidence that would avoid such sidestepping, the authors did not comment on more concrete theories.To limn: this book is okay as a beginning, as the barest beginning, but you'll have to spend hundreds of dollars on additional texts and do your own linguistic analyses if you're serious about learning the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the horizon","review":"For those interested in such a book, but discouraged by the evaluation of this one, a new grammar of Hittite, complete with systematic grammatical description, graded exercises in transliteration, vocabulary, etc., is on the horizon.

I've been a fan of Tony Ward's work--I especially like the quality of his photography, the graininess of his photos, the simplicity. This book seems like a collection of his throw-aways, photos that were unused in previous collections and exhibits of his work. Trying to see how many different body parts one can stick into female orifices grows tired after a while. Most of the couplings in the book are girl-girl, with the disturbing exception being of a girl with a deformed man who has no arms and stumps for legs. As I've already stated, the quality of the photos are nice and are in Mr. Ward's unique, grainy, black and white style, but the subject matter is tired and the book disappoints, and the randomness of the picture selection creates for a very disjointed effect--the book never gathers any steam and just trudges along.

To avoid washed out faces, I'd always gotten accustomed to bouncing the flash off walls/ceiling (on my old camera setup).

I don't take tons of indoor shots, a set of NiMH's gets me 100's of photos before recharge (to tell you the truth, I don't keep track as I've never actually run out of juice at an inoppurtune moment).I would recommend a diffuser, something I don't have.

They are pretty Good. Their first album A greater Art is pretty bad in my opinionSounds like Shizz..Headstones is good alot of heavy songs on that one. Now this cd is very trippy Psycodelic at points. The best songs are Return of ravens, The Shadowshires,and Let us go as they do. Most songs are mid paced. Singer is rather good . Musicians are alright nothing fancy that's for sure. I have a couple of their other discs on the way along withthe new release Illwill which sounds pretty heavy from samples. Give them a chance if you like Type O or Paradise Lost .."},{"rating":"1","title":"Master?","review":"I did some research on Mr. Alexander after purchasing a few of these videos. His length of study with Yuichi Kuda is certainly questionable and I believe he gained his rank through being buddies with another Karate stylist. His techniques are not good Karate and the videos did little to improve my opinion of this person who is known to use videos and information not of his own for profit. Much better instruction can be found out there, and if you consider this guy a Master, you have never seen true Okinawan Shorin Ryu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I watched every detail of this DVD set of Shorin Ryu Karate. It's excellent materials for martial arts! I studied Wing Chun for quite a while. Both Wing Chun and Shorin Ryu Karate came from White Crane Kung Fu. I can tell that Hanshi Alexander certainly has a deep root on White Crane Kung Fu. His styles and kumite applications resemble many effective fighting methods of both White Crane Kung Fu and Wing Chun. Very authentic Okinawa fighting art. Not some highly modified versions for Karate sport competitions that Wing Chun practitioners would easily knock them down.

It had a great mixture of Jedi character, fighter pilot action, and Old Hero Leadership. This book is a 'blast from the past'! Come join Luke, Han, Leia-and the new breed of Knights; Jacen, Jaina, Anakin, ect. in an overwhelming battle against the evil of the 'Vong (yes, I know they don;t like being called that, but who cares)! Don't miss this book. If you're stuck on buying ALL the NJO books (buy them!).

History often repeats itself in reality so shouldn't it do the same in fiction? Two years ago everyone I knew were complaining about Star Wars books being boring and all ending the same. Well here is what you asked for so stop the whinning. Good will eventually overcome. Have any of you actually read any of the books? The Vong will eventually overextend themselves and another great Alliance will be formed.Some people forget what war really is and that good people die in them and for no purpose. These books show that war isn't all fun and glory and it brings Star Wars back to reality.besides everyone dies what better way to die than like the main characters in this book do. In a blaze of glory and to save the lives of their friends and the sake of the Universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"It's obvious why this book is taking so long to get published in paperback.

The sweeping grandeur of george lucas's original vision is dead here, don't read this book or watch episode 1 or any of the other stupid episodes watch the original trilogy. Tenel Ka and Jacen Solo were out of character, I expected to see more of their comedic love hate relationship like Kevin Anderson and Rebecca Moesta wrote them in the young jedi knights. plus this book is too dark, we've seen enough real darkness in the recent tradgedy of sept. 11, that we long for the good guys to vanquish all evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applause","review":"A triumph, no less. Troy Denning has continued what he started in the D&D genre, truly engrossing books. You'll notice that this is one of thickest by far of the NJO series.

But the books are trying for something that the movies were not.Maybe the editors should try watching the old movie again and try and figure out what it was that created and sustained the fandom.

If it was George Lucas, shame on you George... shame, shame, shame.George, remember when Bonanza Hiped Little Joes wedding for two weeks, then killed his wife, my family and a lot of other families never tuned in again. The show was essentially DEAD.BRING HIM BACK OR I'M GONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the author thinking?","review":"I've never been a real star wars fan but I started to read the series and found it to be awsome until I read this book. How could the author have the audacity to kill Anakin?!?! How could the editors allowed Denning to kill a main character especially a younger one that could of spurred more books. If they kill all the important young Jedi Knights there will be nothing to write about. This book was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"600 hundred pages should have been 350","review":"This book almost made me stop reading the njo. The story isn't terrible, but this is as drawn out as the scarlett letter. Except Troy Denning for some reason feels its necessary to shove as many big, obscure words in his novel as possible. Turning what should be a 350-400 page book in 600+ pages. Plus he changes all the characters personalities to fit what he wants in his story. Basically says, the hell with the earlier books, I'm doing what I want.One of the things that bothered me most was how he wrote Jacen. Jacen is one of my favorite characters and I like him because he is a deep, introspective character. Denning turns him into a weak, sniveling little peon. He hails Anakin through the whole novel and is very condescending to Jacen.All in all this novel was enough to make me destraught, but not quite enough to make me stop reading the series, although I know many who have quit the series solely because of the book"},{"rating":"2","title":"One He!! Of A Book","review":"this book is really something I can't really right all that much about it without ruining the surprises, first a lot of charicters bite it in this one, including one that well have a far greater effect in the future than Cewbacca's. The Jedi and the New Republic score some victorys, but they lose just as much, the worse blow being scored against the Solo's.Lots of stuff happens, and it leaves you wanting more, the next book in the timeline comes out in Feb. so we got a bit of time to wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back Bantam and kick out Lucasfilm/Delrey","review":"George Lucas said he made Star Wars because we had no heros-all the money the Star Wars Universe has brought in made him forget I guess when he signed off on this series. DelRey looks down their nose at us fans (and in their interviews in Insider) and these (my fellow reviewers are lapping it up). Well, I would prefer live heroes myself and how long is the series going to last? At least with Bantam you didn't have to wait through more than 3 novels to see how it ends. Reminds me of some movies(like\\"Freddy's back\\")-excessive- over & over & over again. They should of just blew up everyone at one time - it would have been a lot easier to take. I'm not spending the money/nor are the books in my bookcase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is one of the best if not the best book in the NJO series. At first a book that long seems intimidating, but Denning's gift of keeping you at the center of the action made getting through it easy. There are some painful moments, but Denning does not shy away from them. You could feel the angst and pain of the young jedi knights as they were on their difficult mission. Epic, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 25 year experience is Ruined","review":"This book made me so angry I am starting a campaign to get the person fired that talked George Lucas into this. I own and have read all the books, even junior jedi.The prior books leading to SBS suck you in, then Denning is ordered to kill the most compelling character in the EU SW universe. Sept 11 gave me enough reality thank you.If you like Dark books with Sick twists you'll love SBS. I'm done with NJO until HE comes back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Despite my title, I think the book was well written. Troy Denning did a good job. This book has a lot interesting twists and it's never slow paced. After the Vong create a special creature that is bred to destroy the jedi, Luke finally gets it in gear and decides to \\"take the fight to\\" the Vong. We get to see a lot more of the older generation(Han, Luke, etc.)than we have for some time.However, when my favorite character in the whole EU died I was really annoyed. Yes, it is a war, and in wars people die, but when I read a science FICTION book I'm not looking for a big o slap of unhappy realism, especially from Star Wars. The death damages part of what makes Star Wars better than other sci fi series. I still feel depressed. I hope NJO is going somewhere good with this, because otherwise all the death did was anger a lot of people. This is my opinion and I don't care what all those weird people who think the death was a good thing say. It ruined a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"They told me to tell you (the reader) what I think.","review":"HERE'S WHAT I THINK!!!

Personally, I liked having the YJK's back. I didn't like having HIM die, he was the hope for the future, but we need to get over it and keep reading. This book combined humor, action, excitement, tragedy, romance, and a keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat plot. I think that a book needs to be well-balanced, and this was a great example of a well-balanced book.Above all, fellow Star Wars fans, remember this: don't give up on Star Wars because of one book. Keep reading, it has to get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"My word, I am tired of this series and unfortunately there seems to be no end in sight. This storyline keeps repeating itself. Yes, the Vong are not at all nice beings; we figured that out. Sure, the Solo kids are experiencing teenage angst magnified by their special abilities. Ok, the New Republic has become mired in corruption. So tell us something we haven't heard for the better part of 2 years! Give us a reason to care!What I wouldn't give to read a good yarn by Timothy Zahn about now. He could certainly breathe life into this dying franchise. Years ago I used to anticipate the release of a new SW novel. Now I just wait until it shows up at the local library.Time to put this sorry saga to rest and come up with fresh material. Like the SW characters, we're not getting any younger."},{"rating":"1","title":"a major let down","review":"with all the had happened in the two previous books i had expect a turnaround in this one. i was actually hoping things were going to get better with the birth of luke's son, not worse. instead this book is rather dark and there are characters that it just doesn't feel like they are acting like them selves. and i find the loss of not only a major but very important character very depressing. the only reason i finished this book is because it was a star wars novel, had it been anything else i wouldn't have. p.s. i really hope the author of the next book finds away to bring this character back"},{"rating":"1","title":"Del Rey continues to destroy Star Wars","review":"When this series first started I was excited. Finally there would be a new enemy for the New Republic to face. I was quickly disappointed. This series only point so far has been to kill characters for no reason at all.This book was no exception. This novel had very little story at all and dragged on. Countless characters were killed including two who were important to the novels.For the past few years the novels have been developing Anakin and has even had him as the lead for the last few novels. Now out of the blue they decide to kill him pointlessly, like Chewbacca.Personally I won't be buying any more of this series and I would recommend anyone who would want to read a good Star Wars story to pick up the Bantam Series."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GOD! They Killed Anakin! You Nerf-Herders!","review":"Despite this being one of the more suspenseful cliff-hangers in the Star Wars nJo (New Jedi Order) series, I have a huge beef.Four years ago, I reviewed \\"Vector Prime\\", lamenting the fact that RA Salvatore would be pigeonholed as the man who killed Chewbacca. I also reminded them that although Salvatore might have fired the shot, it was George Lucas, master of all that is Star Wars, who ordered the hit. And I still feel that Lucas made the right decision to order his writers/hitmen to take a \\"nobody is safe\\" attitude. Having said that...WHO TOLD HIM TO OKAY ANAKIN SOLO, THE STAR OF JUNIOR JEDI KNIGHTS, GETTING WHACKED?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The author just blew it","review":"All Previous authors had been building Anakin Solo character, make us like him and think he was geat with the force, not one with the force as written by Troy Denning.

Yeah, yeah, it was in a blaze of glory and all and he will be remembered for all time, blah, blah, BUT COULDN'T THEY HAVE JUST KILLED SOMEBODY ELSE?!?!?!? I recognize the need to kill a major character every once in a while, but Anakin was the wrong person to kill. Jacen and Jaina are not the ones you want leading the next generation of Jedi (and who knows what the Vong are going to do to Jacen now that they have him). A part of me is still hoping that Anakin is still alive, even if they have to bring him back in the cheesiest way possible, I really don't care. Anakin used to be the one that was ignored while the focus was on the twins, but now that he had finally stepped to the forefront and achieved his potential, why kill him? Kill Jacen instead. Anakin's ending would have been perfect for Jacen. Anyway, the only reason I will continue to read this now ruined series is to find out what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I read this book and have been an advid reader of star wars new jedi order and I must say that I am bit dissapointed with the killing of anakin solo. I am sure that it is important that there be a death to the jdei's elite but the selection wa poor in my opinion. He was dvelopning into such a huge character to have killed off in such a manner by a new author not sharing the vison of his predecessors. The over all plot was good and I hope if you a a reader are interested in seeing an incredible turn of events then the author succeded in its task. At this point yo umust read the book to understand the next series of books but be aware that storyline is flaky."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dreariest of an increasingly dreary series","review":"\\"Star by Star\\" is the dreariest of an increasingly dreary series that shows no sign of concluding anytime soon. The Vong advance steadily and relentlessly as they have in every other novel. As in the earlier books, nothing the familiar Star Wars characters do seems to make a difference in the overall conquest of the galaxy.In addition, this book seems to have been rushed into print, as if the author had written scenes and never got a chance to go back and write the transitions that were intended to link them to each other and to the main plotline. Major characters abruptly change location and time seems to pass at different rates for different groups -- days seems to pass for the New Republic plotline while only hours pass for Jedi involved in a running gun battle that occupies a third of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great author who didn't bother to read previous books.","review":"Really, the author of this book is a talented writer. But he made the worst mistake possible when he wrote this book. He didn't bother reading the previous books in this series. I mean, why did the other writers in the series build up a certain character so much if this guy was just going to kill the character off. I almost quit the series right there. I really can't recomend this book to fans. You're just setting yourself up for pain, and dissapointment. A perfect example of a writer going over to the dark side."},{"rating":"1","title":"The usual...","review":"The good thing about this book is that it killed off one of the brats. The bad thing is that it didn't kill all of them. You feel nothing regarding the death because the character in question was composed of the sheerest cardboard anyway.Otherwise, the same old NJO. Infantile style, dumb plotting, stupid biotech. This is the type of thing a 12-year-old thinks is deeply profound. DelRey takes cluelessness to new heights.Like one of the previous posters, I find my interest in SW waning, both movies and books. It ain't never gonna get better, friends. Oh well, there are other franchises, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be a banned","review":"This writer, Troy Denning, is a man who is a great writer, probaly a smart man and and just destroyed this good series. Does anyone realy believe in a series were they get a character all ready for saving the galaxy and then kill him (Anakin.) Do not read this book. It is dull except when they grab your attention by killing a character ever few seconds. I think Mr. Denning killed Anakin just so his book would be the Star Wars to remember.Note to Troy Denning: If you ever dare write another Star Wars book I will publish bad reviews of your wretched books.I would also like to note that Amazon.com should let its readers give the books zero stars. I felt ashamed that i had to give the book one whole star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant gift to long time the fans.","review":"Long time fans have stayed with the SW EU because it was fun to read. The new bosses have lead those fans down a dark alley, then ambushed and killed the heir apparent to Luke Skywalker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book ONE in the Star Wars Hall of Shame","review":"As a long time Star Wars fan I think that the part of this book where Anakin dies should never have been approved by George Lucas, or anyone else who authorizes the story lines. I also think that all of the authors who wrote later books should have objected to Anakin's demise loudly if they were consulted that it was going to happen and further not written anything about it into their books.Killing Anakin Solo was a BIG MISTAKE and the Star Wars Universe has undoubtedly lost a lot of fans because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"edge of your seat suspense!","review":"When I read this book, I was on a drive to the coast(no.I wasn't driving), and I just could'nt put it down! The suspense just keeps you on pins and needles, because you don't know what happens next. I gave this book 4 stars,even though it's really a 5 star book, but they went and killed off Anakin. In an earlier book, Master Ikrit told Anakin and Tahiri that they were stronger together than apart, which indicated to me that big things were in store for these two, as a couple. So I was really surprised and disapointed that they killed him.I thought \\"you can't kill Anakin!! He's the hero of the story!!!\\" But it is an excellent read, and shows how bad things can happen to good people.I know they cremated his body in \\"Dark Journey\\",but maybe they'll find a way to brinh him back. I highly recommend this book, and all the other New Jedi Order books as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read it","review":"Don't read it. The book wasn't bad up until the point Anakin dies. I have no intrest in even finishing the book or reading the rest of the NJO series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. Just plain Horrible.","review":"Well, Chewwie died in the first book. I could take that. Then things begin to look up. Ah, Anakin Solo is going to get us out of the Vong wars. So, I picked up this book expecting Anakin to lead his striketeam to victory. Well everything is going well. But suddenly I am reading and Anakin dies. So I re read it. I was sure I was mistaken. Afterall, a good writer like Troy Denning would never kill the hero. I read the sentence again. Holy Smokes! I was right. He died. Besides that a bunch of minor Jedi die, and Jacen is captured. But I can not say what I really think. Last time I went so overboard bashing Troy Denning that it was never published. But I will say that if you this: if you read New Jedi Order you have to read this. It is very eventful in the series. But not eventful in a good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anybody notice this as well?","review":"I could be wrong, but I read this book as well as all the others...and have noticed that there is a character, Vergere, the Fon(d) speicies (bird like who has jedi powers) who was Elan the Priestess's familiar and is now an advisor to Tsavong Lah. She is with Jacen at the end of this book and she supplied tears for Mara Jade in one of the earlier books. Now, am I wrong, or was she also in Rogue Planet(pre-Episode 2) as a jedi-knight who went to investigate the Rogue Planet but happened upon a new species from outside of the galaxy and convinced them to leave and take her with them.....Also, if anyone has some good expanded universe discussion boards, post here please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think About It","review":"This death made sense. Think about it....Ben Skywalker. Anakin was going to be the next Jedi that saves the galaxy, now it will be Luke's son. Plus, the removal of some characters is necessary. The same people always being saved and saving the galaxy is stale. New faces are needed. Plus, people dying makes the epic battle of good vs. evil more believable. GOOD DOES NOT ALWAYS WIN. People die. Even in Star Wars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope for a victory","review":"I really enjoyed this book although I was shocked and saddened by the death of Anakin Solo. He died saving his siblings and fellow Jedi much like Anakin Skywalker did in saving his son, Luke at the end of Return of the Jedi. I felt that it was extremely well written and the darkness described in it kind of gives me a taste of what to expect in the remaining two Star Wars Prequels. One thing I hope is that more of these stories will become uplifting again. The series has become a little too dark for my taste. The Vong remind me of modern day terrorists who kill to justify religious beliefs and they like today's terrorists, should be defeated. I would love to see more triumphs of the Jedi. I enjoyed it, but it is starting to become too depressing. I hope the Jedi win at the end because they deserve to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This book is one of the best \\"Star Wars\\" novels I've read so far. I'm a huge fan of Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Series, but Denning's Star by Star is \\"darker\\" than most Star Wars novels, and a bit gloomy at times, but I think its worthy book. It marks the halfway point in the New Jedi Order series and there is plenty of fighting in space and on the ground. Granted, the NJO series is a bit long, and sometimes I felt as if some books shouldn't even have been made, but Star by Star is not one those. It is arguably THE most important book in the series, with plot twists everywhere. Buy it, but not before you read the previous novels or if you have some knowledge of the events in Yuuzhan-Vong war"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom, put the kids to bed....","review":"War is ugly and mean- why else would it be a war? First of all Star Wars isn't specifically designed for kids! In fact thats why Episode one was so awfull.Star by Star, I must admitt was hard to get through because of the death, but it got my blood pumping again- Series get stale when the main characters become immortal. If only Denning and Zahn could combine their talents!Anyway, this is a great read with some evil twists, and mom, take the kids to see Jar Jar, but dont read them Star by Star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be careful what you read","review":"This a earth shaking book. I believe all of the outrage that has been poured out in the other reviews should compliment the author(although alot of people unfortunately spoiled the book by giving away what happens.) I will be the first to admit that about 3/4 of the way through the book, I got really pissed off. The author built up such an emotional bond and empathy for the characters in me, that when bad things started happening, I really got mad. This book is worth reading even if you are just starting to read the New Jedi Order series as it does a pretty good job going over the backstory and bringing newcomers up to date. It also is the book that will change the face of Star Wars: NJO. If you want a book full of surprises and twists read this one, just be prepared to get a little angry."},{"rating":"2","title":"The darkest book yet.......","review":"Star by Star is the longest book in the NJO order and argubly the most controversial since the first book. I was generally impressed by Denning's characterisation. A lot of them will play important roles in the future story. I heard about the death of a major character before reading the book and I was extremely disappointed by the one chosen. I disagreed 100% with the choice but it makes one wonder where this series will be heading. All in all well written, the extra pages make it a better book than most in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Star by Star was exciting and well written, and further reduces the Star Wars universe to a pointless endeavor. Personally, I have decided to exempt the NJO from my version of Star Wars--Vision of the Future was a great ending as far as I'm concerned. Star by Star (and other NJO novels) seems to make all other novels, and (more importantly) the movies obsolete. What does it matter if Han and Luke and the rest defeat the empire? Thirty years later the whole galaxy will be killed by the Yuuzhan Vong anyway. And due to the loss of major charactors, it's hard to believe any of the surviving charactors will ever by truly happy again. I'd stake my bets that the NJO series is old man Lucas' attempt to rake in some more cash for his own empire. But for me, it has just gone too far."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was he Thinking!!!!!!!!!","review":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGggggggggg Wile this book was well written & may have worked as a stand alone novel, it does not belong in the Starwars universe. First; the author does not continue with any of the previously established sub-plots ( come on what's up with the Shamed?). But, instead goes off on his own crazy tangent and does little to further the overall story line ( unless you call killing off a couple pivotal characters furthering a story ). Now I'll leave the technical errors alone, really I will, since I'm one of the few that probably care anyway.

Also introduces the Bat Signal and the Batmobile. It's really good to see Batman as a human being who goofs up and get ticked off by someone else.

He comes from a country (South Africa) typifying and perhaps summing up what's wrong with colonialism, thus giving him that essential oppression-earned gravitas.

Perhaps it's the recurring fragment, \\"Blue Bolero,\\" finally fully realized and unfolded as the last number in this live concert, but slyly and serendipitously salted into the procedings throughout (no less than four times). Perhaps it's the bizarre juxtiposition of Berlin and Africa that yields these mysterioso results. Perhaps it's simply a faithful jazz practitioner finally reaching critical mass.

I had read reviews that had said that the blade may need a little sharpening out of the box, but this is ridiculous, the blade is unable to cut a sheet of paper. I am extremely disappointed Ka-Bar; the knife looks great and feels to be of high quality but a knife sold as a \\"fighting/utility knife\\" should come with a better edge than this. I was not only disappointed, but actually embarrassed in front of my friends when I opened up this very dull knife.

He's constantly critical of 1950's architecture - wherever he finds it.With surprisingly little technical knowledge, he tours testing grounds and bunkers. But it's not all Atomic America: he has the same commentary towards Arcosanti and Biosphere. Where I yearn for a storyline, he delivers watered down architecural critique.Vanderbilt's writing seems to follow this algorithm: Begin a paragraph using a sentence with an odd phrase in quotations. Then refute this with an academic argument. The first dozen times are fun. A whole book written in this style is tedious.The 1950's nuclear crazyness presents a rich lode for research.

Guns would fire whenever someone would simply carry a gun, no pulling of trigger required. The martial arts aspect was more comical than serious.

Morbid Angel's version frightened me a little bit (The voices and bass/guitar interplay) but this version scared the living .... out of me. The voices they used where unbelievably horrifying.

It comes in a very nice slim tin holder. This could be a primer for new Argento fans. If you love Italian cinema Argento films are a must!! Tenebre and Phenomena are the headliners here. Tenebre was unavailable on dvd for quite a few years and demanded top dollar on eBay ( I paid $35.00). Tenebre and Phenomena are my favorite films in this collection and Tenebre is my favorite Argento film next to Suspiria. Trauma is decent and boasts some great performances. The Card Player is tense and well-made. Do You Like Hitchcock? is very good considering it was made for Italian TV. All have been remastered and cool extras. Oh and I have to mention Argento has a penchant for having some of the best soundtrack music too!! Pick this set up you will not be disappointed. Then pick up all of his other films too!!!Can't wait for his newer one to hit dvd, Mother Of Tears!

Some of the oddball characters tend to distract from the movie even when it is still worth watching. The ending and everything leading up to the ending was horrible. There just came a turning point while watching this movie that there was no way it could save itself.I also agree with the sound factor. The entire cast seems to mumble through lines and the sound needs to be turned up during conversations, and then immediately turned back down when the music kicks in, etc.I love horror/thriller movies. I even love cheesy B movies. This movie fails to fall in to either category for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid","review":"Nice collection of his films...no real standouts...but worth the price tag if you enjoy italian horror films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that all there is?","review":"This is easily the flattest Argento movie. Admittedly, some of this is intentional: it's clear that the old master is attempting to make a \`realist' thriller: gone are the crumbling piles of old Rome; the cobwebs and the faded gothic glamour - in are the pastel shades and humdrum reality of everyday modern Italy. This isn't so much of a problem, really, what is is Argento's attempt at a contemporary thriller: trying to wrap his story in what he thinks is the techno babble of today is akin to seeing your Grand Dad break dancing at a family wedding disco. Frankly, it's a little embarrassing. I don't think that Argento needs to shackle himself to the past, but, where before he emerged some of his stories in futuristic (and deliriously unlikely) sci-fi improbabilities, here he's playing with clichés: the internet is so Sandra Bullock; and that thing with the seeds found on the corpses would be great, if it hadn't been pummeled to death already in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991)."},{"rating":"1","title":"All to predictable.","review":"Definately not one of Argento's best films unfortunately. I was very excited to get this movie today on its first day of release because I am a big Argento fan but I think he strays away from everything that made him so good in the first place. It was all to predictable. He has some really absurd characters like the coroner and the computer genius trying to catch the killer. The characters speak really bad english and the sound is terrible. You have to concetrate to listen because of this or you might miss something. And the Goblin sountrack is nothing like the one in Dawn of the Dead or Demons. All in all I think it is a bad effort. I feel he needs to get back to his roots like in his other classic movies Demons, Suspiria and Tenebre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is a good collection for anyone who is just getting into Dario Argento films. I think it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting, bad filming, bad ending, boring movie","review":"This film had some interesting moments but was basically destroyed by its terrible shot-on-video look, its stupid and confusing double-ending, and some really poor direction (ex: when the protagonist breaks his leg and repeatedly falls off his moped in the rain, the strong healthy man chasing him blatantly slows his running down to an impossible level of sluggishness to avoid catching him). It wasn't quite as out-and-out atrocious as Argento's \\"Phantom of the Opera,\\" but doesn't hold a candle to his newer, more graphic works like \\"Pelts\\" and \\"Jenifer.\\" It's mostly just dull, and filled with stupid characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, average movie...","review":"The premise of this movie is actually pretty interesting and original. As some of the other viewers have noted and as the DVD box states, the plot revolves around a serial killer who taunts police with online video poker - if the cops lose a hand, then (oh man, I can't avoid this one) then the victim loses a hand LOL (sorry) anyway... as I said, it starts out interesting enough, but quickly loses its way. Still I would actually recommend this one for a one-time rental. I think that if Hollywood gets a hold of this one, they should be able to improve on it and make for a much better and more thrilling movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE CARD PLAYER DVD REVIEW 1.5 / 5","review":"Barely gave it two stars but this film is dull. Although it took a different approach, this film had nothing there for me.Wow, a killer taking hostages for a poker game. I'm really dumbfounded other than that.

The date window could be a bit bigger, it can be difficult at times to read. And the size adjustment of the bracelet could be better, it is done by removing links only. I would like to see the adjustment at the clasp, with links as the last resort. Other than that, it is a nice clean design that seems to draw favorable comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Watch","review":"Solid build quality.

Very cool, big selling point. I like the simple band - so many stainless steel bands look too glitzy or cheesy to me - and I like the black face. The Roman numerals give it a certain elegance, but in the end I returned it because it is just a little too sporty for my taste. I want to be able to wear it swimming AND with a cocktail dress, so I sucked it up and bought a more expensive, more elegant watch someplace else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful functional watch!","review":"I love my new watch!

It is a nice looking watch. I would have liked it. However, seriously, do you not look at the watch and wonder why the roman numeral 6 is upside down? It shocked me when I looked at it. It isn't something you notice in the picture but it is immediately apparent when you look at it in person. I received it to day and will be promptly returning it. I cannot even believe these watches can be sold with such a flaw. Citizen should destroy them all to save their reputation. I have owned an eco-drive watch for 11 years and loved it. But when the capacitor goes bad it is almost as expensive to repair than replace. I was hoping this was the watch for me. Received it today and returning it today. Huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't believe I got a great Citizen watch for a low price!","review":"Everything about this transaction was perfect, just as if I bought this in a retail jewelry store...without the high prices!

I will never buy a cheap, battery operated watch again...only solar or kinetic watches for me now!

Perfect for casual or dressed attire. The black dial has silver stylized hands, a sweep second hand, and Roman numerals... which makes this an easy read dial for most.From top to bottom, I found the fit and finish on this particular watch to be excellent!

The band and face are made of sub-par materials and couldn't even handle my desk job. It's scratched from typing!? There's a deep scratch across the face, and the whole side of the band that I rest on my desk is all scuffed up. So I'm very disappointed. Why have a battery that can last forever if the watch can't last a month? Only other thing I don't like is that the date is so small, I have to look cross-eyed to read it. The whole opening for the date is 2mm, so you can imagine how small the numbers are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great spectical, Wonderful acting.","review":"As usual Duval was superb,as was the rest of the cast.I felt I was there.It gave me the sense of the time and space of those early days of the west.A sad story in many ways,but beautifully told, and directed.The scenery was as only the west can be, magnificent!

At the same time the actions scenes are fantastic. It is so emotional. Robert Duval is a great actor and he outperforms his role. I felt love and friendship when I was watching this movie.

I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes westerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent from start to finish!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed watching \`Broken Trail' and after viewing westerns for over five decades I would now rank this movie as my favourite. It is superb in all respects. The landscapes are spectacular, the acting brilliant, the action at times breathtaking and a storyline that readily elicits, in the viewer, a full range of emotions.The Blu-ray version does great justice to the movie. The colour, the sound and the sharpness of each frame make this movie a true high definition experience.The credits at the end of the movie indicated that the story was based on true events and this surprise, without forewarning, acted like the icing on an already delicious slice of cake. It's a movie that I will watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one!!!","review":"Robert Duvall - his usual superb self in the role of a western character.

Entertaiing and satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent beyond words!","review":"This is wonderful movie where the cast fits \\"hand in glove.\\" Words cannot describe how uplifting, heartwarming and refreshing it is to see a movie that focuses on compassion and care for others such as this, rather than the ad nauseum sagas of the self-centered, surgically \\"beautified\\" celebrities of today. Robert Duvall has starred in many movies that depict real people in realistic life situations, always with a villain we \\"love to hate.\\" MORE PLEASE! M.L. Paxton"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Duvall classic!","review":"I said it before -- Duvall can cowboy, period. I was born in Nevada, in the late 40s ( Gad, that makes me sound old! ), and I grew up around horses and drovers on a ranch. Duvall and Church have captured the feel of the old West -- the manners or lack therof, the life on the trail, and everyone who would like to see a little slice of life before modern conveniences should watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duvall is the Godfather of all Cowboys","review":"Beginning with his role as Augustes McCrae in Lonesome Dove(1989), Robert Duvall has carved out his place in western cinimatic history as the Ultimate American Cowboy. This is not to be confused with the great personae that a certain Mr. Eastwood, among others, has created during his remarkable film career. We're not talking about the \\"man with no name\\" that is today's hero, but rather the real cowboy that would also have been revered in his own time. In Broken Trail, Robert Duvall continues his portrayal of the sage old cowboy who is frought with human frailties, yet hard-edged enough to survive the dangers of his period. Just watch for Duvall's mouth movements such as spitting, chewing or the one-handed smoothing his mustache with a bit of saliva. He is THE GREAT AMERICAN COWBOY and this wonderfully crafted western should be watched just for Robert Duvall's presence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy!!","review":"I would compare this movie to BBC Planet Earth. Both films are great, have a lot of amazing shots and a few not so amazing. My machine plays this movie at about half of computing power, electricity is filtered, HDTV (used as monitor)calibrated with Spider2Express. This Blu-ray release is not as good as 3:10 To Yuma.

The senery is absolutely beautiful and breathtaking.I also really enjoyed the music.Not only is Broken Trail a very good movie but, also a very good a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Duvall Toally Rocks!","review":"My ex-wife turned-me-on to Westerns, which were not high on my hit list before giving-in to her, (Yes, I was a easy mark for a sweet voice and and a pretty face, unfortunately it wasn't hers and she ditched me when I remembered who's it was that raced my heart! Tami, if you ever read this I am sorry for any embarassment it brings you, you know it's All true, so don't damn me, please?) Anyway, once I made the conversion from Comedy to Western, I found Robert Duvall to be the epiome of a Western Hero. (Perhaps who Willie Nelson was thinking of when he wrote M Heros Have Always Been Cowboys) This is one of Duvall's finest, watch it, enjoy it and never forge Tami, I won't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't forget Duvall's role in Walter Hill's Geronimo 1993","review":"I have not viewed this film, but have read other reviews. I realize Robert Duvall had larger roles in his named western trilogy.

Awesome.Takes practice - I spent 3 tries getting the bag to shrink down to the approximate shape I wanted.

(We tried this on several attempts with 2 different sweepers.) We ended up having to take out some of the clothing to get it to vacuum, strap, and zip shut.

Unfortunately I had a few of the bottoms rip out (just pushing big items in) and they didn't seal all that well.Enter the tote's. The totes are essentially the normal space bags, but much better. The weakest part of the bag is now attached to a canvas/cardboard section (the bottom of the tote), the valve to suck air out is much nicer, and the zipper is now doubled up. Plus the tote provides safety for it when you toss it in a closet/move with it.They lose a star because it doesn't fit perfectly into the tote, and for how much more expensive they are than the original ones.

The regular space bags don't always keep an airtight seal and always shrink down to an awkward shape.I just moved to a small studio apartment and was excited that the new tote would eliminate the awkward shape that the regular bags have. The zipper is improved and so is the seal. However, I have packed and repacked my tote. I don't even have very many items in there, but I cannot get the square shape. I can't even get the outter tote to close because it doesn't shrink in a uniform shape. I have extra space on one side, but maybe its too tall...I rearrange everything and the same thing happens. No matter what I do I end up with a blob shape and nothing that will fit in the tote shape and zip shut. I guess I'll just keep trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally ruined my day. way to go space-bag. :(","review":"I thought everything was going well, put a bunch of baby clothes in the tote, vaccumed all the air out, it shrunk down to a nice size.

Knowing the bag was now worthless i took all the clothes back out & saw that the little hole had just grown into a huge massive tear all along the side of the bag. Anyway, the point is these things rip really easily. After reading the other reviews I knew to be very careful when I packed the bag, so i was being gentle with it. Now I have a heap of baby clothes 0 - 18 months on my bed that i need to re-sort, re-fold, and repack back into their good old plastic storage tote. I'm extremely irritated right now.

Well, it packed fine but when I tried to extract the air, the size decreased very little (yes I have used other space bags so I know how to \\"suck the air\\" out of them!). I thought that I could use my weight to tamp down the rest of the way and zip it like you would a suitcase - one side zipped but the other zipper came off in my hand - it is going in the trash.

Alas- the seal doesn't even work with my vacuum! I had to have a friend sit on it and push air out while we held the hose into the open bag and tried to seal it. As you guessed, it wasn't easy, wasn't fun and didn't make moving go smoothly. The mass obviously didn't fit in the tote either since it doesn't fit with my vacuum. So beware, you may have to run to goodwill, get a cheap vacuum and do it then. But you'd think name brand vacuums made in this century would work.

The songs here are very melodic and the keyboards complement without being overbearing. Gary is in fine form on par with his days in MSG and their superb second album.

Excellent quality, perfect length, I will probably buy some risers for it as she gets better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's well designed but not what I have expected","review":"It is a well designed backpack, I think... But the photo is very deceptive. It is huge (looks so cute on the photo... also it doesn't really give you the dimension, what's up with that?) and the color is really off green (not refreshing at all) and the worst of all, the fabric has metallic shine (that I don't like, seriously...) that is not shown on the photo at all. I think it's a good product but totally not what I have expected from the image. It's a poor advertisement that makes me mad not the product itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"whatever","review":"the fact that Journey continues on with the sound of Steve Perry is proof that the existing members realize that S.P. made the group what they are.'Nough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's Crying Now?","review":"I think most of us are. Journey was a really great band, but they seem to have lost their knack for truly great music. Red 13 isn't particularly bad, it's just glaringly mediocre. The only element that lives up to the band's past greatness is Schon's ever stunning musicmanship. That being said, the great songs just aren't there. Don't get me wrong; I'm not pining away at Perry's absence; I think Steve Augeri is a great replacement. It's the songs. Red 13 sounds like a band desperately trying to sound as good as they used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did you people listen to the same CD I did???","review":"I know we all love Journey, but c'mon!!! This is utter crap. You can hear the \\"home studio\\" feel from the first note of the filler \\"sounds\\" that start the album. If this was priced as a CD single, I wouldn't complain. I'd just say \\"Ok, I think we're ready to go into the studio and actually record an album\\". Maybe a couple of these tunes might be workable to put on that album. Let's get Kevin Shirley and get some production behind them.The new Journey Generations album is worth the wait. It's not Frontiers or Escape, but worthy (I think) of the name Journey. They should have named this one \\"Journeymusic - Red 13\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey - A Nice Little EP With A Somewhat New Direction For The Veteran Band","review":"\\"Red 13\\" was an EP put out by Journey and the second to feature Steve Augeri on lead vocals. Augeri's voice is very similar to former vocalist Steve Perry and he seems to suit the band well. This EP is under 30 minutes long and only contains 4 tracks (plus an \\"intro), but what is here is really good. The material is rocking and even nod towards progressive rock in spots. Neal Schon is once again front and center with some killer guitar work. The songs are all good to great with \\"Intro: Red 13 / State Of Grace\\", and \\"Walking Away From The Edge\\" being the best tracks. I don't have either of the albums that proceeded or followed this one, but if this is the direction Journey decides to go in the future I think it is a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!!","review":"I know this has been stated several times already with these other reviews, but this cd rocks! I am an 18 year old who has just discovered the magic of Journey a year ago and I can honestly say that out of all the Journey cds with Perry or Augeri, that this one is definitely the best. Although I wish they had added more to it, I think that it makes you wonder what they are going to come up with next, and Walking Away From the Edge definitely has to be my favorite Journey song now. I can listen to this cd over and over again and never get tired of it's raw energy and pure emotion. Steve Augeri's voice has never been showcased better than this! Buy it! You'll be glad that you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Journey continued...","review":"I really love this cd, if you are an OLD or NEW Journey fan it is a must have, Arrival too, don't miss out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey to the Future","review":"This cd is an excellent sign of things to come and a good direction for Journey,. The mythical guitar on \\"State Of Grace\\"along with the strong positive lyrics brings home the point.\\"The Time\\" combines a driving lead guitar and soulful vocalsto bring a message of love and perseverance. The highlight of the ep is \\"Walking Away From the edge\\". Steve Augeri's vocalsare emotional, passionate and haunting on this song.\\" I can Breathe\\" is a strong melodic rock song withan awesome and memorable melody. This ep shows thatJourney can still rock and that it has found a beat andsoul to continue with Steve Augeri and the talented drumwork of Deen Castronovo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I Know Why It's Called \\"13\\"","review":"I have always enjoyed the band Journey and this CD had potential except that it only 13 minutes of music dispersed over 4 songs. It certainly would have been a wonderful album if it was a full-sized CD. Of course the music is good but I am disappointed because they didn't think enough of their long-term fans to finish the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"They have lost thier minds","review":"I appreciate Journey's effort to change things up, but this cd ........ Arrival was much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this???","review":"I'm a die hard Journey fan... this album blows! I even like the new guy, but this album still stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Journey- but this ISN'T Journey","review":"I have been a fan of Journey for 25 years. I own EVERYTHING they have EVER done- pre- Steve Perry and post. That includes Arrival and this- Red 13. Journey with Steve Augeri is Bad English with someone other then John Waite at the mic. Neal Schon and Jon Cain should be embarrassed by this effort. Steve Augeri's voice is nice, but it is not Steve Perry. The song writing without Steve Perry seems contrived and empty. If Neal Schon and Jon Cain want Journey back then they need Steve Perry- DON'T waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Magic Is GONE!!!","review":"This is really a sad , pathetic collection of garbage. This will never ever be put in the cd player again.. The reason there is only 4 songs is because the band has run it's course and is out of ideas..

This bomb out of Canada features two unknown \\"singers\\" murdering otherwise decent songs, making you long for a Tuesday Night Karaoke session in [pick your small town / small bar] just to hear someone do the songs better.

The handle came loose on the first use. They're fine for small branches and twigs but certainly weren't made for the kind of work I had in mind.

Second book in the Windhaven series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This saw is easy to start and runs well. The only thing I wish Troybilt would have done was included specs on the chain in the instruction manual for chain sharpening (file size and angle) and replacement. Also, the rpm's on the high side should be a little faster for quicker cuts, but over all, it's a good saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful saw for a good price","review":"I've been through a few chainsaws and this one is pretty good. It's no Husqvarna but the 49cc engine is plenty powerful - with a few hours on it already, the chain never once stopped while in a cut, but it does like drinking a lot of gas. The spring-loaded starter is quite impressive; just a good steady pull and the thing starts. The only problem I have is with the plastic - plastic guards, oil cap and gas cap, plastic case. Aside from that, it's been performing well so far. Let's hope this one can last me a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"chains that bind and gag","review":"powerful chainsaw for dry wood...wet wood is another matter with this saw. the chain that came with the saw jumped the bar after about 15 minutes of use on the 3rd chain adjustment..you can get a better repalcement chain for it right from home depot. Also the wire coming from the shut off switch keeps working loose from vibration.it does eat alot of gas but the engine doesnt say maybe as long as the wood is dry.its an ok saw for the price.. ya get what ya pay for!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper than sending it off...","review":"I've had my Rebel XT for a few years and finally built up the nerve to clean the sensor myself. I didn't want to pay to send my camera away to have it cleaned, nor did I want to play the guessing game as to when it would return. My wife and I were planning to drive the Blue Ridge Parkway and I wanted the pictures to be sharp.I admit that I used two swabs to get the job done, and I also left a white circle on my kitchen table where the solution dripped accidentally. But, my sensor is clean and my pictures turned out great. A great solution to this annoying problem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Survival Kit Review","review":"I own a Nikon D5000 and the kit did a great job of cleaning my sensor without causing any damage. In addition to dust, I think I also had some wet spots on there that I was worried about. I didn't realize that buying some replacement swabs would be so expensive, but the the kit is still a lot cheaper than most of the other sensor cleaning products that I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product.","review":"Your all-in-one, easy to use tools to clean your camera sensor. The sensor has a bad habit of collecting hard to get rid of dust and fibers. I've never messed with the sensor of my camera before. But this was as simple as can be. You spray the provided, pre-wrapped swab with a small amount of cleaner. Move the swab even across the sensor one way. Flip the swab and repeat the other direction.I cleaned my Rebel Xt sensor for the 1st time since I've owned it. And it's better than it was from the factory(as it already had a few spots of dust on it when I received it). I had to go in with some digital retouch software and remove it.Cannot recommend a product more highly than this. For is simplicity. Safe to use and affordable. Who can even find a camera center whom provides this service anymore (unless you are near a big city). For the price and about 20 minutes of your time you can do it yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great!","review":"I had always heard 'never touch your sensor,' so I was terrified to spend a lot of money on a product that was going to ruin my camera. Figured this was a nice compromise It cleaned the sensor right up and now I'm back to taking pretty pictures. The little package is great for taking with you on trips too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs more swabs","review":"I had a persistent dust smudge that could not be blown off. This kit helped, but I had to use all three swabs to get the sensor almost clean. In other words, the first time moved some new (or unseen) dust to the edges, the second cleaned some of it up around the edges and the third removed most -- but not all. As per the directions, which make sense, I did not re-use any swabs.Other reviewers suggested making new swabs with the lens cleaning fabric that is included. Don't throw away the little plastic swabs that fit your sensor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - works as described","review":"I had a spot that showed up in a corner of the frame. After figuring out it was the sensor and not the lens, I was dreading sending in my Nikon D80 into a camera repair shop or directly to the manufacturer to have the sensor cleaned. I found this product on Amazon, and after considering the other reviews, decided to give this product a try. Just a few drops of the solution and one back-and-forth swipe of the sensor, and all the dust particles were gone. I was able to continue with my photo shoot within minutes. Pictures are sharp and clean again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - works as advertised","review":"I only recently realized that the spots that appeared on my photos when I used my new lens at F32 were actually on my sensor. I have a Canon Digital Rebel XT and have taken about 25,000 photos with it. Once I realized that I needed to clean the sensor, I did a bunch of research and found that the Eclipse solution was the way to go. I had tried air, and it just moved some of the spots around. There are other kits with more swabs and more sheets of lint-free cloth. However, I didn't want to spend a ton of money if I wasn't 100% sure I could clean the sensor.Well, the kit arrived tonight. I followed the instructions and used two of the pre-wrapped swipes. I went from about 32 spots of visible dust down to 2 - both of which are quite minor and are on the very edge of the sensor. I couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the risk","review":"For just a little more than the price of this product, you can have your sensor professionally cleaned by your local dealer. I made the mistake of deciding to do it myself and ended up with a scratched sensor filter thanks to a plastic burr on the very first swab I tried -- what awful quality control on a product meant to clean the most expensive part of an expensive camera body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless Product.","review":"I own Nikon D300 since 2008, and I see spots and speckles on my Photos and when I was looking for solutions to remove the same. When I went to a camera shop, they suggested a air blower(I bought the air blower and eventually, did not clean the CCD) and asked me to look for CCD cleaning Swabs and I bought the swabs here in Amazon.When I tried to clean them, it did not clean well and I put more lints on my CCD and I had to use all 4-swabs in this pack, still the CCD is not fully cleaned. I am planning to give my camera for service.1. It did not clean the CCD2. Put more lint on my CCD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"It was definitively a good purchase, specially since I was able to clean my sensor myself instead of sending it to a service center. The only challenge was to figure out how to use the swab and had to use two swabs before figuring out the proper way to do it.Once I figured out how to use them my sensor was clean as new.From start to finish took me 1 to two hours but I got swabs left for later use so I'm still saving money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works exactly as it says!","review":"You do have to take your time, and you do need a very good, close up light, but the swipe size and the cleaning chemical works perfectly. $80 for a camera dealer to clean the sensor once, or buy this kit and do it whenever you want for so much less. Works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"did the trick but needs more swabs.","review":"the case is very handy for holding your sensor and lens cleaning essentials together.I had a fairly dirty sensor and was able to clean it quite well. the only negative is this kit only givesyou 4 swabs and it took that many to remove my collected dust and grime. my sensor is clean but now I have to order more swabs to have at the ready.it is still cheaper than a professional cleaning so I'm happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have not used this item yet","review":"I realize that my four star review means nothing until I actually use this item. However everything included in this kit appears to be top of the line, considering its purpose in sensor cleaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work as described","review":"Based on some 4 and 5 starts reviews, I was expecting more. I had some oil over the sensor. I had to clean it up 3 times and it still has a small spot of oil remaining. It's a 5 fl oz bottle with alcohol, 4 swabs e 10 pec-pad for $21. If it cleaned how described I'd have had no problems with the cost and would've given 5 start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total crap sale","review":"I bought this as I really needed to get my sensor cleaned up. It arrived and I was all set to get going. I got the mirror up in the camera, got out a swab and was ready to put the fluid on and get cleaning. But what to my surprise, but the entire bottle of fluid was empty. There was not even 1 full drop of fluid in the bottle. Just a damp air came out of it when I squeeze the bottle. nothing. Total wast of time and money. Now I still have a dirty sensor and have to spend money again to get it clean.So in my opinion, don't by this crap deal. total waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Far So Good","review":"Does what it is supposed to.
