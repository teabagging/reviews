Beginning Hawaiian has one big advantage over the other two, it gives the vocabulary for each lesson in each lesson. In other words the text is set-up like you standard language textbook: dialogs/readings, grammar, and vocabulary in each lesson. The only shame is the high price of the audio that goes with the text.

This book was written for people who have access to someone who speaks the Hawaiian language. In the first chapter, it just brushes over pronunciation. The book then then gives an excercise in the end of the that chapter to review street names with someone who speaks the language.

It seemed that the information provided in each chapter was not adequate to perform the excerises in the end of the chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, but nothing amazing","review":"This album is good but not a masterpiece, unlike their later albums. Several songs are absolutely amazing, but a few songs are just standard dream pop fare and are somewhat forgettable. It's definitely worth the price though.Erik's Trip is a instrumental, and is a precursor to the lush sound of Souvlaki. It's just owerwhelmingly atmospheric.Wave,Catch the Breeze and Celia's Dream are all very good songs.I also reccomend Sister Sue, mostly for the vocal performance and the enchanting atmosphere of the song. The rest of the album is ok but nothing stands out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad and extra sappy","review":"Compared to Souvlaki, which I absolutely adore, this album is awful.

Don't hesitate to get this album if you like other Slowdive, MBV, Chapterhouse, or any other 'dream-pop' band. Slowdive helped shape the genre as much as anyone and this CD (along with the Slowdive EP) shows why. Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell's guitars positively shimmer on songs such as 'Waves' and 'Brighter'. If 'Catch the Breeze' doesn't send you on a trip, look for a different line of listening. And don't just think this is the bastard stepchild to Soulvaki. While that is a great CD as well, this one lays the foundation for everything to follow.

The size of the book reminds me of an elementary picture book yet the text seems \\"lost in translation.\\" For example, take the first paragraph of chapter three, \\"By this time, the home had long been a principal element of social status.\\" Using \\"By this time,\\" to start a chapter is confusing to adults let alone below reading level teenage readers (who the book must be aimed at). By what time? The series is supposed to cover 1800 to 2000, which time?The title would suggest that the focus is poor 3rd world countries vs. rich 1st world countries, but very little cause and effect relationships are discussed. Events of the 30-year period 1945-1975 are rehashed with very little weight given to poor vs. rich.

The film does not work as a love story, mainly because (as one other reviewer said,) the English man is so stiff and non-passionate. I could not understand what she saw in him. As a character study it doesn't work either. Her character is inconsistent - at times innocent and ethereal, at times totally erotic and conniving. As a supernatural movie, well, it totally sucked. Oh, and Meg Tilly's overly done thick accent plus the fact that in any language she felt she did not have to move her mouth or speak up made her unintelligible most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"this is a haunting movie-i cried at the end-don't watch it if you are in a good mood because it is sad. meg tilly is beautiful and does well aside from the annoying accent. the english lead is a bit too stiff. most of all, the movie makes a powerful statement about the choices people make for love, guilt, morality, society, etc"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent erotic fiction","review":"Much better than the book, it involves the romantic relationship between a young German woman and an Englishman, and the choices she makes to accomodate him.

Tenchu had competant graphics for the time, though ugly by 2012 standards. The controls definately had issues but lets face it, this is the best Tenchu game to date. Tenchu has not alway done well as a franchise but this has its charming moments. Years later, the thing that sticks out most to me is the Soundtrack. There are certani gamse you hang onto for the BGM's. This is one of those games. The over the top stealth kill and trying to unlock certain items is well and good but the music is the thing that always calls me back. This games wonky graphics and play controls were never anything to write home about and only got worse with each consequential sequal and retread. The first one is the best in the series, in my opinion. Priority was never graphics or packaging. It was all about the fun.. and lovely soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your Average 3D shoot-em-up","review":"Tenchu is an awsome game in which you're a ninja sent on a variety of missions and adventures. Unlike most other 3D games of this type, Tenchu stresses stealth. You need to sneak over roofs, past guards, over walls, and through houses to succeed in your missions. Killing is done silently and by surprise. If you make too much noise or are seen by your opponents, all of the guards in the area are alerted, making your mission difficult, if not impossible to accomplish. Great weapons, a well rendered environment, and awsome gameplay make this game a keeper! I only wish they'd come out with a Tenchu II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ninja stealth action taken to new heights....","review":"If you ever wanted to pretend you were a ninja, this is the game to get. The graphics are top notch and second to none in it's class. Everything is rendered in realtime so the loadtimes are minimal. The voice acting is quite comical, the line that comes to mind is \\"you chose the wrong party to crash\\", in a bad japanese accent. The game is all about stealth, so you don't want to go in playing as if you were rambo. The only educational value in this game is the fact that it teaches you how to sneak up on people...what are you still doing reading this review??? Just buy the game......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put, it's just not very good","review":"This game has a lot going for it with plenty of stealthy ninja action. The problem is that the cons get in the way of the pros. For starters, the controls are annoyingly bad. The fighting consists mainly of run up to the guard and mash the attack button and hope something connects. Usually your character will continue attacking even though your not hitting anything, meanwhile your being chopped to death by a guard. Next, the graphics really show the Playstation's age; in other words, they're terrible. More than once I was aiming my grappling hook at a nearby roof, only to watch the entire building I was aiming at disappear. But hey, if pop-up is your thing, you'll be more than satisfied here. One thing I liked was that it was challenging (mainly thanks to the controls). However, there are just too many other good games out there to get to even consider this one. Go get Metal Gear Solid instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tenchu Review","review":"Tenchu puts you into the world of fuedal Japan, where you play as either Rikimaru or Ayami, which are servants sent by there master to complete misssions for him. The game is great, setting you in 3-d environments, up against samuria, animals, and demons. But this is no run around and kill people type of game, you must complete your missions with stealth and cunning. But no game is perfect. Camera angles may get bad at times, most of the time in the heat of battle, and the voice acting could be better. Though having its problems, Tenchu is awesome. A must have for any action/adventure gamer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, overall","review":"This is a great game - the story line is interesting if not brilliant, and the change from killing everything you see to really needing to sneak around is great. The only problem, and it's a biggie, the camera angles are HORRIBLE. You often will end up looking at a wall, frantically trying to turn around while some guard is shooting arrows into you. However, in spite of the periodic frustration, it's addicting. To bad it doesn't support analog controller, tho."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best games I've ever played.","review":"My brother got this game for my birthday, and I loved playing it.

Even then I knew this was a special film. (A few years later I was extremely lucky and saw it in a theater.)

The characters, sets, and story so totally capture the time the film is set. \\"Children of Paradise\\" is such a unique film experience it is hard to categorize.

A wonderful cast, perfectly suited to their imaginative roles, seeks happiness in the early 19th century French theater world. Through the contrasts of divergent personalities and styles, Carne strips away the superficial, yet powerful, desires and distractions of intensely individual characters to reveal the central essence and motivation at the heart of each player. Garance, the beautiful and tragic female lead, serves as the hub at the center of a grinding wheel of love and hate and jealousy. The men around her--a mime, a stage actor, a murderer, and a lonely aristocrat--fight with themselves and their worlds to discover the key which Garance holds outstretched in her delicate hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best french film ever.","review":"Children of Paradise - Criterion CollectionSuperb remastering.Image as well as audio.

In level 1-3 at the end of the level, you are required to perform a \\"whack-a-mole\\" type game in order to get the last gobbo. Since the controls (or uncontrols) are glitchy at best and unplayable at worst, the game begins to not be a game and more of a nuisance.

The sight of the box just depresses me. It has almost talked me out of joining the Army.It may be the most realistic Vietnam movie, but the focus of the movie is on all the negative aspects. The troops are a bunch of poor white guys and minorities who are sacrificing their lives to capture a worthless hill, only so the hippies and college kids at home who are too afraid to fight (under the guise of saying it's 'immoral') can spit on them when they return. They deal with racial tensions and friendly fire. What makes it even more senseless is that you never really bond with the characters except to feel sorry for them, partly because you can hardly hear what they're saying. The whole experience of the movie is just depressing.

In fact, it's the only film that's based from a true battle... even Apycoliplise now or Dear Hunter doesn't justify really as much of the true war as this film...

The author relates his attempt to send a petty criminal to prison for 4 years for stealing $1 and uses the example as an indictment of the legal system, however it should have presented an ethical problem. The book lacks excitement but could be a guide for those unfamiliar with the legal system. The volume contains many facts, some of which are interesting, but they are never pulled together to make a meaningful statement.

Further the saw arrived damaged which was not surprising owing to the poor packaging. To amazons credit, they quickly refunded my money and the shipping cost, but it looks as though I may still be stuck paying the insurance needed to return it. I would be delighted if amazon was in the routine of describing where their products are made in the specifications section for each item. Surely, this is not the only example of this problem, and I know fir a fact that there are many people who, as a rule, endeavor to purchase items made in countries other than china."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cuts","review":"I Like the laser feature to align the cuts when cutting diferent angles so I know the lengths will always be what I want them to be , \\"Rigth on the money \\" .I wish HITACHI would include the same blade as the one they sell with the 10FSB. The blade they include in this Laser type is the 40T carbide and not the 72T carbide."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW what a saw!","review":"I've used the 8\\" model of this saw for years, but this is one fine saw! Took it out of the box this morning and it was dead on accurate out of the box. I need to tweak the laser (or just read the manual on how to use it), but it is a smooth cutting saw. Nice blade on it--didn't even have to buy a better blade for a decent cut. Quiet, smooth action. Can't wait to start cutting crown moulding with it. I'm impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"other reviews right on - a great saw with some minor flaws","review":"Bought the C10FSH as an upgrade to the DW703. Would say thatthe other reviews are right on the money. Saw was set upproperly right out of the box, and makes fine and accuratemiter and bevel cuts. Very solid, no slop. Soft start isexcellent.Before you buy, you should be aware of the following shortcomings:*the safety switch takes some getting used to. To me, it is a pain.*the laser does in fact have about 1/64\\" of run-out. It iscorrect at the fence side of the cut. Since this problemhas been mentioned by so many reviewers, I have to assume thatHitachi considers this a feature. To me, it is no big deal.*My biggest beef is that there is no vernier on the mitertable. On the DW, it is very easy to change the miter anglein accurate 1/4 degree increments. Not so w/ Hitachi.All in all, I got what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saw","review":"I am a handy man by trade. So I am not really into a lot of finish work but this is a great dual purpose saw. Its not too heavy being over the age of 65 weight is a definite consideration. Easy to use and the laser is great. I am getting used to pushing the saw blade in versus pulling it out toward me as on my old Dewalt. I like the slide feature as well. I found the reviews to be a big help. Enjoy the saw. Price was excellent as a fifty dollar discount was available at the time. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"After looking high and low for a sliding compound miter saw with laser this is the only one I could find. Although I was skeptical (because it was the only one I could find) I order it. I couldn't be happier. It's easy to cart around to job sites. The laser is terriffic, well worth the extra money! The trigger took a little getting used to (actually a safety feature), but once you get the hang of it, you love it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent buy for the money","review":"The c12fch is a nice saw and it can make up to 5 \\" cuts vertically. I did have to hold the guard back to get it to cut this but nonetheless it cut it. The only thing so far I do not like about the saw is that you can not see the laser if you are cutting verically. The laser is underneath the blade instead of up at the top hence the blocking of the laser by the wood you are cutting. So if this is a big deal keep shopping if not... this model seems to be decent. If you need the digital readout for bevel cutting crown molding then go for the c12lch. It's a little more expensive but would be worth it for the accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motor is small - Noise is loud","review":"I bought this saw after read all review on Amazon web site. The saw arrived almost two weeks later. UPS dropped it in very good shape. I didn't use it yet, I just gave it a test and these are what I found: like other review , the saw is good except the noise.This saw has 12Amp motor but the noise is much louder than some 15Amp motor saws.The bevel stops at 33.9 degree is corect but at 30 degree on mine is at 29 degree but I don't know how to adjust it. If Hitachi fix those prolems it would be a five star miter saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stairs Top 20","review":"I am a prossional trim carpenter and I have bought 4 of these Hitachi Sliding Compound Miter saws over the a 15 year period.

We've gone through four of these in the past month, all with the same problem, the positive stops on the miter wear out. The one on display at my local Mega-hardware store works fine after what I assume is constant daily abuse by tire-kickers. But ours die in one week. The saw is fantastic otherwise, beautifiul smooth cuts with no blade wobble, the laser has spoiled me, and it doesn't jerk on start/stop. If Hitachi could just make the stops more robust this saw would be a 5 star hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laser Guide the difference","review":"My Hitachi C10FSH just arrived yesterday (way ahead of schedule), 4-29-03. I ordered it on 4-23-03 with the free shipping. It came down to either the C10FSH or the Makita LS1013. All my cordless tools are Makita. I love them and was ready to go with LS1013 but it didn't have a Laser Guide. Even the boys on \\"Ask This Old House\\" were salivating over this new technology. After putting the saw through it's paces last night, I am very impressed with the saw.I agree with just about everything said below. Peter Jung's review comparing this saw to Makita's LS1013 are mostly accurate but I'm sure he would agree those minor (some extremely minor) differences are very much outweighed by the laser guide feature of the Hitachi. Why Makita hasn't come out with a Laser option on their saws is a mystery to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing rocks!","review":"I did a lot of research (Bosch, Makita, Dewalt, etc.)...but when I went to Berland's House of Tools (Illinois) and saw them all side-by-side, it was a no brainer. It is relatively compact (a good thing), and the laser is great! Only drawback is size of table...overall, extremly accurate. One last note, the 40 tooth blade is very good as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Power Drill that was promised with purchase","review":"Saw is great however Hitachi promised a power drill with purchase and never fullfilled.

This saw was dead on right out of the box. Saw is built very well and very easy to use. The add on miter guides are a great addition if doing alot of crown molding since the ones that come with it are rather small. Saw has plenty of power to handle 2x8 material with no problem. This saw is great for all around remodel work from framing to cabinet trim and crown molding."},{"rating":"2","title":"One sweet deal","review":"Originally I intended to buy the C10FSB but to make a long story short I bought this one. I wasn't really sure how I'd like the laser but I love it. A co-worker has the DeWalt 12\\" which is nice but this blows that out of the water. It's very well constructed and has a great slide action, very smooth. The laser reads very clear and accurate and is very easy to adjust from a left side cut to a right side cut. It's not very bulky to carry around the job site and the 10\\" blade is a great size. I highly recommend this saw, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"Historical romances of 20 years ago often depicted a naive young woman in dire circumstances, and a hero who's a rogue of the first order.

These games are a must have for anyone, especially those with kids who want quality titles without buying shooters. Only these three Spyro's are worth the time though.

The only new things are fighting bosses. Second, it has no puzzles. All you need to do is find A few statues and your wisked away to the next 'exciting' level. Third, There is no plot to the game, all you do is dart around killing enemys, and even though the enemys varie, they all fall into about three catagories, which I won't waste my time typing. The reason why this game got 2 stars was its size, which i must admit is quite large. Basicly, don't i suggest leaving this one on the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me Puke...Literaly!","review":"This game had graphics that were really bad.

After probably 5 minutes of playing this game, the perspective and bad graphics made me motion sick! And I am not a person who gets motion sickness! Anyway, even if I could have gotten over my sickness, this game is boring anyway.

This is a very fun game in which an evil creature called Gnasty Gnorc scatters gems all over the dragon world, turns some into his minions, lets blue thieves into the dragon world to steal their precious dragon eggs, and encases all the dragons in crystal. He missed Spyro, so it's his job to turn the dragon world the way it was. The graphics are colorful and the sound and music are also nice, and as for replay value, it has a fairly good amount. If there is one thing to complain about, it is the difficulty level. The enemies don't put up too much of a threat, and finding gems and dragons is usually fairly easy, and even the bosses are pretty easy to toast. But it can prove quite a challenge to some people, and may include some testing with some things. But besides these two facts, Spyro the Dragon is a nice, colorful game that is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for kids","review":"The best kids computer game I've seen.

Trying to move around is difficult and can be confusing, especially when you're under attack and things are chaotic. The characters move unlike most games. You don't go in the direction of the D-pad, rather you turn with right and left direction and move with a button. It was poorly designed. But since the Playstation 2 is out, and better games as well as more Resident Evil, there's no reason to pick up this game anymore.

This game is an absolute classic. It is not like your new generation games, where you can save anywhere you like and \\"heal\\" by simply waiting, crouched in a corner somewhere.

First, the motion of enemy creatures such as zombies is so realistic that children can't enjoy them. Second, solving tasks is often difficult. Children can't find the key to solve it. Finally, the story is very confusing with respect to human relationships and time-line. Children can't follow them. Therefore, this game is too hard for young children to play alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Game That Gamers Should Buy","review":"This game is GREAT! The story line makes you want to keep going. You get a hand gun, magmum, rocket launcher, and more! The game is really long because you have 2 cds. One is for Leon and one is for Clarie. You have to play both of them twice to bet the game. You also get to play other people too. Make sure you buy this game. It is the best Resident Evil game so far. BIG IMPROVEMENT from Resident Evil 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can This Game Be Any More Fun?","review":"Resident Evil 2 for the PlayStation is one of the most impressive games. The graphics are superb and the plot is fantastic. If you feel like you're torn between playing a puzzle game and shooting things than there is no doubt that this game is for you. The Resident Evil series incorporates puzzles into the horror genre. If you played the original Resident Evil and loved it baby you'd better pick this one up. If you haven't played the original then you should give this game a try it is worth at least a rent for everyone. Be sure to watch all of Capcom's beautiful Full Motion Video sequences, the only thing that can be said, Breathtaking.

Late September here... I just pulled out the ol Resident Evil 2 disc.This is one of the most \\"creepy\\" experiences you will ever have. This game is just plain wonderful. And the two story lines are both great. The one, Claire helping the young child Sherry out of trouble, fleeing via the sewers. The other, Leon, discovering love, teaming up with Ada to get out of Raccoon City. These sad storylines are perfect to the gloomy atmosphere of the game.The game is a complete success in creating the \\"feeling\\" of cloisterphobia, as any Survival Horror should. You are trapped in a small area... zombies everywhere outside... invasion of zombies... you gotta fight! Its great.

Knee chairs are very comfortable and good for your posture, but not this one.My biggest beef with this chair is the base. Your feet get caught on it all the time, and it does not make it comfortable. There is also something wrong about the distance between the knee pad and the seat. The knee pad (as others mentioned) gets \\"wobbly\\" with time, but all you have to do is tighten it up, so that does not bother me that much.I still use it as my gaming chair, but I definitely cannot sit for very long time. When I get uncomfortable, I find myself sitting on it as a regular chair with my feet on the floor.I would avoid this one, and look for a different knee chair. There is something wrong with the design of it besides the base. It just does not feel quite right.For the quality of the chair, I would say this item is way overpriced.Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good and as expected","review":"Excellent.

In other words, the Baha Men are a boy band. I didn't realize this before, but now that I know it, I have trouble listening to this cd because of my lack of respect for any boy bands.

It covers all the bases, Ridgway, his crimes, the victims and the policemen who doggedly pursued their suspect until DNA brought him down. I'd happily recommend this book to any true crime fan.

Ellis also talks about parts of history that are generally not mentioned--the march on Washington by unpaid ex soldiers, the socialism movement in America, Herbert Hoover as a person and what he thought he was doing--just a much more complete picture of an incredibly complex time without easy answers.

The warp room allows you to choose 5 levels at a time. There are many weird secrets. Like in the first level, once you get the regular gem, return to level one, and don't break ANY boxes. You will get the blue gem. Plus, you can save any time, unlike the original. And you don't have to not die to break all of the boxes.GRAPHICS: Very good for a 1997 game. Everything looks great!MUSIC/SOUND: The music is very catchy, and the voices are decent.OVERALL: A great platformer for the Playstation! A must have!PS: You CAN refight bosses.

Of course, if you are planning to use your phone with a Bluetooth earpiece, this shouldn't be an issue at all. But I wanted to use this case with a Plantronics earpiece (and a Treo 700w)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"General design good but... My phone fell out and broke because the bottom snap became unfastened. When I stepped down from my truck the two snaps in the back opened and my phone dumped out. I used a hair tie to loop over the antenna and this worked. After months of opening and closing the snaps wore out, and wouldn't stay closed. I used JB weld so they wouldn't open anymore. The bottom opening was never the right size to plug in for hot sync or charging. Easier if I removed phone from case. Finally, the multidapt clip stitched to the back of the phone broke. Same as other reviewer. One side of the slide track broke. Luckily, I found it on the floor at work. All this within one year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky and inconvenient","review":"I bought this at the suggestion of a friend. I replaced the original Treo holster which constantly unlocked allowing the phone to drop. I thought that this had all the features that I wanted, and it did, except it also had two very unwanted features; 1) it took a relatively slim and lightweight PDA and turned it into a clunky heavy instrument and 2) the snap on cover makes it difficult to answer, you need to unsnap first. This should have been a magnetic closure.I think some of the other Krusell products would be a better choice for me, one without the cover which doubles the amount of leather.I tossed this and ordered another holster by another manufacturer, one that hopefully will not lose the phone every time I stand or sit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for you if you use the headset jack","review":"I should have listened to the guy who did the other review and mentioned this. When the krussel is advertised, it states that it's made perfectly to fit the detail of the phone. They make it seem as if for each port you will have no problems accessing them. But that is not the case. I agree with the other guy who said when using the headset jack it doesn't fit properly. I have problems as well. What happens is it keeps coming out when you push the headset in. The case is too bulky in that area or something. I've gotten to the point where I just take my phone out of the case to listen to the MP3 player, and I shouldn't have to do that. As it is designed for you to be able to access the headset jack when the phone is in the case. So before purchasing this just ask yourself, If you're not able to use it the way it was intended, then do you really want or need to buy this case? I learned the hard way. I didn't listen. Don't let this happen to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read...","review":"I originally used parts of the book for a research project, but after reading portions I decided that I must have the book and reread it from cover to cover.

Wheeler has one of the most increible voices and singing styles of any singer out today, and it's a shame more people didn't buy this record when it was out and she could have used the sales. There's a smashing ballad (\\"Do You Care?\\"), Jam&Lewis production (\\"I Adore You\\", which was the only really good song on the deplorable MO' MONEY soundtrack) and some other great, surprising gifts of vocal agility, grand production and simply good songwriting.

It's shocking just how bad the movie is, the acting is wooden, the storyline non existent and the loop holes are gigantic - the only good thing was the sexy half naked studs especially the blonde guy, what a pair of pecs. The guys should have kissed and made it what it was meant to be - soft porn.I did enjoy those bits mind you, very homoerotic.Next my unfortunate friend who witnessed the horror:-The only thing this movie is good for is maybe as a door stop. There is so much badness in the film, it makes me sick! I consider myself a bad actor, but compared to them, i'm oscar material. I can't believe they went so low as to use a plastic axe!

(It's not that subtle!)I can say though that these two movies are well filmedThe first movie is about a frat of vampires who want to initiate a young studly jock. These vampires are fangless though, using instead an amulet (similar in concept to 1983s \\"The Hunger\\").I can't understand why, when two guys get into bed with a lady to feed from her they all remain in their underwear. She obviously gets a high from feeding them, but I can't see why... whether she's on drugs already, or not, because these vampires don't seem to be able to mesmerise their prey.The second film is about a young warlock who tries to initiate 3 studs into a covern. This is even less interesting than the first, but just as elegantly filmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad at All","review":"This is a fun little romp through the world of the supernatural.

Then you release a \\"collection\\" of maybe three in a set. Come on!!! You know a vast majority of people would buy the Justice League Season 1 & 2 etc.. straight out or Superman or Batman.

This is an excellent show and the fans do want to have this for their permanent collections, so lets not take advantage of them hmm? J.L.

There are two seasons of Batman: The Animated Series to be available soon and the first season of Superman: The Animated Series is on its way as well.

That's about all I liked, though.Bill Moyers is normally a great journalist. Why he would choose to attach his name to this disc is beyond me. Perhaps he could have collected different guests, people who are speaking from real life and not from text book theories, and then it would be worth the purchase price.I would save my money on this....nnless you have chronic insomnia, which this disc is SURE to cure as it put me right to sleep both times I tried to watch it in it's entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Temps Forever","review":"The Temptations were one of a kind.

It's not. Instead each episode has a brief introduction by Tom Hanks and is a dramatization of the events that happened pertaining to that episode played by somewhat familiar faces in the movie and tv industry. And though that could have been a car wreck, it wasn't, by far. Instead it turns out to be very entertaining, and encompasses more of the details that would arguably have been boring and difficult to convey in the standard documentary format. This is a must watch if not buy for anyone interested in the subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am i alone?","review":"I watched the first episode thru gritted teeth. Slow, corny with childish dialog. How can the history of manned space missions be reduced to this? A very inaccurate portrayal of NASA and a sugared up view of the politics surrounding the whole era.The ever present awful music is enough to put you off you next episode (yes i tried another 20 mins but enough was enough) and after reading the rest of the reviews i seem to be out numbered. Still if you want a show to watch with the intelligence required of lets say Baywatch this is for you-not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"The 1st seven parts of a 12-part series are pretty good - but the 8th part undercuts the value of whole series as far as I'm concerned. The 8th part, which dealt with the aborted and near-disasterous Apollo 13 mission, should have been a story of the triumph of magnificent behind-the-scenes technological solutions to incredibly difficult problems. However, the Apollo 13 story was instead inexplicably turned into a 3rd rate soap opera highlighting 2nd rate journalism. For that huge mistake in producer judgement alone - my recommendation is to not buy the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Docudrama?

There's enough archive material to make such lame reenacting absolutely absurd.

The stories are inspiring, the cinematography breath taking and the approach is refreshing and powerful, particularly regarding the Apollo 13 mission.

Alas, I can't get that excitement back from watching this otherwise excellent series. Why? Because I'm deaf, and because HBO, even though it spent oodles of money on producing this series, continued its long-time habit of ignoring deaf audiences and didn't spend the extra pittance to provide closed captions on these videos. About 3 million Americans are getting shut out of Hank's loving tribute to Project Apollo because of this short-sighted attitude on HBO's part. If you care about those things, please write to HBO and express your indignation, and maybe, just maybe, HBO will see fit to close-caption this great series on its next reissue, opening it up to a greater audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the 1998 1.33:1 release advertised","review":"Ordered the listed item: 1998 release with 1.33:1 aspect ratio (the original release). Received instead a set clearly marked as 16:9 with a 2009 copyright. Not an improvement. Disappointing. The conversion to 16:9 simply cut off parts of the original. Not worth the loss. Can order current version of 16:9 release for far less, if that version was what I sought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mini-series, but incomplete","review":"The HBO series \\"From The Earth to the Moon\\" reflects the quality that HBO used to produce before becoming obsessed with political slant and programming aimed at the lowest common denominator. The mini-series contains everything that outstanding entertainment should have. The subject matter can be riveting at times and the life that the actors and actresses breath into their characters make you come to care about them like personal friends. I will always be grateful to Tom Hanks for bringing this to the small screen. The only flaw in the DVD box set is that it is incomplete. The original airing on HBO had eight additional episodes that started with the Mercury astronauts and took the viewer through the Gemini program. The omission of these episodes leaves the experience incomplete because the Mercury and Gemini missions were integral to the eventual moon landing and gave further insight into the drive of the astronauts involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aspect ratio is NOT 1.33:1","review":"I give this one star not because of the series - that easily rates 5 stars or more - but because the info for this version says it is in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The box is labeled 16:9. I already own the Signature Edition, which is also 16:9, but I was hoping to get a copy that was produced like the original series - in 4:3!If you don't care about what the producers did to the video to make it \\"widescreen\\", by all means, this is TV at its very best and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

I have to agree with those reviewers who state that the aspect ratio is wrong. It may be true that the series was shot in 16:9 and I remember seeing it that way on Belgium TV, but this is not that version! When watching these DVDs it very soon becomes clear that something is wrong: the top of people's heads are frequently cut off, sometimes an action that takes place at the bottom of the screen is not visible. I also own the Dutch DVD-set of this great series which has 4:3 aspect ratio, no extras but very cheap, less than $10,00. Comparison showed that the Signature Editon used the 4:3 version and chopped off the upper and lower part to get a 16:9 version. Again, if the series was originally shot in 16:9 than this is not that version! Shame on you HBO for passing this chopped up version of a brilliant series as an expensive so called Special Edition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"really cool series","review":"Outstanding HBO series.

For instance, when Alan Shepard reenters the earth's atmosphere in Freedom 7, it almost looks like a tiny model strung up in front of a sky backdrop--it reminded me of the old 60's TV show \\"Thunderbirds,\\" it was so hokey. It was obvious that HBO did not have the bankroll to snag Digital Domain, the same people who did \\"Apollo 13.\\" (To steal a quote from another space film: \\"No bucks, no Buck Rogers.\\")Luckily, those glaring moments are few and far between, which is why I gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Congratulation Tom Hanks...","review":"This TV HBO series was the best I ever have seeing and the realistic pictures are fantastic ...Congratulation Tom Hanks and all staff include all the \\" extras \\" that make this dream come true it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shows","review":"This is one of the best mini series HBO has ever done.

The box and all the CDs say 16:9 widescreen and it is wide screen (16:9) when you play the CDs.This means that this is not an original version as advertised.

It's his Apollo 13 on steroids."},{"rating":"2","title":"'From Here to Eternity'","review":"Before the magnificent documentary \`In the Shadow of the Moon,' HBO's \`From Here to the Moon' was a multi-faceted miniseries that encapsulated the Apollo program for the near decade America prepared and went to the moon. As a reenactment, the show illuminates the challenges, logistics, relationships, dangers, and interpersonal strife found in the experiences that shaped the precious time when man actually reached and explored the lunar surface. Tom Hanks, who is a main sponsor of the project, is the consummate narrator and a good writer, but his helm as the director of the first episode is comparatively lackluster, which should not deter anyone from seeing all twelve installments, each bringing a different piece of the trajectory of the missions, and most recreating an exciting adventure with an unpretentious look at some lesser known controversies, problems, and issues behind the headlines. The combined talents of many make for excellent viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required viewing","review":"This miniseries is an excellent portrayal of the triumph of the human spirit that was the \\"Moonrace.\\" One of the most amazing things about this program is that the landing of Apollo 11 occurs at the halfway point. This series truly chronicles the entire Apollo program and makes one ask, \\"Why haven't we been back for 30 years?\\" This series should be required viewing for all American kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"The spirit of Apollo enshrined","review":"This production represents the most far going attempt yet made to capture the thrill, the glory, the triumph and the courage that was Apollo, while not losing site of the simple humanity of most involved. It spans the entire programme in a way shows what it was about that space programme that made it special: constant challenges, innovation, novelty and high adventure. Manned pace exploration in the 60s and 70s was really about the exploration and not exploitation of space!Anyone interested in the Apollo voyages to the moon with find this series a magnificent homage to those trips. The individual triumph of many of the astronauts is brilliantly captured, the awe, the tenacity, and the spirit of bold curiousity suffuses these programs: I loved them. The series is perhaps almost as uplifting as the programme itself, and show Apollo for perhaps what it really was: the most inspiring act of faith, courage and singular purpose of the twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of both worlds: the Earth and the Moon!","review":"This is by far the best mix of informative entertainment. By far not a documentary, but the best way of educating those who can't hack sitting through one. I do wish some day, a program of equal quality will be released to cover the Soviet side, now that the information pertaining to that era is more obtainable.I will say this series does spark my patriotic fire every time I see my beautiful flag flying up on a rocket, or escorting our brave Americans onto the moon. If your one to \\"be offended\\" by American patriotism, remember this historical fact: the United States of America landed on the moon, the land of immigrants, making up the best of this world in one nation, in an undertaking of such a grand adventure that only us and the Soviets were willing to do, than I recommend you not see this movie. Especially if your a canadian or from Portland, OR, left coast, USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series!","review":"This is a terrific series done by HBO and Tom Hanks! If you enjoyed Apollo 13 of the Right Stuff, this is will become one of your favorites, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant","review":"Don't think to much if you are space generation person. Bravo, Excellant, beautifull journey to the moon..............."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earth to the Moon-Signature Edition","review":"This documentary series focuses mainly on the people involved in the Apollo missions. It is well done and very watchable, even for those who don't profess to be \\"history buffs\\". Personally, I would have liked to have seen more about the science and hardware involved in going to the moon, but even so I highly recommend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie: A- DVD: A-","review":"Tom Hanks executive produced this mini-series after completing Apollo 13 as a way of detailing the entire Apollo program. Each episode is a story about a different aspect of the endeavor and each features different writers, directors and actors. As a whole, the series is a wonderful adventure and a great history lesson. Cameo appearances by many, many well known character actors enhances the fun. A few of the episodes really stand out as special, but the entire series is more than worth watching. The entire video was shot on video for HBO but still looks great, special effects are as good as in any movie and for the DVD, excellent 5.1 sound is used. The boxed set includes a fourth disc containing extras that I have not seen, thought I anxiously await the opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence in Presentation","review":"I wasn't an HBO subscriber when this film came out and only saw one portion at a friend's home during its original run. That was enough to convince me to buy the series on DVD even before I owned any electronics that would play DVDs. Since then, I've purchased a DVD player and I am as impressed by the content and the quality of this production as I was back when I saw it the first time. For those that are younger, it takes a committment to get through all the episodes, but they will learn much and reap great rewards. For those of us that were actually alive during the Apollo years, who watched as NASA unfolded a dream for us, Tom Hanks and HBO take us where we only dreamed. Despite its cost, I can easily recommend this set and would encourage moving it to the top of your buy list. It is a welcome look at a time when this country had the courage and the imagination to do things that were indeed great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Hanks... you have earned M.W.O.'s total respect!!!!","review":"Mr. Hanks, Being of the Mercury generation, I am in total awe of what you have accomplished with \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\". I am just sorry I had not seen it when it came out on HBO. I don't do TV much at all. As I sit here in the 100\\" dome collecting data for astrophysies, I can't help but be jealous of the dedicated astonauts that got to touch what we only image. I am in awe. Thank you for your skill in revealing the true lives of the men who helped us achieve the knowledge we now hold. I truly hope each generation holds this documentary dear as we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's Greatest Adventure!","review":"This is without a doubt one of the greatest stories in American history. I am only in my twenties and unfornatley was not alive during this great moment of history, however this mini-series does such a great job of recreating a time that changed the world forever. If you are interested in the space program at all I would pick this up along with The Right Stuff, and Apollo 13. One final question: When are we going back?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Story for all mankind","review":"I decided to get this series because I really love Apollo 13 and I'm a big fan of Hanks. Call me crazy but I cried in every chapter. Each and every one of the mission (or chapter) has its own story, its own drama in itself. The truth that we would never known. Who might have thought about marriage life of these astronuats, I was shocked to realize that 7 out of 9 astronuats in this Apollo program got divorced. Man, it hurts me in a way, though, that these brave men and sacrificing ladies gotta suffer house broken problems because of the stress this astronaut job put on them. Anyway, every single episode has its own glory. It reminds me how long i've forgotten to dream the impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic! Awe Inspiring!","review":"I watched this series with my two children ages 3 and 6 and we were all mezmerized. It really captured the excitement of the era. I highly recommend From the Earth to the Moon as well as October Sky and Apollo 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute must have!","review":"From The Earth To The Moon is a must have for anyone interested in the Apollo program.

Wonderfully entertaining piece of work.At the end of each episode, the end credits list the episode's cast. Anyone besides me notice that at the end of Episode 12 the credits list the cast for Episode 6? I don't know if the production/crew credits are correct or not for Episode 12, but the cast listing is explicitly shown to be Episode 6.Hee hee.Have the DVDs? Check it out for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the lunar surface above, this collection shines through","review":"There are certain events in history that change a society's collective conciousness for all eternity. An event that not only stirs emotions but also brands a generation. Like a child eventually breaking from the grip of a protective mother we, as a species, took one more step away from our protector's grasp. Tom Hank's not only puts a personality to the men who risked their lives to step foot upon our lunar neighbor, but puts a face to the thousands of humans who gave their all to make sure those brave men made their fateful steps safely. While this a tale of fantastic feats, it is truly the tale of everyman. Bravo, Mr. Hanks! Bravo, for your fortitude and creativity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"This was the best documentary about the man and the journey to the Moon. Tom Hanks did it great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man I Wish I'd Listened to the Bootleg First","review":"Like I said in the title, I really should have listened to the bootleg version my friend had a few weeks ago that way I would have saved $10.

After being a fan of their first CD i only assumed that their second one would be as good or better, but then i bought the CD and realized that I was wrong. All the songs sound exactly the same.

I tried to like it. I was hoping for the same intelligent lyrics we all loved on TAYF. But if you are expecting music that you can instantly like/relate to while listening to it the first time...this isn't it. The lyrics are cliched and get surprisingly annoying real quick. #3 is the only song I can listen to occasionaly, but even it is too repetative. Okay, we get it. You've got a bad feeling about this. So do I."},{"rating":"1","title":"TBS-Cut From The Team","review":"I hate TBS for many reasons. They make crappy, untalented music. Their biggest fans are 12-16 year olds. And most of all, they made this crappy genre of \\"screamo\\" or whatever and got it played on the radio so now their are a million boy bands all over which are carbon copies of TBS. And they all suck. This is not rock and roll. This is not even rock. This is untalented noise. And i listen from everything from punk to reggae to death metal to classic rock so i know music kiddies. This whole generation of music absolutely sucks. I even met TBS at a party at my friends house once and smoked a joint with Adam, the singer while he was completely wasted and i regret not telling him his music sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Punk","review":"Alright, don't get immediately mad just because of the rating, I don't care if anyone likes this music, as long as people stop calling it punk, it is a far cry way from these guys to the original punks (clash, sex pistols, etc.) who, before you complain about this simple fact, all released albums over twenty years before any of these bands existed, in 1977, so, while I respect the music these bands play, it is definitely not punk in it's true form although it may be very slightly influenced by punk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emo is pure,wussie crap","review":"I hate emo to death, only rich skinny [...] posers listen to this emo,screamo p[...].

The rest of the songs on the CD fall under pop-punk, not well-thought out emo.Save your money if you already have the first CD.p.s: the person in the spotlight review was \\"surprised\\" by the fact there was a slow song on this album. makes you wonder if they even listened to the first CD...Ghost Man On Third?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where I Didn't Really Want To End Up","review":"I find it hard to believe that the band that released this album is the same one who made 'Tell All Your Friends'. I realize that there was a bit of a line-up change in the band, but c'mon...this album pretty much blows completely and verges on totally sucking. The songs aren't catchy and are just all around not good. This is the most disappointed I've been about an album in a long time.My advice: don't waste your money on this, just put in 'Tell All Your Friends' for the hundredth time and listen to it again instead. You'll be much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"so it wasn't exactly TAYF...","review":"it wasn't what I expected, considering I loved tell all your friends, but it was still an OK album. hence why i'll give it four stars. I've heard worse albums out there, and it probably wasn't worth all the 9.72 I spent on it, but it does have a couple of catchy tracks on it that were definately worth it. If you liked TAYF, its a different twist, so I'd listen to a sample of it before spending your money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gift and the Curse of an amazing debut","review":"For anyone looking for the reincarnation of Tell All Your Friends...well you won't be getting it. And maybe that isn't such a bad thing. Tell All your Friends was an exceptional album, but the band had to grow. The lineup change certainly gives way to a slightly different, but not unfamiliar sound. The tracks run smoothly together, except for the oft mentioned \\"new american classic\\" which appears oddly in the middle of the album. But that aside this is a very good album. If you insist on nitpicking the album apart you'll never enjoy it. Tell All Your Friends may have created them, but if they want to stay afloat they must get better with each album and I think they have. Signs of maturity, and a much deeper sound littered with everything from acoustic guitars to a string section makes this album a good step forward. One can only hope they can make further strides forward with a third album. Let's just hope it doesn't take nearly as long to surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the original... but still worthy","review":"Although I miss the original TBS line up... this album is still worthy of the TBS name. The lyrical content is not as passionate as Tell All Your Friends, but still catchy... and still delivering some of my favorite one-liners...\\"Go on just say it, you need me like a bad habit, one that leaves you defenseless dependent and alone!\\" Tell All Your Friends is still my favorite release from TBS... But I recommend you go and pick up Where You Want To Be! - and if you get a chance to see these guys live.. DO IT! They still put on an amazing show... and for those of you who do not know, the ex-members of TBS are now in a band called Straylight Run.. check them out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Rocks!","review":"Taking Back Sunday will not dissapoint a single fan with their follow up of 2002's Tell All You're Friends. While Where you Want to Be does present a diffrent sound, it is still very much Taking Back Sunday, and proves their skills as musicians. Each and every song is amazing, and you can definitley tell the band took their time to produce the best album possible. I also had the opportunity to see them in concert and meet them last week, and they were awesome! I just want to give a big THANK YOU to each of the band's members for working hard to give us something truly great to listen to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to this a few..","review":"Man...wasnt a big fan of tell all your friends..sure...I liked Cute without the E..great romances..and youre so last summer...But...This album...changed my thoughts on the whole \\"emo\\" scene...Phasers to stun was the reason i bought it..great song..but as I listened to more of it..its an amazing albums..one of the few you can listen to for years and not get sick of it...The song i recommend...you may not like it at first..but the best song on here by far..is \\"slowdance on the inside\\"..its cool stuff...listen to it...over and over again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hasn't let my CD player","review":"I got this CD the day it came out. I popped it in my CD player, and that thing didn't leave it for 2 weeks straight. FOR REAL. These guys are tight, their interwoven vocals are awesome, the music is theirs. They are not your typical emo/rock band...they pour their hearts into their music both lyrically and musically. I haven't had the opportunity to see TBS live yet...but if their live energy is anywhere close to their album...WOW!Get it now. You will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Album","review":"Long time TBS fan, Long Island native grew up listneing play small crap clubs before anyone knew who they wore... TAYF was great, listned to it from the day it came out till now and still do frequently... with the new album, i dunno its deff good, not in anyway bad but they have begin to lul into a more monotone sense, and it lacks small things that TAYF had... still a great buy... still a great cd, and still grows on me, and probably will for a while... but not to the standards of TAYF, TBS is still my fav though! :-D"},{"rating":"2","title":"werd.","review":"This release is freakin awesome. Not as good as TAYF, but it's up there. Adam's vocals sound better on this one and it sounds more put together musically. And Nick Torres (singer from Northstar) singing and co-writing the last song is deffinately a plus. Although, I do miss Adam and john's dual vocals and the violent lyrics from TAYF, so I'm only giving it 4 stars. The best songs are: One-eighty by summer, I am Fred Astaire, Decade under the influence, and Slowdance on the inside.Also, check out Northstar - Pollyanna... probably the best CD released this year"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking Back Sunday the sequel","review":"Just as in movies, most sequels never live up to the expectations. TBS may not have made a cd as fine of quality as TAYF, but this is a very good cd nonetheless. With two band members leaving I think they produced as close as a sound as they could to their first Cd. They are a little bit harder rock now, but I think it's a good change. The weird thing abbout this cd is it says it has two sides, which I don't quite understand as all 11 tracks are on the same side, and also that the lyrics are very hard to follow as they are not in seqeuntial order. Otherwise this is a very good disc. Best tracks: A decade Under the Influence, Set Phasers to the Sun, The Union"},{"rating":"2","title":"Builds on and passes excellence of Tell All Your Friends","review":"First off im a big fan of TBS, after hearing their first single I picked up TAYF which impressed me and didnt impress me. Some of the song swere mind blowing, the last minute of you know how i do and their single are wicked..along with ghost man on third...but overall the album wasnt as good as what it could have been. I just listend thru this album for the first time today, and was only dissapointed by the first trakc, and the album version of moshpit. The CD itself is amazing, wicked hook sand awesome vocals throw the lyrics out there and mae one killer CD. Pick this up if youre already a fan or if you are at all interested in hearing the band second only to brand new. Hope this helps ya somehow. later"},{"rating":"2","title":"TBS *almost* successfully avoid the \\"Sophomore Slump\\"","review":"It's usually a pretty common thing for a band to get stuck in the \\"sophomore slump\\" as the difficulty in making a second album as great as the first is called. Taking Back Sunday definitely made an almost successful attempt. Unfortunately for them, in the previous year they lost two very important band members: John Nolan and Shaun Cooper. Fred M. tries to supply equivocating back-up vocals to John Nolan's, but he just can't pull it off like Nolan. Adam Lazzera is still fronting his little heart out, but his vocals have lost quite a bit of edge. The instrumentals have lost edge as well, and it appears that Taking Back Sunday are in the beginnings of selling out their sound to what is \\"popular\\" today.Nevertheless, I give \\"Where You Want To Be\\" some credit based on exceptional lyrics. I'm also allowing some space for the loss of the greatest back-up vocalist in the world--John Nolan. That's why the second TBS album gets only FOUR stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"2ND EFFORT DOESN'T MATCH THE FIRST","review":"I was uber excited to get the new TBS cd. Tell all your friends was an amazing cd which is hard to take out of the cd player. But don't buy this cd expecting the first one. This cd has a whole new sound, its more poppy and radio friendly than the first. Its my personal opinion that this change has hurt the bands sound but some people like the new sound. I like their old one better and their old sound, but check it out for yourself, you might like it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"No sophomore jinx!","review":"The songwriting is original, the vocals and melodies are perfectly meshed. Much more refined sound than TAYF. The band has matured and is poised for great things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jebus Christ why did they let John Nolan leave?","review":"Taking back Sunday lets everyone down. Their first album \\"tell all your friends\\" is probably one of the best albums I have ever heard and will remain in my playlist. \\"Where you want to be\\" wants to be back on eBay where I got it. TBS lost their heart and sound when they lost John Nolan. His backup vocals were always incredible. Their new sound with out him is a turn for the worst. I'm sorry I never saw the real TBS play live (adam just had to crack his hip). WIthout JOhn Nolan taking back sunday is taking back friday too. What is there to look forward to in the week now? Check out www.straylightrun.com JOhn's new band"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Terrible compared to the old album and Straylight Run's debut.

Face it, bad drums, bad bass, horrid guitar. Name me one Emo guitar legend. You can't. Anyone that had their heart broken could have written these abysmal lyrics. Back to the album, my friend has it and he also agrees its bad. He let me listen to it and by the time it ended, I was apauled that this is where music is standing today. So why don't you go buy some Led Zeppelin and let the true Rock heroes show you how its done. And maybe after you Emo kids are done crying, you should throw this album away and your tight clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this band","review":"This is one of my many all time favorite bands.

Their first cd is absolutely fantastic. One of my all time favorites. But this cd... I can barely even tolerate it, at best. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because I like the first two tracks. To me, the loss of John Nolan severely hurt TBS.This cd is full of honest to goodnes pop-punk. To be honest, I actually like Louder Now more than this record. Songs such as \\"A decade under the influence\\" really dont cut it when compared to classics like \\"Timberwolves at New Jersey\\" and \\"No 'I' in team.\\"And maybe it's just me, but I think that \\"Number Five with a Bullet\\" basically is just a retread of \\"You are so Last Summer.\\" But that is just me.-peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"still my favorite","review":"yea...this cd's awsome..even though the old guys were great, i think the new ones add a lot to the band also...they have a couple softer sounding songs on this cd...but they still go all out on all of them..i cant stop listening to this cd...my favorite song on it is probably one-eighty by summer...but anyway, this cd is different, but its still great...give the new guys a chance =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not the same without Nolan and Cooper.","review":"I am a huge taking back sunday fan, so of course to popular belief, I was excited to see the new cd on the shelves. I picked it up and listened to it in the car. It gave me a headache. I figured since that I get carsick often that I should just listen to it when I got home. It was dissapointing. The songs are repetitive. The only thing that was really a pain to listen to were the vocals. Yeah okay, Adam was still there, but it just felt a little odd with Fred. He tried, but its just not the same. This is my opinion. I want to sell the cd or throw it away. I just like Set Phasers To Stun. Thats All. Buy yourself a comfy pair of flip flops instead of the CD. You'll get lots more use out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"this cd isnt my favorite of TBS's but it was definitely the one that got me into the band in the first place. a lot of the songs are really great like the opening track and a decade under the influence. i love fred's addition to the band and i wish he was still a member because he complimented adam really well. overall this cd is great and reminds me of a lot of great memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit turntable","review":"The hole in the center of this record is too small for the metal piece in the center of a standard turntable.

Wish I could get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking back this album to the store..","review":"OK, so maby I'm not really returning this album..another beer coaster couldn't hurt, right? I picked this album up after hearing \\"Set phasers to stun\\" and \\"a decade under the influence\\" on the radio, which I should have realized that is exactly what this band is: radio pop rock for teenage angst. The singles on this album keep me from giving it 1 star, but I still give two grudgingly. If you enjoy the emo/screamo or whatever this genre is, then you will probably like this album. Otherwise, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT cd....but its not as good as the first","review":"Yeah...I love tbs but this cd needs to be a little more depressing like the first.

I've had it for a week-ish...it's righteous. The album is more than just sappy, \\"my girlfriend left me, I'm so sad\\" stuff that usually comes wrapped up in an emo album. The lyrics are beautiful as well. My other frineds (the more harcore, heavymetal, pig destroyer-tuners) like some of the tracks as well, so obviously this record is a good one to check out, even if you don't like emo. Take it from me...I'm an oipunk metal core chick, but this album is lovely and sickly righteous."},{"rating":"2","title":"No sophomore slump here.........","review":"For those who say that \\"Where You Want to Be\\" isn't as good as \\"Tell All Your Friends\\", I agree with you. For those who say switching band members was wrong, I agree with you. For those who say \\"Where You Want to Be\\" sucks I disagree. A CD with two good songs in \\"Set phasers to stun\\" and \\"A Decade under the Influence\\" along with nine other tracks that are okay don't mean it sucks. This CD is still good and its one of the CD's I listen to a lot. From a musician's point of view (I play guitar), this CD is better than 'Tell All Your Friends' in musical terms at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Band lost most of its talent...","review":"... when John Nolan and Shaun left for Straylight Run. There is no variation from TAYF to WYWTB. TAYF was unique but WYWTB leaves much to be desired.

Also, Adam could easily be replaced with any hobo from the streets of NYC. Tell all your friends NOT to buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emo happened in 1986 - It's over now","review":"Yea, so here's another up-and-coming group, Taking Back Sunday. Ok, who had it? People, aren't you catching on yet? One lame band makes a record (how? I have no idea), and another band sees the popular response to it, and light bulbs go off. \\"Hey we can do that.\\" That's what you're getting here. This needs to stop. If you're not a musician, stay out of the studio; because kids hear it and don't know any better. They've gotta have something in the CD player of the sports car that daddy bought for them. Bravo music video corporation! They've successfully marketed a mediocre sound as something more than than. If this kind of stuff moves you, I just don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"I don't know how people can like this band so much. The only good song on this CD is Decade Under The Influence, thats it. All the other songs are too overdramatic, boring, sappy, and just dont hold your interest. These guys aren't really very musically gifted either, nothing on this album is amazing music wise.

That whiney, snotty, off-key frat-punk style of \\"singing\\" has got to go! Who buys this do-do? Someone does because it obviously pays to become yet another copy of this sound. I blame Blink-182, the original snotty, annoying, frat-wanna-be-punk vocal. What was Robert Smith drinking when he agreed to record with them? Of course, the Cure has become a shadow of what they once were anyway. Like so many others, Blink jumped the Green Day bandwagon. Green Day jumped bandwagons too, but they came up with pretty much their own sound that so many tried to copy. At least it's not emo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hORRIBLE","review":"this cd is a total sellout cd.there old cd was grade a emo punk. now all they are is a pop punk band that should either quit or find there own \\"identity\\" do me a favor review writers check out there old cd if you want to see some good roots emo - punk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love watching Everybody Love's Raymond on TBS!","review":"OMG, LOL that guy in their song totally looks like Fight Club. I wish I could meet that guy, Fight Club, because I would bet he would teach me all about his philosophy on life and fight with me. But I would not hit him as hard as I could because I might hurt him and he has a pretty face. Then me and him, we would go to the bar and talk about soap, and about girls while this music played in the background and we'd feel sad about how dames are so cruel, and they just want to go out with the jock and bone him and don't want me because my hair is dyed black, and they can't deal with my realness. So, then Fight Club would tell me about his philosophy, and I'd be so floored by its realness and I'd adopt it, because it is the most brilliant philosophy ever because they made a movie about it, I think it was called Fight Club, in honor of my friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nails on the chalkboard","review":"This band has the most overwhelmingly EXCRUTIATING vocals I have ever had the misfortune of hearing.

I have had the cd for about a week and just can't get into it. I guess this is what happens when the main songwriter leaves the band.

TAYF was a classic, a break through. And it's hard to live up to that, but TBS tried.Band members changed, about 2 years have a passed, and TBS has a new cd out. And for one, I think it's great!The new cd improves in some areas that were flaws on the old record. The first two songs on the old record really annoyed me because they tried too hard.The new album doesn't do this. They have fun melodys and catchy chorus's. Which makes \\"Where You Want to be\\" a fun album.The only thing that doesn't deliever much are the lyrics.Those seem to be kinda worn out.Putting all this aside, WYWTB is a a fun album that any TBS fan with the attention span of 4 minutes will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"I am now officially in love with this band.

I've never listened to their 1st one but after listening to WYWTB I'm not sure if I should give it a chance. The only 3 good songs are 1(not wonderful), 3(excellent), and the last one.

What I heard was a deadly dull collection of character studies and vignettes exposing the not-so-scandalous secret thoughts of some small town people. Certainly it had a few moments, but none of the stories ever resolved themselves or built up any significant narrative tension. Even the language wasn't particularly inventive or evocative. Characters were introduced, thinly sketched, and then left the stage - sort of like \\"Cats\\" without the music.I'm neither a lowbrow reader nor overly culture-bound, but these voices from the distant heartland simply didn't speak to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portraits of the Human Condition -- American Style","review":"Many writers in American literature have tried to gather the conscience of America by traveling across the landscape of the country to pinpoint something truly American. Sherwood Anderson does so by placing his story (or stories) in one single, Midwestern town called Winesburg, Ohio. The stories that present the personalities of the residents of Winesburg are quite eloquently written. The characters of Winesburg are odd, horrific, lonely, young, old, and beautifully human. The time period may have past, but Anderson's characters continue their lives by something Anderson has captured from American culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth","review":"First and foremost this book is not a collection of short stories, but rather a novel based on a boy growing up in small town America. However, this town is like no ordarny town, it is full of people made grotesque by the truth of their own past. An eye opening account of human sexual desire and the truths that haunt us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unrenowed Author deserves props","review":"A great American Book of short stories by A Great American author who is widely unknown. If you like reading about the human nature by someone qualified to speak to that subject I would recommend this book. This book is not suitable for the low-brow Opra Book club types."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glipse at the timeless lives of ordinary Americans...","review":"This collection of short stories gives readers the opportunity to see through the lonely eyes of the small town people of Winesburg. Each individual is just that--an individual. Each experience and story that has been collected in this book is full of life and emotion, intense at times, and relatable. Though the stories are only loosely connected--in that the characters are all from the same town--the wonderful variety and perspectives of the town's citizens gives Winesburg life with a realistic taste any reader can sink his or her teeth into.As a prospective English teacher, I would highly recommend this book for any high school classroom. But I would also recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading stories with rich characters and vivid description."},{"rating":"1","title":"bizarre, depressing","review":"I have read this book and yet I am still trying to figure out what the author was trying to get across. The bookd just left me with a somewhat depressed, glad-it-is-over feeling. I grew up in a small town in ohio and yes, there are some weirdos there just like any other town or city, no more no less. With that in mind, I did not get any kind of a \\"message\\" from the book--unless it would be to avoid small Ohio towns because of the weirdos. The book was not written in an enjoyable, entertaining fashion, so I don't think entertainment was the intent. As for being a \\"social commentary\\" on the times or a \\"snapshot\\" of Ohio history--I surely hope not--this town is out of the norm, not a representation of it. This book is just a schizophrenic collection of rather bizarre, boring people with no philosophical or historical point, no entertainment, no social commentary, not even amateur \\"reporting\\". Strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ohio verities","review":"Malcolm Cowley suggests in the introduction that Winesburg, a unified story collection, is comparable to the SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY and THREE LIVES by Gertrude Stein. \\"Godliness\\" is superbly and significantly at the center of the collection. It has four sections encompassing three generations of a prominent family. George Willard is a presence in many of the stories and his consciousness serves as a kind of organizing principle. The book is grittier than the SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY, more organic, less contrived. In this production Sherwood Anderson's artlessness works. George Willard, reporter for the WINESBURG EAGLE suffers the death of his mother. He is eighteen. At the time of the county fair he decides to leave Winesburg. The young man is going out of town to meet the adventure of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greats","review":"It is ridiculous to write a review of a Sherwood Anderson book as he is one of the greats of American literature. If you read you must read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange editing","review":"This edition of \\"Winesburg, Ohio\\" was edited in a very bizzare manner. It seemed as though the text from another edition was brought over and simply pasted to this edition, which caused words to be hyphenated in the middle of paragraphs. In other words, what seemed to happen was where a word that might have been at the end of a line in one previous edition was now positioned in the middle of a line, but it was still hyphenated as it had been. This was very distracting and after the second page I had to stop reading, because the hyphen-ation was break-ing words that should not have been bro-ken and, in effect, alter-ing the em-phasis and meaning of the text. Very shoddy editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsequential","review":"Take the simplicity of William Saroyan but omit the charm. Take the sparse imagery of Robert Frost but omit the poetry. Take the kaleidoscopic view of small town America of Edgar Lee Masters but omit the humanity. And there you have Anderson's Winesburg. There is no elegance in his style and no consequence in his narrative. He seeks to reveal Middle America with a series of vignettes but the result is a frustrating, meandering journey to Nowhere, Ohio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desultory, Depressing, Dismal","review":"I really had to force myself to plow through \\"Winesburg, Ohio,\\" and it's only a little over 200 pages to begin with. I can't remember a book that depressed me more, except perhaps for \\"Tobacco Road,\\" and at least that book was leavened with some humour.\\"Winesburg, Ohio\\" is a series of loosely connected stories, each one centering on a different inhabitant of this small Mid-Western village. In a nutshell, all of the characters are lonely for one reason or another, all make attempts to reach out to others for some solace and/or emotional companionship, and all fail miserably. Sherwood Anderson's writing is flat and airless, never varied, and the whole enterprise sinks under the weight of its own monotony.I give this book two stars instead of one because I'm feeling particularly generous today and because Anderson's writing did seem to greatly influence the course of the American short story. Read away if unbroken despondence is your bag; otherwise, pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money at ANY price","review":"Typical of many of his generation (the much-vaunted and even more overrated \\"Lost Generation\\"), Anderson is a cross between Pathetic and just plain Weird, and the psuedo-intellectuals who termed his work \\"literature\\" were mostly just self-absorbed fools. \\"Winesburg, Ohio is just a poor joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winesburg, Ohio","review":"I tried and tried, but I could not get into this book.

The walks and secret places that lead to self discovery are the essence of growning up in such a place. Everyone knows what's going on in Winesburg but no one knows the meanings because it's the self discovery and perspective of a young man. The good news and bad walk the streets of Winesburg hand in hand. Not a comfortable place for most but a challenging one for thought and reflection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"There is no plot, just a random series of events and facts.

There is nothing to make me care about any of these characters, though, no emotion at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed dribble.","review":"\\"Winesburg, Ohio\\" is one of the worst books I have ever read. I have no problem with dreary and bleak books - as long as they have a purpose. I do not see any point in this book. I found Sherwood Anderson's writing to be babbly and incoherent at times - as if he was writing the first thought that came into his head. I felt that he was just using many words to take up space. The characters were not fully developed and they all had the same characteristics and personalities - there was no versatility. This book is a complete waste of reading time. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh s*it","review":"don't buy'em the jacket is kind of like Towel lookinand it's heavy and too thick for this summer~~oh my gosh I don't think I can even wear themdon't buy'em it just the waist of money~~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate Prayers and Poems","review":"This is a beautiful bi-lingual book. It really offers a look at some of the real feelings that at least one Guatemalan was having during the years of civil war. The original Spanish is on the left-hand page, and the English translation is on the right. In the back, there is a Notes section where the English reader can reference some of this historical references made in the poems and prayers (the deaths of certain people was one of the most helpful).As I do a lot of work in Guatemala, I found this book to be very touching.

Don't get me wrong. There are moments of outstanding guitar heroism on this disc. \\"stray cat blues\\" is a superb and psychedelic take on this closet classic from the stones. \\"bad luck situation\\" is stuttery and funkin'. And the solo in \\"Hurtin' so bad\\" is heart-wrenchingly impeccable. As you can tell, I like this recording a lot; I even like the sax solo on \\"Feedback on Highway 101\\" courtesy of Johnny's brother Edgar.

An enjoyable experience from the guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than the bad rap it gets","review":"First of all, you have to get past the fact that Mick Jones and Topper Headon are not on this album. But it's not Strummer's and Semonin's fault that those two were smacked out of their minds. That being said, this is not vingtage 1977 Clash, it is however, a pretty good album. They go in some new directions, although not to the extent as in Sandinista! and the end product is well worth a listen. Joe Strummer made such precious little music that we have to take what we can get.If you are a Clash fan or a Strummer fan, you owe it to yourself to own this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally misunderstood...","review":"First off, there are 2 tracks on this album that I would argue are as good or better then almost any other \\"original\\" Clash song. They are: \\"Three Card Trick,\\" and \\"This is England.\\"While this album does have some synth drums and cheezy ass effects, I think it is totally unique and cool. I see this album like this- this is what came between The Clash and The Mescaleros.If you like The Clash enough, and consider yourself a huge fan, buy this album. You won't regret it, even if just for those 2 songs I mentioned above- they are awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BLAME JOE!","review":"This album isn't indicative of the Clash's talent, nor Joe's. True, Mick was kicked out by manager Bernie Rhoades, and a new group was put together, but after Joe started work on this album, it was taken from his hands. This IS NOT A CLASH RECORD, IT IS A BERNIE RHOADES RECORD. The songs are Joe's, and they aren't all bad. So, do yourself a favor and buy Joe's solo albums if you're looking for post-Mick Clash songs. \\"Rock Art and the X-Ray Style\\" is excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I listened to this recently for the first time since 1990. Since I first heard it, I have tried to pretend that it doesn't exist.Over twenty-five years since this monstrosity was unleashed, the pain and the scars still exist.What a dreadful awful load of bloated garbage. This hideous catastrophe drags down the name of an absolutely amazing band. A Clash record without Mick Jones? What were they thinking. Rhodes and Woody Mellor should have been impeached. Even my dog hates this album. I would consider using the forced listening of cut the crap as a cruel and barbarous unnecessary form of torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Does Not Even Deserve One Star!!","review":"This is the most unlistenable, unmelodic, poorly played, badly-written record I have ever heard ANYONE ever do.

Otherwise, an embarrassment and an indication of what Strummer would do in the future: nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Just like Lennon needed McCartney and Jagger needed Richards, Strummer without Mick Jones is not the same. This is a Strummer project, not the Clash, and it hardly deserves to be considered along with any other Clash album. Anybody who considers this to be a great album must be a johnny come lately, who never saw the Clash live or picked up the Clash's albums when they came out on vinyl the first time around. All of their albums were breakthrough albums that stretched the boundaries of music and solidified their role as the only band that mattered. If you consider Green Day or the Offspring punk, go ahead and buy this album, but for those who were there the first time around and know better, don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums all time.","review":"This album seems to bring out extreme responces, you either love it or hate it. I happen to love it. Particulary the tight rythmn, and full blooded guitars. Unlike other reviewers, I do hear the original Clash in this CD(i.e. London Burning, or I'm so Board with the USA) in tunes such as \\"DIrty Punk\\" and \\"Dictator\\". Its too bad this new Clash broke up. I knew a friend who did get to see them and he was impressed with the rythmn work live in concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you cut the crap from this you'd have a decent ep","review":"this is like a Clash karaoke lp with faux punk singalongs. there's actually some potentially decent songs but you'd never know considering how crappy they sound.

Their songs, albums and general outview on society have influenced countless amounts of bands from U2 to Rancid. However, this album (very ironically titled) was a major blemish on The Clash's near-perfect musical record. Mick Jones was ousted in '83 and the new members went about carrying on The Clash's early sound, playing live shows that emphasised volume and speed - a way The Clash hadn't played since 1980. \\"Cut The Crap\\" was removed from Joe Strummer's hands after the demo stage and completely ruined the album with electronic drums, out-of-place samples and mob vocals. Because of a egotistical and nutty manager, The Clash's good name was blemished forever. I recommend that you have a listen to the post-Jones/Headon Clash, but don't get this album. Get your hands on a bootleg from 1984 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Collectable\\" (read: sparingly purchased) sixth Clash album,","review":"You wouldn't get into many fights going around saying Cut The Crap wasn't the best Clash album. Released in their final year of trading (1985), imagine a Beatles album recorded in 1971 without Paul or Ringo. The mighty Topper Headon had left under a drugs cloud in '82, and co-songwriter Mick Jones was thrown out in '83, but Joe Strummer and Paul Simonon (casting themselves as the \\"wise men\\") soldiered on with three \\"street kids\\" (according to the sleeve), and recorded this 40-minute suicide note, under whose wonky beatbox, Pistols riffs and terrace anthems Strummer's unique personality is buried. It contains a song called \\"We Are The Clash\\", but they weren't - The Clash were the greatest rock'n'roll band in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every Band has a Swan Song","review":"...and this is The Clash's. Had it been released as a Joe Strummer solo record, it might not have inspired the vitriol that it did on original release. But that Strummer and manager Bernie Rhoades had the nads to include \\"We Are The Clash\\" as a song pretty much guaranteed that \\"Cut The Crap\\" was soon going to be known as \\"Pull The Plug.\\" There was exactly one great song here in \\"This Is England.\\" I have since dropped \\"Cut The Crap\\" from my library since that song's appearance on \\"The Essential Clash.\\"Other than that, if you must have all that The Clash and their spin-offs have recorded, \\"Dictator\\" and \\"Movers and Shakers\\" have some appeal. Tis a skippable CD, afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not really the Clash.","review":"After Mick decided to go (rather than stay as he questioned on Combat Rock) Joe, Topper & Paul were taken to another planet and replaced by this garbage band.Okay, that's not really what happened, but oh I wish it did. This album sucked. I refuse to own it in my collection. I'm not trying to over-emphasize Mick's contributions to the Clash, but, well, they were terrible without him (though all of their solo projects were great).This album is terrible. I guess if you are one of those new Green Day/Sum 182 fans, you will love this stuff since all that other new stuff sucks too... However, if you respect the clash, and love their music, forget about your curiosity to hear this and just let it go. Even Joe and the rest of the band were later ashamed of this album and didn't even acknologe it as a Clash album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the Clash's \\"Indian War Whoop\\"","review":"This widely despised recording actually reminds me of another widely scorned recording - Indian War Whoop - by an equally influential group of musicians, the Holy Modal Rounders. When I first heard Indian War Whoop, a record apparently recorded while the musicians were tripping heavily on LSD, it was unlistenable, and I regretted buying it. But, with later listens, it sort of grew on me. I don't listen to it often, but when I do, I recognize a real musical core.So too with this mess of a record. It's really not the Clash, but there are a core of halfway decent songs. It's not a great record by any means, but not nearly as bad as many would suggest. I suppose, though, that it deserves to be seen as a footnote to the Clash's, and Joe Strummer's, otherwise fine musical careers.I could really do without the drum machines, both here, and just about everywhere (with perhaps a few exceptions, such as Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, and a handful of techno acts)."},{"rating":"1","title":"a fatal attempt to make a clash album without mick","review":"This album is F*cking BullSh*t. Dictator is the worst song ever recorded by the clash. Though I do give Joe credit because This is England ain't that bad. Overall this cd sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good song, cut the rest of the crap","review":"This is England is an inspired song which taps into a lot of the social unrest that was still present in Thatcher's Britain - \\"Ive got my motorcycle jacket but I'm walking all the time.\\" The rest of the song seem like a disappointing football game, they just glide along, without making any real impression on you at all. Generally, this album is only for completists. There is so much better material in the Clash's back catalogue that is worthwhile and you may as well go back to The Clash / The Clash, or London's Calling or Give 'em Enough Rope."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album is not indicative of the clash","review":"'Cut the Crap' is a seeming spin-off from \\"Over-powered by Funk\\" on Combat Rock. In it we see a lot more 80s pop influence (synth) and a lot less punk. The songs are boring and the clash seems bored playing them. I liked Combat Rock, and I liked it's experimentation. But this, this is complete unindicative of the Clash, in that it mires their political message with commercial trappings. It is by far the worst clash album. (And it pains me to say that.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keyboard Only Tracks","review":"I purchased this product due to the first review and was terribly disappointed by the sound of hearing the wonderful Jerry Herman score played by just one keyboard using its bells and whistles.

I expected to read the history of Borden Chantry, father of Tom Chantry, and how he died, as Tom Chantry always talked about in L'Amour's book, North to the Rails. This was an attempt by a western writer at writing a mystery, which he obviously had little clue how to do. I was disappointed in it. It came across as a book someone would write just to make his quota of three books a year. I grew up reading L'Amour, and I wasn't pleased with this book. There is a new author critics call The New Louis L'Amour. He also puts mystery in a lot of his books, but this guy is really good at it. If you really like L'Amour, I would suggest you pick up a copy of Jonas's Death of an Eagle and compare.

BESIDES the fact that it's a boxed set.","review":"So I'm writing this not based on the fact that it's a boxed set of these three movies, but based on the fact that any one of them is not so impressive. I don't like Baz's direction because, in very short, it doesn't allow for the viewer to have an attention span - it felt like a continual climax and it tired me. (This is for all three of them, by the way.) Any one of them entertained me for about 40% of the time. That's 2 out of every 5 minutes for each movie. Therefore, it deserves 2 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I had already bought the Moulin Rouge DVD and absolutely love it. I had seen Strictly Ballroom some time ago and loved it too. I find these two movies very entertaining with all the color, wonderful music, super dancing and top notch acting. I have thoroughly enjoyed the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile Purchase","review":"This is definitely a worthwhile buy if you're willing to incorporate material that isn't canon published by the D&D publisher. There are many creative ideas here, including those for tattoo and ritual magic. One downside is that it has a heavy leaning to the Scarred Lands setting. This is no obstacle if you are willing to rename or rework some spells/artifacts. This book is especially nice for druids, paladins, bards, and to a lesser extent rangers. They seem to get many of their own spells instead of overlapping wizard/cleric spells which the Player's Handbook seems to do. It also has about 8 new prestige classes.The reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the layout isn't as eyecatching as official D&D material, and the art is of dubious quality, not to mention lacking colors. This should not be a strong deterrant to purchasing this useful book, but should be noted. Overall, a very useful buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not needle holders","review":"This is a 5\\" hemostat, not a needle holder as advertised.I arrived today in a brown envelope without a receipt, invoice or return labelI will be returning this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not arrived at expected time","review":"there was so much delay in arrival of this item so I returned it back , ..... .... ... .."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gloves","review":"A must have for a masquerade birthday party we attended in costume. we were decked out from head to toe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fierce, hot salsa at its finest.","review":"I must say I enjoyed the very little I had heard of Azuquita and some of Kako's work with Maelo, but this album was a pleasant surprise. It has some of the best fiery salsa you will ever listen to. \\"La Fiera\\", \\"El Candado y La Llave\\", \\"Guaguanco Soberano\\" will just blow your mind. The arrangements are fantastic and the musicians here are seriously on point, from the congas, timbales, bongo to the extremely (I dare say) majestic trumpet and trombones. Another thing I like is that each instrument is given an opportunity ot shine with a solo. Highlighting the musician (which don't get enough credit in my opinion)is very important. This is one of the best most obscure albums I have heard in a long time and mind boggling why it hasn't been remastered. Interesting to note that Barry Rodgers, Ruben Blades and Adalberto Santiago took part of it.

This is the slimmed down version of Gold: Greatest Hits. People complain about the lack of tracks on this album, however people have to remember that this version of the greatest hits is marketed towards the US...which would mean...us! Like,no way. Avid Steps fans will buy Gold, while the casual listener will pleasently enjoy this best of. It has the disco thriller \\"Chain Reaction\\" (which is reason enough for a purchase) plus other fantastic Steps classics. Worthy of a purchase for the young and the young at heart. Plus, who can resist \\"Tragedy\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Songs Make This Worth the Price","review":"\\"One for Sorrow\\" is a marvelous song, and the female vocalist (Claire Richards) is absolutely terrific, right on target every time she hits the stratospheric high notes. Great pipes, and she must have perfect pitch to be so invariably accurate. Wow! \\"The Last Thing on My Mind\\" is also a true winner, beautifully sung to an impressive arrangement. By the way, this is not Tom Paxton's folk song of the same name (for which I recommend Tom's own version or, even better yet, the jaw-droppingly fabulous recording by the Australian supergroup, The Seekers, with Bruce Woodley as lead singer). Other material on the disc is pretty good, too, but the two I have mentioned more than qualify this release as a good investment in pop excellence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read before buying Best of Steps!!!","review":"Here's the \\"supposed best of album\\" of the recently departed band Steps arriving as a last effort of the music label to milka few quick bucks. Don't get me wrong, I loved Steps for theirenergetic pop tunes, dance routines and charismatic attitudes, but what you get in this cd are 8 songs from the 1st US CD, 2 from the 2nd one, leaving only 3 \\"new\\" songs imported. In my opinion, more songs from the second album Buzz should have been included, balancing the CD for old and new fans. The other letdown is that the import version of this CD has more songs (17 or 18), better selection of songs that were never selected or given a try to be released in the US. If you really like Steps, get the first US released albums (Steps One and Buzz) and shell out a few extra bucks for the imported version of this CD (called Gold)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect modern music!","review":"Sarah Nixey is better without our band Beat Box Recorder!

I read it from cover to cover and wished I had found it 20 years ago. It is extremely informative, and should be read before evaluations even take place. Then one would know what to expect.

This movie made me feel embarrassed for the people in it. The topic would seem to have a lot of potential but the folks who are featured are repulsive and there is not enough in-depth exploration of the art to make it interesting. The story rambled, and the Americans (yes, that includes Paul Pena) behaved so awkwardly it was painful to watch. There was just a low-level vulgar tone throughout the whole movie. In many scenes, Paul totes a beer and looks like an indigent. He comes across as pathetic, socially tone deaf, and totally unworthy of his own talent. Mario was a boor - always coming up with something obnoxious, loud, and totally irrelevant to say. (Why the hell he was invited on the trip is a mystery.)

This is a powerful story told in the spirit of Richard Feynman's life, which was also spontaneous and full of meaning. The tuvan throat singing is simply amazing; I still have no idea how they do it. Paul's live performance in the concert is astounding, especially because he winged the whole thing! If you don't appreciate something this good, I don't know what to say.

Rather, it is a very human story of a blind man with a unique talent visiting a very old culture. Some of the scenes are jarring in their discordancy. For example, young Tuvan children, dressed in blue jeans and other Western fashions learning a skill that is perhaps thousands of years old.Music is indeed the universal solvent as this Californian builds relationships with a native Tuvan throatsinger.All in all, it's a pleasant movie that tells the story of a man, an exotic skill and an ancient culture all at once.Jerry"},{"rating":"2","title":"such an interesting story","review":"it's not the greatest documentary from a quality standpoint, but the two main characters are amazing people.

I then pulled it out of a box in storage last year to read to my kids and I was appalled. The story teaches that the only solution to bullying is to beat up the bully.

The horns are phenomenal. When combined with David Clayton Thomas's unique voice, it's nearly unbeatable. Momma Gets High is a soulful, gritty song with very seductive horns and DCT's vocal at it's finest. Cowboys and Indians is a very strong track. It and Momma Gets High are worth the price of the CD. Look to My Heart is a quietly beautiful instrumental that eases into your head and leaves you smiling. High on a Mountain is a smooth track that lazily draws you in as DCT sings the story. Lisa, Listen to Me is a little weaker but a nice track with lyrics that all women will appreciate. John the Baptist has sharp lyrics and DCT's voice makes the song. Go Down Gamblin' is a bit of a let down but only because the other songs are so good. For My Lady is a beautiful song and a joy to listen to. Valentine's Day is also a pleasure.

I first viewed this movie when I was a youngster of 11 or so. It was a real treat to see it again decades later in HD. The film transfer to Bluray is of very good quality; colors and detail look great considering its from the film vault dating back 40 years ago. Audio was also surprisingly well done, probably layed back from mag masters. Bluray box says DTS audio, but its sounds like native stereo; still very good. If you liked this movie and want to see it in 1080p HD this is worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grand Daddy of Disaster Movies","review":"Yes, it's campy. But hey, It's it's a Movie. I saw this movie in the theatre about 15 times, (that's before Home video ever came into view). This movie is fun. It even inspired me to go into aviation. Even though I was only 5 years old when I saw it at the movies, I still remember the applause when Joe Patroni got that plane out of the snow. This is a bonafide classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Granddaddy of Disasters","review":"Inspired by Arthur Hailey's bestseller, \\"Airport\\" delivers a fair share of drama, thrills, and humor. Considering it's age, it is rather tame by today's standards. Standing out among the cast is Helen Hayes as the impish stowaway and Maureen Stapleton as the desparate woman trying to stop her psychotic husband. Both were nominated for supporting actress Oscars, with Hayes winning. Also great are Dean Martin as the womanizing pilot, Jacqueline Bisset as the beautiful stewardess, and George Kennedy as the tough-talking maintenance chief. With it's well drawn characters and multiple plotlines, this old-fashioned thriller is sure to entertain all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the book!","review":"This movie is one of the most star-studded, fantastic movies ever! This movie has been one of my favorites for years. And it is just as good as the book! But I suggest you read the book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Airport","review":"I love the 1970 movie Airport- it is my favorite. Yes, the film may move along slowly without much action, yes, it may have a soap opera feel to it, yes the costumes and hair designing may be thirty years old, but it still is a classic in the disaster films area. I recommend it for anyone that is interested in aviation. The technical details are excellent as well, except that the in-flight scenes are shot using a toy model Boeing 707, but it's not too bad. Helen Hayes, playing her role as Mrs. Ada Quonsett, the stoaway, is excellent and very convincing. Alfred Newman's theme music gives it a good touch as well. Also, I recommend Arthur Hailey's novel from 1968, Airport, from which the movie is based on. The book was recently re-printed in August 2000, so it should be easy to find a copy, or to order it right here on amazon.com. Thanks for reading my review, and enjoy the movie and book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid HD Transfer, No Extras in Universal's Blu-Ray","review":"Ross Hunter's 1970 box-office smash ignited a whole genre of \\"disaster movies\\" that followed throughout the \`70s, including three sequels of its own. No question the move to high-definition adds to the appeal of this George Seaton-scripted adaptation of Arthur Hailey's bestseller, with the movie's Todd-AO cinematography appearing more detailed and impressive in Universal's solid 1080p AVC encoded transfer - the colors and contrasts are nicely balanced, with good detail and maybe just a hint of filtering that doesn't get in the way of the image. Not much in the way of extras here: just two \\"100 Years of Universal\\" featurettes and the original trailer are on-hand, though the DTS MA 5.1 audio does a capable job rendering Alfred Newman's excellent score."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CLASSIC FILM RUINED ON DVD!!!","review":"This film is a Universal Studio release. Why wasn't the DVD released by Universal instead of the cheezy Goodtimes Video? This film was nominated for 10 Academy Awards including best picture. It is brilliantly produced and directed. The film premiered at Radio City Music Hall in 70MM and 6 track sterophonic sound. Contrary to one of the reveiews here, Goodtimes did not mix the sound in the widescreen version in 3 channel surround. It is a [bad] 2 channel stereo track. This is a disgrace considering how effective a 5.1 Dolby Digital transfer would have been. The great sound effects and Alfred Newman's great score deserves better..

This had to be a money grab & nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best shock jock ever","review":"I did not give this 5 stars because it is just Greaseman stories, not an autobiography of Doug Tracht. Greaseman was so much better than Howard Sterne and the others. He was just as shocking and funny. The big difference was that he was genuinely nice. He clearly meant only to entertain and make people happy. Also, he was an amazing story teller who developed a whole language to get around FCC decency rules. It is so ironic that his career was ruined when a couple of his jokes got too mean-spiritted. I think he was just trying to be funny and edgy and did not realize what he was doing until it was too late. Anyway this short book is very funny and brings back happy memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a Greasman fan, you know....","review":"If you've ever listened to Nino on the radio, then this book (albeit a short book) is for you.

I was intrigued because my mother used to listen to this guy when we were kids in DC. She thought he was hilarious. I don't know, the book kind of sucked. I did some background on him and his website, Greaseman.org. Check it out. He did an appearance in Hagerstown, Maryland recently and three people showed up and he posts pictures of it. His claims on Greaseman.org of having \\"MANY\\" fans may be wildly overstated. I guess \\"many\\" to him means five or six. It seems he was popular for five minutes until Howard Stern came on DC 101 and buried him. I'm sorry but the Greaseman is just pathetic. He should be in that car lot in Hagerstown selling cars, not being paid to sign autographs. He should write a new book called \\"When I was..\\" where he discusses his rise and fall. Now that would be awesome because I can guarantee it would be a fantastic story.

It was the first Twisted Metal game I've play. It's the real thing alright. I will not be a Twisted Metal fan if I haven't play this game first. Like if I got Twisted Metal 3 first I will never be a fan of Twisted Metal. Now I own Twisted Metal 2, 3, 4, Small Brawl, and Black. I'm going to buy Twisted Metal when I go to Gamestop no matter what the price to complete the collection. I'm only 13 and a die hard Twisted Metal. I like #2 better than Black. Cyburbia, Paris, and Hong Kong are the best levels in the game and New York. The controls are easy in the game. The cars will move exactly way that you want them to move unlike Twisted Metal 3, 4, and Small Brawl. If you like Jet Moto games than you should buy Twisted Metal 2 because you can play cars from Twisted Metal 2 on one of the levels from Jet Moto."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest twisted metal game ever!","review":"This is the best twisted metal game ever!

It has new special combo attacks like freezing and slamming. This game unlike twisted metal1, has great advanced attacks (over 20) and excellent special weapons and pick-ups (including tornado spins, bulldozers, richochet bombs, and much more!).This game has some of the best battlegrounds ever! Examples are Heavenly Honk Kong, Icy Antarctica, Nasty New York, and 5 other great levels. You can also play in 3 secret levels in 2-player mode!

The game play is outstanding and it is very engrossing. You can play a level numerous times and have fun every time. The graphics do not, of course, rival TM Black, but the game is still a joy to play. TM Black is more than a bit creepy, more than a bit violent, but TM 2 has just enough blood to keep you coming back without being over the top. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Twisted Metal games","review":"I rented this game because I am a big TM fan. I'll tell ya', this game is pretty old and doesn't have the best graphics, but it's awesome. The levels are cool. My favorite is Holland: Field of Screams. The characters are awesome too. My favorite is Minion. One of the things that I almost immediately noticed about this game was the machine guns. I don't even know why they give you machine guns on TM 3 and 4. They don't do anything. On TM 2 the machine guns actually do some damage and debris flies off other vehicles when they are hit. It would take a week to kill someone with your machine guns on TM 3 and 4. Actually you would be killed in less than a minute if all you use is a machine gun on TM 3 and 4. If you want a good vehicular destruction game, you can buy any TM game, they are all fun, but I recommend TM 2. It will provide hours of fun, especially deathmatch mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"the series ends tragically","review":"After the messy intro, we kick into a long version of the hardhouse diva anthem by DJ Disciple.

Poor sad Lucy being used by in death, she deserved a grander tribute. Just buy Lucy's book and pass on this self serving untalented trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"The perfect book to reference in a term paper","review":"Being a psych major and having an interest in the bonds between women and how important those friendships are in our lives, I hoped this would be a positive book I could share with friends and pass on to future clients. Contrary to one reader, I don't feel Patchett used Lucy's death as an opportunity to cash in. However, despite her best intentions to chronicle the difficulties and tragedies in her best friend's life and evoke in the reader a fondness for Lucy, I found it difficult to feel sorry for her (Lucy) and at times was even annoyed by her neediness. Worse yet, no-one seemed to mind terribly. No doubt Lucy suffered a great deal during her life, but I feel much could have been done to save her had someone had the courage to show the tough love she needed. Even if it was not the author's intent, the book could prove a helpful tool in psychology classes and to psychologists by providing a text-book example of extreme co-dependence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Supreme","review":"Few of us experience relationships as deep, compelling and infinite as Patchett's 20 year friendship with Lucy Grealy. This book is both heart-warming and heart-wrenching. Even knowing it in advance, the end is unbearable. Truth & Beauty speaks from the heart and Patchett proves that, in the end, love is all that remains. A rich read, this is an ode to unconditional love."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to read this novel...","review":"Reading through previous reviews, many people have pointed out: (a) Lucy was a selfish person (b)Ann must have had some problems to put up with it. What these people are missing is that in a true friendship, you have to accept the totality of the other person's character because your love for them necessitates it. This is one of my favorite books because it reminds me of my relationship with my best friend. We both have Lucy and Ann characteristics, and we both lend each other the splendor of our lives when the other needs it. Don't read the book as a moral/ethical novel, but as a window into a beautiful and fruitful friendship. Lucy and Ann may have respectively had a few problems, but who doesn't? It is the way that they connect the moments of life together in their writing that is important here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching Testimony to the Power of Friendship","review":"The writer Anne Patchett was the poet Lucy Grealy's best friend. After Grealy died, Patchet wrote \\"Truth and Beauty\\" as a testiment to their friendship and to Grealy's life-long struggle with her deformity from facial cancer. \\"Truth and Beauty\\" is a fascinating glimpse into the lives of two amazing writers, and an expose of the meaning of true friendship. It is especially interesting to read together with Lucy Grealy's book \\"The Autobiography of a Face.\\" Everyone that I have lent my copies of the book to has agreed that they are the read of a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intense Memoir","review":"Following Lucy and Ann through the course of their lengthy friendship is a true journey, through book deals, surgeries, and addiction. Overall, Patchett offers a first hand view of an intense friendship with a woman who is constantly struggling with her self-worth, whether it be physical appearance or sexual attractiveness. Lucy's endless questioning of herself left me tired and I commend Ann for sticking through it, and being a best friend through the thick and thin.If you have ever thought you had a friendship worth writing about, take a look at this memoir and be dazzled by the love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, talk about selling out your friend!","review":"Can I give this book less than 1 star?

Read it and decide. Lucy and Ann share an intimate friendship, so intimate that I wondered throughout the book whether it had a lesbian content, active or subliminal. Lucy never married and was unusually fond of Ann; a fondness, which, from Ann's descriptions, often had a physical (though not necessarily sexual) expression. True, Lucy has promiscuous sex with men. But what is the reader to make of her affection for Ann--an affection that expressed itself in naked baths, \\"spooning\\" in bed, kissing? . . . Again, it's up to the reader to figure out what's what in this perverse friendship.As many other readers have noted, I couldn't understand what Ann saw in Lucy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lesbian-Like Romance","review":"Ann and Lucy were infatuated with each other. As graduate students at the University of Iowa, they lived together in an intense,passionate relationship.

Why did Lucy never marry? Why did Ann end her marriage after a few years of trying it out? Why did they never quite lose their sense of intimacy?Ann doesn't answer many of these questions---or glosses over them as if they would not even occur to the reader. At first I thought she was just a novelist trying to write in an unfamiliar medium. Then I wondered if she had something to hide. I still don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexual Confusion","review":"Lucy and Ann are the best of friends. They even share a twin bed together. Ann gazes at Lucy during long, leisurely, naked baths. Ann does Lucy's bidding, whatever the personal or financial cost. I was shocked by Lucy's demands--and more shocked by Ann's willingness to comply, like a leashed dog.I kept expecting Ann to go down on Lucy, what with all the kissing, sleeping together, and long, hard stares.

I never met Lucy (but I saw her at 2 parties--very exciting!). Their friendship was really complex and hard to understand but fascinating to read about and really sheds light on intense female friendships. It did make me feel like I could either be a Lucy or an Ann and was most likely an Ann--but that wasn't so bad. I think a lot of the reviewers are disturbed by the negative feelings they have for Lucy in the course of the book. Ann was disturbed by those feelings too and deals with them. I also believe--to my delight--that Ann Patchett is really a humble person. I wish she had been more in the book (she gave about 1 paragraph to her own success).

Lucy's neediness was bigger than anything that Ann could ever fill, as hard as she might try. I am so grateful to Ann for writing this book; it must have been so hard.

I appreciated the author's honesty and could identify with the emotions expressed. A personal pull toward home, toward God, is experienced by most of us. Reading this book has given me greater understanding of myself and greater compassion for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"tale within a tale","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated fairy tale with a moral: He who returns evil for good will be punished. A poor fisherman casts his net and frees an evil genie, who threatens to kill him for his trouble. The fisherman tells a story within a story to try and convince the genie that murder would be a mistake. This is a classic Arabian Nights approach, very satisfying. The story within a story within a story structure may be somewhat complex for children reading to themselves, but the use of different type faces for each story makes them easier to track. The illustrations are dramatic and colorful. Several deaths occur in the course of this tale (and not only bad guys die), so it may be too scary or upsetting for bedtime reading for the youngest listeners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad !!","review":"The one star is for the lead-off track; all the rest get zero. This is truly the nadir of Kansas' career. While albums six, seven and eight are not in the same league composition-wise with The First Five, they certainly can be critiqued on their own merits and stand up quite well against other albums of the same time-frame. This abomination, however, not only fails by that criteria, but disgraces the overall legacy of the band as well. I recently purchased all the 2001 & 2004 remasters as I only had one, and in the course of listening to the whole catalogue in order from the first, imagine my stunned surpise when I got to this. Naturally a band evolves and changes over time if they have a career that spans more than a couple years, and John Elefante's writing on the prior record was quite good.Those tunes grow on me the more I listen to it. But what happened here?A real stinker by the standards of any band, much less one of the calibre of Kansas. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"For diehard fans only","review":"Slapped together while the band was breaking up, DRASTIC MEASURES pretty much deserves the scorn it gets from Kansas fans and the utter lack of attention from everyone else. John Elefante has said that the album was pretty much an Elefante Brothers album with the Kansas name on it, as they were the only ones working on it full time, and for the most part it really doesn't fit in with the classic Kansas sound.Having said all that, there's no doubt that the album's hit single \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" deserves its place on THE BEST OF KANSAS, although it seems oddly out of place here, and the band performs this song to this day in their live shows. I've given DRASTIC MEASURES a number of chances but still find almost all of it very forgettable with the exception of \\"Andi,\\" a terrific John Elefante pop song that suffers only from not sounding anything like Kansas (except for Rich Williams' power chords).Recommended only for Kansas fanatics and the musically curious."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRY SPELL FOR KANSAS","review":"KANSAS' DRASTIC MEASURES is a prime example of style over substance. While technically proficient, the songs for the most part are curiously empty and easy to forget. MEASURES also doesn't really seem like Kansas. Branching out is not unusual or detrimental but losing your core identity can be risky.New frontman John Elefante obviously dominates MEASURES, both as lead vocalist and composer. Although Kansas vet Kerry Livgren shows up, none of his earlier influence is evident. FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE is the best song and a passionate reminder of how good Kansas could be. ANDI is a pleasant change of pace but ultimately nothing special. The remaining tracks seem like fillers on albums by Journey or Foreigner.DRASTIC MEASURES won't stand as a crowning moment for Kansas, but it shouldn't diminish their status as a great force in progressive rock history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing Rubbish!!!","review":"From beginning to end this album is far and beyond a work of John Elefante. John has an amazing voice and even displays some great chops but his song writing which dominates this slab of garbage does not deliver any nuance of what Kansas once was prior to this release or what they were after for that matter. Vinyl Confessions was brilliant prior to this album, a true work of art and seemingly full band effort. This album contains ZERO violin..not even sure if Robby is listed in the credits. If he is, I am sure he was not happy about it. Even the song Fire With Fire in this age sounds over produced and very outdated. The only shining moment on the record is the moment before it starts and the moment just after it ends...oh yes...and the cover is actually amusing. Kansas did much better before AND after this project."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the illegal use of Kansas band name","review":"I think this album has nothing common with the music performed by this band until 1982. It's obviously that Robin Steinhardt's disbanding made a influence on the music, and at this album the band's decay is seen.

Another great track is the country and westernish \\"Ain't Nothing to Me\\": Like most great C&W; tunes, it's all in the lyrics. And I don't want to leave out mention of the two covers of Rolling Stone songs, \\"Let It Bleed\\" and \\"Silver Train.\\" Although it appears on the Stones' \\"Goats Head Soup\\" album, \\"Silver Train\\" was actually written by Jagger and Richards specifically for Johnny Winter.There isn't a weak song on the album and, with the CD, you get two excellent bonus tracks that weren't on the original LP: \\"Lucille\\" and a raunchy version of Bob Dylan's \\"From a Buick Six.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"johnny winter fan since early 70's","review":"still alive and well is awsum, listen to his alblum john dawson winter III,u will agree, this is his best ever. i have the orig,lp/never opened."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS GUY KNEW HOW TO ROCK THE HOUSE","review":"I HAVE LOVED JOHNNY WINTER FOR AS LONG AS HE'S BEEN AROUND.

I, too, saw Winters And on tour in, I believe, 1970, and was floored when Johnny cooked on the guitar and absolutely astonished to find out that his side-man was no other than the boy from the McCoys, Rick Derringer. He had most definately been practicing since \\"Sloopy\\". As for Derringers' songs, Hootchie-Koo, Still Alive and Cheap Tequilla, I love em all and especially when played by Johnny and And. As for the length of the album, 12 songs seems fair and is, in fact, 2 songs more than the original album on vinyl. I still remember playing this one for the first time some 35 years ago. That, to me, says a whole lot about this album and, as a matter of fact, I'm buying a new one today from Amazon to replace my most recent worn-out cd copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only buy one of Johnny Winters CD this is the one to get","review":"A great collection of clean crisp Johnny Winters slide guitar work at the top of his game.If your looking to add Winters to your collection this in my opinion is the one to get.

I have read, and re-read Hughe's stunning descriptions of the heaving South Pacific, and have panted at the prospect of standing at the helm of a transport ship navigating the treacherous \\"malachite\\" waters, or negotiating the jagged and jutting rocks along the coast of Van Diemen's land.

Metallica doesn't know what they lost when they fired David. True he was going through alcohol problems but they should have temporarily put him on the bench until he could control the drinking problem. Enough with that, this cd kicks ... The guitars never let up on any of the songs, the drums are heavy, and the bass is possible one of the heaviest I have ever heard. Every song on these two cd's rock and I would recommend this cd to any person wether or not they are Megadeth fans. If they enjoy good rock music, then they should enjoy this band.

Dave's voice is far too strained and inconsistent live to do any justice to the material on the albums they've recorded and the constant use of \\"autotune\\" (a digital pitch correcting process) makes Dave's voice very plastic like and quite frankly unenjoyable.

Indeed, smooth downtempo electronic beats merge with carribean vocal work and horns in a most enjoyable way.

Telesco's own concoctons. I was expecting more recipes for traditional drinks such as ale, mead, wine, etc... but, the recipes that they did give contained very brief,simplistic brewing instructions that had me a bit worried.

The Escort service owner peddled his wife, unbeknownst to the old man until after Christmas. The couple seemed to fall for each other but in the end she told the old man that she was married to the man who arranged the whole thing stating they needed the money (500.00). Unbelievable!

The Beta book has several noticeable errors and the editing was a rush job. Some of the examples resemble the on-line help and may be screen shots from the on-line help. The on-line help has improved tremendously since the Beta. The 2nd edition has corrected most of those errors and the editor has done a higher quality job. The chapters on disconnected databases (Chapters 9 thru 12) and XML (Chapter 22) are very good for understanding some of the new features of ADO.Net.

The two CD's also showcase Copland in his many moods, sometimes light hearted and fun as in the Scherzo Humoristique and the second movement of the Piano Sonata, or sometimes nostalgic as in Down a Country Lane or the third movement of the Piano Sonata.

Those who say they can still hear their music when the mic is on don't have the volume dial turned up enough for the mic.The problems I have with it are minor. For one, the cable going to the headphones from the control needs to be longer than the cable going from the control to the stereo. You cannot put the controller in your pocket when connecting to the really short cable on the 530's without putting in an extension cable. Otherwise it pulls too much. Problem #2 is the clip on the back SUCKS. it's removeable which is nice, however it does not clip - it just slides off of everything. There is no pressure on the clip.

Sorry, but computerized ghosts are just not very frightening. Yes there are some extremely hot (but totally and completely clothed all of the time) Thai women, and there are a couple of gory scenes, but this is does not to Thai horror justice. There are much better movies to see. The Victim is just cashing in on the success of its older, bigger and better siblings - The Eye, Shutter, and soon-to-be-released Alone.

You can see it by look into a technical details: of course the NTCS are 720x480@29.97Fps as always, but bitrate is only 3500Kbit/sec - it's only a half of regular DVD bitrate! So this is why you can see compression's consequences sometimes. But the picture is dark almost everywhere so this is good - such bitrate can handle it (picture).What about perfomances? Not too much to say, just yeah, they are great as always. And they are rare (not everyday you can see Sascha's playing guitar)!Overall: a must have for every KMFDM's fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best KMFDM video footage & videos to date","review":"This is the best KMFDM related video footage your gonna find right now (that's not a bootleg anyway).

Even though this book is printed on every other page (with \\"insights\\" on the even-numbered pages), it takes too long to make its points. There were several interesting concepts in the book, but not enough to justify more than 20 pages or so. Additionally, de Bono oversimplifies (something he cautions us against) by making blanket statements that reveal his lack of understanding regarding industry practices he is critiquing. de Bono himself has developed brilliant theories that have been widely applied around the world, but this book isn't the best source for discovering those ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I expected","review":"I collect Bob Dylan covers, and bought this disc for the cover of GOTTA SERVE SOMEBODY. The Dylan cover was great, much better than I expected. A lot of covers use little or no imagination. Often I skip over the rest of the songs on an album after 30 seconds a track.

Until that happens \\"25 X 5\\" is a great condensed version. The numerous clips of the band in newsreels, on Ed Sullivan's show, on pop music shows of old, at press conferences, and much more are treasures. I enjoyed listening to Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, and Mick Taylor giving their perspectives instead of the usual Jagger and Richards. The performance clips that capture the band at various stages over the years are equally entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill is real, funny, tough, sensitive - a man!","review":"I helped edit this book - reading each story, then thinking about what it meant - or DIDN'T mean was great fun and very insightful. Bill has patience, intelligence, wit, and when you see his eyes twinkle as he reads a story out loud (the way he means it to be done), you understand that sometimes he's pulling your leg and you have to laugh out loud with him at the humor in the situation. I love every story and give the book to men friends who don't usually read this type of book. Bill is a \\"man's man\\" who can pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"Yeah it's only $150, but that's because it's no good. For starters, the batteries died all the time. I had to recharge over and over again. Second, it took forever to take a picture and then reload to take another one.

But how delightful that Capitol Records has culled from their extensive catalog some of the very best examples of Irving Berlin material recorded by some of their classic vocal artists, most notably the great Judy Garland. This album is worth the price of purchase just for Judy's rendition of \\"Puttin' on the Ritz\\" alone.If you're a fan of Judy Garland or of Irving Berlin, be sure to check this album out.... and add it to your collection! You won't be disappointed, since at this price, it's a REAL steal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inherently Dangerous Design","review":"1) The factory-fabricated and -assembled parts were shoddy at best. After as much tweaking as I could manage, when fully assembled, the stroller still leaned to the right, which subsequently resulted in a strong \\"pull\\" to the right.2) Here's the dangerous part. If traversing uneven pavement, or if the operator leans too heavily on either the left or right side of the handlebars, the brakes will inadvertently engage on that side. Instant stop, instant yank left or right, and highly possible stroller tipping.We used the stroller for about 20 minutes before taking it apart and having it shipped back to Amazon.Have now happily purchased a Bob Revolution. More money?? Yes. But an incomparably better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a jogging stroller.","review":"I bought this stroller so my kids could take the baby outside and to walk down to the neighbors and it wouldn't mess up my Graco stroller. It is a good stroller for the park and walking up and down the road. The only bad thing is it leans to the left a little bit but other than that it is a nice stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have muscles?","review":"I bought this stroller so I could go for walks in the park and the stroller I purchased also had the feature \\"music on the move\\" which is the built in CD player. That feature was nice, but the stroller itself weighed a ton and putting it in my trunk was a task. This stroller is definitely for individuals with an SUV. Plus, the air pump they give you for the tires doesn't work at all. I was stuck going to my locate gas station to air up my tires. Honestly, I started off with the Graco Metrolite and I should have stuck with it. Anyone want to buy a HEAVY awkward stroller?(smile)"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DANGEROUS!!!","review":"I had the previous colors of this stroller. This stroller looks good, easy to push and has a lot of neat features. It all seems good but the stroller always leans if you are on the slightest incline or smallest bump. I would never let my other children push this stroller and always told them not to lean on it with the fear that it might tip over with my baby in it. One day at the mall my 5 year old barely leaned on it and just as I was afraid of, the entire stroller tipped over sideways! It was a good thing I had her strapped in and laying back otherwise she would have smashed her face on a nearby bench. There is NO padding inside so when she fell over, her head fell right onto the bar on the inside of the seating area and had a huge lump for days. I left the mall immediately, went strait to Babies R Us and returned this stroller!! I ended up spending much more on a Peg Perego P3 that my 5 year can even stand on the back so I know it is not going to tip over and I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"I do not like this stroller and would return it if it wasn't a gift and I tossed out the box...I am anticipating a recall on it anyday. I have only been using it for a couple of months and I am ready to dump it. First of all the seat has little to no padding, so I bought a padded insert that really doesn't fit well but doesn't leave a red mark on the back of my son's head anymore. The seat is elevated by pulling on a string, yes a string...Talk about cheap. Second the brake keeps falling down and stopping the Stroller, I have to kick it up every few steps. And this is one heavy stroller. STEER CLEAR OF THIS ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlocked wheel can cause a tip over.","review":"We purchased this stroller because we have a home in the mountains and like to do a lot of hiking and walking. My husband thought the swivel wheel would give us better control. He tried every which way to upset the stroller in the store, but never unlocked the front wheel. First time out of the box we took our four month old for a nice walk, everything was fine until we returned back home and our older daughter leaned onto the front of the stroller and both her and the baby tipped over into the bushes.(the front swivel was unlocked.) The baby was fine thanks to the five point harness, but we were disappointed and frightened that the stroller tipped over. Please becareful if you have older children. We have returned the stroller and are looking for a better alternative with more stability."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this stroller!","review":"We have the limited one with the music on the go added, but otherwise it is the same. It is a little bulky, so you need a big trunk to carry it in. It steers like a dream. Will actually do a 360 in one spot! We have taken it riding on the sand and on gravel and my daughter barely feels a bump. We used this from the time she was 3 weeks old and I know it will last her until she's done with strollers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"The Back support on the stroller from the front looks nice and comfy for baby but beware the back of the seats material is thin and the card board backing inside the seat split through the cover and now there is no back to the seat! I spent alot of money for this stroller and got to use it twice! Since I have had this problem I have found 4 other people who have shared the same problem and only with this model. I tried going to JeepBaby.com for assistance and their email address is not a known domain and the number they have down doesnt work. Becareful!! Luckily my 10 month old daughter wasent in the seat when it gave in.

The brake keeps falling down and stopping the Stroller. We tried to take it back to the Babies R Us store, but since it was bought online and they dont carry that model, they couldn't help us. They said they couldn't order the part it needed nor could they order one to replace the entire stroller. So we are stuck trying to get this thing fixed via email. This has been very time consuming and irratating. And we still haven't a reponse from Babies R Us online."},{"rating":"1","title":"It flipped over with my baby in it!","review":"I initially loved the Jeep 3-wheel stroller-until it tipped over with my baby in it! The first time I was at the mall paying for my items and my son leaned on the front foot rest and the stroller fell sideways and my baby's head skidded on the floor (she was buckled in). About a week later I was walking down a slanted driveway and I had to catch it before it completely tipped over again! I am returning the stroller, and have contacted the manufacturer so the issue can be corrected immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Safe! Do Not Buy!","review":"I put this on my registry after reading reveiws online. I found out too late that the reviews here refer to a completely different model. This is a basic stroller, there is no padding in the seat, there is no place to plug anything in, there are no toys included...just a plain Jane model. They tray in front does not stay latched at all. My son too fell prey to the shoestrings used to secure the back of the seat. When you put your child in the seat, the weight of the baby on the shoestrings pulls them tight-and you might as well be rubbing a curtain rod against his head. My son ended up at the emergency room...AND BOY DO THE DOCTORS LOOK CLOSELY AT YOU WHEN YOUR CHILD HAS A HEAD INJURY! I had to send my husband home to get the stroller to prove how he hurt his head. The lump stayed on his head for over two weeks. He cried out of pain for a few days. No donating this one...it went straight to the dump. My strong advice....DON'T BUY THIS FOR YOURSELF OR ANYONE ELSE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Safe","review":"This is not the model with the attatched steering wheel and a place to plug in your mp3. This is the base edition. All I can say is it is not safe. I put my 5 monthold son in it and he fell alseep. As with most babies, his head leaned to the side. After only going to my mailbox and back, I noticed a huge egg on the side of my sons head. It was from the stroller. There are laces on either side that you use to adjust the height of the back of the seat. My sons head was rubbing against this string. There is no padding around the string, only covered in the nylon. Maybe it might work for a child who holds themselves upright constantly and doesn't fall asleep, but I truthfully wouldn't recommend this product to anyone! Who wants to see thier child get hurt?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Shopping-Very Dangerous!","review":"I purchased this stroller because my son is 2 years old and wanted an all-purpose stroller. At first I loved it,then my son began to get his fingers stuck in the harness/buckle strap. My son was also able to turn him self around in the stroller because the tray is so far away from his body. Then one day as I was traveling down the sidewalk on the down ramp the stroller tipped on its side, I was able to catch it. The last and final accident was when my son got his fingers stuck in the harness/ buckle again, so I unstrapped him and he turned around in stroller and leaned on the backrest and the stroller flipped over, whe had a trip to the ER, with a serious lump and two black eyes, and a CAT Scan. Since purchased the Graco Quattro Tour, a nice heavy duty safe stroller, with safe straps and harness, does not tip and my son can't turn around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Becareful!!!!","review":"I got this stroller for my shower... my daughter is now 2 months.. i wanted it because i love to go for walks... well, the left shock sinks down and pulls to the left... and the worst part is, it's so Heavy!!!

My son is big(37#) but under the 40# wt. limit. When he was in the stroller the brake bar pushed down on the wheels, making it difficult to steer and turn the stroller. Then this afternoon the front wheel locked up and it catapulted the stroller forward while my son was in it! It is just not very sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this stroller","review":"This stroller tips over constantly. when my daughter leans forward it tips, when you try to cross the street the wheels get stuck in the gutter and over it goes!

The photo is a hot pink case which appears to be a decent quality. This pale pink peice of junk they sent wasn't anything like the photo. If the case is any indication, I'm not even going to try that car charger.

The speakers hum noisily when the unit is plugged in. The unit also picked up a radio station even though no radio was built in. The unit uses loose USB wire and speaker wires to conect to the Motorola Q. This is unattractive and cumbersome when wanting to use the unit. The worst part was that when everything was connected and I played music the unit hummed so loudly that I could barely understand the music. The seller refunded my money but I was stuck with hefty shipping charges. If the bugs were worked out this may be a good buy. For now I suggest not buying this.

By the time of this album's release in 1975 (on Alegre Records) Charlie Palmieri had long been recognized by most of his peers as a \\"musician's musician\\" and most of the tracks on this CD amply prove why this was so.

How refreshing to read this tongue-in-cheek yet quite serious parody of a parenting book. When pregnant with my first child I read reams of parenting books until I realized that there is something out there to validate whatever your parenting style happens to be.The Three Martini Playdate offers a delightful, 50's retro-styled tome with advice as wacky as how to teach your 5-year-old to mix his first martini, to some as wise and practical as how to avoid going insane listening to insipid \\"children's music\\". The sweetly condescending eastern-standard tone of the book, coupled with Dick-and-Jane style drawings add to the book's charm. The chapter on child-proofing is especially hilarious. This book would make a wonderful gift for many modern mothers, but might be taken the wrong way (or frighten) brand-new or expecting parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Fabulous!","review":"This book gives modern parenting (if you can even call it that) a kick in the rear!It addresses the ridiculous things that parents these days do and don't do ... like say NO to their children!The ideas are presented in short, easy to read chapters.

While there are a handful of funny lines scattered throughout the volume, it lacks the heart, warmth, and empathy of Vicki Iovine's wonderful series \\"the Girlfriend's Guides.\\" Where Iovine makes hilarious fun of the many ways we all make child-rearing mistakes, Mellor plays a one-note tune about making sure your kids know who's boss. Mellor provides us with a paean to discipline (put the kids to bed on time, don't buy too many toys, don't let them decide how many cookies, etc.) and her images of adult life seem to come straight out of the 1950s (grownups drinking cocktails; dads work and don't pitch in on child care).This book provides neither insightful childrearing advice nor humorous tales of parental life. I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"parenting advice with a twist of sadistic humor","review":"After reading part of this book, I put it down. Frankly, the author takes things a bit too far. As a loving parent (who by the way enjoys a great life of my own as well) I can't stomach such advice as cooking meal after meal of strikingly unpalatable food, \\"until their tummies rumble\\"...and they'll eat just about anything...or centering a child's first birthday party around adult drinking.

Mellor comically enshrines alcohol consumption as the ultimate adult pleasure. But she ignores the unfunny, dangerous and skyrocketing issue of binge drinking among teenagers, which this book could inadvertently reinforce. I realize Mellor's intent is not serious, but it underscores the wrong values. This book would never sell if it were called, \\"The Three-Marlboro Playdate\\" and emphasized the joys of parents smoking cigarettes together while their well-bred children provided ashtrays, dumped the butts, and then ran along to play among themselves.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely a five-olive read!","review":"i read this during my son's naptime as my four-year-old was insisting I help dress her Polly Pockets...and laughed so hard i nearly wet my pants!

The people in the photos are too far away to hit each other with the strikes they use. They block and punch with their other hand at their hip, leaving themselves open to attack. The stances limit mobility and the joint locks can be too complicated to use in a fight. The only thing that I think is useful is the eagle claw, which is used to grab pressure points and choke. I think it shows good hand strengthening exercises and has good acrobatics, if you're interested in fancy flying kicks. The book is probably not worth your money. The only practical styles of kung fu I know of are wing chun and san soo.

The original film was 78 minutes. In addition, advance reviews (at blu-ray.com) say that the print is the same poor quality scratched-up one that they used on the DVD edition.Currently, the best available prints of this film are the full-length versions issued on DVD by Image or by Front Row.

Legend Films has a patented process that makes colorization look much better and more natural than others. As mentioned by other reviewers, this is a heavily edited version of the film with 18 crucial minutes deleted. It would be more aptly titled \\"HIGHLIGHTS FROM A CHRISTMAS CAROL\\". The biggest disappointment is the picture quality. One feels like they're watching through a layer of gauze or through a screen door (the picture is VERY fuzzy). There is also a nearly constant \\"flicker\\" to the picture. It is a very poor so-called \\"restoration\\". Legend Films really let me down on this one.

It canno be changed..the period, the style, costumes etc. Aida can be under done or over the top, but never a 19th century piece.The singers try with it, but it is so ludicrous and camp, ( see the openeing scenes with Amneris) and then, finally, distracting; you have to black out the picture and just listen.Rememeber Roger Debris in The Producers, with Zero Mostel. Roger was a director of shows that folded after the first act of the fist rehearsal. The designer of this production and all accomplices should have folded afeter the first note of the first act.And of course this is very camp, but only for a while..it will go down in history as an Aida that only primaytes could lay any claim to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"The soprano is great, but the rest of this performance is laughable.

I recently lost it, so I purchased another one. I love this DVD - it gives you 10 minutes for belly, 10 minutes for butt, and 10 minutes for thighs. It's great for when you only have a little bit of time. You can just do 10 minutes if that's all you have."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, but wish it had an arm segment","review":"I can get a nice workout from this dvd and have a good burn the next day.

I tend not to grab it as much as other exercise dvds that include arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intermediate toning workout","review":"I really like this dvd. I actually like all the Prevention series that I've seen so far. In this workout they use proven exercises for maximum effectiveness. Chris Freytag is the instructor again and she cues well and is very down to earth making the whole programme enjoyable and not overly intimidating if you are new to working out. She will definately keep you motivated. There is your usuall pilates type moves, crunches, squats and lunges to name a few, but these same exercises are around because they are definately effective. Trust me, you will feel good after this. Anyone will get a good workout from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belly, Butt and Thighs","review":"I really like this video.

I am not easily annoyed, and was surprised by my dislike of this dvd... I am definitely selling this one on ebay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Workout","review":"This is my favorite work-out video and the only one that even after 2-3 times, I can tell a difference.

This is a smallish book with lively little drawings. Its not one of those lavishly photographed books which show rooms so breathtaking you can barely relate to them. What it does do is provide elegant tasteful ideas which work no matter what your budget is. Some ideas were meant to stimulate your imagination while others were clear cut, direct answers to your problem. If anyone has ever stood in the paint store looking at a jillion shades of white paint and not being able to decide, what a comfort it is to have a book which says, if you want to achieve XXX look, then buy this brand of paint in these exact shades and they'll look great. There's no fluff in this super little book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Natalie Goldberg meets interior design...","review":"Dylan Landis throws you bite size chunks of inspiration instead of a visual slop bucket of inflexible pictures & difficult to emulate styles. This is the perfect book for the right brain decorator who is into \\"imagination\\" verses visual stimulus. In its visual favor, however, are the elegent garden-style sketch illustrations & a creative use of font. We all like the picture books because they're colorful and we FEEL inspired, but most often it's pithy text that gets the juices really flowing. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A slim book with a mishmash of ideas&#65533;and no photos","review":"A decorating book without photos is like trying to get the flavor of foods only by reading a menu.

It includes great tidbits of information that can tranform your rooms into decorator show places. I particularly appreciated the chapter on paint colors. The author gives tried and true recommendations that you can take to the paint store. I've had great success using the paint suggestions in 4 rooms so far. It really takes the guesswork out of trying to find the right color of warm yellow for your living room. This chapter alone is worth the cost of the book!A quick and enjoyable read that stimulates your decorating imagination. One resource at the end of the book that I would not recommend is the stencil catalog by V. and Olga Decorating. I sent away for it (which cost $8 instead of the $5, mentioned in the book) and it was a real disappointment. For $8, I expected a professional catalog and a credit voucher for my first purchase. I received neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the Simple to the Silly","review":"This book is a list of bullet points with specific decorating ideas from the simple (weave artificial ivy through the security bars on your windows) to the impractical (have your lampshades custom lined with gold or pink silk for a flattering light). If some of the ideas appeal to you, you may find the book worthwhile. If not, you won't find any general decorating theories to help you design own space. (And by the way -- if you can afford custom-lined lampshades, skip the book and hire a decorator.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better decorating books out there","review":"If you want pithy text that inspires and educates, as well as gorgeous photographs, there are better books on the market -- books that do both jobs beautifully. I like The New Decorating Book by Better Homes and Gardens, as well as Terence Conran's Essential House Book much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"For an introduction to Media politics Graber provides the perfect setting.

But I like 'Rembrandt Pussyhorse' as well. But back to 'piouhgd', tracks 2, 3, 5, & 6 make it worth it on it's own. 'Revolution pt. II' is full of, I think fellow Texan names, 'Lonesome Bulldog' has the hilarious Kennedy tie-in, and 'The Hurdy Gurdy Man' cover is well done. I think 'Golden Showers' is a terrific track.

It gave me an insight to Charles Dickens that I had not had before. It would be best not to sit down to \\"read\\" the book in one setting. Really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tender treasure","review":"This slight book is Charles Dickens' written interpretation of the Gospels, a gift meant for his children. It was only to be published after his death. In the retelling of Christ's life Dickens gives his children the most precious gift...his testimony. This is a treasure of a book, a witness to the beliefs Dickens held dear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life of Our Lord","review":"Excellent to share with children in your family if you are interested in having your children gain an easy to understand overview of Jesus Christ's life.

You can just read the Bible but the idea that he rewrote the account of Christ for his children. Cool that we can read it but almost sad something meant to be private for his children is now for everyone. I hope it is appreciated. We got this book from a song Come thou Font of Every Blessing. In it there is a line of here I raise my Ebeneezer. We wondered what that meant. We found it meant stone of help - from the Bible. Which led us to wonder if Charles Dickens was a religious man and named Ebeneezer Scrooge with a purpose. This book deffinately indicates he was religious, further study shows many names had meanings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"The pictures are beautiful and fit with the content that Charles Dickens has written about Jesus Christ. I love that he shares his personal feelings about someone that so many have forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull affair","review":"This isn't really a very good recording. Levine's treatment of the music is episodic and, at times, rather lifeless, and he fails to portray both the turmoil on the physical and psychological level.Morris's voice is drier than usual and his Dutchman cannot be said to be one of his best achievements. Voigt sings beautifully but sounds underpowered as Senta. Above all, she completely misses the passion of the character. Heppner's Eric, by contrast, is one of the best on record.As there are better recorded versions around, this set is by no means an essential buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragging Dutchman","review":"This Dutchman set is only flawed through Levine's tempi, which are a tad slow. Although the overture is grand and the best I have ever heard, his rendition of the spinning chorus and ballad are too slow. After seeing Voigt in Paris in June, she has to be the best Senta I have ever heard and this recording does not do her voice true justice. Heppner is amazing in his delivery and not strained like many tenors. Morris is fantastic! Groves is also great. The men of the chorus fare better than the ladies who sound like old women. If only Levine had been a tad faster in some places..."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is unbelievably bad","review":"From the opening bars you can tell (IF you have a knowledge of Wagner and this opera) that this recording is going nowhere. Absolutely no tension or suspense whatsoever, two elements required here. And even worse this set has a bigger fault of a Dutchman with no strength or personality whatsoever as well as his dry voice and swooping and scooping into notes. Morris can't sing and Levine was the worst conductor in the Met's history. This set should be avoided. Great recordings are under the batons of Krauss, Knappertsbush, & Keilberth. None others need apply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Levine's sinking Dutchman...","review":"This recording is a major disappointment. The singers are so wonderfully cast that I would have loved to see what they could have done with a reading of the score that wasn't so sluggish. And I know, I know. That's what EVERYONE has been saying about Levine in this recording. But I still gave it a listen hoping that maybe these reviewers were exaggerating, or nitpicking. Unfortunately they were absolutely correct. Under Levine any momentum the orchestra and the singers build just...DIES. I found my mind wandering waiting for passages to start, waiting for a singer to spit out their lines already. It's just a complete drag.I don't want to be completely unfair. The sound is clear, the orchestra has power, the leads can definitely sing. In the end however, this doesn't even crack the top 5 Dutchman stereo recordings: the Dohnányi, Klemperer, Doráti, Solti and Sinopoli sets are all superior. At least check out a few of those recordings before settling on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Orchestra is fine, but . . .","review":"The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra gives out a spectacular performance, creating enormous power and precision. And that's probably the only thing that's good about this Flying Dutchman. James Levine's tempi are dragged (most notably the \\"Overture\\" and the \\"Spinning Chorus\\"), making this the least Wagnerian of all studio recordings. The choir is surprisingly unpleasant: their diction isn't good enough and their pitch isn't completely correct. The vocal soloists . . . well, let's just say that even Daniel Barenboim's choice of casting is better than this. As for the sound quality, it's just plain awful: The volume is a bit weak and the bass sound is heard incorrectly.All in all, if you want to get this ONLY for the orchestral sound, then do it. Otherwise, go for the Solti, Sinopoli, or Klemperer recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good pep talk","review":"Another great book from the Love and Logic people. Much of this book is about identifying how poor parenting and our self absorbed culture can mix to create kids with a sense of entitlement that can eat a child alive. I felt that this was largely a rehash of previous love and logic books, yet directed on one particular area where good parenting can make a huge difference. If parents could see this entitlement tragedy coming, they may be able to work against it. I love the scripted responses to typical kid attacks. Sometimes I need someone to tell me what to say and to remain calm. It's not easy. All my kids are teens now and suffer from different degrees of entitlement. Not too long, full of stories and examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Wife Bess","review":"\\"My Just Desire,\\" a superficial look at the life of an Elizabethan gentlewoman, leaves much to be desired. Peppering her writing with modern phraseology, such as \\"boy toy,\\" author Anna Beer's diminishes both her subject and her readers' interest in it.Better that the fascinating life of Bess Throckmorton, wife to Sir Walter Ralegh, had been treated in a more reverant and scholarly manner.

The game includes lots of affirming questions, providing a great time of intimate sharing, along with cards leading to various sensual touching and strokes.

Unfortunately, he used up most of his best ideas the first time around. Though the title track of \\"Don't Look Back,\\" and perhaps \\"Feelin' Satisfied\\" are up to the first album's standards, the rest suffer from a fatiguing similarity and show that the Boston arena rock formula was already beginning to wear thin. Shultz must have sensed this, because he fired the rest of the band (except for lead singer Brad Delp) and went into seclusion for over seven years before reappearing with his next effort. By then of course, time had passed him and his band by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember....","review":"OK. Raise your hand if you bought this on 8-track when it first came out. Remember how the music faded out near the beginning of \\"It's Easy\\"..... (click,clunk) ....and then faded back in on channel two!I imagine everyone who's wincing from this brutal (and totally uncalled for) lurch back to August, 1978 already has this on CD.So for anyone who's wading into Boston for the first time, let me say: there are no bad songs on this album! It's short (a mere 33:42). It's famous for Tom Scholz declaring that he released it before he was finished (under pressure from Epic Records). But there's nothing lacking about the tunes, the playing or production. It's pure Boston and every bit as great as the first album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"solid second album.","review":"This is Boston's second release. \\"Don't Look Back\\" #1, should of just been on their first album, great songs and great production.

Other great songs include \\"Party\\", the great \\"It's Easy\\", \\"Used To Bad News\\" and a song that doesn't get enough respect \\"Don't Be Afraid\\".

The book comes with an audio CD and that is where the problem lies. The audio on the CD is hard to hear. The Chinese speakers are motoring through the text as though they are on a short lunch break and have to get to somewhere fast. For an English speaker wanting to learn the tonal qualities of each word this was a problem. Most language audio CD's are spoken at a pace which can easily be followed by students adn many have the sentences repeated for your benefit or allow a pause for you to attempt the words yourself....but not here. It sound like you are evesdropping into a telephone conversation between two speed talkers!I honestly wonder if the author has ever listened to the CD! I'm thinking that it was an addition added to the book perhaps by the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am sure that the author was well-intentioned, but according to my Chinese friends who are on the Mainland, there are numerous errors in the cultural information sections. Also, some of the phrases and usages listed in this book are very uncommon, some were described to me as being flat-out incorrect.

This book proves the Bible is like no other book in existence. Dr. Ruckman in his own unique way shows the reliability of the Bible historically and prophetically.

It took Evangelicalism's emphases to embarassing extremes, inviting scorn and criticism on ALL born-again Christians.But Ruckman's King James Only movement took Fundamentalism outside of the Christian Church. Now, independent Baptists are more likely to be raving heretics rather than misguided Christians. Evangelicals no longer need to bear patiently with Fundamentalists. We no longer need to do damage control. Today's Fundamentalists are not orthodox Christians. We're finally free of them.Thank you, Dr. Ruckman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Taste of Heaven on Earth","review":"The Florida Boys, legends in the Southern gospel music field, show why they are the industry's standard-bearers on this album.

First,the usual way served on gourmet crackers. It is especially delightful toasted in the oven with a variety of cheeses on thin cut bread.

Sorry but Artist friends of mine have this book and its only advantage is it's conviently in front of you and not on screen. I recommend not getting it, get a printer and find some tasteful online nude photo sites.

The large print wasn't large at all because the pages are too crowded (4 columns), even though the book is 8.5 x 11. As I flipped through the pages the letters were already fading and the printing (title, etc) on the spine of the book was fading as well. For the price that is being charged I expected excellent typesetting and time withstanding pages and cover. The print doesn't appear to be computer generated. Maybe I am being too harsh, perhaps the publishers intended to preserve a manuscript appearance. It was a turn off for me. However, the information contained therein was substantial and impressive, I just wish they would significantly improve the appearance (including type size and spacing) and the overall quality of the book.

I believe that it's one of those that she wrote for a slightly younger age-group, and so there is not much romance, though there are some weddings, or engagements toward the end. Ruth was raised by her aunt and uncle, because her mother died. She was not told about this and only found out after her adopted parents both died. By that time, her birth father has also passed away, but she has two older brothers, whom she immediately makes plans to visit.

It's very sexy, and great for a romantic evening, or just to relax with. His voice and delivery, is as smooth as the music. \\"Urban Theme\\" is a nice start, with the sound of a vinyl record sampled. \\"Sumthin' Sumthin'\\" is cool, and \\"Reunion\\" is also very pleasing.

(i.e. my boyfriend loves Sade; when he heard me playing this CD, he swore it sounded like some of Sade's stuff. Then I told him that a lot of Sade's band members, like Stuart Matthewman, were on the CD, it made him an automatic fan!) I wound up buying him the CD he liked it so much.

For my 23rd B-Day last year my road dog surprised me with Maxwell concert tickets. She knew how in love I was with him, so for her to purchase that ticket for me it was a dream come true. Through out the whole concert I was dazed. I had never seen an artist perform with such perfection. The music was perfect and so was his hypnotizing voice. I've always dreamed of one day just talking to him to get to know Maxwell the person not the artist. I want to know the person behind this sensual music. Maybe one day I'll get my wish, but until then I'll keep his music close to my ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"My dog chewed up my copy if Urban Hang Suite so I was thrilled to get it again on sale!

Apart from track 4 'Ascension (Don't Ever Wonder)' which was a chart hit here in the UK, none of the songs did anything for me at all. None of them stand out as particularly good songs or held my attention for more than the first 20 seconds. If I were listening to these songs on the radio I'd probably change station pretty sharpish. In my opinion Maxwell is just another 'I'm soo cool' Artist who tries too hard to be original and falls flat on his face. For some truly powerful soul I reccommend Al Green's Albums 'Get's Next to You'(quite funky) and 'Still in Love with you' (more mellow any love stuff)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a CD that I can't live without!!!!!","review":"I fell in love with Maxwell and his his music the second I saw his \\"Till the Cops Come Knocking\\" video.

I almost wish I had read this one first since it covers glamour lighting in great detail, plus a whole lot of other stuff.I just finished reading it today, so it's still sinking in, but if you plan on taking beautiful pictures of women and taking it seriously, you pretty much have to read this book. It's a career's worth of experience in an easy to read book.I've got to say though that some of the 80's style pictures are pretty laughable, especially the 80's sunglasses!

This book has 95% nude women, many with their legs spread open, or breasts and crotch as the focul point.

I called the company and was told that the supplier in Italy produced a bad batch. I am impressed with the company because they are going to replace my order with a new set. If it is in good shape, they will accept the return of the re-glued set. If the problem persists, I will return the second shipment.I will post what I find out once the replacement arrives.

Lindsay, the main character, is struggling to fit in as one of a small number of girls who now attend a school that had previously been for boys only. The trouble is that a number of the boys, especially one named Chas, don't want the girls to be there. Lindsay is also worried about living up to her family's expectation because they're all high achievers. At first, Lindsay tries to outdo Chas, but after one of her stunts goes wrong, she begins to think that maybe she should simply try to maintain a low profile and blend in. There are a lot of feminist themes in the book, but the book is mainly about learning to be yourself, even when others are critical of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something I was waiting for my daughter","review":"This set of four CD's gives the best possible collection of childrens songs.

I have only read one other book besides \\"Pizza Face\\" which was so funny that, in my laugh-convulsions, I dropped the book and nearly rolled off the sofa. This book, of course, was John Kennedy Toole's \\"A Confederacy of Dunces.\\" When I dropped \\"Pizza Face,\\" the corner of the book--I have the dangerous hardcover--hit me in the right eye.

It's an interesting story, but there really is no evidence that radiation exposure caused any of the deaths. There is a far more mundane explaination- the victims were all chain smokers.

If you live anywhere near the area and/or are familiar with the area, it's fun to watch just for the recognition factor. But if you enjoy John Wayne's better acting, this is certainly not the picture for you. It reminds me of Arnold's 'fine acting skills' as portrayed in \\"Conan the Barbarian\\". It's no wonder Howard Hughes kept this film in hiding for so many years.

I thought this was the absolute worst casting job of all time. What's next, Sidney Poitier in the role of Adolf Hitler?I thought it was absolutely laughable when I saw this movie once on a dreary Sunday afternoon on TV.

I couldn't believe my eyes. Since Genghis Khan is my favorite historical personage, I couldn't resist the combination. I have to agree, however, that it was a fairly silly role for Wayne. On the plus side, he actually looked somewhat Mongol. What really didn't fit was Susan Hayward as Bortai, the most obviously white person there. She absolutely did not fit and, I believe, did not even come close to a proper portrayal of Bortai. She was clearly the worst item. It was also bad when the Khan's horsemen attacked the Tartars near the end. There was none of the disciplined army in evidence. They looked like an unruly mob. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for your collection","review":"I have always enjoyed this cd. One of my all time favorites since it's 1996 release. I couldn't find my original copy and was so glad I could easily get it at Amazon as it is hard to find in music stores. This to me is Maxwell's best cd so far, although his talent is immeasurable.

But if you're looking for a book with beautiful photographs of glass beads, you're in the right place. Each page contains photographs of beads by talented glass artisans. What's especially nice about this book is that there are artists represented from many different skill levels. For an intermediate glass artist like me, it's good to see that I've come a long way, but there is still so much territory to explore.

It was the funniest, most honest book about parenting, growing up (or not wanting to), life in general, etc...i've read in a long time, and also very touching.From mosh pits, to bottles, breast pumps, diapers, mini van, and Warped tour and PTA meetings...It's got something for everyone.Jim Lindberg is very good at describing situations, and you can picture him going through all the drama, ups and downs of life and yet feel the inconditional love he has for his family.All the incertainty of being a So-Cal Punk Rock guy, staying true to your beliefs, while raising 3 daughters...it's all in there.I hope he writes another book, i truly enjoyed his writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read for Parents Who are Still Kids at Heart","review":"We picked this book up at Borders when we were looking for other baby books one night. My husband and I both really enjoyed this book. It was a lot of fun to read, we laughed out loud several times while reading this book. Jim Lindberg really helped us to see ourselves as future parents. Maybe being a huge Pennywise fan didn't hurt either, but you don't have to be a punk rocker to enjoy and learn from this book.One of the hardest things for me to figure out during my pregnancy is that I don't have to magically become this perfect Mom person. All I have to do is be myself, that's who my husband wants to be with and who my child should get to know. Becoming a parent doesn't have to change who I am at my core, I just will have a new role as a parent as well. This book prepared me for that role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"For first time author Jim Lindberg this book is a great look at the dynamics between growing up and remaining true to the music he loves."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't feel so alone","review":"A well written book with some insights on being punk rock and trying to raise kids. We were never meant to be authoritarians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim is more sane than his music","review":"Great book! Easy to read and gives a good insight on how to perceive life as a parent. I highly recommend. Jim is more normal than you would think of a singer of a band that happens to be a dad. I think HE doesn't realize he isn't any different than most other dads out there that aren't from a surf punk band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good debut!","review":"The cover blurb by Donna Andrews describes the book as \\"a modern day Nick and Nora Charles,\\" and I'd say she's not far off. The characters are part of the upscale, San Francisco, theatre, cocktail set, but it's the self-deprecating, first person voice that gives the story balance and humor. All of the supporting characters are wonderful, particularly Flank. It's a quick, fun read that is cozy with a bit of romance, but also an entertaining break for those of us who usually prefer something darker. I'll be looking forward to Charley and Jack's next adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be a different Lawrence Block","review":"I am less than 1/2 way through this mess and have been sticking with it waiting for it to actually get better.

It just does not read the same as anything else I've ever read by him and I've read a BUNCH of his books. There are a couple of characters that are engaging, but he does not spend much time with them.

This DVD is a real value compared to some of the other DVD concerts that I have bought in the past. I gave it only four stars as opposed to five simply because of the lack of extra's. Basically the only extra on this is a slide show. I would love to see some things like back stage footage, etc...

It's painful to hear her wobble her way through a shortened soft-soap version of \\"I'll close my eyes\\", and to hear her impaired intonation on the high notes. My advice is, to choose from the many excellent albums out there. \\"Jazz Round Midnight\\" and \\"Dinah Washington Sings Standards\\", both by Verve are good ones, and \\"The Fats Waller Songbook\\" and \\"Dinah!\\", both by EmArcy are top notch. Any of these albums will give you a much better representation of Ms. Washington's incredible versatility, awesome expressive powers, and unmatched ability to seamlessly integrate with an instrumental group of any size or composition."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting look at a life in the political media","review":"Political columnist Jack Germond, best known as a panelist from the political talking-head show McLaughlin Group, here provides a witty and insightful look back at his years as a political reporter. He includes his own humble beginnings at a small Rochester, New York, newspaper, and his various positions at Gannett, the Washington Star, the Baltimore Sun, and his work as a commentator on the McLaughlin Group. Germond has some harsh words for McLaughlin, who he describes as incredibly difficult to work with (that's putting it gently).Germond is clearly someone who loves not only politics, but politicians, and his book is a memoir of a life devoted to politics and writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulls Few Punches","review":"I hated myself for loving this book--perhaps for the same reason that someone might hate one's self for listening to juicy gossip; Germond pulls few punches, goes heavy on the personalities and light on the policies (at least when he takes time to tell the reader why he dislikes Richard Nixon so much). On the other hand, Germond makes it amply clear why he dislikes George Bush--he says Bush had no idea what he wanted to do with the office once he had it; he was the \\"quintessential empty suit.\\" In 12 years, this is the first time I've heard anyone dare to point that out. I was vastly amused by his McLaughlin Group chapter (I wonder what *McLaughlin* thought of it). And Germond's own attitude about the show and his place on it is refreshing. All in all, it's an insightful, valuable and entertaining memoir by one of the most thoughtful, least affected pundits in the arena."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed reading this as much as Jack enjoyed writing it.","review":"The few occasions where I tuned into the McLaughlin Group I found Jack to be \\"odd man out.\\" I found his comments thoughtful and insightful, never loud and boorish. I never could figure out what he was doing on the show; now I see that it was a mistake on his part.This is an enjoyable book, more anecdote than analysis. I'm a political junkie and knew about most of the subjects he covered and it was fun to read his take on them. From reading the book I got the impression that a Journalism 101 student sat with him, turned on a tape recorder, and said: \\"Tell me about your life in journalism, Mr. Germond.\\"It was puzzling at times that he alluded to aspects of his personal life but didn't go into detail (his daughter's death, the breakup of his first marriage, etc.). He certainly doesn't owe anyone and explanation, but I'm not sure I would have mentioned them at all.But the book was well worth the investment and it was a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Alaska Trees & Wildflowers","review":"I purchased this guide and took it with me on a cruise to SE Alaska.

In a way the album is a mixture of the 2 album styles (\\"Since You're Gone\\"/\\"Shake It Up\\"/\\"Victim of Love\\"/\\"Think it Over\\" sounding like they fell off the \\"Heartbeat City\\" album and the rest sounding like they could be leftovers from \\"Panorama\\").A very diverse album all the way with Ocasek's lyrics and Hawkes' keyboards ruling the scene. Ocasek's lyrics have never been better than they are in this album (\\"chicken encounters fill your bowels\\" and \\"is this the kill? is this the thrill? this could be love\\" among many other poetic pieces).My favorites on the album are \\"Cruiser\\" and \\"Think it Over\\". Both songs are negative (ala \\"Panorama\\") in their approach, but say so much about Ocasek.This album is the advanced, techno, new-wave Cars that is so much their trademark - and the essential (but not their best) Cars' album in my book"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most \\"bubble-gummy\\" Cars album","review":"A good disc, and I remember it well as it came out right before I went to Navy boot camp.

It has a clear interpretation of important Perl must-knows, lots of useful examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good source","review":"I liked this book because I had very little background in programming (aside from a semester of C++ a long time ago) and it wasn't too overwhelming. The excercies were great and the programming was explained fairly well.I did a lot of bio-informatic work (lineplots, blasts, etc). The book was great for teaching programming that would be useful for these applications, and not a lot of other miscellaneous programming, that i would never really need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly for the Biologist","review":"People come to Bioinformatics from either the bio side or the CS side, with a few from various other disciplines. This book is best for the bio person who is getting into programming, not the programmer who is getting into bio.For you CS types, I attended a tutorial by Tisdall on this material some years ago. One of the attendees asked why you needed an editor to code in Perl. That is the level that we are dealing with here!It is a crime that biology and biochem students are not taught any perl- this is a very useful tool that will be more important as time goes on.Perhaps someone could write a book on bioinformatics Perl for programmers someday, but that is not the goal of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginning Perl for BioInformatics","review":"Excellent book.

She performed \\"The Ballad Of Cleo And Joe\\" live in a black spandex leotard 7mos. pregnant, dancing, and brought the house down. It's a shame her lack of record label support contributed to her waning popularity in the '90's. This album is a gem with tracks ranging from soulful ballads like \\"Fall Into Your Dreams\\" and \\"Searching\\" to folksy/rock tunes like \\"Hot Gets A little Cold\\" and \\"Unhook The Stars\\". \\"You Don't Know\\" is pure pop at its best, while \\"Mother\\"'s haunting vocals represent just one more example of Lauper's diversity and range as a performer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This GRRL Rocks when she has fun!","review":"How amazing is Cyndi Lauper? This album is one of the 1990's must under appreciated albums ever. From the opening track SISITERS OF AVALON's rock tinges to the disco beats in THE BALLAD OF CLEO & JOE and to the stunning HOT GETS A LITTLE COLD - Cyndi Laupetr is a true artist with a silken voice taht can build up in a dance hall beat and reduce you to tears with a ballad the next.I remeber when she was doing press on the album, and she did an acoustic version of the song FEARLESS on Rupaul's VH1 talk show. It was simple, elegant and mesmerizing to sit and hear her voice.She is an artist who has grown tremendously and radio stations need to rediscover this gem of an album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best ever from the best voice in rock","review":"This is a truly amazing and eclectic album. Almost every song sounds completely different, yet Cyndi's vocals are truly unique. \\"You Don't Know\\" should have been a HUGE hit. \\"Unhook the Stars,\\" \\"Fall Into Your Dreams,\\" \\"Hot Gets a Little Cold\\" and \\"Fearless\\" are among the best ballads she's ever done and \\"Say a Prayer\\" is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's wrong with it, but maybe it's me","review":"I guess I liked her first three albums so much that I expected something in the same key. But the times and style have changed, and Cyndi grew up too. This album just didn't do it for me, except for \\"Hot gets a little cold,\\" a very touching song. Everybody here seems to like it, and I feel odd, but oh well, I just express my impressions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cyndi's worst album","review":"I really dislike this one. I think \\"Sisters of Avalon\\" is her weakest album, along with \\"a night to remember\\". The title track is very bland and unmemorable and the other songs are boring or just plain bad. I don't know why most people think this album is so great. I recommend \\"12 deadly sins\\" \\"true colors\\" or \\"merry christmas..have a nice life\\" instead of \\"Sisters of Avalon\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a fine wine...","review":"I bought this cd several years ago (I believe I was 18 at the time) and was somewhat disappointed. I absolutely loved all of Cyndi's other albums, but had trouble enjoying this one. Well, after a couple of years had passed I started listening to 'Unhook the Stars' and decided to give the album another shot. I couldn't believe what I'd been missing out on! The title track, 'Hot Gets A Little Cold', 'Fearless', and 'You Don't Know' are my favorite tracks. So, at least in this writers case, I found 'Sisters' most enjoyable after a couple year's shelf life. If for some crazy reason you couldn't appreciate this album on first listen, now's the chance to give it another shot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When Hot gets a little Cold","review":"...an appropriate sub-title for \\"Sisters of Avalon\\", as Lauper returns to the subtle hip-hop arrangements from the uneven \\"Hat Full of Stars\\". But that album was kept exciting and interesting due to a perplexing mix of moody material. Here, only \\"You Don't Know\\"(a terrific single), \\"Hot Gets a Little Cold\\", \\"Fall into Your Dreams\\" and \\"Mother\\" really capture the essence of Lauper as an expanding musical force. The title track peters out before it's over and \\"Unhook the Stars\\" and \\"Searching\\" are a bit too windy and directionless. Still, it ends on a cheery note(with a head-scratching ode to lesbian love!)and Lauper as a performer is as engaging as ever.

It is one of the first anti-hero movies, a reaction to the cotton-candy goodness of movies during the 1950's and the McCarthy era. It was made as the studio system was crumbling and more and more directors were being influenced by European cinema.Newman is absolutely at the top of his game as Luke, a war hero turned petty criminal who is sent off to a Southern prison camp. Full of religious symbolism and themes, this drama shows the strength of man and his relationship to God. This is the type of movie that gets under your skin and stays there.

Sure enough repair facility, Fremontek in Fremont CA. charged me $355.00 dollars to repair and return. It took 8 weeks to get a refurbished computer returned. Repair facility has no toll free number, I spent 5 hours on hold waiting for customer service and they don't return calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable","review":"I have been wearing New Balance sneakers for over ten years and this is not their finest product. I purchased these for just strolling around the park with the kids, no long distances, but they were quite annoying. The sole is recessed and there is an odd portion on the end of the shoe that rubs your heel as you step. Unfortunately, I tried to go up a size and had the same result.They look really nice but they're not worth the discomfort. I suggest that you take a good walk around a footwear store with these on before you add to the unwanted shoes in your closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"They never let poor Rudolph...","review":"Boy. There are very few times when I leave a theatre dissatisfied, but Reindeer Games was definitely one of them. With three castmembers I typically enjoy (Affleck, Theron and Sinise), I don't know how this film could have disappointed more. The convoluted plotline only gets worse as the film goes home...and only God knows what Bruckheimer was thinking when he shot that ending. Best watch this film in the company of friends a la Mystery Science Theatre 3000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the action?","review":"That's what we were asking while watching this mess of a movie. It seems that this movie wastes more time in stupid dialog than in the action piece. Now I know most action movies have stupid dialog, but they make up for it in excitement, Reindeer games had no excitement at all. Save yourself a couple of hours and skip this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reindeer Games Review Mad Lib","review":"I decided to watch [ movie name ] with my best friend [ name of person ] the other day while eating [ food name ] and drinking lots of [ beverage name ].

I can't blame the actors, I think it was the script and/or directing. I have seem them both in other things and really liked them, so I can't see how they could have all of a sudden become as bad of actors as Kathy Ireland (pretty, but should keep her mouth shut), I just don't see it.Just my humble opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"One hell of a good movie!","review":"This is probably one of my favorite movies. The main story in 'Reindeer Games' is that an excon, Rudy Duncan (affleck) poses as his jailmate in order to meet his pen pal Ashley (theron). Then her brother, thinking that affleck is really the jailmate, forces him at gunpoint to help him rob a casino. This movie was more than what I had expected in all the right categories. Nonstop action meets tingling suspense and even some humor. Rent this movie... I garantee that you will love it just as I did. I will definately be buying this one when it comes out on VHS. I LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"reindeer games","review":"this movies was such a dissapointment to me that it mad me sick.

What a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could this movie be anymore obvious?","review":"This movie should be in the comedy section, because I found myself laughing at it more than being thrilled at it. The characters are just plain stupid, mostly Gary Sinese (whenever I see him with long hair I always think of him without legs...not a very threatening villian I must say). The plot twists are obvious, and stupid. Bad acting, bad script, BAD MOVIE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!","review":"For every film I enjoy with Ben Affleck (Chasing Amy, Dogma), he seems to come out with two that stink! (Armagedon, Reindeer Games, Pearl Harbor, etc). He's over-rated, and can only play about one character... my guess is he's not acting, that's just who he is, and every now and then a script fits his personality very well. This script is so bad that it doesn't matter who is in it... the movie just stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violence--with a twist","review":"This movie seems to have an identity crisis. One minute it's a blood-and-guts, shoot-em-up violent movie and the next minute it tries to be funny and tongue-in-cheek. Ben Affleck is hard to believe as a newly-released convict who assumes his dead cellmate's identity and the lady penpal who is waiting for his release. He wants only to go home, drink hot chocolate, and watch football games with his father, but alas, he becomes involved with some bad guys who think he really is the man he is impersonating. There is lots of shooting, beatings, and violence, but through it all, Ben maintains his sense of humor. The only thing that saves this movie (the actors are hindered by a bad script) are the twists and turns of the plot at the end which keep it from being a 1-star attraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in Santa's Bag","review":"This film has great cinematography. We see images of the last few days before Christmas spent in a prison, a couple of cheap motels, and a small casino. There are a lot of good snow-covered winter landscapes and an interesting bit involving ice fishing.But, simply put, this film is a joke! And it's supposed to be dead serious. It makes no sense. The plot is as shaky as the San Andreas fault.The actors appear to follow directions and follow a script. But directions and script lead them along a loopy road indeed. It occurred to me that one way to get the most out of this film is to just turn off the sound and make up your own story.Plus, it mocks the Christmas spirit. Imagine, Santa uses very bad words and fires automatic weapons at innocent people! A running joke is one character's repeated reference to Santa's \\"dwarves.\\" Another character repeatedly corrects him and says it's Santa's \\"elves.\\" At least, we learn something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Video","review":"This product arrived on time and in excellent condition.

The casino robbery scene is quite exciting and the DVD provides good 5.1 surround activities. And the surprise ending saves this movie from being below average action movie. The story is about a convict (Ben Affleck) who just released from prison and was mistaken as ex security guard from a small casino and forced to rob the casino. Sounds good, well let me tell me it is very boring until the last 30 minutes or so. If you are looking for a good action DVD, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent............................","review":"THIS IS A MUST-HAVE MOVIE IT HAS SO MANY TWISTS AND TURNS YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE ROOM FOR A SECOND OR YOU'LL MISS ALOT.BEN AFFLECK IS A GREAT ACTOR,AND I ALSO LIKE CHARLIZE THERON.GARY SINISE IS A GREAT VILLAN.THIS IS ACTIONED PACKED SO BE READY THE ACTION STARTS 10 MIN.

The plot is forced, the dialogue is just bad, and it contains a performance by Gary Sinise that one is tempted to call \\"hammy.\\" The only actors to retain their dignity are the ones with little screen time, namely Donal Logue (Pug) and James Frain (Nick). At least Affleck's accent is consistent.I thought this would be a good Friday-night-with-chinese-food flick, but it's not even fun. The fault lies in the script, because all problems can be directly attributed to the writing, including the twist at the end.The actors give it their best, and Frankenheimer does what he can to keep the pace up, but there's really nothing that can be done to salvage this patently unnecessary waste of time.Just skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good action/suspense movie","review":"This is one of the best action & suspense movies I have ever seen.Rudy(Affleck) has just gotten out of prison.

Charlize gets down dirty, and I think that she did a phenomenal job. \\"Reindeer Games\\" is one of Ben Affleck's best movies in my opinion. Another good thing about it is that you have no idea how the game plays out until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun","review":"It is true that this movie doesn't have a believable plot, but that doesn't stop it from being good entertainment. There is nothing wrong with the acting, the film moves at a fast pace and has a good sense of humour. If you are looking for bit of fun(god forbid) in an action/thriller film, then look no further.Obviously it will be said that I am lacking in intelligence for liking this film, but I can live with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reindeer Poop","review":"Why let logic get in the way of a movie's ending? Why do we need script writers at all? Let's just put some good looking people on the screen, add some scary character actors and then blow stuff up. This movie starts outs ok but it is always desperate to find ways to keep this group of backstabbers together. The logic gets thinner and thinner as the movie goes along. It doesn't have a lot of logic to begin with but the ending is so laughably insane that you'll find it hard to believe. Any other special guest villians hinding in the wings? The movie is so intent on \\"tricking\\" you that it loses all believability. Just fast forward to Charlize's topless scene and then cut your losses."},{"rating":"2","title":"A So So Movie......with a GREAT ending !","review":"this movie starts very slowly....i began to feel bored and just want to leave the cinema....but i got to tell you this....this movie has an amazing ending....very unpredictable.....then again...this movie has little something for everyone....if you are girls there is ben affleck..and if you are boys there is always the always mesmerizing Charlize Theron !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe i'm being a LITTLE harsh...but","review":"I love ben affleck, and this happens to be his worst film ever!

This thriller by John Frakenheimer has an incoherent plot (like most action thrillers of late) and no energy whatsoever. The usually great Affleck, Theron, and Sinise all look so bored and depressed while onscreen. The stupid plot twists which make absolutely no sense could have been easily forgiven had the actors put a little energy and enthusiasm into their roles. Affleck was just plain cheesy. Theron was annoying as was Sinise. I'm not even going to start on the supporting characters played by James Frain and Dennis Farina. I strongly suggest that if you're in the mood for an action thriller that's actually fun that you need to keep on moving. \\"Reindeer Games\\" is definitely not fun...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat Flap","review":"The cat flap is less easy to use than expected.

Valle's songwriting is above average, with no weak numbers. I also like the production, which is both cool and slightly 'trippy', and which provides the music with a great sound.

Enjoy!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bossa Nova modernized","review":"This is the same Marcos Valle who was a mover and shaker of the original bossa boom. The liner photos show how very pretty he was then, and how much the worse for wear he looks now. His music has changed in much the same way. I don't like to listen to this album often, because every track goes on far too long. The old melodic flair is still there in places - the best is 'Mushi Mushi' - and he has modernized his style by adding elements of pop and jazz; it is only fair to add that some people will like it that way. Valle's keyboard playing is much featured, and most tracks are instrumentals. He sings on 'Mushi Mushi' and there is also a female vocalist on a few tracks. I was recommended to buy this by a young fan of Brazilian music, but I prefer the old Valle of the 60s."},{"rating":"1","title":"It never came","review":"The seller emailed me initially with a confusing explaination why the product may not be coming.

The second point of view is as wretched and evil as possible. Everyone needs to be aware of the despair and disease that such places breed and fight to get rid of them. The first encourages a falseness in relationships. I would give no stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a beautiful story!","review":"I have read many books over the years but can't remember one that has touched me so deeply. Although a city girl, I appreciated the description of farm life and the closeness of those who work the land. However, the details of the feelings and life of Hannah and her husband, Nathan hit home with me. I was at the beach with my husband of 28 years celebrating my 55th birthday while reading the book. Several times I handed the book to him so that he could read the author's view of the beauty of mature love. It was also meaningful to him. The sorrows and eventually, joys, of empty-nesting have never been described so accurately. What an accomplishment of a male writing from a woman's outlook! This is the first book I have read by Wendell Berry but it will not be my last.

Ordered 4\\" twin size memory foam bed topper then cut two pieces (one for each dog bed) to fit exactly in the cover. Kept the egg crate foam that comes with the bed.

The quality of sound and picture is terrible. It looks as if it was recorded on 8 mm film. I know this concert is 32 years old. But I bought the Led Zeppelin DVD with footage that was older than this and they did a masterful job on the picture and sound quality.

His conviction and clarity grabbed me almost instantly. Unlike the vast majority of politicians who study demographics so as to appeal to as many American sub-groups as possible, hoping to win the most votes, Harry seeks to pursuade regarding what he believes. I found this title one day and read the whole thing right there in the book store. Harry's got it nailed! I never before thought through the issues of the \\"war on drugs\\" or income taxes or social security as Harry had. I am now a Libertarian and learning more and more about precious liberty.

They all liked it, and some bought more for THEIR friends. In a time of dismal forecasts for the economic future of the United States, Harry Browne offers a plan to greatly increase the spending power and financial security of every taxpayer, through his provocative proposal: Would you give up your favorite Federal Government program if you never had to pay another penny of Income Tax for the rest of your life? Almost everyone says Yes. (A few even point out that they have no favorite federal program, they dislike them all.) Anyway, get the book.

When I read that it was to be done with MTM and DvD I thought,\\"This is going to be awful\\". I was not disappointed.

The popular songs from this album have their moments but don't really stand out as entities in and of themselves. Space filling strumming seems to be used when they are running out of ideas or want to lengthen a song to an unnatural point, you often feel you know the song in another form.

The juddering guitars begin to grate pretty quickly, as does the singer's hoary voice. Everything feels like it has been done before, and better by many American, and some German and even British bands. The lyrical content when translated is simplistic and emotionless. For a band whose name translates to Big Heart in English, they don't display much of a knowlege of the heart's workings. It's really hard sometimes to tell the songs apart too. I have to type this review up here, because it will break my friend's heart if I tell her the full details of how much I hate this.

Slowly she gains his trust and learns the horrible truth behind what happened to him. While Kiefer only has a supporting role he makes every scene he's in count. And the emotional moment of truth is devastating. May be a bit dated but the impact is still there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See For Fans Of Kiefer Sutherland or Marsha Mason","review":"I saw this movie when it was televised in 1986.

This book does an excellent job of covering the various aspects of changing legislation on the wolf at both the federal and state levels. It also thoroughly cites chants, essays, poems and treatises that map the varying American views about the wolf. Do not look for detailed biological information in this book, however, this is a study on human attitudes as they have affected the wolf.

At first, I thought it was a cool camera, being small & all.. When I tried using it though, I was very disappointed. There was no flash, so I had to make my own lighting just to take pictures indoors. When I did take pictures, the picture came out HORRIBLE! The picture quality was the worst that I had seen, & this was from a supposedly hi resolution picture.If anyone even thinks of getting this camera, I advise you not to.

This film didn't flow naturally and the scenes seemed so scripted that the actors overcompensated in making simple points. Although it wasn't intentional, the mood of this film reflected an old mindset (1950's - 60's), era and tone that displayed a poor job, in my opinion, of the true issues/pains surrounding racism.At least it was free on Hulu, but still was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful compilation","review":"This book is a wonderful compilation of 18 short stories detailing conversions by Protestant clergy to the Orthodox faith.

When the book finally arrived, it was the worst print quality of a book I have ever seen. The type was so faint it was difficult to read. An entire chapter of the book was not cut properly so that the paper page extended well beyond the bound of the book. I had to trim it with scissors.

The drama feels artifical and the \\"humor\\" can only be described as lame.If the reader is looking for some type of description of the XIX century customs and ambiance of the brazilian lifestyle, he/she will also end up being very dissapointed since the atmosphere only provides with bits and pieces, which are the barely minimum to locate the reader in the space and time of the novel.Frankly your money will be spended better in other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a dip ... the water is great","review":"For any couple who has ever considered the potential disaster in \\"swinging\\", this is must viewing. The movie features--among Baldwin, two extremely sexy women (unfortunately, I can't recall their names), who genuinely seem to enjoy the experience. Unfortunately, it goes bad fast, and very nearly costs one family everything.Like most guys who rent these types of movies I wanted to see women getting together. The movie does this, and well. The build up was excellent, and the payoff reasonable for an R-rated film.True, I would have liked it to be unrated, and extended, but that's just me.I thoroughly enjoyed the tension between the couples, I enjoyed Baldwin's psychosis (I happen to believe he's not acting). In short, it was decent, and well worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"KRISTY RULES","review":"Okay,you know this wasn't an award winning movie. I wont bore you with that and the whole plot...you can see that stuff here from the others. But i will mention that Kristy Swanson is very hot and spicy in this movie. Kristy is wicked in this movie.

In this sorry excuse for a movie Ms.Brandy Ledford's marriage has become somewhat stale so she and her husband decide to try \\"swinging\\" Gee. I thought Marriage Counselling would be a better option. So they get involved with a Sociopathic couple and then the stakes in the deadly game just keep on getting higher.I have always like Ms. Ledford and Ms. Swanson and why they agreed to appear in this trash is beyond my comprehension.I do give this movie 5 stars because no doubt every 17 year old Geek out there who can't get a date on Saturday night will LOVE this movie for the sex scenes alone.And I do mean \\"alone\\" as in by themselves with their hands on the remote control!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"can you say predictable","review":"This movie started out promising. A couple decided to become swingers. However the appearance of Stephen Baldwin quickly deminished any hopes for decent acting. The plot is even weaker.

Canadian cinema has seen better days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book for art historians and collectors to learn about materials","review":"I recommend this book often to art historians and collectors so that they can understand how the materials of a painting, e.g. canvas vs. wood, oil vs. tempera, etc. affect the look of the painting, how paintings change with age (become more transparent, fade, how varnish darkens), and how conservators also may change the look of paintings by conservation treatments. The chapters provide a useful history of materials of Western art, describing the support, grounds, paint films, and coatings. The book tells in clear language what you learn from x-radiographs and examination with ultra-violet light, how to tell that separated panels come from the same altarpiece, or how to recognize if a painting has been cut down or repainted. It was written by an art historian and a conservator working together and should appeal to both groups. Excellent illustrations and information about many well-known artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job","review":"Yeah, I ordered two books at the same time, one from amazon and one from this seller.

Brian singing Caroline No and Surf's Up is priceless! With the exception of the newly recorded \\"California Feelin'\\", can you cull these from your Beach Boys CD's a make it yourself, and will some of you do that? Sure, but then you miss out on two great pleasures. 1)Seeing Brian's name on the cover art and 2)paying royalties to the man who brought you these timeless great songs! Buy it now!

Great mix of California Girls too. I must admit, I am a fairly recent Brian Wilson admirer, but I am glad I didn't have to sit through crusty old mixes of Surfin' Safari or 409, they were great and all, but I am so very glad to have been reintroduced to beautiful selections from those almost forgetten 70's albums like Friends and Surf's Up that have rarely appeared on retrospective collections.

Though some of this text's lack of clarity is due to the subject matter itself, it certainly isn't carefully-edited enough to make it more understandable. Very little is given by way of explanation, and solutions to the many problems in the text are given sparsely. The only positive thing I can say is that the problems in the text are generally appropriate for the material, but as an introduction to the subject, this text leaves you basically on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexcited, hazy presentation; at least accurate & coherent","review":"Despite the myriad typos and mostly confused presentation, this book has at least couple of redeeming virtues, namely that a few sections, like the point-set topology section, were decent; in general the proofs were mostly rigorous and solid; and the exercises listed many good problems to help our understanding. Most important, the integreation of linear algebra with the calculus/analysis was, as advertised, pretty good. But the text was unexciting and very often completely unhelpful. It gets the job done of presenting the material, but not very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful and amusing how-to book for people who lose things","review":"This book is great for people like me, who spend an excessive amount of time looking for things we've misplaced. The principles for finding lost objects really work, and are presented in an amusing way via stories, photos and delightful cartoons. I recommend this book to anyone who's ever just put something down, and been unable to find it again. Also, a great gift for anyone who loses or misplaces things on a regular basis (I suspect there are lots of people like that)."},{"rating":"2","title":"REVIEW OF THE FILM \\"30 MILES\\"","review":"First off, I have to admit that I am a die-hard Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs fan. I personally feel that he is one of the most underrated Black actors in Hollywood. He brings dignity, intensity and fantastic acting to whatever role he plays, and his performance in this film certainly lives up to this expectation. This movie is great, and the ending is something that you would just not anticipate; particularly because of how the movie begins, and of the first meeting between the two main characters. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs fan. A must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolution","review":"This is a great Cd that I only recently (year or so ago) took the time to listen to. Squirrel Bait was awesome, don't get me wrong, but I'm tired of people being upset when an artist develops. I'm not really a fan of his newer work, nut Starbilly was awesome. Dark, popapunk, fun to listen to, but deep enough to stick with you. It has some more polish on it and it's a good thing. I'm not going to get rid of my squirrel bait albums, but this is a great progression from a talented man. If I didn't evolve, I'd still be sitting in my parents house listening to Anthrax. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Noisy Power Pop","review":"Ex-Squirrel Bait singer Peter Searcy has a great voice...noisy interesting guitar work...production could be better...slow, intense cover of the Husker Du classic \\"diane\\" captures the true dark nature of the song...worth checking out just for this cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"It won't catch any squirrels.","review":"Peter Searcy, all grown up following his stint years back as the frontman(boy?) for the magnificent post-punk teen wunderkinds Squirrel Bait, and that's too bad. He's cleaned up some of his wail, and has apparently excised a large amount of the angst he had in the 80's. Nevertheless, for those wishing there was more Bait out there, this is it. Starbilly is pop, but not to the saccharin extent of Searcy's recent solo effort (watch some late night VH-1 to catch remnants). Send me back to Skag Heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I recently bought this video along with The Firm Super Body Sculpting. I agree with one person that she zooms through the workout like you know what you are doing. The music on this video is all wrong. I will make an attempt to do the work out but won't make any promises. I can see the difference in these older and newer firm videos. The music is up to date and you don't have a ton of people excercising at the same time. They don't give you a modification of each exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"this tracie long video is the core of my workout.","review":"it took me a minute to realize i had this tape under the name All weights since around 1998. i am disappointed as for a minute there i thought i missed buying one of tracies workouts. i've said in other reviews for her other videos ( The tortoise and the hare scuplting with weights etc) i just love tracie long as an instructor. i have lost serious inches due to this fun and tough workout. and i just love also the other firm workouts, they are tough but they WORK.. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Beginners!!","review":"The description of the video states that it is for beginners to intermediate...use only if you are planning to enter the Olympics. Do not even consider this if you are a beginner. Tracie Long is supposed to be the instructor on this video, she is rather a demonstrator only. The tape has no introduction or instruction whatsoever and Tracie zooms right through each excercise as if the viewers were totally familiar with all movements of the routines. If you are looking for a step by step or even minor support, this video is not for you...I was most overwhelmed and discouraged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aerobic work out isn't there","review":"I was very disappointed, when it said 30 minutes of aerobic I was expecting a cardio work out to get my heart rate up, it wasn't there. I have ordered Gilad, Kathy Smith, Tamilee Webb, Kelly Roberts and have been VERY pleased with all of those but NOT with this one. I was expecting a cardio work out mixed with weights. In this work out it jumps around too much, picking up different weights, body bar, push ups, after I finished I had to jump on the treadmill for 20 minutes just to get a cardio work out. Also, it doesn't use a normal 'step' I had to add risers (making the Reebok bench 4 risers high) and still didn't get the cardio."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good, but not for me","review":"It's a good workout but it's for a more advance person that has been working out for quite a while. As a new mother, I was very tired after I worked out with the tape. I do recommend it for those who are bit more shape than I and I will work with it again after I can get a bit more stamina to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adaptability is the key","review":"I recently ordered this video based on the rave reviews it's gotten; plus, I am familiar with the FIRM serious and Tracie Long. I did enjoy the workout; however, advanced students should know that you really need to use heavy weights to get the workout you're after. I was expecting it to be much harder, so I went with lighter weights, and it was over before I knew it had begun! The reps are really quite short, so you'll want to pile on the weights in order to really feel it. Once you do that, though, it's a great tape and I'm sure I'll be reaching for it often when I am looking for a specifically weight-training video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Simple SOngs 2","review":"I teach KIndergarten, and many of my students are second language learners - so it is important to have them feel comfortable in speaking.

From 'run Forrest run' and 'Washington reunion' to 'Forrest meest Forrest' and 'Jenny's grave', it's Silvestri's way to tell a story. From subtle piano to majestic symphony variations: his orchestrations are magnificent.Enjoy.NB. Besides this SCORE there's also a double cd, titled 'Forrest Gump the soundtrack'.

I have always been a fan of Alan Silvestri's music (\\"Back to the Future,\\" \\"Father of the Bride,\\" \\"Fools Rush In,\\" etc.). Included on that CD are all the instrumental pieces heard in the movie. If you've seen the movie often enough, you'll be able to recreate the scenes in your head while listening to the music -- Forrest running, the feather floating, Forrest talking to Jenny, Forrest in Vietnam. A lot of very powerful songs can be found on that CD. The other CDs (actually a 2-disk set) are a compilation of oldies used in the movies. Relive the eras of the 50s, 60s, and 70s with all these great songs. There are a few songs from the movie that are not on the soundtrack but it's still a good CD anyway. Both CD/sets are great for any fans of \\"Forrest\\" and I would highly recommend them (especially the intrumental soundtrack)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful but too short","review":"You've seen the film, you know the wonderful background music by Alan Silvestri.The only negative is the length of the CD- some 38 minutes.I had hoped that the various themes may be performed in slightly longer versions than heard in the film- they aren't- some are less than one minute long. Just as you are getting into the music, it ends and the next piece starts.Otherwise it is wonderful, beautiful emotional stuff and complements the other soundtrack to the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"This is absolutely astounishing! It has all the formulas melded into one! For once I feel that a soundtrack is complete. And that would be this one. The absolute best track is 6.

Since purchasing and using two Wrist Sleep Supports I am sleeping soundly through the night and waking with both hands feeling comfortable and normal. The Wrist Sleep Support is very comfortable; lightweight; quick and easy to put on and take off; and provides excellent support (adjustable straps not only mean the fit is adjustable, but you can tighten/loosen to adjust the compression/support). I love my Wrist Sleep Supports!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable at all and non-returnable!","review":"Had such high hopes for this with all the reviews but so disappointed! If you have skinny arms - like anorexic - probably work well for you. This was very tight in the arm area. Not adjustable easily... PLUS it makes your hand/wrist so HOT! Not breathable at all. SO, SO DISAPPOINTED. Top it off and find out that it is NOT returnable! It doesn't clearly say that in the product information anywhere! IF something has a unique return policy, I think it should be noted in the product description! I ordered 2-3 different ones and this was the ONLY one that was unreturnable! Luckily found one that was fantastic BUT if I had known, I would NEVER have ordered this to try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for your sleepy moments","review":"This is a perfect accessory to help you with your painful wrist.

It was applying pressure in all the wrong areas and did not last nearly as long as i would have liked. I still use it on the left side which is less sensitive, however at the time of purchase, it was under the impression that these would remain more supportive than they actually did.

I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best workout video ever!","review":"My VHS version of this video recently bit the dust after years of use, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a CD version to replace it!This video is great for beginners or advanced. If you're a beginner you can modify the exercises and not use weights. If you're advanced you can add as much weight as you can safely handle. It gives a full body workout (cardio and toning) including abs, with a good warm-up and stretching/cooldown period when completed. No bands, balls, or steps needed. You start with 1 lb. and 5 lb. handweights, and ankle weights. That's it! If you can get through the entire workout you WILL see results in 10 workouts. Amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Better, Look Better","review":"Tired of lack of energy, or down in the dumps? I always wanted to start working out but always found a reason not to. Finally I mentally prepared myself that I would start and stick to it. After the first run through, I seriously thought I might die and told my son he may need to call 911 before the workout was over. I stuck to it and the next 2 days I felt like I had been hit by a truck. But I had the patience I promised myself. Today I have done the workout 4 times and wow, I can't believe the strength I have already built and I am no longer cursing under my breath at Susan Harris because she really does do a nice job. I know I will see results in 10 workouts, and I already feel so much better. Try it, you'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Firm--Delivers the FASTEST results","review":"I have been working out to the Firm for about five years--I recently discovered this one about three months ago and have quit ALL my other exercise videos because this one really kicks butt and still keeps me sweating and out of breath after working out to it almost EVERYDAY for the past three months! It is a GREAT program, a lot of varying moves, you never get bored, and I LOVE the music on it.

If you're a beginner, just start with two pairs of dumbells: a pair of 1-pounders, and a pair of 3-pounders. That's all you need to start. If you can't keep up, that's okay, just do as much as you can. Advanced folks, you can go as heavy as you like. This workout will challenge even the most advanced exercisers.

I've been desperately trying to find a DVD copy of this video and I'm very happy to find it here. It is an excellent, hard workout, but it seriously got me in shape after gaining 20lbs after college. This video got me hooked on The Firm videos, but this is definitely my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time fan of The Firm Videos!","review":"In spite of the fact that I'd like to stuff a thick crust extra toppings extra cheese pizza down each one of them--could Ms Harris BE any skinnier--I really love these Firm videos. Susan Harris is motivating and encouraging. If you buy this one don't stop there. Collect them and you can rotate them to suite your needs and personalize your workouts.I would also recommend you really learn how to exercise safely first. As others have said before, Ms Harris, et al demonstrates good posture and safety but she doesn't teach it during the session. These are tapes are not for the first time exerciser who may not understand or be able to keep good posture throughout the session."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Firm Total Body Body Sculpting Basics","review":"I just ordered my second copy of this workout. I used to do it years ago and wore it out. Recently I've started working out again to try to lose weight (can you say MENOPAUSE?!). This workout gets results. I've tried others, including Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred (which is no piece of cake), but nothing gets results like this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE!!!","review":"I just had to write in and give a review after using this video for the last 20 years. I'm 38 and have the body of an 18 year old thanks to this workout. Susan is inspiring and although I have over 100 workouts from Cathe, Mindy, etc. I always go back to this one. In fact, I never did half of them so I sold all of them and just stuck with The Firm.The floor work is brutal and makes me scream every time I do it but there will never be another video out there that matches the toning in this workout so get ready to BURN!! Whenever I need someone to kick my butt into shape, I grab this tape. Yeah, the makeup and hair are hideous but you'll see immediate results!Susan, I'm sorry I'm about 20 years late with this review and you ROCK, GURL!!SUE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Workout Video","review":"This is the most awesome workout video ever; I first used this video ten years ago; and still to this day, it is the best workout video/workout in general. I have used the treadmill, gone to the gym using weight machines and many other things at the gym, tried other videos; and still nothing compares to this video. I am soooo tired after I finish this workout but it is so worth it. It is very intense but I got used to it in no time after about three times of using the video. I also first noticed results after the first three times of using the video. I recommend this video to anyone who wants a serious workout. Susan Harris keeps the workout interesting and the music is decent. Another plus about the video is that it is the farthest thing from a cheesy workout video."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Ultimate work-out!","review":"I first used \\"The Firm Vol. I\\" seveal years ago. My sister-in-law got me started on it. I did this tape everyday for the longest time and was looking the best I ever had. I had a baby recently and am now getting back to my tape. It's only been 3 work-outs so far, but already I'm feeling strong and alive! I can hardly wait till I'm back in shape. This is THE best exercise video I've ever used (I own about 50 of them, Gilad, Kathy Smith, Jane Fonda). The other Firm tapes are good too...particularly Vol 5 (Boomers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful/Repetitious/Strange","review":"Having just done this video for the first time, there is no doubt it is going to work. However I would not definitely recommend it for beginners. There is very little information from the instructor regarding technique, ways to maximise exercises and how to prevent injury. The moves are basic and quite repetitious and include a few strange strengthening exercises. Now I know what a dog must feel like! There is both aerobic (jogging and not much else) and toning exercises which makes it a good work out. However she does move quickly through the moves but I think this will be fine if I do it a few more times. On the other hand, I wont be buying any more Firm videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"The instructor is too fast to keep up","review":"I purchased this video with the intent to have a nice work out. I was very unsatisfied with the fact that the instructor was way too fast for me to keep up with her moves. Sometimes I was very confused with some exercieses and of course there was no way for me to find out if I was doing the proper exercise correctly. The instructor never bothered to explain how to do the correct body form or position for the exercise. I have to agree with the review from Japan. If the next work out is this fast, I won't be purchasing any more of The firm videos....Thank you...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable Music","review":"This video may help me to develop better all around body strength, but the music is simply the worst I've heard on a workout tape. Additionally, the instructor speaks in a whispery, breathy, Marilyn Monroe type voice. The whole thing seems to be straight out of Las Vegas. I couldn't even get through it one time."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Masochists Only!!!","review":"Holy Crap I thought I was going to die when I tried this video. My sister bought this video several years back and at the time I considered myself in pretty good shape. I exercised daily and loved doing aerobics and weightlifting classes. So, one day I decided to try this video. I think I made it about a half-hour into the video and quit because I thought I was going to collapse.Then I found out my sister had tried it with her friend and they lasted about 15 minutes before they gave up. Then I found out my mother tried it and she only lasted about 5 minutes. It has sat on the shelf unused since.Basically, unless you're like at an Olympic fitness level, I wouldn't even attempt this video. It's just too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"This tape was HORRIBLE!","review":"I've been using the Firm for a while and have many of the newer tapes. Lately I've started ordering the older tapes, to add some variety. By \\"older\\" I mean the ones that were produced prior to about 2000, when they had the wooden boxes as their fanny lifter.I've had some issues with the older ones, with the aerobic portions being tedious and boring, consisting of just running in place and lots of hopping around. But beyond that, the sculpting portions are fine.This tape had the awful running and managed to also destroy the sculpting portions by trying to do the moves at lightening fast speed. You don't get a full range of motion and it's nearly impossible to keep up. Plus I found the instructor, with her breathy pleas to \\"keep going\\" incredibly annoying.If you're someone who is familiar with the newer Firm tapes do NOT buy this one as it is a pale comparison and in no way gives you as thorough a workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't say enough","review":"The great thing about the old Firm tapes and the new FitPrime workouts is that you can ALWAYS make them more challenging. Even after you memorize the entire workout forwards and backwards, there is always the possibility of adding more weights to make it tough. This particular workout includes an exhausting thirty minute floor routine that primarily works every muscle in your legs. I saw results in less than ten workouts. Some beginners may not like the layout at first, but remember do not use weights! Just do the exercises to get familiar and work your way up. The new Firm tapes pale in comparison, so do yourself a favor and go back to the beginning, you and your body will be thankful."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a tough workout","review":"This was the first Firm tape I bought and being a pretty active person thought it would be easier - boy was I surprised, but pleased. This workout will make you sweat! The floor/leg workout will kick your butt! I've been doing the tape for 3 weeks now, every other day and still can't do all the gluteus reps, let alone with ankle weights! I've already lost pounds and inches and my legs are looking less flabby. The tape is a little dated in that I find the stretches too fast and could be dangerous if you're not careful with your form. Also, Susan Harris is a little dramatic with her facial expressions! Overall, I find this a good, effective tape that can challenge even the fittest person and can be adapted to those with very little fitness too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This One is Good for Beginner to Advanced","review":"The main thing I like about this volume of the Firm Workout is that almost all of the exercises can be done by people who are not in great shape. There are no step aerobic parts as in many of the others. There are a couple of relatively easy cardio routines you can do with or without weights. There are no complicated steps that require dance skills. I have tried many of the Firm Workouts and found that this one is one of the easier ones. Susan Harris leads a straightforward routine that older, over-weight people can do without risking injury or discouragement. The idea behind these workouts is that if something is too difficult, you let it go and move to the next segment, and if the weight being used by the participants seems to heavy, the person at home can use lighter or no weights. This Susan Harris workout has very few segments that an out-of-condition person has to skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Firm: Total Body-Body Sculpting Basics","review":"I have used this tape for years and it really works, It is amazing how fast your body firms up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Results from a Classic Work Out","review":"There are some dated elements to this video like the clothing and hair styles, but the the work out is fundamentally effective and enjoyable. Susan Harris is a true master of her craft and delivers a humble and comprehensive lead to a vigerous work out. If you use this work out 4 - 5 times per week you will see surprising results. I love the music they have with this video. Like so many other things, they just don't make them like they used to... This video is 20 years old and is top notch to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gym worthy workout","review":"I am a group fitness instructor, and I swear by this workout video. Although I prefer to workout in a gym with a class, I make sure to use this video once a week. All you need are several sets of hand weights and ankle weights, so you do not have to spend a lot of money on extra accessories. If you are new to exercising this video will prove to be a challenge, but do not feel obligated to complete the entire hour the first time. I have never found a better home workout series. It even rivals some classes at the gym!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't regret buying this one...","review":"I have had this tape for two years and still enjoy it. The instructor is great. The tape is easy to follow yet challenging enough to do over and over again without getting bored. If you haven't bought a FIRM tape yet, this is a great one to get your feet wet on."},{"rating":"2","title":"This workout is NO JOKE","review":"It works everything, the old school way, by blood, sweat and tears!!! I give it 4 stars because some of her technique and form is incorrect. But overall, it is an effective workout from top to bottom. If you want to purchase this video and all of the other older Firm videos go to www.collagevideo.com. Many of the older videos are also on DVD from colleagevideo, including this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best video in the world if you really want to get fit","review":"I have owned and used this tape on and off for many years. In fact, I ruined the first one I owned and had to purchase another. Despite the fact that I go to the gym regularly and own a collection of exercise videos, it remains my favorite workout. I laughed when I read the reviewer who said the video is only for masochists. She must be extremely unfit. I am 50 years old and can handle the entire video. One cannot be fit and remain that way without pushing the body. This video is definitely not designed for the lazy. It is for those of us who take fitness seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"best firm workout of all","review":"I really prefer the older firm workouts to the new ones- the sets are nicer, the music is better, and you don't have to buy all the Firm product junk the new ones insist on. A stool, a 2X4 board, dumbells, and maybe ankle weights will do ya. This Firm video is volume one, which is surprising, because its the hardest I've ever used. However, you can make it easier by using light or even no weights. Susan Harris is gentle and Southern, and a pleasure to watch. The workout is over an hour long, so don't do the whole thing at once. Break it into half a day. The camera work looks a little randy, like the cameraman was indulging himself with Susan Harris. But the best you can buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"I have had this video for 10 plus years and I still \\"feel the burn\\" when I complete it. This workout is killer. Susan Harris is in great shape. A little too perfect at times, but she is very motivating. Tjis workout has everything, aerobics and toning exercises that are effective and safe when performed correctly. Don't try to use weights your first time. Take it slowly and you WILL see results."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best workout video ever","review":"This video is great because you can do even just the first 10-15 minutes of it and feel as though you've exercised a good portion of your body without overdoing it, yet building muscles easily. Once you get to know the video, it just feels great to work through the whole thing. You can always make it harder by adding weights, but I've found they aren't necessary at all to make the workout worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Body Workout","review":"People, people ,people...if you hate the gym, have no time to go walking or jogging....this video is for you.

I recommend this tape to anyone who is serious about exercise. A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"This will kick your butt!","review":"I am new to exercising, but I was given this tape for a good challenge. This is like nothing I've ever done before. It's weights while doing cardio and its really tough! It's a great challenge. I guarantee you will feel the muscles all over your body after doing this work out. I even felt it with out using weights the first few times doing the video. This is really tough and I recommend it for someone who has exercised for at least a few months or is a beginner that can be patient with themselves as they are gaining strength and endurance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, balanced exercise","review":"I'm 63 and I find exercise a chore. I've used this once or twice a week for 12-13 years. I like it as a balanced workout that exercises all muscles. It complements my walking and other exercise and ensures some upper body exercise and overall balance. It's hard to get started on it (boring and hard), but my body always feels great when I finish. Never had an injury from it.Just bought a second copy in case something happens to my first one. I've tried others, but I have this memorized and I would be lost without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REAL BLAST","review":"Susan Harris has been working really hard, you could tell. I am an advanced exerciser and I jog every morning for 4 miles. In addition to my routine, I have been doing the tape for two months, and I relly feel that I am working out. The thigh and butt parts are not easy, even for joggers like me. The only drawback is that the bacground appears very out and old, also the costumes and Susan Harris' make-up. I gathered from another fitness website that the tape was actually made in 1985 and I guess this is a re-issue in 1995. I also think that Susan Harris is too soft in cueing. SHe could have better motivated fellow exercisers. Another thing is that why is every one in the background working so perfectly? That makes the tape a bit unreal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most emotionally charged cd ever!","review":"All you can do is sit and listen. This is not music for the \\"weak soul\\".

I am in my mid 40's and in relatively decent shape; maybe if I were 15 years younger!! I did feel thoroughly challenged in regards to endurance and coordination!!

Collings draws on his background as a seasoned journalist and academic to argue for the centrality of press freedom for the expansion of democracy in the 21st century. This pioneering study merits serious attention for what it has to tell us about seemingly \\"free\\" nations with whom the U.S. deals everyday, but who routinely oppress their people and deny them access to an independent media. The implication of global connectivity make press freedom more important and perhaps more endangered than ever before.

I was, and still am, a huge fan. I ran out to buy this album as soon as I could, being that there isn't much good music out there to buy these days. After the first few listens, I had to compare it to his other live album, East Asheville Hardware. This album compares UNFAVORABLY with his old album. How can two live albums by the same artist be so totally different? EAH had a certain edge to it, an attitude....even one of self-mockery. On Live Songs and Stories, Wilcox comes off as way too preachy for someone who is, well, not a preacher. I get the feeling that he is taking himself way too seriously on this album. Just shut up and sing, man. You are capable of WAY better than this. The songs are good, the performances of them not so good. Yuck....not recommended. Oh well, I guess I will have to begin the countdown until James Taylor's new album now...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time for another journey with DW","review":"I'm so totally confused as to how \\"fans\\" of David Wilcox could not love this CD!!!! What do us fans love about DW? We love his story telling, his lyrics, his guitar, and his vulnerable baritone voice. This CD has all of that. The stories give great insight and humor into the songs as well, as himself. The guitar playing is just as compelling as in his previous releases. And his voice, combined with his incredible lyrics, once again find their way into my heart to entertain me, teach me things about myself, as well as life.My personal favorites from this CD are Traveling Companion/Words Alone and Appreciating the Differences/Good Together are both GREAT story/song combinations. And Kindness has become a new favorite of mine - what a perfectly written and sung song.If you've ever enjoyed any of his prior music, or want to experience the depth of one of his concerts, this is a great way to do it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too full of himself.","review":"I'm new to David Wilcox. I've heard of him, but never heard him until last night on an internet station. The song was, \\"Not Far Away\\", and I was impressed enough to download the entire album. I'm still impressed with his songwriting and guitar playing, but I don't think I would want to see him in concert.

After reading reviews of the Presto 01781, I discovered that this pressure regulator was available, which turns your dial gauge canner into a weighted gauge as well! It works perfectly! I don't have to constantly check the dial, as long as I hear the gentle rocking of the regulator, I know that the pressure is perfect. This product is a definite necessity for the Presto 23 quart canner. And, at right around $10, a steal considering all the time it has/will save me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!","review":"I don't write a lot of reviews unless I am very impressed with a product and this one definately does that.

(Presto model 01781) I heard about this little gem. It is a three piece weight set. The middle section is 5 lbs. And each ring adds another 5 lbs. So you can have either a 5,10 or 15 lb weight on your pressure canner. When canning most things at 11 lbs I found that you had to sit in front of the stove and adjust the heat on the stove to keep it at 11 lbs. Now with this item I put on the base with one ring and Presto! It self regulates at 11 lbs! I am literally typing this review while processing a batch of Chile Verde. Without this item it would be impossible for me to sit down and use my computer. Thanks Presto! I also thank all the reviewers who made my decision to purchase so easy.

Luckily it wasn't too hard to figure out. I just replaced the 15lb weight that the canner came with when it was time to cap off the vent.It works perfectly! Just as promised.

Your friend may be you enemy, and your enemy just may turn out to be your friend. The story exemplifies the addage, \\"Politics makes strange bedfellows.\\" I found the character of Morgan Roche to be as engaging at Ellen Ripley character from Alien. A strong enduring woman, who is an unwitting pawn in a grand scheme where the reader is unsure as to who is pulling the strings. The culture is portrayed in a richtapestry, where humanity exist in genetically modified caste system. I recommed this book for anyone looking to get involved in a space opera of a grand scale. Only downfall is that once you finish Emgerence, you're going to have to wait for the next book in the series to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"and so it begins...","review":"This was where it all began. I was hooked right from the start and I never looked back. After reading this one I went straight on to the second and third books, and loved the entire series. But this was the one that set the mood for the following saga. I had forgotten how good sci fi could be. And it wasn't just a boy's own adventure either. The central character is a female and a damn strong female too. I couldn't help thinking as I read this how good the story would be made into a movie and having read the following 2 books in the series I have to say the whole thing should be turned into a trilogy of films! This could be the next Star Wars! Maybe this type of reaing isn't for everyone but if you do like sci fi space opera as much as I do then I recommend these books.

Yes!","review":"Yes, the hair and costumes look like 1990, but the moves, sequencing, tight choreography, and excellent production quality make this video timeless.Susan Harris and Kai Soremekun provide excellent cueing in this no-nonsense but entertaining workout. Short sets with heavy weights, alternating with aerobic segments, give a great, complete workout in minimum time. The ab section is innovative and very effective. The cooldown/stretch is wonderful, and the optional \\"dance\\" at the end is just plain fun. Composer Marc Aramian wrote the music specifically for this and the other original 6 Firm videos. It's perfectly synchronized, so you don't have to listen to monotonous \\"gym music\\" or deal with music that doesn't match up with the instructor's moves.I have more exercise videos than I care to admit to, but when I want RESULTS, I always go back to the Firm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"I am a FIRM veteran but this is the first time I've ever used this particular workout. If you're new to the Firm please realize that this tape, though a great workout, will take some getting used to. The changes between sets are QUICK and the moves - especially Kai's - are FAST. Don't get frustrated, it will take doing the tape 5, 10 times before you will be able to stay with them the entire time. That's the down side of all of the Firm's tapes. The up side is that once you know the tape, you won't get bored being taught the same move for the umteenth time (or hear that darned joke again), you'll just get on with your workout.By the way, even though I'm in good shape, I still found some of these exercises too challenging. I recommend that beginners use a shorter step (6\\" rather than 10-14\\") for Kai's kick-your-butt segments and use half the weight that Susan recomends in her segments."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is hard to beat!","review":"As a Firm Believer for over fifteen years, I have just about all of the Firm Tapes.

It has a mix of aerobic and weight training sequences. Susan Harris is an excellent instructor, but extremely thin to the point of looking anorexic. Perhaps that is why they have obviously retouched her photo on the video case. Kia (sp?) does the aerobic sequences and is not the best at cueing upcoming moves. I think The Firm has improved their teaching of aerobic sequences in later videos. This is obviously an earlier, less polished effort. I will say that Kia is obviously a gifted dancer.Despite these small criticisms and observations, I find myself going back to this tape time and time again for several reasons 1. mix of aerobics and weight training 2. good intruction from Susan Harris 3. strong abs section 4. great workout in 42 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, fast workout, but not my favorite","review":"If you are a die-hard FIRM fan, you will probably appreciate the intensity and time efficiency of this workout. If you are a fan of all things 80's you'll enjoy it even more. The workout is solid and time-efficient as promised. The only drawbacks are the very dated looking outfits and somewhat cheesy music.

The regular DVD version has a bypass option so why is there not one on the bluray? I rewatched the standard DVD and it really only has marginally less picture quality than the bluray and the audio is completely acceptible.

The audio mix sounds like the same one from the DVD, but it has a clearer, fuller sound to it. It has an uncompressed DTS Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack at 48khz/24bit. There is also a PCM stereo track but I can't comment on it because I've only heard the 5.1 mix. The video is 1080i but it looks very good regardless.

It's a book, that actually could make me fall asleep very easily. The beginning of the book is soooooooo stretched and stuffed with soooooooo many shortcuts you have to look up in the appendix each time you read them. It takes more than half of the book to until the first real tense situations develop.

Astronaut Jim Lovell provides Mr. Kluger with lots of information and leads to information, but Kluger was the one who put it all together in this magnificent book. As one who has followed his other writings, too, I must say that Kluger deserves recognition as one of the best writers of our era, particularly in his facile ability to explain complicated scientific information to a lay audience.

Although I knew that this series was not the more recent one, I was hoping that it would be equally as interesting and engaging.Not so. I like Alan Titchmarsh's work very much but this appears to be early in his career as a presenter and none of the wit and intelligence shines through a very pedestrian presentation. The camera work is just awful, very amateurish. A long pan shot of one garden jerked and jumped to rest on a view of one of the National Trust's homes. Weekend home movies are better shot.The production is simply not interesting. The musical score is only occasional and not inspired. There are long stretches where there is neither music or commentary to accompany the views.The DVD that I purchased here seemed to have been a returned item as there was very apparent use of the box.

There are references to Christianity in some of the materials, but it is by no means \\"forcing\\" beliefs on others. In fact, when did respect, love and logic consequences become Christian only values?

Susan has a nice voice, but I think she should consider going into Jazz or pop music, where I think it would be better utilized. I think the other people here who said they didn't like it, also like a different kind of blues. That does not mean that they are Posers or the like, it just means their particular taste in blues is different than what Susan offers here and they very well may NOT enjoy it. I think that personal bashing here is really uncalled for and immature.

Not exactly off key, but just off - maybe its the melodies, but something definitely doesn't work. When I started listening I kept thinking \\"the next song will be better\\"...but it never happened. Susan produced this one, and maybe that was a mistake, its really lacking the energy and harmony of 'Just Won't Burn.'

Mostasteless was an all around masterpiece and you can tell the lyrics on The Green Book have a lot of heart put into them, but this album just comes off as flat. A lot of the material on this album comes from the scrapped Black Majik side rock side project Twiztid was working on. If Twiztid decided to scrap the whole idea, then you can bet it was pretty whack. In my opnion, the only solid tracks on this cd are \\"Reflectionz\\" because of its wicked sound and \\"The World\\" because its just a kick ass song that reminds me of the Mostasteless days. \\"Dirty Lil Girl\\" is pretty funny, but still sub-par musically.

So I skipped them, did some arm and back stretches, and then started working with the video. If you're looking for an aerobic workout or something which works out your whole body, this is NOT the video for you. That said, this is a great video for upper arms. The only two drawbacks are that it's hard to switch the amount of weight you use between various upper body muscles since parts of this go fast, and there is a lot of back (lat) work but not as much bicep work as I would have wanted. This is a great video if you want to spend 20+ min just working the upper body or want to add at the end of some kind of cardio workout.

I usually lift weights for upper body three times a week, once with a new tape from the library, and twice with Firm Upper Body.

I have gone from size 22 and 260 pounds down to a loose size 18 and 204 pounds while using this tape regularly. It is intense if you are new to exercise.

After an hour, I passed the job to my husband (my five year old had completely lost interest in watching me struggle and swear) who spent an hour trying to get the skeleton into the mold. Once he got the skeleton together and put it in the mold, any manipulation of the 80 tiny plastic mold parts would break the skeleton again. I shudder to think what the process is for filling in the body - I probably would have ruined my kitchen in the process.This is going back. Don't waste even a dollar on this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of money","review":"This isn't a \\"toy.\\" This is a poorly constructed piece of garbage. As another reviewer said the mold isn't built well or right, the skeleton parts don't stay together (if they even fit at all,) and trying to actually get everything to stay in place is a feat of acrobatics... which I failed at. I wish I'd read reviews of this before purchasing it (at Target.) My son spent his 4th birthday money (and boy was he proud and excited) on this horrible, cheap nonsense. He's a very advanced and capable child for whom this should be no problem (targeted for 6 year olds.) Well, I'm almost 30 and I was on the verge of throwing this thing out the window after an hour. I have built bicycles, tunnels, Hot Wheels sets, dinosaurs... the list is immense. This? Made me curse the manufacturer a LOT. If your child likes dinosaurs check out the dig kits where you can be a paleontologist and \\"dig\\" dinosaur bones from a rock. My son loved them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off!","review":"From my 7 yo: \\"I got mad science for my birthday and me and my mommy tried to put it together and I couldn't do it. My mom tried but she couldn't do it, either. And then my dad came and he couldn't do it. The set is a rip off. I didn't like assembling the skeletons because my mom tried to put it together and the the neck snapped. Since we couldn't put the bones together, I tried to put the gel in there and it came out like a blob.\\"From me: Parents, don't waste your money. The pieces do not snap together easily. In fact, they don't even fit. And once I was able to force a limb in, another would fall off. We never even got past the first step!

I'm sure some folks get lucky and have the bones actually fit into the mold. Not me. If I moved the back feet into position, the skull popped out. Put the skull back in, then the front leg falls off. Quite the exercise in frustration. Finally I decided to skip the bones and make an all-gel dinosaur just to have something to play with. The gel ran out the cracks in the top of the mold and made a nice horrible mess.I'd suggest thesnap together electronics kits, or pretty much anything done with baking soda and vinegar instead of this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Junk Junk","review":"Reading all the reviews was way more entertaining than this product. I have never written a review before this, but had to because of just how bad this product is.It's all true...the skeleton pieces don't fit together, the mold is impossible to keep together, the gel solidified too quickly, the instructions were incomprehensible. Then when we put our finished dinosaur, which had bones showing because gel didn't fill up the mold, it wouldn't fit on the stand. There was no possible way that it could.[...].

Our son easily snapped the skeleton pieces together and was jazzed about getting the mold done. Unfortunately, this part of the project is not for ages 5+ or even for ages 37+! I struggled with the mold (dinosaur bones kept falling apart), then my husband struggled, then I struggled again, put it away for the night, and struggled to finish the next day. Of course, the five year old totally lost interest. The instructions for mixing the gel were unclear (put both packets of gel powder in with one cup of water or one pack for one cup of water?), so we ended up with a mess, and the gel didn't properly cover the bones-- even after all that work. We've put the second dinosaur project away for another time.

Ultimately, we threw all of the parts and the goo back in a bag and will return in tomorrow. The list of which parts of the procedure work is very short, and the list of what doesn't is almost all-inclusive. Highlights:* the dino skeletons are fragile and fall apart often during the process* figuring out where the multiple parts of the mold go is extremely difficult (you have only dark, photocopied small photos to go by), and the parts are placed loosely on the skeleton, so one shake of the table and you're starting over* the goo you're supposed to pour in through a tiny hole into the mold is too thick and won't even pour, let alone spread inside the moldI won't even buy another Mad Science product after this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful","review":"This product is aweful, the skin does not cover the bones, my nephew loved it but as a consumer don't buy it, it's a great idea and concept, but needs adjusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicken!","review":"This is an excellent grilling product!

The remainder of the album is not bad, but never manages to rise above what I would consider the average singer-songwriter fare. There's not a lot of urgency to be found here, with most of the tracks settling into a mid-tempo stroll. Penn, who conjures up the Beatles, and sometimes a touch of They Might Be Giants (I don't know where that comes from, but I thought it was TMBG the first time I heard his voice),is winning but never really asserts himself.This is a review for those of you who have not listened to Penn in the past.

Penn is an excellent songwriter/storyteller in the tradition of classic folk artist's like Bob Dylan and Stephen Stills. While the music on this album reminds me of older artists, it is by no means dated. It has a fresh sound to it. Refreshingly deep, while still having pop sensibility. Wonderful harmonies and superb musicianship. The first single/video \\"Walter Reed\\" is a great representation of the album. Heady lyrics with beatlesque harmonies and music, while still maintaining and identity that is uniquely Micheal Penn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concept Album","review":"This is a great album. The first two songs are fantastic! A bit depressing when one considers the concept of the album.

I was intrigued to find Christmas Evil on his website, and on reading the synopsis I thought it would be much to my taste. The DVD arrived today, and having sat through it, I found Christmas Evil to be the biggest movie disappointment of my life. Although not a John Waters production, I thought that having been endorsed by him, this would be a good black comedy, with at least some of the campy dark kitsch that is John's trademark. What I found was just unbelievably and embarrasingly awful, and lacked just about everything that would have been necessary to deliver what was suggested. Imagine the worst B-movie ever, but produced by an eight-year-old, then extract anything approaching humour, and you have Christmas Evil. I sat through it with fellow Waters fans and at the end I had to apologise to them.

That is a pretty bold statement considering how varied peoples tastes are. I think this is a very good character piece that definitely deserves to be viewed at least once.

I would have to compare it to episodes of Hill Street Blues, which I loved. It isn't an exciting, page turner.

Some people do \\"fall through the cracks\\" as children due to family circumstances; their education is woefully inadequate.

But originality is not really what's needed in this simple film about simple people and their loves beneath the stars. It is easy to see why films like this get glossed over come Oscar time, but it's unfair. All characters have their particular voices and seem refreshingly authentic.

Her life gets even worse when her daughter announces that she's pregnant. Iris has become friends with Stanley, a cook at her company's cafeteria. When it becomes obvious that Stanley cannot read he loses his job. Iris is determined to teach Stanley to read. The most touching scene in the film is when Stanley explains to Iris what it is like trying to hide the fact that he can't read. (I would like to show this clip when I'm giving talks about the need to support adult literacy programs.)This film only received modest reviews when it was released, but I think it's a wonderful story about people struggling to maintain their family life against terrible obstacles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stanley and iris","review":"Always enjoy films with a great storyline and good acting.

The first night I had the phone I charged it overnight like you are supposed to. Then I let the battery die and charged it overnight again. For the first month I had no problems with it. Then I started noticing that the battery would just die at random times. One minute it would tell me I had full battery life and then I'd go to make a phone call and it would die on me. When I'd turn it back on it would tell me I only had 1 bar of battery life or no bars at all. I am very disappointed with this battery and it has affected my opinion of the phone as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"T193-Stinkin Battery","review":"This phone is horrible.

Within the last month the battery has been not holding its charge at all. I would plug the phone in at night before I went to bed and when I woke up it would say it had a full battery. I would then make a 30 minute phone call and the battery would say it had only one line left? I just had to order another battery because the battery wont even power up the phone anymore. I am very upset that motorola would put out a battery that did this.

While I spent my early life as an Air Force jet fighter pilot, my vision is not what it once was. This is a really nice watch, but its various features are somewhat complicated. I would say that anyone who buys this watch MUST read the instructions to get things working. Herein lies the rub.The instruction booklet is made up of about .0005 typeface. This is probably the 4th or 5th Casio watch I have owned over the years (my wife describes me as a 'gadget guru'). This watch has all the features I could ask for. Now that I have owned it for a week or so, I think I have it kind of figured out ... but I must admit that after the first few hours I was ready to call Amazon and discuss their return policy.It would really be nice if they had an option for a 'readable' instruction book. I may own this watch for several years before I figure out how to do 'everything', but for now I have figured out the most necessary functions. It's a great watch!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solar POWER!","review":"The watch is solar powered and has atomic time keeping.The battery also lasts for a very long time ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch with the correct time always.","review":"This is my second Casio GW500A watch.The first, which I have had for many years, needed a new band after being abused with many chemicals and UV from the sun. I decided to buy a new one rather than just the band. The old watch still works perfectly, always with the exact time, due to the atomic feature, and never needing a new battery, due to the solar charging. It is probably 12 to 15 years old. Before I retired a few years ago, it was constantly subjected to strong magnetic fields, harsh chemicals, vibration from air and electric hammers, and other abuses that industrial maintenance offers, but still worked perfectly. I would highly recommend this watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"This watch sucks!","review":"This is my third Casio atomic watch. I like their accuracy when they actually work correctly, but when they screw-up they are worthless. This my latest Casio watch and came with an operating manual you'd need a microscope to read. If you could read it you'd need to be a brain surgeon to understnd it. Casio is not kown for their dependable watches, and this one is a pain in the ass to set-up and use. I've had this watch for about a month. As you can tell I'm bummed, because this watch went belly-up twice in the past twenty-four hours. I would not recommend this watch to anyone who actually wants a dependable wrist watch. Atomic time is a great idea but worthless without a dependable watch to use it. Casio just aint it."},{"rating":"1","title":"UPDATED: Now Faulty","review":"UPDATE: 10-20-2012The watch has developed a problem: when I press the Light button, it illuminates for an instant, then the watch goes into \\"Recovery.\\" But, the Battery indicator shows \\"Full,\\" and the Sync function still operates.Without a functioning light, this watch is useless to me. I have lowered the rating to one star.I have contacted the company with a request for refund or replacement.UPDATE: 11-09-2012Company states watch is out of warranty. No return or replacement is possible. I threw it away. I'll not buy this model again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good watch, Casio dropping the ball on the straps...","review":"I actually owned two of these casio atomic watches but they were different models. The first one lasted about 4 years and the band broke while I was playing football and the pin was bent out of shape and I couldn't replace the strap. The second watch I wore for about a year until the little thing that holds the strap with the watch body ripped and I had to stop wearing it and couldn't find another one of those things.The bottom line is, the watch itself is pretty tough and you could probably run over it with a truck and nothing would happen. BUT, what is the point when the strap breaks so easily? Casio is known for having pretty weak straps if they fixed this the watch would be near perfect.The only other problem with the watch is that the buttons are a little hard to push sometimes and it's a bit large but some people like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I bought this thinking about the daily update to a nuclear clock and solar power to have a watch last longer than four years. This one lasted about four months before it stopped working altogether. I wouldn't buy this watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always accurate, rugged, and solar powered","review":"Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, but all are equally accurate. The Casio G-Shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models, such as this, never require battery replacement. Atomic accurary, solar power, and G-Shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best watch ever","review":"This is better than my previous Casio Wave Ceptor. Lost my old one on the trail due to broken band. This one should be even better. Charges by itself, so battery wont be a factor for a very long time. It's a G-Shock so should be stronger. It's nice having a watch that is always the same time as the GPSs that everything uses so you know exactly what time it is. It even has a stronger band so maybe it wont break off this time. Best and cheapest of the G-Shock Wave Ceptors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Watch. Worth every penny","review":"My Casio says GW-500A on the back. I've had this watch for about 7 years and have put it through hell. Great unit, but it is a little bit on the larger size for a watch. You have to take it off in tight spaces (minor drawback). The tall case does a great job of protecting the crystal (which is set lower), so there is a reason its designed the way it is.The G Shock is the bomb for durability. Everything still works on this thing as if it were new. I highly recommend it, and I love not having to worry about batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great up until now","review":"Got this watch about a year and a half ago. Worked great up until about two weeks ago.

Unfortunetly my fears were correct and after a few days of wearing the watch and leaving it in direct sunlight for hours I still can't get the battery to remain charged over night without the display going blank and the charging indicator blinking. Only after leaving the watch sitting in the window and the display returns can I wear the watch until it goes blank again sometime in the night. I am now in the process of going through the return procedure and sending it back for refund. Probably just got a bad one but don't want to take a chance again.."},{"rating":"2","title":"me and my watch","review":"I have owned this watch for over 12 YEARS now and i have only had to just now replace the wrist strap for it. I am very hard on watches and it is difficult for me to find one that holds up for more than a year or two so i am very impressed that it has held up. yes its big but so are all G series that last any amount of time.

Swimming, skiing, rough on-the-job treatment. The solar charged battery has never been a problem. The wrist strap, which on previous Casio models tended to crack after a couple of years, is still like new. I must be on the fringe of reception, or blocked by the mountains, because it doesn't sync to the mothership every night, but it does most nights, and it is always accurate to the second. When I bought it I was concerned about the size--it is fairly big and clunky--but that hasn't been a problem. To wear it with tight-fitting shirt cuffs I just open up the strap a couple of notches and it rides a little lower. I have no hesitation in recommending this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solar Atomic Watch","review":"This watch arrived very quickly, and it is a very fine watch. I had an earlier Casio Ceptor watch and the battery died, I couldn't find anyone to replace it so I needed a new watch. By the time I had ordered this watch, I actually replaced the battery myself in the old one. So now I have two atomic watches, but the G-shock is superior by far and is ruggedly sturdy and should last indefinately with the solar power, just be sure to get it to full charge by putting it in direct sunlight until it indicates full charge. A great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch, solid.","review":"Perfect for hiking and camping trips (that is why I bought it). The time is very accurate.

I was impressed with the quality of the display and liked the solar charging feature.However, after going for a 2 hour paddle in the ocean yesterday, the watch stopped working. I thought it might have needed a recharge (though it read full charge before the paddle) and have kept it in the bright sunshine for 4 hours today with no hint of a charge.

I'd maximize to see letters bit better. Comments are based on 2 months of ownership and expect to use this for another 120 months.***Added later.I had originally given it 5 stars. Functionality of this watch is excellent as long as it is exposed to Sun.When the winter comes in, I wear long sleeve, work inside most of the day and watch hardly get to see the sun.So, I had to buy a spare watch one while it is being charged.

I drive bus, so timing is important. This watch sets it's self 4 times a day and is always on time with the clocks at work. Also, because of it's design, it's able to endure bumps w/out being damaged. The watch looks great and feels very durable. The batteries recharge themselves. There's a backlight for nighttime. It has multiple alarms and many more features. I had been looking at watches for a long time and, for some reason, I never looked into the G-shock series. I completely regret not doing this sooner. The price might have been a reason. But now that I have it, I can see that it was totally worth it, although, it really wasn't expensive. I can tell it's going to last me years, if not longer. Many of my coworkers have these series of watches and don't regret buying them. In fact, some are looking to upgrade their G-shock's because they've had them for so long. You can't go wrong with one of these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"salrite","review":"it's all fine, except you're suposed to prop it up at night so it will catch the radio signal correctly, which I thought would just happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Watch","review":"i wanted to wait a month or so before i wrote my review in order to really test this watch. All i have to say is that this watch is amazing.

Great price and even better watch. Would recommended to anyone i know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the risk of buying","review":"Wanted watch which i could rotate with some of my other watches.

He has a dresser drawer full of watches that need batteries. Some don't keep very good time either.This Casio watch is Solar powered so it NEVER needs a new battery. It has a Atomic Clock setting that receives a signal 4 times a day from the National Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins Co. so it is ALWAYS perfect time. Accurate to 1x1,000,000 of a second a day.!

What the heck eh?Buy One be happy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch!","review":"First off, I agree that this watch can be found in retail stores for about that price or less and you can try it out while you are there. Once you own this watch, you can forget about needing to change a dead battery when you least expect it. This is due to the built-in solar panel. Also, it can update itself to the atomic time (USA) by using a signal that is automatically obtained by the watch early in the morning while you sleep. This watch has a tilt sensor that will automatically turn on the indiglo light when you go to look at it. I have had this watch for a few years now, and there is not a scratch on it. The band is still in perfect condition, but a little dirty. This is a watch that you can forget about replacing for many, many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love mine!","review":"Let me confess right now that I purchased this for it's atomic clock maintenance and its long lasting rechargeable battery.I have no interest in all of the other great features of this watch.Nonetheless, I wear it every day and love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch, Had it over 4 years.","review":"This is a great watch, I am always beating it up with outdoor hiking, swimming, fishing, snowshoeing running... and it still works great.

The solar batteries in these watches tend to die after ~5-7 years and can no longer be charged, so the watch becomes worthless unless you have the expensive battery unit replaced, but that defeats the purpose of the solar battery. It would be cheaper in the long run to just buy the non-solar versions and replace the $5 batteries every few years. I feel like the solar gimmick is a scam by casio. Although the watches themselves hold up well and have good features, DO NOT buy SOLAR unless you expect to replace it in a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total loss[...]","review":"A few weeks after the one year warranty expired, this solar watch just up and died on me.

What's up with that Casio!?!?!? Can i give ZERO stars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to set due to small print instruction booklet.","review":"This watch has several problems. The dials on it chew up space for anyone to read the time and other info. Ok if twice its size. Get one w/o dials. Use a good magnifying glass to read instruction booklet or Casio has to double its size of their instuction booklet. Other bad mark is its shaded face or dark glass. I'm informing Casio of these problems as well. Its buttons are hard to press or do their job.

I will try to return it to casio."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much hassle","review":"Two things made me return this watch to be replaced with the Casio G-shock Tough Solar (which is great)-I didn't like having to take the watch at night and point out out a window to receive the radio signal to keep correct time (or have to wait while I mannually did it during the day)-I didn't like the idea of having something on my wrist that is receiving radio waves-maybe there are no risks(cancer etc) but didn't want to risk itOverall-the watch seem very high maintenace just to keep the time-would not recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Problems = Zero; Product = Exceptional","review":"Wear and tear are always a frequent problem with any watch and should be expected. Preventive maintenance helps. Once a week I wash the watch and band with soapy water and then dry it. I have worn this gem for 16 years for dress and active canyon hiking. It continues to look - and function - perfectly. On occasion, during a trip involving a motel stopover (depending on building shielding and/or motel location), the time may not synchronize. A push of the receive button and change of location will effortlessly correct this. If one is fortunate enough to locate this model, purchase it, as these watches are quite difficult to find new and now. Am I fan of this watch? You bet. It has been the best behaving and most functional watch I have ever owned [and that includes a Rolex)."},{"rating":"2","title":"STill figuring out all the features","review":"Great watch, very feature rich, great to look at, and simple to use once you get the hang of it.

This will be my fourth. They take all kinds of abuse but I have not had one last more than 5 years (assuming the stolen one is not still running somewhere). My last one was this exact model purchased at a big box in 2007 and it just stopped working one day. I put a new battery in it and it worked again for a few months. Now it works intermittently.

I got the white/red/black pair.I am giving this shoe 4 stars instead of 5 because while it has good cushioning in the heel, it is pretty thin under the toes/forefront of the foot. You can feel everything if you are walking on a non-smooth surface.The straps are velcro and quick to open/close, yet secure which is a positive.

James Horner has done a magnificent job of composing such beautiful music. Some of my favorite songs, Farewell, Descent into madness and Alfred, Tristan the Colonol, the Legend. I chose the last track because it cimbines all teh different melodies adn themes throughout the cd. It also fills you with emotion because of it's story."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit more realistical rewiev of the soundtrack","review":"Well, for starters it annonyes me a lot that almost every critic here give the product always five stars. I'm not about to preach for that subject, don't be afraid...As a classic music enthuasist and anyother good music lover, I think this soundtrack definetly doesn't deserve five stars. I must say that I haven't watched the movie, but this is a quite a boring and poor music. It's very classic movie soundtrack with almost played only by violins.The composer of this soundtrack didn't got the courage to try and make something special and unique, and the result is in my opinion a very flat, easygoing and poor classical violin music, with not a single characteristics in it.It's not all so bad as might get the expression from this, but it's a very mediorce. And there are much better soundtracks available to buy, like \\"Braveheart\\" and it's sequel \\"More music from Braveheart\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words Hardly Do Justice to This Music","review":"Absolutely georgeous soundtrack.

The ABF driver was very agreeable about unloading the saw and setting it in my garage. I then was able to unpack it and move it into my basement shop in pieces. The saw was packed very well and arrived in perfect condition. Assembling it was easy, the directions were mostly very clear and easy to follow. I made my own mobile base and assembled the saw on the base so I wouldn't have to lift it more than once. I was apprehensive beforehand about ordering such a big heavy tool, but my experience could not have been better. I also recently purchased a jointer at my local home center, and I wish I had just ordered the Delta from Amazon instead. I bet I would have had an easier time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 300 lb Coat Rack?","review":"Quickly, I expected more for nearly a grand. The table isn't flat, it's nearly impossible to get the blade to run vertically (if it's centered on the top wheel, it's off on the bottom and vice versa), no matter what I do there's still a very slight grinding sound, dust collection is wholly ineffective and the cheap steel stand isn't sturdy enough to control vibration. And don't forget, this baby comes ala carte...you need to buy a fence (budget another $100 for a disappointing aluminum Delta fence that doesn't adjust enough to compensate for blade drift). On the plus side, the motor has plenty of power and the blade tensioning device is very handy. I guess the real acid test is that I only turn to this tool when I can't make the cut another way. I guess that says it all. I should have spent a few hundred more and bought a Laguna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheels not in plane","review":"Delta tools have really gone down hill. I've had this saw for over a year now and while it is adequately powered, the drive wheels are not in plane. In other words, the blade does not run in the center of the upper wheel when it is centered on the lower drive wheel. Instead, it runs on the front. This causes the blade to come off the wheel alot and that destroys blades. There is not enough adjustment on the alignment mechanism to get it to even run on the center of the top wheel because it binds against the cover. This seems to be a common problem with this saw, as other reviews mention it. It's like there is a washer/space missing. Wish I had my old 16\\" Delta back that was 20+ years old. Summarily, don't buy this saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts Mess with Amazon order 28-475X","review":"I ordered the bandsaw via internet on March 11,2005. When it arrived it was missing the TABLE! After frequent jerking around by Amazon and Delta, a table was finally ordered on April 5, which arrived around the 24th. I finally had time today to complete assembly only to discover the trunion components that attach to the table are missing. It's Saturday so obviously no one is answering phones, but the message states Delta is consolidating warehouses so no parts orders can be taken until after May 2.Out of curosity I checked the flatness of the table, which is off .03\\" in 18\\" from right front corner to left rear -- so it is marginally useful in any case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delta 28-475","review":"After seeing one example at Acme Rents, I wouldn't buy one. An unknown quantity are cast in China and imported here. I wasn't impressed with the finish of the table as it had an ground edge. I brought a used 28-212.

I ordered anyway to keep my shop \\"pure Delta.\\"I had the saw shipped 3-day Fedex so that it would be delivered by a truck with a lift gate. Total shipping weight was 280 lbs. Take away the 20 lbs of pallet and cardboard, and what's left is 260 lbs of saw, far more than the other review said it was.My other concern from reading the sole review was the flatness of the cast iron table (how can cast iron be out of flat unless it was machined that way or run over by a truck?). My table was as flat as I can measure with my machinist's rule. . . . in no place can I even slide a piece of paper under the edge.Now I'm waiting for the free mobile base to arrive before I assemble the saw, or it will never be moved again.

But I have to confess that von Eckardstein's playing here seems more dutiful than on fire; the latter is what Scriabin requires and there are any number of pianists who can do that -- Horowitz, Hamelin, Kissin come to mind. Von Eckardstein plays all the notes, it's true, but the emotional temperature rarely reaches above medium cool. The Third Sonata is workmanlike only. The Eighth Sonata, here lacking its intensity, seems merely a collection of notes.

If you don't like her chattiness, make a workout mix CD and turn down the volume on the TV. It's more fun to do it to music anyway, and the steps are so basic you don't need to hear the instructions.Most of the steps are repeated throughout the walk. This is good if you're not a dancy, aerobic person but still want a good cardio workout.

Some people find Leslie's \\"chatter\\" slightly annoying, but I find that it becomes encouraging and passes the time faster. Prior to beginning the 2 mile video and now the 3 mile video, I had lost 28 pounds but had hit a plateau. Working with my low fat/ low cal. diet, these walks have drastically spiked my metabolism, improving my results each time I step on the scale! Since beginning the walks a month ago, I have lost an additional 10 pounds and an addition 2 pant sizes (most likely due to the addition of toning exercises found in the videos)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for knee problems","review":"This program is an excellent low impact workout. I have had two knee surgeries, and I can actually use this video! There is no jumping, skipping, or other pain-causing moves, plus, I don't feel as though I get a lesser workout like when I have to modify to a low-impact move!Leslie herself is very annoying, with way too much conversation with others on video, and far too much marketing. That said, I mute my t.v., turn up my favorite songs, and walk away the pounds. I am already feeling results, and prefer this tape to the monotonous treadmill!Also, I only bought the 3 mile, so if I am having a lazy or sore day, I just do less miles!

For me, someone working to become fit, this intermediate level is great. She talks a lot through the whole thing, so if chattiness bothers you, you will probably be bothered. But she comes across as very genuine, so I think of her like a talkative friend. I love the handweights used to give you a fuller workout. Also, Leslie gives you a warm-up that gradually gets you going. I hate tapes that have you jumping around in the first 3 minutes. But make no mistake, if you give it a real effort, you'll be sweating by the end of the tape.

Never in my exercise video experience, have I heard anyone talk so much ... I thought I was going to lose my mind! I was just hoping to get an easier video to do very early in the morning one day a week. There is not one scrap of creativity in this workout, and I can't believe she has millions of these on the market!In all fairness to Leslie Sansone fans, I'm sorry to be so negative, but buyer beware: You might want to mute the sound on this video AT ALL TIMES, and use your own music. I don't believe this video would be \\"appreciated\\" with exercise video users who like Kathy Smith, Karen Voight, and the Firm. This video would NOT be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for beginners","review":"After reading so many rave reviews online, I decided to give the tape a try. I have to say I was extremely disappointed and didn't even make it through the entire tape. Since I wear a heart monitor during all my workouts, I was waiting to see how long it would take to get to my target range; about 15 minutes into the tape (and I was pushing myself as hard as I could), I didn't even break the low end of my range. If you are just starting out, it would be a great, easy workout to try, but I would not recommend it for those who have been working out for a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shut up already!","review":"I'm not even in that great of shape and could march all over this dvd.

I guess if you've never exercised before or do not live a very active lifestyle this tape would be okay. I was given this tape and didn't even break a sweat into the third mile, not to mention I was bored out of my mind. What's with the \\"walk, walk, walk, walk\\" talk! On the positive side this tape is a good start if you have not exercised in a very long time or if you are having a \\"lazy\\" day. Otherwise, go for something that can get your heart rate up. P.S. You are not really walking, you are doing low impact aerobic moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Miles In NO TIME","review":"I didn't expect much from a video that claims to \\"Walk Away The Pounds\\".

Yes, there is regular walking but Leslie has you moving your arms about as well as leg lifts, kicks and side steps to increase that calorie burn. Now I have no excuse not to \\"go for a walk\\".

The cues are very clear and easy to follow. Themusic is non descript but not anoying. The participants in thetape have a variety of body types and are not spandex princesses.Leslie Sansone is a bit chatty on the tape but you can't helpliking her.

My doctor recommended exercise. I love to walk, but wasn't real excited about being on the side of the road in traffic, rain or snow, and really not into being challenged by dogs that don't like walkers.My sister told me about Leslie's 3 mile walking DVD. I bought one. Wow! I'm a senior citizen, and I can really do this! I can keep up with the pace of the music. The moves are managable. Leslie's energetic, easy way of encouraging me, her information about the value of getting large muscle groups involved; getting oxygen all throughout the body and how aerobic exercise keeps the brain healthy all come together to help me feel good about myself.I am certain my use of this workout DVD contributed to my weight loss and improved cholesterol and trigliceride numbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leslie Sansone Walking away the pounds 3 mile","review":"GREAT! work out I love it, it's easy and really works out all your body, would highly recommend to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I Can't Believe I'm Enjoying Working Out\\"","review":"I've had Leslie's 1,2,&3 mile DVDs since March.

I actually look forward to working out and miss it when I don't. I can't believe I said that. It's easy and easy on my knees too. I enjoy the mile markers she uses for motivation. Everyone on the DVD looks happy. I enjoy the health tips she gives for motivation. She encourages you throughout the workout and gives you alternatives if you can't do a certain step. I am in love with this workout series and I can't wait to go home and do the 2 or 3 mile workout tonight. I've kept my weight steady during the holidays by working out almost everyday in December.

This is the one season where the \\"Big Bad\\" was not only a physical threat, but an emotional one as well. While Buffy does save the day in the end, it does come at a heavy price (not to be all melodramatic and cliched, I'm just trying not to give away too much for people who haven't seen this season).Along with the great stories (\\"Lie to Me\\" was my favorite episode of this season, although \\"Surprise\\"/\\"Innocense\\" and the 2-Part season finale \\"The Becoming\\" were great too) we get the introduction of some of the best characters in the Buffy-verse. Ofcourse I'm talking about Spike, Drusilla, and Oz.If you have never seen Buffy before, please do yourself a favor and give it a shot. It is some of the best television out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over all very good .. Where's season 3?","review":"I never really watched Buffy when it first aired, but got into it in reruns on FX. When I bought the first season gift set it was a good time having a marathon and the dialog between Buffy, Willow, Xander, and giles is always hilarious. With the 2nd season it continues as they build their characters and increase the depth of the story lines. The addition of Spike is excellent and he adds a luke perry presense to an already good show. The special features menu is great and gets into the makeup and set design. I also noticed that disc 1 has a more grainy quality then the other discs in the set. Still a good buy for Buffy fans. They need to pump out season 3 alot sooner then 6 months from now, but hey .. what esle could you ask for for x-mas?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Seasons ever","review":"I don't know what about this season, I think shines above the rest but this season overall throughout television history is one of the best. The mixture of drama, comedy and science fiction is great. All the actors and actress this season make you actually feel the emtions of the episode. The way the producers and writers handled social issues especially Buffy losing her virginity was amazing. They showed great craftmenship in the writing. The shows were tight in all manners from writing, acting and special effects. The Spike/Drussilla and then Angelus villians were brillient because it allow Buffy to face certain aspects of her life that was missing in the first season. The Buffy-Angel romance and break up was compelling and very powerful. The music score and soundtrack to the season just added so much to the show. The special features are great especially Josh Whedon's interviews. Any television fan show own this season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween turning...","review":"This episode marks the beginning of some of the best Buffy episodes. It is the introduction of Oz in brilliant form, as well as the introduction of possibilities between Zander & Cordelia (continuing to bring Cordilla more actively into the mix) all amidst a Halloween chaos. The snappy dialogue and quick paced moments are priceless. The use of the costumes and placement of new characters brings out new sides and depth in a brilliant manner. The scooby gang really starts to take shape with new additions and the show really starts to find its rythm and quirky edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"best season","review":"If I could only own one season of buffy it would be this one. The second season is actually what drew me in because it's amazing, the rest of the series is great too but this season is just the best. There's everything you could want, romance, hot guys, funny moments, angst, action, kinda scary moments, and something only Joss Whedon does that I just can't name. I would say what it's about but plenty of other reviews plus the summary already tell you.

Here, the relationship between Buffy and Angel is established and intensified, with one of the best storylines of the season. The best \\"Buffy\\" villians EVER--Spike and Drusilla--are also introduced here, and the show develops the dark tone that will be present throughout the rest of the series, with things getting progressively darker as they go along. All in all, the sophomore year is very different in tone to season 1, but it brilliantly develops what is to come. The Holiday themed episodes (Halloween and Valentine's Day) are funny and clever, while the two-part season ender BECOMING is a true stand-out. This is deliciously addicting television--an awesome season that was snubbed MANY Emmy nominations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I was expecting.","review":"A couple of the disks I think were copies off somebody's computer or something. You could only really tell in the more shadowed scenes, but they looked much akin to those deleted scenes on the special features where they didn't bother touching them up. Kinda disapointed and I may decide to buy a different copy somewhere in the close future.

And the DVD boxed set is an amaxing representaion of that. Superb packaging, great special effects, and cool menus. However, the DVD picture quality on most of the episodes is down right nasty. Some of them, like \\"Inca Mummy Girl\\" are so grainy and dark you have to laugh. Random \\"night\\" scenes are so dark that most of the features in Buffy 's face dissapear. I own some of these same episodes from the VHS release - and the picture quality is TONS better. I have no idea what happened in the transfer. Somebody please fix this for future releases. What's the fun of Angelus when the scenes are so dark and grainy you can't even see the sheen from his leather pants!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly one of the best Buffy seasons ever","review":"In season 1 of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", everything was scary and great, but season 2 takes the show to a brand new level, revealing more plot twists. This season shows that Buffy is not just a teen horror show, but there's plenty of drama. Many of the episodes are hilarious and are also nailbiters. For example when Xnader's love spell backfires on him or the Halloween episode. These are truly originals. The villians at the same time are totally awesome, the crazy, future-telling Drusilla and the malicious Spike.And if this cannot convince you to buy the season two DVD, there are great guest appearances, like John Ritter in the episode \\"Ted\\" or Shane West in \\"Go Fish\\". And don't forget the heartbreaking 2 part season finally!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than VHS picture quality","review":"I'll admit I've only watched the first disc so far but was very dissapointed with the picture quality compared with the first season.

Wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy Season 2","review":"Being a HUGE Buffy fan, i believe that the 2nd season was THE BEST, it was the year Angel turns evil, Spike has a bigger part of the show, and Giles' love Jenny Calander met her doom. I feel that the 2nd season still holds some of the better episodes, like Halloween (where everyone turns into what their Halloween costume is), Whats My Line Pts. 1 and 2 where a new slayer comes to town, mistaking Buffy for a vampire. Innocence(where Angel first turns evil after he and Buffy have sex), I Only Have Eyes For You (this is my favorite episode.. just watch and you will see why!) Becoming Part 2--bring on the tissues --this one REALLY got me! Overall I LOVED season 2 it was my favorite. I highly recommend to any Buffy fan-new or old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YAy buffy!","review":"Even better then the first season, more episodes, more laughs, more tears. Everything is better, including the hair. It is a more exciting season, as well as much sadder. But there is much less useless backflips, which i miss, but still great. It's a season to remember, and has memorable episodes like, \\"Surprise\\", \\"Killed by Death\\" and \\"Becoming\\". Spike and Drusilla are introduced, they are the most intriguing characters to ever appear on the show. Evil, loving, and so careless. If u loved the first season, get the second... now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the three!","review":"The second season of Buffy is my favorite!

Handy fold out holder just like the other two and every episode is a Must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"Television doesn't get better than this (though season three comes rather close, I must admit). If you only buy one season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, let it be this one, and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. This is one of the most well thought out, affecting, heartbreaking, meaningful television seasons. If someone tells you that season six is dark, they're lying - that's just depressing. Season 2 is, in my humble opinion, the darkest season in many respects, but Joss Whedon constructs the story in such a nuanced fashion that the dark aspects are far more subtle. And to those that pay close attention, this can make it much more creepy. Angel's turn to the dark side is by far the coolest arc of the series and without a doubt the most shocking. This is the season with the perfect balance of horror, romance, comedy, and drama, and all the characters are at their absolute best (even when they're at their worst). Don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible video quality.","review":"I love the show. I hate the video quality of this DVD. It looks like it was mastered with a VHS tape or maybe worse. Terrible video quality. Highly disappointing.

Someone said this is the quality it was filmed in, but this is NOT TRUE. I bought the first season here in Germany and the quality is WAY BETTER, especially in dark scenes. I bought the second season in America because i wanted to have a complete set and these sets are much more expensive in Europe, but now i know that it was a very bad decision. The second season is one of the best, but you simply cannot enjoy it with this set. Better go to amazon.de and get the European version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Season only gets better","review":"Continuing the great work that he started with the 12 episodes in the first season, Joss Whedon continues and starts out great with a meaningful story about Buffy dealing with the fact that she came very close to death in her fight with the Master at the end of the first season. This would be tramatic for any teenager, even if she is The Slayer. This launches a great season where Angel turns and two other Slayers are introduced. Full of Drama, snappy one liners, wit, emotion [and comedy] Buffy's sophmore season shines and raises the bar on the great storytelling and character development that happens over the 24 episodes. Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy Fan","review":"I have been a die-hard Buffy fan since it began in 1997. Season 2 was a really good season. The season shows you how Buffy and Angel's romance developed. You won't want to miss \\"Becoming, Part 1\\" and \\"Becoming, Part 2\\". Season 2 is also the season when Willow kind of gets over Xander and hooks up with Oz who I wish they would bring back. Seth Green is such a cutie. Anyway, if you have'nt picked up Season 1, do it and if you have'nt picked up Season 2 yet, do it. You won't regret it. I can't wait to add Season 3 to my collection. That season introduces Faith who really gave Buffy a run for her money."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Passion (spoilers below)","review":"The second season of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" is undoubtedly the best season of the long running television program. The script increases Buffy's involvement in her love life, revealing the dangers of her passion for Angel. The emotions and reactions to the several complicated situations are genuine, displaying what true passion really is.The season also introduces Oz, played by Seth Green (\\"Austin Powers\\", \\"Rat Race\\", \\"Idle Hands\\"), who lights a spark of happiness in Willow's lonely heart. His role adds to the complication of the plotline, making him one of the most memorable characters on the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good show-Bad discs","review":"I like the show, so I bought this set.Quite frankly, these are the worst quality DVDs I've ever seen. The brightness level is WAY too low, so the discs are so dark you cannot see whats going on. Also, it would have been nice if they didn't have a second of blackness where the comercials were, haven't they heard of editing? On at least one part, the actor's lips were out of sync with the sound.I was NOT impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show, shoddy packaging, horrible picture quality!!!","review":"I doubt I am the biggest Buffy fan out there, but I am enough of one to shell out a lot of money for a Boxset and in return expect decent picture quality and packaging that won't damage when I drop it on the floor. I have had a heck of a time with two of my Buffy Box sets, mostly the packaging, but I was disgusted to discover the horrible picture quality in episodes like \\"Some Assembly required\\". I personally think that Fox should have their head's examined, thinking they could release Buffy fans this kind of DVD. I was so upset the quality of this DVD that I wrote Fox a big letter complaining about it. If you feel like Buffy fans deserve some respect or your just annoyed by the film transfer, then send a letter Fox's way. I have to imagine that the entire budget for this DVD was spent on the the overly elaborate 3d menu's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is the season where \\"Buffy\\" came into its own. The first season was delightfully campy and had some great eps, but everything didn't exactly flow. In the second season, however, it clicked. The writing was witty and intelligent, the relationships between the characters were hilarious and heartfelt, and of course, the legendary story arc of the season was...well, legendary! There are a few so-so episodes here (\\"Some Assembly Required,\\" \\"Reptile Boy,\\" etc.) but overall the episodes were great. Some of TV's best hours are here, and no one should miss it.

Spike and drusilla, the buffy and angel relationship getting deeper until angels soul is taken away and she must have to kill him, secrets are revealed about Jenny Calendar, and when angel kills her, plus other normal hellmouth issues! this is buffy's hardest battle having to kill the person she loves the most before he kills her and her friends"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Quality Problem","review":"As some people already said, looks like this second season DVD might have some production problems. I opened the box and played the disc 1, it's of course a brand new but often the picture were macroblocked at the specific position, some are even went nearly a black out. And the audio was chopped badly so that I couldn't even follow the story. This happened all over the disc but especially in the episode 2. There is no visible scratch on the disc but I see very huge smear( I don't know if this is the right word for it). I have just seen only one disc but I already decided to claim for the exchange.

The impressive dramatic arcs demonstrated that creator Joss Whedon and company were masters of setting up surprises and convincing us that our characters are in real jeopardy, no easy thing to do on a weekly series. All of the main figures found love this season, and more than one of those affairs ends tragically. It is rare to find such an effective mix of thrills, laughs, and genuinely affecting drama, and the fact that this show sustained its quality for seven seasons makes it rarer still. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT Show, TERRIBLE Quality","review":"I, like other Buffy fans, bought this DVD expecting to watch again the great shows we know and love. This can be done, however the picture quality is so bad, old VHS copies off television are far superior. The video quality of the first season was great why isn't the second season? FOX probably figured we'd all buy it for the content forgetting the quality. \\"Make money off the hardcore fan.\\" For the amount of money this set costs it should be so much better.

I would never order from this seller again because I could not trust what they advertise. The product itself is fine-once we were actually able to view it. It is also a long and involved process to try and get a new one-and I don't want to let this one go before they send me a new one. Once again, it is the issue of trust. They want me to send them this one before they send out a replacement. I believe this is their error and I don't believe they would actually send me a replacement.

It's actually a very good season. All though watching Angel as the \\"Big Bad\\" of the season was disturbing yet enjoyable at times. I especially enjoyed Spike being introduced into the mix as well.

But what is with the horrible digital transfer?? The night scenes are so grainy they look like a low quality VHS tape. The brightness levels are all over the place. Without a doubt, this is the worst quality DVD transfer I've ever seen.While I credit Fox for trying to keep the price down on the DVD set so younger fans can afford it (The X-Files sets are still ludicrously expensive), I honestly have to say if the quality is going to be this bad, I'd rather lay out more money for a better picture.

What good is it if the menus are sharp and dynamic when the shows themselves look like you're watching them on an old TV set that's trying to pull in a decent signal via a bent coat hanger on top of it?

Of the dozens of DVDs and videos I have, the DVD package of \\"Buffy\\"'s 2nd season has by FAR the worst picture quality. Since one of the biggest advantages to DVD technology is improved visual quality, you'd think Mutant Enemy and 20th Century Fox would at least take the time to clean up the image and give us a decent product.

No commercials, but they kept the gaps. Can't anyone figure out how to blend through those frustrating gaps? Fade out to black is uncouth, unless there is a story shift. Gaps aside, I thought the quality of the video was good, even though I had a little trouble reading some of the menu selections. I chalked that up to not wearing my glasses rather than poor background color selection, which may be the real culprit. Sound quality could be a bit better, but Giles' mumbling is part of the script, right?Okay, so I'm addicted to Spike and find it hard to fault his DVD debut and some of his best Buffy performances.

For a person new to UNIX who doesn't have a prefered shell, editor, X client, etc, this would be a decent book to begin with, however for those of us who have those preferences get ready to read about Authors' bias against them.

Hence a purely intellectual insight is not enough, because one knows only the words and not the substance of the thing from the inside.\\"Although Wilcox offers plenty of fascinating intellectual insights, this book is first and foremost a personal account of her experience with Ayahusaca, and it is the autobiographical nature of the book that makes it so engaging.

The writing style is flowery and repetitious and it blends personal narrative with a term paper. The author spends a significant portion of the book quoting other authors. She mentions on more than one occasion that she was an English Lit major, as if that somehow makes one a good writer. It doesn't and the prose nearly made me stop reading. To be fair, her ayahuasca experiences might be of interest to those who plan to spend some time in the jungle drinking the medicine. She pretentiously implies that her experiences are somehow more valid than others because of the diet she maintained before drinking the tea. They seem to be quite normal compared to other experiences I have heard, read, or experienced.My husband couldn't get past the second chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frothy Blog Writing With Little Useful Content","review":"I too feel this is a self indulgent and amateur work that lacks any kind of rigour or frankly much information of any real interest.

However, if this is what you are looking for then this might be the book for you.If you are looking for any kind of in-depth descriptions/discussions about the process or history or usage of the vine then you will probably be disappointed.There is an amateurish attempt at the start of the \\"book\\" (I would say blog) to sound scholarly, but this topic is so clearly out of the author's depth.

I found that Rick's book has taught me to think outside the circle and to be able to put 'effective self defence' back into my art (Tae Kwon Do), most of which has been progressively taken out as some styles of TDK moved to become just sport. Like others, I have some criticisms on the quality of the publication but certainly none on the content.

The heavy gauge wire that runs into the mike, then one short wire for one ear and a too LONG of a wire for your other ear.You turn your head and the short wire pulls the speaker out of your ear.My other gripe, CHEAP SPEAKERS. The speaker with the long wire slowly started to fade and sounded scratchy. The one with the short wire slowly lost it's quality within a 4 hour period. The next day it won't work at all, the speaker is now blown. And the other speaker you can barley hear out of. And I NEVER had the volume turned all the way up.

I have found this true of Broadway Sweat. I like Broadway music and thought this would be a good place to vary my workout. But the tape is CHEESY. The action takes place on a theatre stage with some very colorful characters. Again plenty of stiff and goofy smiling dancers sashay their way to \\"Can We Dance?\\" from The King and I, \\"June is Busting Out All Over\\" and other assorted (and lesser known) Broadway songs. I found the steps VERY hard to keep up with. It is more of a dance tape than a work out. I don't like the Tone Up tape at all (I got them as a package set).

His talent and artistry has stood the test of time.The opening number \\"The Good Life\\" is the definitive version of this tender song. The title song \\"I Wanna Be Around\\" is filled with color and dimension. Tony's vocal timing is impeccable! There is a rather cool jazzy feel in \\"Until I Met You\\". One of the most gorgeous ballads ever recorded is \\"Once Upon A Summertime\\". Among these sweet, mellow songs is an etherical version of \\"Quiet Nights\\". Obviously, not many male contemporary singers could match Mr. Bennett in his prime!A highly recommended experience from a rare singer from a great era.

This show was terrific until the last season, where it looks like crappy writers took over? Once Joel became awol and his personality changed, the show went downhill fast. The final Joel episode was quite good though, with a magical kind of ending, and perhaps the series should have ended there. Not only were Joel's replacement characters boring, but the stories themselves were also not nearly as good as in the previous 5 seasons.I give it 1 star not because season 6 was as bad 1 star shows, but I'm comparing it to the other seasons, which I would rate 4 or 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Own TV Series At A Must Own Price!","review":"What more can really be said about one of the greatest tv series of all time?

There are some interesting things to note, the word Satan is translated as adversary and in Isaiah 14 it uses shining one instead of Lucifer probably for the best :). That's the one thing that always ticked me off about old King James and the Geneva Bible the use of the word Lucifer which created the giant misconception that the story was about a fallen angle and not the King of Babylon.

Young did decent at first, but the bible is very long and it gets less and less literal until it becomes basically identical to the King James translation which is far from literal. There are many phrases in the bible where the meaning can only be classified as \\"uncertain\\". In my opinion, the JPS translation is the most accurate translation available. Unfortunately, like any translation I have ever seen (Young's Literal Translation included), it does bias itself toward a particular train of thought.

The plot quite simply is that a number of former \\"Ladies of the Evening\\" who have married well and successfully are charged to present to society the rather unattractive daughter of their former madam. Written from the vantage point of a typical WASPy New Yorker it's amusing enough but when you know the back story, it's a riot. The \\"ladies\\" call on old friends-and former customers-to try and turn a troll into a princess. Whether they make it or not is an element of suspense and the final solution genuinely unexpected.I own this book and am glad to see it available even if in very limited, expensive copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thorough but disconnected","review":"A very thorough discussion of Unix System V implementation.

The signal/noise ratio of this book is quite low. Most of its contents are just slightly commented sVr4 header files (which files by the way you can get for free with a free UnixWare system and not bother about a book). The descriptions of algorighms are short, difficult to follow and sometimes self-contradicting. And between the high-level descriptions of algorithms and low-level header files there is a great gap that makes both these descriptions rather useless. If you look for the description of what's going on inside svr4 then compared to this book the Vahalia's book covers much wider range of systems (including sVr4 and its derivative Solaris), each of them in more detail, has much clearer descriptions, and all that in less volume.

However, because this is simply an amalgamation of a bunch of Firm videos I found it disjointed and hard to follow. Basically, they just offer clips of several Firm workouts. Mind you, these are great leg workouts; however, because they are just clips the workouts were never really designed to be done in this kind of sequence.

Standing Legs is a tough workout but if you watch it first, then do a little at a time -- say 20 minutes of it and work your way up.With 10 workouts with this tape --You WILL have a nice firm bottom, AND thinner thighs with the added bonus of muscle. (No more saddlebags ! ) Trust me.I have the 10 inch step which I do not recommend for everyone, even they don't recommend it for everyone, but if you have the extra cash for a prop and don't have bad knees, go for the FIRM step, otherwise use the Reebok 4-6-8 step.

Take it easy when you first try this workout. You may want to do only one segment at first and eventually add segments until you are able to do the whole tape. Don't be discouraged!

I was very excited to hear that Ryan was releasing a solo project until I actually heard it. The selections are monotonous and lack variety. Ryan simply whines his way through one self-loathing song after another. I will still give him another chance but this CD has been relegated to a toy for my 2 year old. It is VERY difficult to listen to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Nothing","review":"I like twang. I like alt.country. I like singer/songwriters who wear their hearts on their sleeves. But I don't like this. Adams sounds like he is trying very hard to be taken seriously here. But there is no depth or imagination to the run-of-the-mill songs. Adams over-sings throughout, straining for profundity, but more often coming up with bluster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"After hearing \\"To Be Young\\" in the movie Old School, I went out to purchase this album. The problem is none of the other songs have the same tempo or arrangement. There are obvious Dylan influences in the songs, but the songs don't have the muscial quality that Dylan has. Most songs start with voice and sparse guitar only at a slow tempo. At around the two-minute mark the songs seem to actually take some shape. 1 or 2 slow songs like this would be OK, but when there is a stretch of 10 songs in a row all with the same formula, it gets boring and repetitive. I would recommend Dylan's newer albums or even Tom Waits' albums"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I wouldn't bother with this CD which can't hold a candle to Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska Or Uncle Tupelo's March 16-20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Talent","review":"Ryan Adams is an amazing songwriter, period. Forget that he's so prolific that he makes Robert Pollard (Guided By Voices) look like he's sufering from writer's block. The quality of these tunes are simply startling! Paired with Adams' aching vocal delivery and sympathetic backing from a crack band, and you have a real winner. The only thing that is keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the mix. Frequently, the levels are such that it sounds like Adams is singing a capella, particularlly during some of the quieter numbers, the levels of the backing instruments desperately need to come up."},{"rating":"2","title":"America","review":"In Heartbreaker, Ryan Adams makes his first and most lasting contribution. The first studio album to follow his tenure with alt-country rockers Whiskeytown, Heartbreaker sees Adams pairing with producer Ethan Johns (the first of several such collaborations) and enjoying considerable musical contributions from the likes of Gillian Welch, David Rawlings and Emmylou Harris, among others. The result is stunning, beginning with the first listen and continuing seemingly indefinitely thereafter. Multiple songs from this album received considerable attention in both the music and film worlds, in the way of covers and soundtracks respectively, further compounding the fame Adams was due, regardless of whether anyone ever bought the album or not. Heartbreaker is not just a post-Whiskeytown effort. Heartbreaker is not even alt-country. It is Ryan Adams' definitive contribution to American music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"When first learning of Ryan's departure from Whiskeytown, I was extremely disappointed. I thought the enjoyment I got from Jacksonville Skyline and Carol Lynn, just to name a few of Whiskeytown's hits, would be over. Ryan's obvious lyrical talent is shown on this cd. His guitar play varies in many songs, but for the most part it is kept upbeat, with a few slow songs. This album was such a nice start to Ryan's solo career, although I sure wouldn't mind a Whiskeytown reunion. (Hey, I could dream) I think Ryan mixes in a little country style into his rock-like tunes. Overall, this is a must buy for fans of any type of rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of 2000","review":"Ryan Adams, for his first time alone, has turned out a classic. \\"Heartbreaker\\" comes across like an old time live rockabilly record mixed with just the right amount of ballads (or is it vice versa?). Songs like \\"Winding Wheel\\" and \\"Come Pick Me Up\\" have that wonderful high and lonesome sound that is missing from what the industry calls \\"Country\\" now. Adams isn't the best lyricist in the world, and a lot of his songs sound like he was filling in the blanks of a MadLibs (remember those?) for songwriters sheet then sang it. The melodies he writes more than make up for some of the lackluster lyrical quality though. There are some great potential hits here, but the lyrics need to be a little more polished."},{"rating":"2","title":"instant classic","review":"Honestly, this album is a masterpiece. While it may seem a bit premature, I heartily argue that it stands as one of the great hundred records of rock and roll. This kind of gift for songwriting comes so rarely...this record should be celebrated alongside Blood on the Tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the best","review":"There is nothing better musically than an artist who actually writes most of, if not all of his songs. If you like Dylan, Croce, Baez, Loeb; this type of what I call folk music then you will love this cd. My absolute favorite is IN MY TIME OF NEED, the song seems to be about a farmer and his struggles; but it delves into so much more, it expresses a love for another, it expresses what one feels for another, it expresses what one will do for another. Go ahead, give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's no Hick'ry Hawkins","review":"This CD is nowhere near The Hell I am by Hick'ry Hawkins. If you wnat true alt country, listen to Hick'ry.

Sure it's got a bit of a twang in parts, but so did Gram. Buy this CD! I can't get these songs out of my head. Beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"Heartbreaker is Ryan Adams' best album yet. With songs like \\"In My Time of Need,\\" \\"Come Pick Me Up,\\" \\"Oh My Sweet Carolinia,\\" and many others theis album really speaks. Yes, it has a more mellow or quiter sound than his more recent albums, but thats because he's sold out somewhat. This album has a tremendous sound to it and is his best out of his solo career. It's the kind of album you'd listen to on the ride back home fron your girlfriends house at 2 o'clock in the morning. If youy like Heartbreaker, buy Whiskeytown's Pnuemonia. Whiskeytown is Adams' old band."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great cd","review":"I first bought \\"Gold\\" in the fall of 2001 and I really enjoyed that cd so I decided to try \\"Heartbreaker\\". Also, I had read in one of my music magazines that Elton John was really endorsing this cd which got me more interested. I must have listened to this cd about a dozen times the first week I bought it. Every single track is really good but the standouts are \\"Come Pick Me Up\\" and \\"Oh My Sweet Carolina\\". Its been a long time since I heard a cd this great. Yes, this cd is mellow with the exception of a couple of rocking tracks but the acoustic guitar and Ryan Adams distinct yet heartfelt voice seem to match well together. The production on this cd is a lot more raw then \\"Gold\\" but I think thats what makes this album unique and wonderful. This is a great cd to listen to on headphones when you just want to chill out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic?","review":"Seems most like to refer to \\"Heartbreaker\\" as his masterpiece, and while I tend to like \\"Love Is Hell\\" and \\"Cold Roses\\" a hair more, this is in my top three. Being his first solo album after he ended Whiskeytown, this naturally sounds like that band more than his later albums do. It's all alt-country here. After the intro track, this starts out rocking with \\"To Be Young (is to be sad, is to be high), then quickly mellows for most of the rest. Many of these are what I consider to be quality sad songs, if not lyrically, then musically. The first half of \\"Heartbreaker\\" I find the strongest, and a few songs are really slow, but the whole thing holds up well. There's no doubt this guy can write a good song. Again, this might not be the first Ryan Adams album I reach for, but It'll always remain in my vinyl collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dully disguising derivative","review":"Yes, there is usually an air of disingenuous sincerity present in Adams' aesthetic pursuits of gritty country-rock, but that does not take away from his unique pop songwriting talents to help raise the songs higher. In fact, it is when Adams completely abandons any preconceived notions of \\"authenticity\\" and simply follows the melody with conviction that he often records his best work. With Heartbreaker, the overworking artist is nearly in full-on Dylan acoustic mode though, mainly drawing generically unimpressive results, with truly memorable passages such as the chorus of \\"Come Pick Me Up\\" being a rarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too downbeat","review":"I seem to be in the minority but I find this album unlistenable.I've listened to it about 10 times but I just cant get into it.I much prefer the last Whiskeytown album Pnuemonia."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very timeless CD.","review":"Ryan Adams is all of the great songwriters, Elton John, Dylan, Willie Nelson, etc. put in a blender and out comes this beautiful piece of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"this dude's the real deal","review":"Ryan Adams not only writes a heartbraking song, he sings it with unrestrained melancholy and beauty. \\"Call me when you get back home, cause I miss you. I just wanna die without you.\\" Sure Britney Spears coulda sung that line, but Ryan Adams sings it and makes us all remember when we the feeling was all too real. This record feels like it was tossed off in a matter of hours--that it's also brilliant is a mark of a darn good musician. Buy it right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ryan's Swan Song thus far","review":"Ryan Adams is not God. He's not even a genius. He's prolific. He writes millions of songs, and does not leave anything left over for waste. This is reason why his albums are so long, this one included. That being said, this is the best of his long winded solo work. I could complain, but the music is too good to."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's amazing he USED to sound like this.","review":"This album, along with Pneumonia, are Ryan Adams' two best accomplishments. Heartbreaker is one of the reasons alternative country is so popular today. The album does run a little long, and his best work is on the first half of the album. However, this barely takes away from its quality. My favorite songs on the album (if you're interested) are \\"Winding Wheel\\" and \\"Come Pick Me Up.\\"It's unfortunate that Ryan Adams' new albums are such rubbish. I guess some artists who \\"have it\\" can just \\"lose it.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album to live inside in","review":"I bought this album after I bought and loved \\"Gold.\\" I was expecting another batch of \\"Answering Bells\\" or \\"Rescue Girls\\", but I was surprised to find such beautiful songs. This was the album that got me to fall in love with his words and you will certainly live in this album for weeks. Some of the best are \\"Call Me on Your Way Back Home\\" and \\"AMY.\\" Buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALT. COUNTRY CLASSIC","review":"Ryan Adams first solo album after the breaking up of Whiskeytown is also his best IMO. The songs are very Whiskeytown orientated in there sound and the lyrics are as beautiful as ever. Near the end of the album there are some harder songs but this record is very mellow. Emmylou Harris also does background guest vocals on a classic song from this album. Favorites include To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High), My Winding Wheel, Oh My Sweet Carolina with Emmylou Harris, Call Me on Your Way Back Home, Damn, Sam (I Love a Woman That Rains), To Be the One, Shakedown on 9th Street, In My Time of Need, and Sweet Lil Gal (23rd/1st). Highly Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Ryan Adams","review":"With moments of heart wrenching brilliance and fun country pop as well. I have all of the solo cds and this one definitely stands high above the others. It is less polished and \\"radio-friendly\\" than \\"Gold\\", and more cohesive and even than the collected tracks on \\"Demolition.\\" This was his first and in my opinion best solo work. It includes the incredibly mournful \\"winding wheel\\" and a great duet with the perfect Emmylou Harris, \\"My Sweet Carolina.\\"If you love Bob Dylan, Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, and the \\"alternative country\\" stylings of Gillian Welch and David Rawlings (who's guest spot on this cd could be the key to the sound), you are sure to highly enjoy this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"pollished? yes, but still corrosive!","review":"c.o.c. is one of the few hardcore bands that didn't crossover in the 80s but after 89s barley listenable \\"technocricy\\" they had to do somthing .\\"blind\\" is one of my favorite c.o.c. albums .it was the tinkering w/ what would become their sound today.karl agell gets a bad rap for his lean toward a mainstream vocal style ,but its no more mainstream than what phil from pantera & kyle from exhorder were doing at the time.i personally love it.it fits the music.the entire cd jams from beggining to end but i must say the highlights are tacks 9 \\"vote w/ a bullet\\" (pepper keenan on lead vox) & 10 \\"great purification\\" an anthem w/ some trance elements. i highly recommend \\"blind\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"It's like listening to rock and roll.

But for those who would want to dig dipper into how to analyse trends and fundamentals, there's a need to read on some other books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not serious at all","review":"The book is in a very bad condition, outside and inside, as if it was found in the street or in the garbage. Beside, it dates back to 2002, meaning it is too old in terms of publication. I haven't even touch it, because it may be polluted or contaminated.This is disgusting"},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey with Elizabeth Wingate","review":"I picked this book up for lack of something else to read, four days later, I smiled as I read the last sentence. I struggled in the beginning to get into the story, it was monotonous and seemed to be the fictitious equivalent of a history book, but I continued...for as I said, I had nothing better to read. Though the writing style may seem dull, and in the beginning casts that shadow over the story itself... Elizabeth, her family and friends, become real. Not only do you experience the lives they live, but you also receive an amazingly clear picture of what our world was! Perhaps, I have left this review incomplete...in fact, I am sure I have. There are many more things I could say...about Elizabeth's soul-searching, about Jennifer's indecision, which walks hand in hand with ambition, to Charles's hidden self. However, instead, I will tell you that this book touched me, opened my eyes to many new ideas and truths and sparked an interest in the world around me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lost semi-precious gem","review":"I found this book left behind by somebody years ago at the Waldorf-Astoria in NYC. Its a nice read: a multi-generational story of one Elizabeth Wingate, her parents, and her progeny. It traverses the British Empire from colonial India to the lost colony of America and eventually ends up in nearly modern California. I kept waiting for something dramatic, some epiphany, but in the end, its simply the story of a life and its tangents. The book is well-written and enjoyable but I think there's a reason I've never heard of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Akro-Mils 37686 Tote","review":"By far the best solid, strong, and durable tote I ever bought, an outstanding product that I would purchase again.Do not hesitate to buy this tote; you will be impressed by its quality..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unfortunate Purchase","review":"This is easily the worst \\"political philosophy\\" science fiction I recall having read. Even though I love other conservative authors (Heinlein, Drake, RIngo's early novels, the new stuff is crap), I have to say Kratman is a frightening ideologue. His characters are weak, his writing an embarassment to lawyers everywhere and his rather sick character sketches show a frighteningly twisted mind. Bill CLinton is imprisoned and raped to death, Hillary Clinton is a lesbian murderer, Kerry likes \\"thin teenage girls\\" and Kennedy likes \\"fat teenage boys.\\" And this is in the first 50 pages. Don't buy this book. signed [a gun-owning registered republican]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I love Ringo, Drake and Weber, so I was an easy mark for this book. I could even take Weber collaborator Steve White's novel with its Communist, pedophile murderer as a protagonist, because the book was readable, even if the villain was laughably cardboard. But this one is totally unreadable, and not as you might guess from other reviews, just because of the politics. The writing is so bad it is a total waste of money. Give it a miss and reread classic Heinlein while waiting for a new Weber or Drake book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was a satire....","review":"I thought this book was an over-the-top satire along the lines of Norman Spinrad's satire THE IRON FIST (an example of how Hitler would have written an 1930s science-fiction novel), complete with cardboard characters, B-movie violence, and foam-at-the-mouth political rantings, until I realized that the author was serious. My advice: write the author and ask for your money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont even call this Sci Fi","review":"This book is so stereo typed and over the top, that the only thing it could be considered is political satire. It is so poorly written that I have removed anything else written by Kratman from my wish list. Especially after previewing his next book at Baen's web site. He is so far right wing in these books, that he is beyond the fringe.I have no problem with the sci fi concept of suspending disbelief, bu he goes too far to be credibly considered a Sci Fi writer.I've been an avid Sci Fi reader since the late 50's, and have a book collection that is beyond 5000 titles that I have kept thru 4 moves. This is the first title I intend to not keep. He is an embarrassment to Heinlein, Leinster, Reynolds and Norton. He even makes the Gor novels, especially the later books seem almost mainstream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable; can I award negative stars?","review":"In a lifetime filled with more than a book per day, there have been only a handful whose writing was *so* appalling as to almost physically repel me. This piece of barely-literate junk now heads that pile - the only book for which I've ever demanded a refund!Yeah, the politics are crude well past the point of idiocy, but that's a minor sin compared to the total absence of any trace of writing ability, plot interest, characterisation... I could go on, but the point should be clear. And I am fine with right-wing, military SF - although as others have noted, this is not even SF. It's - well, it's just tripe, basically.Baen's recent offerings in this genre have been good to excellent - Ringo, Williamson are closest but also the more established Weber, Drake and so on. This? Is an aberration. Bleagh.[However, I *do* need to give kudos to the Baen folk for superb handling of the irate note I sent to them. Well done, folks; this book is unworthy of you.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this thing published","review":"I gave up in somewhat less than a hundred pages. I should have quit reading sooner but it had a sort of grim fascination like a train wreck. You keep thinking that it could not possibly get any worse only to be repeatedly proven wrong. The previous reviews tell why. Only a right wing nut would be willing to put up with the wretched thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Texas-Israeli War ring a bell, anyone?","review":"It's for sale right here on this site, and it contains the only interesting elements of this \\"novel\\". This is political screed...read the prologue, if you can continue, then you get what you deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it is printed on","review":"I bought this book because I read Watch on the Rhine and thought that was an enjoyable read. This book was just absolutely horrible. The politics offended me at every level. In addition, the characters were all cardboard and stereotypic. The sexism and rascism in the author's beliefs were hard to disguise. I will never buy another book by this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"To the Right of the Tea Party","review":"Unless you are slightly to the right of the Tea Party you will find this book unreadable. It is written like the worst nightmare of all of the right wing conspiracy theorists. If you are a moderate or even slightly to the left Mr. Kratman's book reads like Republican party election year propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"This is a Bad Book.It is Badly Written; it almost reads as if English is the author's second language and not all that well learned, at that.This would be okay if it had an interesting plot (it doesn't) or effectively delivered its political message (Doesn't do that, either.)As a story it is improbable in the extreme and ludicrously overwritten, relying heavily on thinly-disguised caricatures of people Hillary Clinton and Janet Reno, and the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents, and more than a touch of homophobia.Not worth the time or the money; if you want a book which espouses these politics, try L. Neil Smith's \\"Win Bear\\" books, which express much the same political view and are rather better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Right-Wing Drivel","review":"The author exposes his strong right wing views on nearly every page. The newly elected President in 2009 (obviously Hilary Clinton) is a lesbian, who beds her lesbian lover (who is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) in the Oval Office...The Secret Service is like Hitler's SS, with mechanized troops, the Surgeon General has her own armed forces in order to enforce abortion rights, weapons and ammunition are heavily taxed and registered, teachers are \\"reeducated\\" unless they have the proper liberal views, etc.Nearly every Rush Limbaugh\\\\Ann Coulter \\"fantasy\\" is trotted out during the course of this book. This is too bad, because the author obviously is familiar with the military (the Army in particular), and the idea of a modern civil war could have been intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-the-Top Hate Mongering","review":"Let me start off by pointing out that I am a big fan of science fiction and military SF in general, so I was really looking forward to this book. However, I could not make it past the first chapter. The author goes out of his way to push every ultra-right-wing button he can come up with. No subtlety here. The newly elected president is a black, gay female with a secret agenda to become the permanent ruler of America by creating a Gestapo-like police force. This was a complete waste of my time and I only read one chapter before returning it. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Clunky Read","review":"Baen's offerings these days are bit like the curate's egg. And I'm sorry to say that A State of Disobedience is not amongst the good parts. This MilSF novel is a vehicle for a slew of reactionary kneejerks, centered on a less than two-dimensional rabid lesbian Hillary Clinton knockoff and her cabal of homosexuals pollutin the Murrican bodily fluids, or whatever, a unimaginative reenactment of Waco and the usual blood'n'guts battle scenes. Now that would be ok for the usual airport page turner. The clunky prose, the execrable dialog and the all too transparent desire to get back at \\"Hillary, Janet and Lon\\" make this book a case for a speedy trip to the used book store. I'll rather take my political propaganda neat, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for thought","review":"A fascinating look into a dark future. A future where today's political divisiveness and polarization come to a titanic impasse.The author raises weighty issues that revolve around constitutional law, individual rights, and power of the state as they impact \\"the little guy,\\" and ultimately the future of the entire republic.This is certainly not a work for the politically thin-skinned, especially for people who are far-left of center. For everyone else, this book is a thought provoking treatise on human nature and the abuse of absolute power.A must read for fans of action, political intrigue, and gut-wrenching suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"If you want a better-written, over-the-top, libertarian condemnation of the Clintons, from Baen, in a near-future scenario, try Last Centurion. Although that author also has bizarre opinions of people who disagree with him, he is better at putting it on paper. Both authors use in their scenarios a thinly-disguised President Hillary Clinton as a villan, but this guy opens the book up with her as a lesbian more-totalitarian Hugo Chavez type. And when it comes to second American Revolution tales from Baen, there was a better one from many years back called (I think) First Citizen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burst open after having it for 4 days!","review":"This wrist cushion burst open after I had it 4 days, and the little pellets were leaking out.

I also quit smoking 2 years ago, and have put on about 20 unwanted pounds. The gym was too hard to get to, and walking alone at night was out of the question. A friend at work recommended these tapes, so I bought them. I have been more than pleased. Walking in my home, on MY schedule is wonderful. The music is just right and the group on the tape with Leslie helps keep me going. In the 2 weeks I've been using these tapes (every day), I already feel so much better. They are definitely just what I needed to put me on the road to better health and weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great","review":"I have been pretty non-active for the past twelve months due to a serious spinal injury. I decided it was time to get off my butt and bought this tape...I am glad I did. I was able to keep the pace and get my heart rate going without too much drama.

It's not very demanding and there's so much chatter you get to the point you'd rather turn the sound off then listen one more time. That's Leslie's biggest problem.

I feel incredible and I am happy to say that I have lost 12 pounds!Leslie uses simple movements that are very effective.

From the obvious symbolism of the two smoke stacks towering over the two young men meeting to the grainy, pseudo-documentary footage, this movie is irritating from the get go. Don't let the cover fool you, as it did me. That image comes about three times in the movie and means almost nothing. Don't waste your time and money on this one.

The video is supposed to be about Great Lake Shipwreaks, but only discussed two wrecks that somehow involved the same cook on both. About 35 minutes were on one wreck, and the remaining 10 minutes was on the other wreck. Seems to me the title of this should have been more specific and indicated something like the cook of two Great Lakes Shipwrecks. Was the video interesting? Well to some degree. I was expecting an abbreviated history of the shipwrecks from the Griffin to the Fitzgerald, or something like that.

Being a guy, I've never done any of the Firm series before, but I guess most of them are similar to this one.The sets, music, production values and demeanor of the hosts are hilariously cheesy, like Sheena Easton doing a Cinemax \\"adult\\" film. I honestly had to quit my first workout because I was laughing too hard.However, this is a VERY serious ab workout, especially for a man who's got some muscle (and therefore some weight) in his legs. These things make me hurt in a really good way. The single tape has five different routines, so I can't imagine them getting boring. I cycle between this and 8 Minute Abs, and find them to be a great combination.You won't lose fat with this tape (or with any other ab workout alone), but you will certainly shape your stomach nicely. Great value, both exercise- and humor-wise, for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the beginner","review":"I am glad I've worked out with Tamilee Webb before doing this Firm video.

UGH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"challenging but you will get results fast","review":"i like this tape. as much as i groan complain during the workout i have been doing this one for about 3 weeks now and notice great results. the guy is stupid, disregard his left/right leg instructions. just follow the instructors and you will be just fine. i would have given it 5 stars if they had gotten someone else as a 'host' for this program. some of the music is not great, either, but all in all this program will give you stronger abdominals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointing","review":"I found this book to be full of errors in grammar, spelling, typesetting and punctuation which made it very difficult and tedious to even finish. The reader will find every story to be almost exactly the same. The writing style is that of a junior high student.

Promoting their lifestlye(smokin pot, freedom ect. ect.) Because of their stances which stand quite far from our government's actual laws today of course they will stir up controversy. Old school KMK fans might be disapointed by the \\"mainstream-type\\" sound, but if you listen to their lyrics I think you will agree they will never be mainstream because they never plan to conform to mainstream standards. If they are put in the mainstream, as long as their message reminds true(and the same), I see it as them conforming the mainstream to them. Still rappin about legalizing freedom because freedom is still illegal makes perfect sense, and I hope these guys have as big of an impact on everyone else's life, as it did on mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally not kmk's best","review":"i read on kmk's website that this was going to be their BEST album yet... so i was pretty pumped for it to come, but i was totally dissappointed once i listened. they seem to have completely changes their sound. i miss the old kmk like \\"high society\\" and even \\"hidden stash 2\\". it sounds to me like their are trying too hard to be ghetto fabulous. what happened to singing about livin in the suburbs and smokin out witcha friends? remember, your p-town ballers, not gangsta gangsta."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite KMK album","review":"I have been a KMK fan for about seven years now, and I own all their albums. This one is pretty mediocre, in my opinion. There are three or four pretty good tracks, but the rest sound too similar and run together.

KMK albums I recommend are Hidden Stash II, Cloud Nine, Rollin Stoned, and Koast II Koast."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I cant believe that these guys are still around I figured they would have broken up after the first album. seriously how many albums can you release with the same lame lyrics about smokin pot and how much you hate the government.

As far as this album goes this is one of the weakest most watered down attempts I have ever heard. the music sounds like a bunch of fake gangsta wannabe white boys trying really hard to sound like little john and the east side boys.

I love to walk outdoors but I live in a very hot climate. This video makes it possible for me to do my walking in the comfort of my home. My 4 year old loves to go along with the tape also! I am looking forward to getting Leslie's newest tape, the hour-long 4 mile walk. Her chattiness doesn't bother me at all, although some viewers may not like that.

Don't let this fool you tho -- this is a great, high-energy workout! Leslie is perky, but not too annoying, & her moves will get your heart pumping.

I loved it so much that I went out the same day and bought the 2 and 3 mile tapes. The first day, I did both the 1 and the 2 mile. And best of all, I had fun!

I find the reviewer's opinion that Tony Bennett's rendition of White Christmas surpasses Bing Crosby's borders on the sacrilegious. In short I consider that Bing Crosby is a singer while Tony Bennett talks musically.

Is his solo-album going to be even half as good as Fate-recordings, I wondered. Well, no problem: This is great one (and fortunately Tony hasn't done nu-metal), maybe because this sounds similar to Mercyful Fate; mixing black metal, horror-rock (lyrics) and tuneful melodies Tony has done one of the heaviest albums of the year.

I recommend this movie to everyone who like good music, singing, dancing, and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, fantastic movie for kids and adults","review":"I think we've watched this movie over a dozen times now and just never get tired of it. In these days where there are so many things you don't want your kids to see, Disney came out with a real winner. The kids and I couldn't wait for it to show on TV. My daughter sings the songs with her friends everyday. I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to do so. The singing and character interactions are terrific and the movie has lots of great messages to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Gets Old!!!!","review":"Ever since I watched the first showing of HSM, I couldn't get the songs out of my head, and I watched it the whole weekend. Right now, I've watched HSM about 8 times now! That's how adictting it is! I'm 14 soon 15 and I can't get enough of it. And I'm also a boy, so this is one of the first movies I can watch without waiting for violence. I mean, I usually watch Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings but this movie is amazing!

I couldn't warm up to this movie if we were cremated together. They say it's a family movie but its superficiality, immodestey, and its ultimate nacho-like cheesiness make it totally innaproppiate for children... As a matter of fact, it's totally inappropiate for adults... In fact, as a good Christian cat-owner, I found I had to cover my little kitty's eyes for a few rather long parts (that is before I banished him from the room completely). This book was interesting to a point, the point of departure. The actors are about as good as a fresh-frozen stail of asparagus. Disney also has promising singers, they should promise to stop singing. This movie was so girly I swear the characters probably wallpaper the insides of their refridgerators. Do me a favor and burn this dvd. Save me and the other 99% of the human population misery by burning this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gets so ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!","review":"It shows on Disney Channel all the time.When I go to school or my day care they play it all the time on the CD player.My mom is thinking of buying the DVD.That's not a good thing.My best friend Morgan doesn't like it either.At her school they play over and over and over also.High School Musical is annoying and if you are a first timer than you it will get annoying trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE IS EVERY BAD THING I CAN SAY!!!!!!!!!","review":"Why would you do this to anyone?

Long after the movie has finished there is the CD of the film's unmemorable soundtrack which can only lead to the sequels (2 of them at this writing.) and the ripoffs.

Thought this movie would be similar. Instead, incredibly boring. Plastic people. Just evaluate each character as you see them: if great looking (a 10), then character is a good guy/gal; if not, then an non-entity or a bad guy/gal.Have NEVER given eval anywhere re: a movie, & probably only giving this one b/c I was stupid enough to order HSM & HSM2 from Amazon at same time. After seeing HSM, knew a BIG mistake. Watching HSM2 right now, & I rest my case.NO IDEA how popular these movies were when released, but if popular, SCARY.No individuality re: characters. All PLASTIC stereotypes. Boring. Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soylent Dick Says: Apallingly bland movie with dreadful music","review":"I would have thought that the whole point of 'High School Musical' would be the music.Well, as a trained musician, and one who has written my own material, and directed high school musicals, I have to say that the music in HSM was WOEFUL!!!! Whoever wrote these numbers has no talent for writing tunes whatsoever, or (more concerning), they were under instructions to write the most bland, innane trash they could think of.The fact that so many people thought it was great, is of real concern. It shows the inability of so many people to recognize the difference between good and bad music (and these people are allowed to vote!). To some extent this is a matter of taste, but I do not know any trained musicians who would say anything good about HSM.The acting and the story followed a similar vein - all reflective of the Disney factory which produces an idealistic, squeaky-clean world of prestine beauty which doesn't exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great except for Vanessa Hudgens...","review":"Why does Vanessa Hudgens (Gabriella) always smile when she's acting, like she's uncomfortable? Reminds me of Bush giving his speeches. Everyone else is great, especially Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale), but Vanessa Hudgens destroys most of the movie with her weak vocals and even weaker acting.They should've cast Vanessa as the girl who stayed home with mononucleosis while a better acress was cast as Gabriella."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I cannot figure out how Disney is still in business, considering its complete downward spiral into creative bankruptcy -- much less how this sad movie managed to spread in popularity like it has, virus-like. This is the nothing more than the sort of useless, talentless pabulum that Disney's team of shackled-down writers now hack out on a regular basis so that their soulless overseer will feed them.What happened to my Disney -- the Disney who made Beauty and the Beast, and The Lion King, and Aladdin?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves this movie","review":"My 7 yearold daughter loved this movie.

They are going to start working on the sequel the end of this year or beginning of next year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"This movie is definitely a guilty pleasure for me. The movie is kind of cheesy and the singing isn't all that great, but I can't help but love it, which is surprising because I'm a die hard musical fan. Classics such as White Christmas and The Sound of Music rank high on my list of favorite movies. I really don't know what it is about this movie though, once it starts I'm hooked for the next hour and a half. It's a movie people of all ages can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do they really sing?","review":"I need a little help over here!I know it might sound stupid, but I what to know if are the actors who really sing or if their voices are manipulated with the computer?If someone got a clue on this, please let me know!Thanks,Malena"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why the terrorists hate us","review":"Perhaps the only thing impressive at all about this musical is the fact that it has proved to be so monumentally successful despite being little more than an over-hyped Disney TV movie. Financed with Old Man Walt's Nazi gold, High School Musical takes formulaic trash to a new level of mediocrity. It was the smash hit that was never supposed to happen, a straight-to-DVD exercise in tween-sploitation that got blown out of proportion by ironic hipsters. Thanks to them, this piece of forgettable pap became 'cult viewing', and soon enough everyone was riding the bandwagon, and apparently forgot that it was all a sick joke concocted by studio executives, the Internet and Satan. The overwhelming success of High School Musical is a testament to the unforgivable folly of mankind, and for this reason alone the very thought of it chills me to my core. I mean, there's a character called Sharpay! Sharpay! I weep for this generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still can't understand what is so \\"awesome\\" about this movie","review":"When High School Musical first came out, I didn't really care to see it because it just didn't seem like a movie I would like. Then a couple months passed, and all I kept hearing about is \\"High School Musical this\\" and \\"High School Musical that.\\" Since there was so much hype about this movie, I decided to see it and give it a chance, just to see what it was like. I guess some of the songs were ok, but I HATED the movie. I still can't understand what all the hype is about. I don't reccomend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walt Disney Keeps Turning In His Coffin","review":"This movie basically gives a retrospective of what Disney has become lately. The movie is definitely marketed to elementary level kids and possibly preteens. The plot is cheap and predictable, it's basically a watered down version of Grease, and it has absolutely nothing to deal with real high school life. The actors blow, but hey, it's Disney, what do you expect? If you've ever watched a Disney Channel movie, they basically regurgitated those types of people. This movie is basically Disney's way of increasing the amount of cash they receive, and it makes me sick. Boycott anything recent that Disney has done, because it lacks value, creativity, and the strength it had decades ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great....","review":"personally, I don't know what it is everyone sees in this movie. To me it's just a cheesy storyline with an obviouse ending. Nuff said.Now, there were some good singers but others were awful in my opinion. Whtas her face (I forget) The girl who plays in zack and Cody has a horrible voice.To me, the songs get really annoying afterwhile. Especially when everyone in your clas is singing it. Yeah, imagine haveing everyone singing \\"were soaring flying..\\" all the time in your school. (especially when they sing really bad too) yeah, you get my point.It was not all bad. This just wasn't a movie for me. Personally I think Disney Channel movies suck. This one wasn't that bad, but I just didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupidly addicting for people","review":"High school musical is stupid. People love it and it is the same as any other disney movie. Everyone only likes it because they like Zac Efron. I am a girl and I hate it. Being \\"crazy\\" for not liking it at school is stupid. All I hear is \\"This movie is the best!\\" or \\"I'm going to marry Zac Efron\\" or \\"I am this movie's number one fan\\". It is an okay movie but too addicting for so many people, especially girls. It is better for people too spread out and I've heard people making a big deal at school if you don't like this movie. It is hurting to get your feelings hurt or even brake your friendships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, the story line was good...","review":"alright I know this is going to effect my reviewer rank but i can't leave this unsaid, I CAN'T STAND DISNEY ANYMORE!!!!

Do not expect to feel changed after leaving the cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE???? This movie is an abomination. It combines the horrible pop music that is destroying our society's art with a horrible array of bad actors and cliche plot points. Its message has been told a million times. Unless you think that the phrase \\"It's okay to be different!\\" is an especially new and invigorating idea, then you will certainly agree that this movie is a load of feces. I got it for my roommate specifically so that I could torture him with its badness. I nearly vomited. And then I get on here and see people giving it GOOD REVIEWS?

I would definatly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney makes a small budget winner","review":"Made on a small budget, this movie even surpassed Disney's expectations. Sometimes I believe that the adults that make movies forget that kids like the idea of being able to spontaneously break out into song and dance!

Oh... did I mention that my kid loves it too?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific family movie","review":"We rented this movie after hearing and reading good things about it. All were correct.

I LOVED IT!","review":"Given that I am a major GLEEK, it should come as no big surprise that I just LOVE High School Musical. I can tell you first that people just starting to sing out of nowhere, it sorta requires you to pretend a lot, but probly not any more than you do when you watch Spiderman or the X-Men. But just like with Glee, I don't care, cause that's why I'm watching it! I love music! I REALLY think Zac Efron is a major hottie too, so I can't say it is just the tunez that are making me love this movie. I don't really see him as a basketball player tho. He's kinda short. But whatev. I don't mind. :^) Anyways, I really do recommed you check out this movie, especailly if you are a kid. It's really good. And Sharpay (wierd name for a blond girl) gets her just deserts in the end, so that's good. So watch it! And stop by over at fanforum and tell me about it! Later!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN for BOTH Kids and Adults","review":"My kids like this movie alot. I just saw it and, yes, it is a \\"nice story\\" with some decent songs and winsome characters.

And ya know, the dancing ain't bad. But is there a less believable \\"basketball star\\" than Zac Efron? Hey, I'm 58 years old and I could probably beat this guy one on one. The plot may have been simple, but given the target audience (6-10 year olds), it's appropriate that it lacks anything challenging, like irony. Real high school actors hate this movie, or love it because it's so bad. If you've actually seen a well-done high school musical, you understand why: while the villains here are faintly amusing, the less talented principals are strictly baby formula. Swallow it down, kids, and pay no attention to Zac and Vanessa as they laugh their way to the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for all my chidren even teens like it","review":"This reminds me of my obcession with Grease II when I was young.

They're all gonna win all of their stupid things that they have to do like whoever Vanessa Ann Hudgens plays wins her geek compition, Troy wins his basketball game, and they win the audition. I knew what was gonna happen before I saw the movie. I can't see how anyone could like this at all. I feel sorry for all of the people that for some stupid twisted reason have a crush on the guy that plays Troy because he doesn't like girls if you know what I mean. I really hope you know what I mean because I'm not gonna say it right out unless someone gets down on their knees and begs me.

And i can honestly say that most people turned it on for the super hot zac efron, but stayed for the amazing dancing and songs. The actors have amazing voices, and they made this movie perfect for all ages. It had just the right amount of singing, dancing, acting, and romance.

I've listened to the soundtrack at least once a day since I got it from amazon, usually on my way to work because the songs put me in a good mood. I mean, who doesn't want to do one of those cool dance moves in the car when \\"Stick to the Status Quo\\" or \\"We're All in This Together\\" comes on? I do refrain.

And I'm not afraid to admit it that I\\"ve seen this over 6 times with and without my kids. I've taped the show and have had Korokee parties with my kids along with my friends kids. I'm still going to buy the DVD when it comes out, I'm so crazy about this movie. It brings back memories when we all went crazy over a similar movie, GREASE, when we were young.when I first saw the commercials, I knew that this movie was going to be an \\"extreme\\" hit and could not believe our luck that we didn't have to go to the theaters to see it. I was counting the days until premiere day. The dancing, the singing, the music, the storylines, the total package was such a joy to watch. I've also bought the sound track and as another customer has written, it brings a smile and a wonderful feeling when I hear the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love High School Musical","review":"This movie is the best movie Disney Channel made I can't wait to get it. When I first watched it I got in to it a little by the end of the movie I was dancing around like a monkey.I love the songs.I love that they picked Ashley Tisdale off of The Suite Life of Zack & Cody to be Sharpay Evans.If u don't like this movie something is wrong.But that is my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"High School Musical","review":"I looked for this movie every where, no one had it in my neck of the woods.

IT IS AWESOME!p.s Zack Efferon is a HOTTIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grease for the 21st Century!","review":"I'm sure I'm not the only person who has ever said this, but this movie is basically Grease set in the modern era. Troy, the big sports star, loves singing musicals with Gabriella, but his friends and father think that this is taking his head out of the game. They want him to stop singing and to stop being with the girl.But Troy is a good guy and thinks he can do both! The movie is all about encouraging the people in your life to follow their dreams. Be a blessing, not a burden!Also, the movie music is BETTER than Grease! Great stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST PLAIN STUPID","review":"As part of a dare from my friend I sat down and watched this incredibly annoying movie and I enjoyed very little of what appears to cheaply made movie from the once-great Disney. Now there's hardly a Disney movie made nowadays that I enjoy without having the urge to punch myself in the nuts because of how lame they are. This film is only enjoyable for girls, not guys. I don't llike the teenage actors either, because they're pretty damn annoying(And the fact that a lot people I know are betting Zac Efron is gay). There is only one other movie I've watched that makes this film look a masterpiece, and that movie is Happy Feet: the worst movie of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much mush!","review":"I feel that disneychannel has taken the whole musical thing to extremes. I mean when 20th Century came out with 'The Sound of Music' they didn't have DVD'S, T-Shirts, or CD's and it's still considered a classic! Ortega did a great job choreographing/directing, but whoever the writer was didn't do a great job! The movie is terribly romantic and I don't understand why they couldn't get to the point! I mean the movie is called High School Musical, not Gabriella and Troy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Movie","review":"This movie was a very good one. It's not screaming an Oscar Award, but considering that Disney made it, I'd say they did a more than okay job. I wasn't a huge fan of the dancing but the singing and acting was pretty good. Try this movie and see if it's for you. Some people love it, others hate it. It's all on how you look at it. A piece of advice, don't watch this movie if you are wanting to see an amazing film! This is just fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor attempt at a musical","review":"i watched this one day just to see why it was so popular and i have to say it wasn't that great.my musical taste is heavy metal , punk rock and hip-hop. that one song that i think was supposed to be rap \\"get'cha head in the game\\" was pretty darn awful.this pretty awful \\"musical\\" is probably for interest for those teenyboppers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as bad as rotten clam chowder!!!","review":"Disney's laughing all the way to bank with this movie. The plot was so cheesy and predictable I was so bored that I almost did a puzzle while watching/falling asleep during this movie. For everyone who has not yet watched this yet but thinks this is going to be the next new hit I have a challenge. Start HSM at 9 o'clock pm and watch the ENTIRE movie without falling asleep, drifting off, or just getting bored of the movie. (I also might add that for you to complete this challenge you may not blast the volume up so as to not drift off) This plot was fishy from the very beginning. (Or as I should say, rotten clam chowder smelling)"},{"rating":"1","title":"why would anyone in there right ind like this!","review":"THIS IS IN NO WAY EVEN CLOSE TO A REAL DEPICTION OF HIGH SCHOOL! This may be one of the worst movies/telivison movies I have ever seen, heard, and I had to throw up because of it. In a real high school its never at any givin time all happy, joy, joy, like in this pitiful excuse for a movie. WHY ARE THEY SINGING!!! They have 10 times more important things to do like, getting ready for college, getting a girlfriend/boyfriend, or atleast any friends at all! None of the cast in this movie could do any of that IMPORTANT STUFF! Instead they think they can just sing there problems away. YEAH, RIGHT! Singing doesnt get you into college people!

The writers try to make the dialogue witty, funny, and hip, but it really isnt. The songs are really overated and cliche (and Zach Efron doesn't sing it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Fun family movie","review":"I'm really getting a kick out of all the high school kids talking bad about this move. Although the title says \\"High School Musical\\" it was made and intended for kids 6-10. I Have a 5 year old who LOVES it, and as a parent it's fun for us to watch too. The songs are catch, the story is appropriate for children, and it keeps their interest. It's a fun family night movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High School Musical DVD","review":"Very good movie with lots of music and dancing, plus it's good for the whole family to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent explaination of Pointer on C","review":"As before I bought this book I have problems about advance pointer like a pointer to function, array of pointer to function, pointer to structure or other topic like this. The author explain this topic very well.By the way, the purpose of buying this book is to solve reading C language code on embedded linux which involve pointer and hardware. The author do not give enogh information about this topic.However I still rate this book five stars for the topic Pointer on C."},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful book","review":"The book carries through an interesting boarding in relation to the use of some more important resources of the C language, multidimensional arrays and pointers.The comparison that is made between them, as well as the use most appropriate of each one is enlightening.The author also carries through a soon however interesting explanation on the design and implementation of ADTs. At last, the book brings valuable tips and serves as reference for programmers of any level."},{"rating":"2","title":"hardcore C explained clearly","review":"This isn't a run-of-the-mill programming book on C. Things like for loops and do-while loops are common among most modern computer languages. This book doesn't try to re-educate the programmer on those things -- although it does take a deeper look at common C topics. This is a book on the advanced features of the C language especially on topics such as pointers to pointers, pointers to functions, and dynamic memory allocation. The author does a great job explaining these advanced concepts by using simple and clear examples. If you want to roll your own system software or hack an operating system written in C (Unix), arm yourself with this book as your language reference. It will save you time and grief. This book ought to be a de rigueur item on any programmer's bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clears up the sometimes obscure nuances of pointers in C","review":"Great book. It taught me more about pointers in the C language than any other C book I've used. However, it's not just about pointers. It's a good book for learning C in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book for learning C pointers!","review":"If youre struggling with complex pointer operations (as I was) .. get this book. Even if youre not having trouble with them, I'm sure you will learn something from this book. I like how Reek anticipates questions readers will have, then goes on to explain in lucid detail. Excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow to grab the reader!","review":"I am a true Ann Rule fan, having read everything she has written. This book however has left me almost to the point of scanning over the pages waiting to get past more information than is needed. I normally read a book in one or two days depending on how many pages and interruptions. This book though finds me sitting at page 200 and I have been reading it off and on for a week.Most readers of the book would have grasped the controlling nature and style of Tom Cappano way before now. It is a simple case of too much, too strung out information leading up to the actual important story line. It really doesn't take 200 plus pages for the reader to understand how this man manipulated and used women. Very boring thus far.There is no doubt in my mind it will improve when the actual story line comes into play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"Completely shocking cannot even to begin to describe this book. I had to do a report in my English 2 class and this book caught my eye and I'm sure glad it did. When I was introduced to Anne Marie Fahey and her family, I was concerned for her safety, although this being a book about murder, I already knew what was going to happen. Ann Rule writes very well and I commend her excellent effort put into this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Compelling, a page turner","review":"I really enjoyed this book, as I have with all of Ann Rule's. The story moved very very quickly, and I had a hard time putting the book down. Being in the Western United States, all I had heard of this case prior to Ann Rule's book was on the news, or in People or Vanity Fair Magazine. The end was very poignant when we found about about the judge's ruling, and testimony from Anne Marie's brother. I hope the Delaware Dept of Corrections keeps a very short leash on Mr. Capano! Ann Rule's books are always worth reading due to her style and explanations. Coming from Colorado, I can certainly understand all of the negative reviews from the Delaware folk, as we out here have heard about as much as we need to about the Ramsey murder case. I think no matter who wrote about that poor girl, I would have a hard time being objective, as it appears the readers from Delaware are in these Amazon reviews........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann Rule's very best in story development, description.","review":"Having read all of Ann Rule's books, watched her development, can truly say this is her crowning achievement. She has mastered the descriptive art, the ability to place you, the reader, right in the center of the action. Could not put this book down once started: also became personally involved and empathetic with the victim and family. We loved Never Let Her Go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some small measure of justice for Annie","review":"It's a measure of how good this book was that my heart literally aches for Anne Marie Fahey. A private woman and a nice Catholic girl, she was mercilessly dragged through scandal after her death. Ms. Rule makes Annie three-dimensional, which is as it should be. Too often in these books, it's the murderer who is the most memorable character. I also enjoyed the passages about the police work. The cops and detectives are real-life heroes. I'm only sorry that Capano's and McIntyre's kids have to live through these revelations."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious, slow going , endless detail","review":"slow going thruout ; needed better editing; repetitious and too much unnecessary description. I respect the research by author, but that is all; reads like a term paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy is this a bad book!","review":"I thought I had bought an \\"Anne Rice\\" book when I saw this in the book store. That was my first mistake. Then I decided after I got it home, what the heck, I'd read this. That was my second mistake.Is this how how all \\"true crime\\" authors write? I mean I never read this genre because I figured why would I want to read something so sad. In this case, why would I want to read something so bad? So badly written, so badly explained and so unashamedly maudlin.I'll give the author credit. I've never read her stuff and she certainly kept my interest to the end of the book. She gets 1 star for that.But now I realize why I only read fiction. If you want to read or write fiction, then read or write fiction.If you don't have the imagination to write fiction, then please don't write a supposedly \\"true\\" story and cloak it in the veil of fiction.I find that morally repugnant."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a big ole goose egg of a book","review":"This wasn't very good and I wish I hadn't spent any money on it. I'm only writing this to warn off objective readers. I know Ms. Rule has legions of fans and they'll probably buy anything she writes. But the rest of us shouldn't be suckered in by the shallow ruminations redundantly deposited on the pages of this book. Buy Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood\\" if you want real good true crime - don't accept any substitutes"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I found the missing boat anchor...it has about 400 pages","review":"Listen, I could have dealt with the endless threads of unnecessary information that seemed to loop back on themselves every twenty pages or so. I also could have overlooked the meandering flow of events that sometimes left me wondering if it was two days after the murder or six years before. But what finally got my goat was Ms. Rule's endless attempts to glamorize Anne Marie Fahey. Hardly a page in this ponderous book can be turned without some reference to Anne Marie's beauty. I even recall one description of a picture of Anne Marie describing her \\"lovely eyes and soft lips.\\" OK..we get it...Anne Marie was hot and Tom Capano was a lecherous slob. Now can we please get on with the story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rule's best book ever!","review":"A brilliant portrayal of the Capano case and of the vulnerable, trusting women who were deceived and then destroyed by this charming, manipulitive man who only cared for himself. A \\"must read\\" book that transends the story itself to speak to women everywhere who have been betrayed by such a man. My highest recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann Marie's vulnerability when confronted by Tom Capano","review":"Ann Rule's book, \\"And Never Let Her Go\\" is an insightful, absorbing, true story of a lovely young and vulnerable woman who was caught up in a relationship with a man who had a horrible dark side, which Ann Marie didn't see or comprehend until it was too late. This true story should touch every woman because we have experienced some of what she experienced, haven't we? Ann Rule's carefully documented story get you totally involved in all of the characters--the family members of Ann Marie Fahey, and those of Tom Capano. Ann Rule has a gift of presenting us with not just the facts, but the interaction and dedication of Ann Marie's family and the attempt of Capano's family to come through this ordeal. Ann Rule gets to the very \\"soul\\" of the story, and thus she truly touches us in a very special way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, as of late, I'm very disappointed with Ann's books","review":"What happened to the Ann Rule who wrote such good books as the Stranger Beside Me and Small Sacrifices? They were well researched and held my attention to the very end. From reading this book, I get the impression Ann attended a few days of the trial, purchased a transcript and found a few people to interview, then wrote her story. BORING, BORING, BORING. There are three other books written on this same case and are by far much better than Ann's. Sorry, but as of late, I have been very disappointed with Ann's last few books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate portrayal of diabolic manipulator","review":"As a resident of the city where Tom Capano and Ann Marie Fahey lived. I attest to the accuracy of this book. Ann Rule's investigative reporting is meticulous, down to the last detail. Her portrayal of the various characters is excellent. A great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As usual, Ann Rule did her research and scored again.","review":"Ann Rule is the best in her field. I followed the Capano case closely and was surprised my some of the non-published information in the book. She always presents her stories in a way that dignifies the victims, without the usual sensationalism, especially on a high profile case like this. It's well worth the read......"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Ann Rule at Her Very Best","review":"If you liked Small Sacrifices, you will just love And Never Let Her Go. I don't understand some of the reviews that said this was a hastily written book. What it is, is a detailed glimpse into not only the victim and her her family - but also into the life and circumstances of her murderer. Who could ask for more? By the time we get to the trial we feel like we know these people well and are more than interested in how it all turns out. I very nearly read this book in one huge gulp...the only thing that kept from from rushing through it was dreading the last page. I know what I'll be doing in another 6 months or so...re-reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and Long Book","review":"This is the first Ann Rule book I have ever read. I plan To make it the last.The book was very biased. It could not really be called investigative. It seemed to present a one dimensional side of the events. It is amazing that it took so many pages to present such a limted view. I do not know the facts of the situation but it really seems like the author used a lot of words to not tell a complete story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book was written faster than the murder occurred....","review":"I was more than disappointed at some of the inaccuracies of Ms. Rule's quickly written book on a fascinating , disturbing murder case. If you eliminate court testimony, there is no substance that the author adds except for a family background on the tragic families effected by Capano's vile actions. Ms. Rule may be popular, but popularity is not verification -- she'll collect her millions for a nichel's work of investigation."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Didn't Know Any Better It Almost Sounds True","review":"The Ann Rule book was well written. I was surprised that it seemed to be a Debby MacIntyre biography. The attempt to make Ms MacIntyre come out smelling like a rose was laughable. The fact that Debby was portrayed as a victim was a joke. For someone who knows nothing about the case it seems almost reasonable. I would take this book at face value and say it was good. If I were interested in the truth I would be concerned with the factual errors printed and wonder why more research didn't go into it before it hit the shelves. Also, I thought it was a low blow to the Capano children that the author would say catty remarks about their style of dress. I think if Ms Rule would have attended more than a handful of days at the trial the book would have had a different slant."},{"rating":"1","title":"chilling insight into an obsessive man and an insecure woman","review":"This is Anne Rule's finest book. She successfully explains the reasons Capano was able to find each woman's vulnerabilities and exploit them. Reading about the trial makes you feel you were right in the courtroom and the jury reached the correct verdict for such a cold blooded monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Account","review":"If the disappearance of Chandra Levy haunts you, please read this book because the parallels between the two cases are startling. In this book there is closure after a long period of time, but no body. Ann Rule reports on murder better than almost anyone else, and in this book she writes sympathetically and with obvious care about the life of a young woman who was turning things around for herself when she was cruelly taken by a narcisstic man in a position of power."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Couldn't Put It Down !","review":"Ann Rule is an excellent writer, no one could out-do her book about this case. She brings people in the book to life and includes a lot of detail. Very well-written. It will remain one of my favorites among Ann's books. Ann is able to write with feeling,emotion,clarity, and common sense....it is very human writing..... is why it's so wonderful to read her writing. She is a great reporter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The deadly seducer.","review":"What an excellent account of a sick and controlling mind. I wasflabbergasted at some of the similarities of what is going onwith the Gary Condit case. You never know about anyone. Only Ann Rule can dissect family history and the culprit in such a spellbinding way. Fact is better than fiction in this story.One scenario is more unbelievable than the next and the perpertrator really believe they are above getting caught!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And Never Let Her Go","review":"It would be a shame if this is the first Ann Rule book you read. All of Rule's books are winners, but this one, And Never Let Her Go, is so good that her others seem to pale by comparison.Like a good police dog, Rule takes hold of the elements of this story and never lets it go. She has organized an enormous amount of detail about people, families, places, events, and nuances in relationships into a page-turner that fascinates, not because of lurid details, but because of the outrageous distortion of human character that is revealed in Thomas Capano. This book is a breakthrough for Rule. Her writing seems suddenly freed up from her previous story-telling protocols. She leads from one chilling detail to another so effortlessly that the bedtime reader may glance up and be amazed to find that the sun is coming up.Surely this book will be made into a gripping movie. I hope that Hollywood gives it the serious respect it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another page turner from Ann Rule","review":"Ann Rule once again gives her readers a page turner that they can't put down. Through her words her readers can feel the very emotions that drove Anne Marie Fahey, Debby McIntyre, and Thomas Capano. You could not finish this book without wanting to reach out and comfort the family and friends of Anne Marie. I have been a fan of Ann's for many years, always looking forward to her next book. She did not disappoint me with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRULY GREAT BOOK...UNABLE TO PUT IT DOWN FOR VERY LONG","review":"I FOLLOWED THIS CASE FROM DAY 1 AND THIS BOOK WENT SO MUCH DEEPER THAN THE MEDIA COVERAGE THAT WE WERE ALL INUNDATED WITH. I WAS LIVING IN THE AREA AT THE TIME AND SINCE MOVED TO FLORIDA, AND THIS BOOK MADE THE STORY COMPLETE FOR ME. ANN WAS ABLE TO GIVE TRUE LIFE TO ANN MARIE AND MADE HER READERS FEEL AS IF WE KNEW HER. I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK ESPECIALLY TO ANYONE LIVING IN THE DELAWARE,PENNSYLVANIA, NEW JERSEY AREA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book would make a great sleeping pill. It is overwritten and incredibly tedious.Making Deborah MacIntyre into such a sympathetic character is extremely hard to swallow for those of us who know this case in the Delaware area. It's angering and insulting to see this woman presented so sympathetically after she purchased the gun that killed Anne Marie Fahey and concealed her affair with Tom Capano for so many years from Tom's wife who was Debby's friend!Ponderous, tedious and extremely pointless. This book starts off like a lead laiden Zepplin and explodes into, mind numbing thud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Rule's Best","review":"Of Anne Rule's true crime novels that I have read, I consider this to be her best work. It is not flashy, exploitative, or predictable. Although the victim and others hurt by Tom Capano were not totally innocent, Anne Rule does not present them as such; yet she manages to show appropriate compassion for those whose lives were torn apart, never to be mended. Thomas Capano was a manipulative monster, a terrible adversary to be faced; Anne Marie is portrayed clearly as a woman whose childhood predisposed her to be hunted by a sick man. The writing is excellent, especially her information about the Mid-Atlantic states. Buy this one; you'll want to read it again, someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real spell binder, clear, concise, excellently descriptive","review":"I just finished the book and I'm pleased to say it is Ann Rule's best work since, \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Somnambulent","review":"Not Ann Rule's Best. She stretches here to find sympathy for some characters that don't deserve it and her courtroom descriptions seem oddly out of synch.It is mind numbing and vapid and seems to have been written in a hurry.I cannot recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The editor should have never let this book off his desk","review":"Well-written? This is one of the worst written books I've read in decades.I slogged through this mire of words and redundant, ill-phrased pop psychology until page 103, when I nearly stopped reading altogether after I read this sentence, written in the author's own words and not a quote from anyone. \\"They agreed to keep seeing each other, and her world seemed temporarily brighter, although she felt sorry for him because he told her he had to go to some stupid law seminar that he dreaded.\\" SOME STUPID LAW SEMINAR? Yes, the whole book, while based on a very interesting story fleshed out with some rich detail,is filled with shockingly bad prose of that sort. Who writes like that? Ann Rule has an excuse: She's a professional cop. Who lets that kind of sentence and this kind of book get printed? The editor and publisher ought to be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bully!","review":"A grand adventure movie with giant characters portrayed by a cast of greats at their best. Sprinkled with equal parts humor and drama, this movie captures an era and allows the viewer to share some of the heady nationalism Americans felt during the Roosevelt administration. When a pragmatic Arab points out to an American official that his plan to build a railroad across the desert is not practical due to drifting sand, the American merely states \\"We'll do it - we have men in America that can do anything!\\" Looking over American history since this story was set -Normandy, the Moon Shot, the technology revolution - how can one argue? While the event portrayed is super exaggerated from the truth, there are many gems of historical fact, and the story is well told enough that you may well decide to read one of the many excellent biographies on TR after viewing it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Candace Bergen and Mr. Sean Connery....","review":"He is dashing and handsome and ruthless and rash. Ms Bergen, is intelligent, protective and very put out by the Raizuli's impertinence of kidnapping her and her children. Such a great, old film, so wonderful on a rainy day to watch this and follow this up by watching \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\"...a cuppa tea, some good English cheese and crackers, and these 2 films..back to back...Sit back and relax, enjoy this film and just ride with the Raizuli and his band of Berber gangsters.......on camels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Film","review":"This is a great movie - lots of action, and Sean Connery at his best!

Laurence of A, Khartoum, Charge of the Light Brigade, Man Who Would be King, Zulu, Zulu Dawn, 55 Days at Peking, Conduct Unbecoming. Couple that with Connery, who, like M.Cain, I enjoy watching even in the odd bad movie. This movie should, therefore, be among my favorites. It isn't. In fact, I tossed it after I watched it. I found it boring, and frankly I don't really know why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozefest","review":"This is low grade 1960s-70s calibre TV style acting.......Connery as an Arab isn't convicing for even a second....The landscape camera work is breathtaking at times.....This is cornier than the worst of John Wayne films......It had to of cost a lot of money to make this hunk of crap.......This is a bland movie...Bergen is stale too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all-time best adventure yarns...","review":"Sean Connery and Brian Keith are wonderful in this movie as two opposing forces that respect each other in the classical sense, with honor. The character development is well done with John Houston playing a wonderful Secretary of State, you must see the \\"You likee speechee?\\" scene with the Japanese ambassador. The cinematography is grand and the scenes mystical and romantic. It is one of my favorites and one that justifies buying a copy to see again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking !","review":"All the key players of this movie are wonderful.

Unfortunately, it came out at a time of other big time releases and did not get the exposure. It has a cast of thousands, Arabian intrigue, clash between cultures and religions - handled brilliantly, the tension between Bergen and Connery, one of the best portrayals of Teddy Roosevelt, and a bit of American \\"Big Stick\\" bravado! This movie is one of my all time favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN ABSOLUTE FARCE","review":"The acting (and I mean all the actors except for John Huston's small part)and the script are really bad.

Father & son Perdicaris were captured not mother and children (in fact Mother Perdicaris telephoned for help).2. The event lasted 5 weeks not the months portrayed.3. Not a shot was fired, in fact, Marines were specifically barred from using force.4. The Perdicaris's were returned largely unharmedSOURCE: \\"Theodore Rex\\" by Edmund MorrisIt gets 2 stars only because Sean Connery is so laughably bad as an Arab (he shtill hash his sshlurring dialect) and worth the view--at least for awhile.

Throw in Brian Keith as a great Teddy Roosevelt and a military intervention and you've got a great flick. But there's more.

Sean Connery and Candace Bergen are a great match; with all their cultural differences and personal strength they find that, although each has met his/her match, they learn to like and respect the other.

When I'm feeling a little fearful about approaching something new in life, I watch this video. The courage and boldness of the characters is inspiring. And Brian Keith's excellent portrayal of Teddy Roosevelt's grit reminds me of current events. The relationship shown between Sean Connery and Candace Bergen's characters is so charming and touching that it makes me forget it's a movie.

Among the film's few virtues are Brian Keith's brilliant Theodore Roosevelt and Jerry Goldsmith's memorable Oscar-nominated score. A major disappointment considering the vast amount of talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely NECESSARY Sex Scenes! Yea!","review":"It's very rare that I find sex scenes necessary to the telling of a story, but in this book it just had to be.

It was a story that haunts me even though I'm now reading another one of her books.I could not put \\"Second Hand Wife\\" down even though I wanted to go to bed. That says a lot for a person who devides her books into two readings: first half one night, second half the next night.I have read several of Ms. St.John's books, and I think her writing style is similar to Laveryl Spencer's. That is great because I adored Spencer's work, and now that she's retired, I have found someone to replace her. Well, almost.

At best it's a run-of-the-mill beauty and the beast story that's entertains but brings nothing new to the table. At worst, it's a poorly written story that overuses POV prose, tells instead of shows and rehashes the fairly exasperating \\"angsty disabled/scarred hero consumed by self-loathing redeemed by endlessly patient and good Mary Sue heroine.\\" The good characters are unconflicted and perfect while the bad characters are pure malice and outrageously cruel. This can work in a melodrama, but the author seemed to want to play them straight, and so they're just soulless and cardboard. I read it in one sitting, but it never swept me away and Noah's self-pity was just wearying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Enjoyed this book immensley.

We had not treated the pot roughly, only read instructions, washed it lightly, rinsed it with water & a cup of vinegar when we first got it, and nothing after that. We use filtered water.Also, on the outside of the kettle, the handle had not been attached properly so that a corner of a washer stuck out a bit, keeping one of the screws from going in all the way.

Many of the best pieces are actually by amateurs, which is not surprising given the labor-intensiveness of a quality wood box. The book is refreshingly themeless, and the work runs from classical to whimsical, with a decided tendency towards unconventional design. Only the bare minimum of information beyond the photos --size, material, a few artists comments, and in back, contact information.

By his actions he disgraced his military record and the country he stood for. Corcoran certainly provides a thorough backgrand into what was happening to the rural communities in the eighties and how such times made farmers like Kahl ripe for recruitment by right-wing paramilitary zenophobes. Kahl and the Posse stem from the same roots that created homegrown terrorists like Tim McVeigh. For Kahl, a man who had served his country in WWII, the treatment of rural America in general and farmers in particular, must have been a bitter betrayal. While some have critized the local sheriff and federal agents for the way they handled the arrest, it is important to note that Kahl had a choice, to go peacefully or to take up arms.

Bitter Harvest was based on a true story.I enjoyed this book because it was a true story about the passed. About racism and how people hated each other. This is something that I really find interesting to read about. How people lived in America in the 60's or 70's. Bitter Harvest had tons of exciting adventures put in to the story. This is what people thought when they were apart of this story.He reason I chose this story is because it is about crime. It is also about trust and truth. Also I loved the cover.

It worked great when it was new. It does make the phone a little bulky, and I actually like the belt clip with the spring loaded button. It protects the phone very, very well. Nary a scratch in six months.The biggest problem I've had is getting the piece that fits over the top half of the phone to stay on. It seems that the leather/plastic combination has streched out over time to the point where it will not stay on the top part. I had to stop using it. I could turn it in to AT&T and get a new one, but I'm just going to have the same problem in a month or two. Right now I'm using the original plastic holster, which seems to work fairly well but provides zero protection.The aftermarket needs to jump on this problem!! Where is Body Glove when you need them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor OEM case","review":"Purchased the V60t and ordered the case because Amazon.com did not have anything else(i.e.Body Glove).

The clip is also so thick that the case itself is thicker than the original phone even without the phone in the case! It also will not fit in the desktop charger with the case on the phone and due to the design on the case you have to completely remove it to make it fit.I have actually reverted to using the horrible original clip as I didn't like this big bulky thing on my hip.

But this edited collection of essays and his Positive Psychology movement in general, do not show a very sophisticated understanding of psychological research and theory on pessimism. This edited volume can be compared directly with: Optimism & Pessimism: Implications for Theory, Research, and Practice, Edited by Edward C. Chang. I find Chang's book to be more scholarly, better balanced, and thus more informative. Unrealistic optimism is no adequate replacement for the authenticity of anxiety and worry or the adaptive value of constructive pessimism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all funny.

Along the way he stops to help people with their own problems.

The shootouts are orgasmic in their imagery, and the deaths are the climatic endings. In short this is the product of an individual who has transposed much of his sexual desire into violent acts. But is this not entertaining? I found myself laughing outloud at times as I read this book, which I picked up for 25 cents at a rummage sale.

My favorite part is 'Born to be alive' where you do lots of punches and power moves which really encourage me and make me feel fantastic. I've seen people who just can't stand R.

My other issue is that since it's a little expensive compared to other adapters out there, it gets even more expensive in that you have to buy another one to play against or with a friend (but that is usually resolved by the average emulator's ability to connect to other users via an Internet connection).Overall, it's a fun product that won't let you do when it comes to having nostalgic fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work correctly","review":"I purchased this two of these items, (by the way its says, \\"Retro-bit\\" not \\"retrolink\\") and both did not work correctly.

I was delighted to find that Paul Copley, the original narrator, was narrating my copy of it from Amazon. Not at all disappointed that it wasn't Michael Kramer. The Pilgrim's Progress is a thought-provoking story, but one which I think would be too difficult for the modern child to read. This dvd presents the story very well & very faithfully. I look forward to watching it with our granddaughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reduction is fantastic!","review":"Reduction just plain reduced me to tears of happiness and joy! Easily, my favorite song was Lately. It sort of rings some bells on a past relationship. Keep the great music coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and too many lines","review":"I suppose if you're a really hard core Sicilian guy, and you like to see endless variations, this might be your book. I was looking for a book that was a lot more into strategy, and I think this lacks strategy. It's really nothing more than an annotated ECO or something. I wish it had sections based on common pawn skeletons and what each side's strategy was to continue. This book is more designed for somebody who wants to memorize a bunch of lines. Great! Then you get into a middle game and have no idea of a plan. Oh yeah, I think the organization of the book, for what it is, is pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"$8.95 and oh so misleading","review":"This is not an idiot's guide to freezer meals as the other reviewer reports. There is only a short paragraph about do's and dont's for freezer e.g. buttermilk and yogurt and breading do not freeze well, This is a book with recipes for chicken beef and pork that you are supposed to thoroughly cook, then store in freezer containers, then microwave or reheat on the stovetop. I am not kidding. This book does not deliver on its premise at all.Most of the chicken recipes require searing the chicken before finishing the meat by stewing or baking.This book did move me in an irritation to look at my regular cookbooks for meals that would freeze well. So far, I have found that Fuschia Dunlop's Hunan pork stir fry dishes can be frozen and steamed. Also, I have baked Italian hot sausages and then packed them in containers with raw green peppers and onions to be reheated in the oven whenever I need a savory dish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is wonderful but sound is not","review":"You can hardly miss by having a Stephane Grappelli DVD - so the music is lovelybut the quality of the recording is not good. Sounds very tinny and shallow intone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy","review":"All the Songs are great. There are some familiar songs/videos in this compilation, but most of the songs are Catchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"More the just Immune Support!","review":"You don't have to be HIV Positive or suffer from CFIDS, Cancer or any other degenerative disease to benefit from this book. It is also a must read for people who want to get off of sugar, wheat or dairy and many other toxic ingredients too. You can learn the \\"why and how\\" to go about removing these poisons from your diet. Follow the easy to understand directions, use the delicious recipes, and get healthy by reducing infectious ingredients from your diet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Companion","review":"My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A worthy effort, but not worth it","review":"This recording features some of the most beautiful piano works ever done by Beethoven. But the interpretation of the pieces are awful. The performer takes certain liberties that are not specified in the musical manuscripts and drowns out certain voices that are more important than the fast moving accompaniment. The performer has also romanticised music that is defintely classical in form. Finally, in the second movement of the Pathetique sonata (Adagio Cantabile) the performer hangs on to the first beat of every measure and in the middle of the piece, the iterpretation is layed back when it should be at it's fullest sound and strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bobby Otter and the Blue Boat","review":"This was my favorite book as a child. Margaret Burdick is a wonderful author and illustrator in this charming book. It is a great story about an otter in a little village full of friendly animals. Amazon.com found this book for me even though it was out of print. Thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre stories, poorer animation","review":"The stories, like most of the recent WB animations are directly from comic book editions. The stories are part of the Emerald Knight series. Most of these lacked the action of many of the Green Lantern/Hal Jordan stories. Whoever is animating these is both trying to imitate the original artist, but lacks either the skill or budget to do a good job. This was released more or less as a companion to the Green Lantern live actor movie coming up shortly. Mostly to explain some of the other Lanterns in the GL corp.If you miss this one, you aren't really missing anything vital, or particularly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"English Please!!!!","review":"I got this movie for my son but it is not in English. I have no idea what the hell language its in but it sux!!! Should state clearly that its not in english.When I played video clips of this movie they were in English.
