Also note that this is a CDrom as well, with a full video for \\"Brackish\\". I just turned 34 to think that these chicks could be my daughters. Now I think their parents should be praised for letting the girls express indiviuality. I agree with the comparison to L7, however Kittie has more potential, and better musicianship. Pretty good live show, room for improvement, but huge upside. Also Note that the band made $100 per show on the Slipknot tour. I found that out when they came to Ft. Lauderdale. Can't wait to see them at Ozzfest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close, but no Crisis","review":"I like this record fine, it is better then Korn or Tool or any of the umpteen thousand Pantara sounding bands out there. Yes, they ore overly slick and a little too well packaged for the genre, hardly punk rock. But I give it thumbs up, besides, there cute. There is a better, more original female voice out there that I hope Kittie fans will give a listen to, Crisis. Karyn Crisis is still the unchallenged screem queen of blasting, sonic noise. Buy the new Kittie, then go get Deaths head Extermination or the Hollowing, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 1st CD","review":"I just got the Kittie CD yesterday. At first I couldn't understand any of, but after a couple listens it started to sound really really good. The drumming is awesome, and so are the vocals, but some of the screaming was over the top, espcially on *spit*...Morgan is going to ruin her voice if she keeps it up. This is definitly real metal. Kittie's lyrics are really powerful and beyond their years. The best songs are *Brackish* *Paperdoll* & *Do You Think I'm A Whore* If you like Slipknot and Pantera then you will love Kittie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I WAS BLOWN AWAY AS SOON AS I PUT IT IN!","review":"This cd is amazing!

If you are into underground bands then I recommend getting Kittie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Wouldn't You Like This?","review":"It seems there are a lot of guys out there who are dogging this album. Well, that is because all they have heard is \\"Brackish\\" and possibly \\"Charolette\\". They can't stand the fact that girls can do what Korn can do, and even better. Also, why would you hate Morgan Landers vocals, she sounds like the female Phil Anselmo (of Pantera). Further more, the tracks on \\"SPIT\\" are far deeper and inciteful than half the crap getting air play right now. Its hard to believe that Kittie are all under 20. The girls also give a kick a$$ live show, they can thrash with the best of 'em. Open up your mind and give \\"SPIT\\" a try. This is the one album that all metal fans can love, fans of the NU-metal, thrash, death, black, and aggro will all fall in love with Kittie after buying this album. Check out \\"Do You Think I'm a Whore\\", \\"Charolette\\", and \\"Get Off\\". One thing is for sure about Kittie, these girls have some balls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good band but- This is NOT an audio CD!!","review":"I find the band interesting but this is not an audio CD so it is of little use to me.

I thought, \\"Cool, a girl band on the metal scene.\\" This is one of the worst albums I have in my collection. My listening tastes vary from Hanoi Rocks to Sepultura, so I'm usually pretty open to new stuff, but I didn't like this. In reponse to the riot grrl comments, that's what it sounds like: whiny teen girls from the north who have nothing to complain about but do it anyway to get airplay.In Metal Edge they're supposedly one of the best bands out there- if that's true, us metalheads have a lot to fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"hahhahahaahaha","review":"i think the only reason alot of people like kittie is because it is a buch of chicks, and i also think that alot of people dislike them for that same reason. but i dislike it because they are very untalented and quite bland. the bass player is extremely sloppy, and the guitars are very simple. the vocals seem to be strained, which i do not like. the music is very simple and not at all complex. if you want to hear a chicks that can rock, check out jack off jill."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype and little quality.","review":"I feel bad lancing into a group of enthusiastic teenage rockers -- and my compatriots to boot -- but Spit is a pale excuse for a rock record.The guitars are thin and mixed low, more of a groan than a growl, lacking in both punch and diversity, a sludgy mess of sounds. The vocals are an unsophisticated grind, the lyrics barely discernible. There isn't much songcraft on display here, and even the excitement level is severely limited due to too much attention to a rumbling low end and not enough biting treble.Some points for attitude but that's about it. For good hard rock/metal by women, go for Veruca Salt's Eight Arms to Hold You, Drain S.T.H.'s Horror Wrestling or Phantom Blue's Built for Performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"1.)A girl trying to scream and sound like a guy at the same time is an awful sound!2.)

The same guitar riffs repeated through every song!Totally unoriginal!5.) If they were 30 years old and ugly, you would have never heard of them. NEVER!6.)

They need to go back to grammer school, because every other lyric is a curse word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably BORING","review":"Kittie is the single most boring, untalented, and contrived band in the history of mankind. It sounds like these poseurs were manufactured at the MTV nu-metal factory, complete with whiny lyrics, down-tuned guitars, and a very commercial, plastic overall feel. Don't let all the hype fool you, this band truly lacks any musical ingenuity and no one will even remember them next year (as with all fads). If you kiddies want some serious metal check out early Sepultura or Suffocation."},{"rating":"1","title":"kittie","review":"I've heard good things about kittie so i decided to check them out...figuring they would be as good as i've heard. im sorry to say that they are terrible. the lead singer has no focus on music and the lyrics are meaningless repeats. they don't seem to know what they're doing. don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should let us give 0 stars.","review":"This is the worst album ever... Do not buy this album! For starters, they're only popular coz they're [female]... yet all they sing about is sexism, feminism and how bad they've had things. They could barely play their instruments when I saw them live ... The drums are marginally better than everything else, but considering that everything else is boring, simple and sloppy I don't think that's too much to be proud of. THE most overhyped piece... ever. They may enjoy the success they have which they've earnt so far, simply from being good-looking girls ... Quite frankly, a pile of rubbish.P.S. to say this is catchy, original or has excellent lyrics is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"Like so many others, I heard great reviews and decided to check them out.And like some others I was left with a piece of plastic that would have been better use to me as a frisbee than a music CD.I think that they are getting popular on the fact that they're teenagers, girls, and a heavy metal band. But thats my opinon and I know some people agree with me. (I know several)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Overall, too satanic and Marilyn Manson-like for my tastes.

In my opinion, [geta copy of] Brackish and try to forget the rest of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok Come On","review":"(...) Wow...what moving and thought provoking lyrics. This is just one of the most pathetic albums ever recorded. A bunch of angry canadian chicks who cant play their instruments, who would ever want to buy this. Kittie and bands of the like make nu-metal look even worse than it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Kittie is unoriginal, meaningless, and annoying. There is no distinction between the songs. They lack creativity in all possible aspects. The entire album is all just moaning, bitching, and bad music that has been done countless times before. Kittie is nothing new to the rock scene. They're just like every other act that comes up, has their 15 minutes of fame, and disappears into the shadows."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite CDs","review":"I think that Kittie is an awesome band. They might no mix a huge variety of instruments together like Slipknot, but they sound awesome anyway. I recommend this for any metal head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best!","review":"This CD didn't annoy me enough to give it 1 star, as it didn't have any of that rap-rock garbage to deserve such scorn.Let me just make one thing clear: This isn't metal. It's a \\"riot grrl band\\" posing as a heavy metal band (because of its mainstreamity, people automatically call it metal. But that's the myth behind riot grrl music, it's basically a mockery of what they call the hard rock scene taken over by men.)What's already has been said has been covered (the one hit single is the stand-out, the rest of the songs reek. Many garage bands out there sound better than this.)An almost identical album is Babes in Toyland's \\"Fontanelle\\", which has MUCH better lyrics and was more thought out. If you want similiar, earlier music done better, get that album instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nails-on-a-blackboard bad, but makes an excellent coaster","review":"The current trend of fresh out of secondary artists has brought forth some interesting new \\"talent\\". However, none of these can compare to the effort we see in Spit by Kittie.Screaming predictably foul-mouthed vocals highlight this recording. The four young members seem to delight in attempting to astonish. *very clever...wearing Hot Topic as well, I see* Maturity...forth-coming? Blech!On a better note, the CD itself has a lovely spiked collar design. It has found a place of honour...as a coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unispiring","review":"Everywhere I went I kept hearing about this great all girl heavy metal band that was getting great reviews from everyone. Never hearing them before I decided to check out the cd and decide for myself. I was unimpressed. After you get past the fact that they are all girls and all really young, the music is just plain boring. Sure it's heavy with your typical screams, angst ridden lyrics laced with cuss words, mosh pit riffs and such but most of the songs sound the same and just don't seem to have any originality to them. I have to admit that I do like the song \\"Brackish\\" which is very good but also the only one that I can seem to remember from the cd. Not to mention that the cd is only like 35 minutes long or something it's not worth it to buy a cd for one song. If you want to check out a really good all girl heavy metal band then check out Drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"kittie rocks!","review":"kittie rocks!not only are they extremely talented but they are very sexy.kittie is one of the best metal bands ever and \\"spit\\" is one of the best metal albums next to korn's \\"follow the leader\\" and disturbed's \\"the sickness\\".everyone needs to own this album.ALL HAIL KITTIE!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harder than the other chic bands","review":"Kittie is a very talented band. Morgan has a nice melodic voice and fallon can scream loud too. The guitars have a very slayer-ish sound and are actually heavy(unlike most chic bands).

Its a total WASTE of good graphics. The storyline is bad. The game play is bad. You have no direct control of ANY characters.

Really too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of my Top Ten Worst Movies","review":"You'd be better off watching all six hours of a blank VHS cassette than five minutes of this cliched folderol. Clearly derivative of \\"Big Chill\\" sickly sentimentality and perfectly devoid of quality writing, \\"Peter's Friends\\" ranks with \\"Ishtar\\" in its utter waste of talent.

The actors out of league with their lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"A vision of hell...","review":"Branagh creates a creepy world of horror in this little film.

They claim it all only takes place on a weekend, when it really feels like eternity. \\"The Big Chill\\" was only a toe dipped in the pool of smug self-importance--now take the dive.The worst part is that everyone involved here has done very good work elsewhere.

Of course all the actors are much younger in the film, so obviously, it isn't current. Wonderful cast. Beautiful setting. The stately English mansion through the fog is breathtaking. Everyone is so believable, and so interesting that you just get sucked into it and, in an instant, it's over. The authenticity of the people is right-on. I was so delighted to get my copy this week when it finally came out (February 12, 2008). I watched it last night with a glass of wine and nibbles, and just fell in love with it all over again. Stephen Fry is such a delight to watch. You want to just hug him through the screen. Everyone just glows. A wonderful film for the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative, Forced and a Prison for Talented Actors","review":"This is one of those films that I'm willing to watch, at least in segments, in order to appreciate some very good actors as they make the best a cliched, poorly-written script. As others have noted, this is really just a Transatlantic imitation of The Big Chill. I don't like that film much, either, and so I'm of course not going to be crazy about watching an imitator. There are some clever lines, I will admit, but each character has become mired in his or her personal rut since the group last reunited, and each rut is stated and restated and analyzed in about every facile and melodramatic manner one could imagine. Still, there's a lot of talent on that screen, and while I cringe at the script I can admire the actors' attempts to salvage it. At some point, however, there will come a point where I won't be able to watch even a few minutes of this disappointing film anymore, and I suspect that point will arrive early next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is one of the worst children's games I ever played.

The game comes with a spinner that has the numbers 1-4 and then a moon. Every 4 spaces on the game board you have to stop. The moon is a lose a turn space. So there's a lot of spinning and not much counting because the players are constantly stopping. Some spaces you have to feed your caterpillar a certain type of food (fruit, picnic food, etc). At that point you spin to see how much food to give your caterpillar. This is confusing for kids because the spinner now is used for something other than movement. Near the end of the game you have to wait on a space until you spin a moon. Frustrating.Terrible game design - game designer tried to follow the plot of the book way too much, and as a result anything educational is lost.Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for 2 yr olds.","review":"This is a great game for very young kids who are just learning shapes and colors.

I'm a pre-school teacher who bought this game for my class of 3-5 yr. olds as we are doing \\"A Very Hungry Caterpillar\\" unit. While I understand what the game creator was trying to cover (number recognition and counting, one-to-one correspondence, matching, the butterfly life cycle), the game itself is poorly thought out. Way too much stopping and waiting (it can take forever to spin a moon...) which makes the game boring and frustrating for kids. In addition, the caterpillar playing pieces are small cardboard boxes, which easily rip when inserting the tabs in place to make them. I had to tape two of the playing pieces before one game was even played! Not worth your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fun game!","review":"We got this for my daughter when she was 4. It is terrible and incredibly boring and pointless. The pieces are not sturdy at all, made completely of cardboard.

When I read it, I was completely enthralled. The characters are strongly delineated and they develop believably as the work progresses.

And a comparison with other compact bino brands - including my old Bausch & Lombs and Bushnells - will convincingly demonstrate why Leica's compact Trinovid Series are truly well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antiquity","review":"This book gets four stars because it has stood the test of time.It was written by a man from my home town about a slave in his family.He was a child when the book took place and it demonstrates to me thatin a child's innocence, he loved this woman and had no understanding ofwhat slavery was.It's not that well written but is worthy for it's historical value and fora child's viewpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not totally impossible to imagine a worse novel","review":"This is my first (and last) Gilbert Morris read. I never would have guessed that this author had so many previous publications, and I find the other reviews here totally incongruous with my perception.On the up side... The book had an okay story, and it was a fast read, primarily because of an unusually large type face. I almost rated this two stars because I could imagine worse, but I've given two stars to an item here and there that I thought were somewhat better.On the down side... No suspense; No medical information to justify the portrayal and basis of the amnesia of the story protagonist; Hugely stilted colloquial jargon. Most disappointing were the extremely heavy-handed Christian story elements and metaphors. Apparently the author is a former pastor and drawing from his expertise, but he did it with no grace and at the expense of every other requirement in a well-constructed and well-written story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me A Break!","review":"I could handle (barely) the first two-thirds of the book with him being a Don Juan but seriously, who does this character think he is?

And wouldn't you know it, he even wins them all!By the time this narrative is almost through, he undergoes 3 identities. Does he really know who he is when the story is through?

My wife stopped using this bag because in elevators, crowds and many other situations, she was constantly bumping people.On the upside, it seems to provide good back support, good storage and the quality is also good. With Baby in front, bag behind also provides good balance. Though we never used it when travelling, I think it would be very suitable for that as its shape seems conducive to fitting aircraft luggage bins AND its construction, zips and clips means things wouldn't easily fall out.Summary: Make sure you are comfortable with the extent to which it sticks out behind you; if you're ok with that, then this makes a great bag to support your baby needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah blah blah","review":"Edited review:I used to actually think this moron had something to offer.

I think the learning curve on it is taking me some time but Im getting the hang of ship controls. Theres nothing more exciteing to be launching photon topedoes at romulons.

I was drawn to buying this game because #1 I'm a huge Star Trek nerd and #2 I like video games with lazers. However, I'm not sold on the idea of flying a star ship around like a fighter out of Starfox. The level of detail they could have taken this game would have made it 10x as much fun (i.e. doing damage control, boarding enemy ships, etc.etc.)But biggest of all is the controls. If you are prone to vertigo, this game is not for you. The camera controls are something to be dealt with as you're always attempting to figure out where the enemy is. Good sounds, good voice actors, nooooot that good gamer control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love to Hate","review":"PC VersionAs of this writing I am still trying to love this game. When first installed the mission loads your left in wonder. The graphics and detail are something to see. I'm a fan of most things Star Trek so I'm usually bias in any ST game. This game was not...and still is not ready for shipment. The controls are a complete mess and the multiplayer is a disaster. There are a group of us 20+ who all have legacy and play together. Out of 10 games in a session I'd say 2 go smoothly.If you'd ask if I'd buy it again knowing what I know now...yeah I'd buy it again. The game truly has alot of potential....they just really screwed it up.If your not a fan of star trek don't buy this game.

Poor controls and poor mission design will have you bashing your head against your console until you lose enough blood to pass out. Going to the dentist for a root canal is a more enjoyable Star Trek experience than this awful attempt at a Starship Combat game. It is as though Mad Doc software took all of the good ideas that could have been put into a Star Trek starship combat game, jumped up and down on them, shredded them, flushed them down the toilet, retrieved them from the sewer, burnt them and then buried them in concrete to make sure that none of them were implemented. Don't buy this game for anyone else unless you really hate them, even then you would have to really dislike them to purchase them something so wretched."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm too stupid to play this game","review":"I did not like this game.

The graphics are poor the animation is boring. The ships are unimpressive and have little to do with star trek. They lie about re-enacting star trek episodes. It's just a bunch of lousy battles that have nothing to do with the original or other series. Ships orientation is unrelated to travel direction. Warp drive takes you out of the game area. It does not came close to taking advantage of the xbox360. I am sorry I bought this game & wasted my money. Return it before you open for Christmas you or who ever gets it will be terribly disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS!!!!!","review":"Go take a look at the reviews for the PC version, which I own. This game is an aboslute travesty.It has no depth, no strategy, zero replay value. It's buggy, controls are worthless, graphics are not up to snuff, there is no upgrading of systems or selection of captains, no ability to use Star Trek systems like tractor beams or transporters, no 3D manuevering - you can't even customize the skirmish mode by selecting your own enemies! The game does it for you. No in-game save, you can only save one mission at a time... need I go on?Avoid it at ALL COSTS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A game for (almost) every trekkie!!!!","review":"The makers had a good idea, great story line... but nearly failed at controls and game play =(Some of the controls are great... however I seem to recall that at least 90% of torpedo's that WERE fired actually HIT their target!Also I would think that the ships would turn easier at low speeds then faster... Also the ships are over priced for what you get from them.Oh, and the 3d navigation is a pain, you can't just tell a ship to go to some spot up the Z-axis... they will go to the 'plain' to that spot (and then you have to move them the rest of the way to position them where you want to)...I would say rent this first and try it out to see how you like it. If you don't like it your only out $5+/-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Many of the other views offer valid criticism of this game; however, for those of us who have loved Star Trek for years nothing can top flying around in the original NCC-1701 and blowing Klingons and Romulans up! That alone was worth the $60. The only complaint I think is slightly unfair is the claim that the control are difficult and all I can say is that driving a battleship is going to be harder than flying a fighter plane. The controls are slow because big hunks of metal move slow and from an \\"in game\\" point of view that is about the only way the designers could convey the sense of size and power of these ships. In any event, it is Star Trek and it is a great game. Personally, I would have paid $60 just for the ship to ship combat simulator so the entire story is just an added bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"ver complicated!","review":"First off, the graphics, music, sound.... etc is amazing no doubt! However, playing the game is not interesting at all. For example, there are way too many controls for the ship that one can not navigate fast enough to avoid attacks. I'm very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG dissapointment","review":"I was truly hoping that I had found a video game platfrom version of SFB. Not so. If that is what you are looking for here, you will not find it. Bad controls, misleading claims on packaging-there is no \\"2 player\\" option for this unless you are online and guess what? After attempting to find an opponent online several times....there is no one on, hmmmm....wonder if that is because everyone takes it into the local game trader after finding out what a piece of garbage it is. Horrible floating camera angles. What's the deal....expected so much more from Bethesda. Did no one with any background or interest in the real time tactical Star Fleet game experience test this thing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy star trek legacy","review":"The controls in this game take forever to learn and the control book still leaves you pressing the wrong buttons. This game should also include all the races of star trek not just the main ones. They should not have scraped the upgrading part of this game. They need to improve if they're going to make Star Trek legacy 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait in my opinion","review":"This review specifically details the Xbox 360 version of this game, I know it got butchered in the PC version and I want everyone to know I have played this game on the 360, waiting for each successive delay.Graphically, this game is very interesting, HUGE detailed backgrounds and particle effects, coupled with explosions make for a very interesting visual. I'd say graphically this game rocks.I was very impressed with what they did with the 3d mapping as far as determining how to locate other planets/ships/etc. Too often when a game ends up in 3 dimensions it's TERRIBLE to navigate, they used a very innovative approach in order to remedy this problem.The fact that this game has both online and offline play just adds to it's fun, I have yet to play involved games online but from what I saw, and all of the insane amounts of ship options, it looks pretty dang good to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff","review":"I don't disgree with the last review- I was a bit disappointed because the album didn't quite meet the expectations generated by the title.

I feel stillbirth is a completely different situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pop Album!","review":"I think most people are putting down Paris's album because of who she is, which is unfair since the album itself is really good. Despite being \\"Paris Hilton\\" her album doesn't sound half-bad considering what they're playing on the radio right now. The album starts out with a hot dance track titled \\"Turn It Up\\". Then there was the *surprise* radio hit \\"Stars Are Blind\\" which wasn't really a surprise hit at all because the girl CAN actually sing... it was a *surprise* because most didn't think she could. \\"I Want You\\" is another upbeat song. \\"Jealousy\\" is in my opinion the best crafted song on the album. That track is definitely worth a listen. \\"Nothing In This World\\" is another upbeat song... the only two songs I didn't like was \\"Fightin' Over Me\\" featuring Fat Joe and Jadakiss and the remake of Rod Stewart's \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy\\". If you want a juicy upbeat pop-album then get yourself a copy of Paris Hilton's CD! I hardly doubt you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"This album is not horrible, if you enjoy mindless, feel good, I-am-hot-and-I-know-it kind of music. I enjoyed the songs, 'Stars Are Blind', 'Nothing In This World', and 'Heartbeat.' The Oakenfold remix of the song 'Turn Me Up' is much better than the album version. (You can get it on I-Tunes) As expected, she does a lot of sighing, trying-to-be-sexy kind of vocals. She usually falls flat on her face when she is trying to do this. She does not have the range or inflection in her voice to do so. Paris will never win any awards for the power of her voice.That said, I do not think she is the worst thing out right now. The majority of the popular female singers (Fergie, Kelis Cassie, Ashlee Simpson, Pussycat Dolls) have less than stellar voices. Paris is yet another artist in this group. The songs mentioned above are fun, that's all. The DVD edition provides some funny moments when Paris is talking about her 'love' of the record. If you can get this version---it should put a smile on your face."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read swashbuckler","review":"\\"On the evening of June 28th, 1518, young Pedro de Vargas, aged nineteen, confessed his sins of the month to Father Juan Mendez.\\"So begins Captain from Castile, a great adventure set in Renaissance era Spain. Pedro de Vargas is an eminently likable young man who gets by through quick thinking and a deft hand. The story is quick paced, taking the reader on a journey that leaps from imprisonment in the dungeons of the Inquisition, to the invasion and conquest of Mexico to intrigues in the court of Emperor Charles V. The treatment of the native populations may come across as dated but definitely true to the views of the 1500s.

The OEM speakers were part of a sad excuse for a car audio system. These speakers made a tremendous difference in overall sound quality and after I hooked them up to a small amp they got even better. These speakers do have to be tuned by the head unit however to bring out their optimum sound quality, and you will never get tremendous thumping bass out of these something I realized after putting them through the paces, but if your looking for a clean sounding well built product that fits in those tight areas, look no further. I wish I had more room in my car, but unfortuantely that's not changing. I imagine these speakers in a car with more room and a resulting larger sound stage would sound even better.

It comes with bracket clips to mount. Installing them is easy once you solder or crimp. I chose to solder for a better connection.

Later this year they will be getting a power upgrade and I fully expect that they will only improve with some increased and cleaner amplification. Figure to put 50 watts RMS through them and add a sub to the system. When they aren't being asked to provide frequencies outside of a reasonable range, they should really fall into their own.

It has the same lyrics, but with, in my opinion, a new-age twist of drums, fiddle and it's more upbeat than the original.Even though there's that old song on there, the guys can still kick it and write new ones of their own. I love their first track, \\"Last One Standing\\"; it's flamboyant and a great way to start off the CD.Major props to the new Emerson Drive CD, I would definitely recommend it that is if you like country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I enjoyed the singles from Emerson Drive's first CD, but it wasn't until I saw them performing live as the opening act for Shania Twain that I decided I would buy this CD when it came out. Well I received it yesterday and I have to say that there is not a single song on this CD that I would skip. This CD is just so well put together. I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new twist in country","review":"This cd has a few surprises I wasn't expecting. I'll die trying is a soulfull song that any woman would love. If you were my girl is a great upbeat sing along song. Memories has a unique sound. The remake of Fishin in the Dark is not exactly as lively as I've seen them perform it live but still a great cut.Keep up the good work, this CD will be The last one standing.

It was sissy music, and I'm not quite sure how to categorize this. It sure is not country, that's for sure. The boy band of country music. Let's call them OutofSync. And why does it suck so bad? Because it has not edge and it's as if they needed some songs for their stadium tour. But they just don't pull it off. Maybe the worst country music album I have ever heard? Definitely is one of the worst, and I've been a country music fan since 1992. Also, I don't understand all of the five star ratings. It seems on Amazon, all you get are positive reviews.Update 9/3/05: They are ranked over 17,000 in sales!!

The SFX are not bad but used too many times so with the very noisy atmosphere they tried to create, it's finally very annoying ! About the Death Metal score, I guess it must be annoying for those who hates this music... And even if Ramirez was listening Metal, it wasn't Death Metal either but more like Iron Maiden,Acdc.. Death Metal and especially the one in the movie, didn't exist in the 80's or at least not in this style ! I am also not very sure the story is accurate to the true events. The end sounds a bit too much, with many improbabilities. Very average movie in my opinion.

Take my advice...just read the book solely about Richard Ramirez and dump the film. Poor directing and cinematography which wasted the actors talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst ever","review":"Out of the serial killer movies, this one has to be the worst by far. First, we don't even get to know who the \\"Nightstalker\\" really was. He is only shown when he attacks. We know nothing about his life or his upbringing. He hardly even speaks in the movie. Also what was VERY distracting from the beginning, is the camera would shake real fast throughout the movie. It made me very seasick and I wanted to turn it off. I guess it tried to be all \\"artsy\\" and show what it's like to be intoxicated on drugs. It was just annoying. My friend lent me his copy.

The acting isn't bad and I've seen much worse movies so that's the reason for my 2 star rating. I just wish this movie would have given us more details of the man himself. It fails to deliver a true story like movies such as Ted Bundy, Dahmer, Ed Gein and Gacy. I was disappointed with this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...","review":"This movie was an inaccurate account of the events leading to Richard Ramirez's incarceration.

This one in particular is so mean-spirited and unfunny that all you can really do is gape. Its view of marriage is right up there with the Three Stooges (remember the short films in which the three of them were married?) and enough to swear a teen viewer off the institution for life. Yet it's one of those bad movies I like to turn on when it (rarely) shows up on TV, maybe because of the now-quaint 60s art decoration and costumes, maybe because rarely before or since have performers of such talent squandered it so egregiously.

The signs and symptoms listed in this book as indications of reactive attachment disorder more closely match the diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder.The authors create a false sense of urgency, to encourage parents to hurry off for controversial therapy, rather than take children to medical professionals who will take the time to make an appropriate diagnosis.Fear of unattached children is used to scare parents into seeking immediate attention.A better book to read would be It's Nobody's Fault: New Hope and Help for Difficult Children and Their Parents by Harold S.

As a scholar of Second Coming Prophecies, I must say that LeHaye & Jenkins did an admirable job in sticking to as it was written, not only in revelation, but also in the other Second Coming prophecies that are scattered throughout the Bible. It also places it in an exciting format that will and has attracted many un-believers. There will always be critics of these books, mostly non-Christians who did not even bother picking up the books or the Bible, who will brazenly say, \\"If you want to know what happens, read John's book of Revelation.\\" In doing so, they show their own lack of reading that very book in the Bible. These stories are wonderful and I highly recommend them to all ages! They are also great witnessing tools because even if the reader doesn't accept Christ now, they will after the church is raptured!

Shame about the tripod straps","review":"This pack is good. We just took a trip to Europe and I had no concerns about the safety of my camera and lenses. The pockets are well-padded, and easily adjusted to fit any size of camera and most lenses. It also has numerous side pockets for little gadgets - spare memory card, remote shutter release, USB card reader, etc. etc.A minor niggle is that the chest strap is too high. It feels like the bag is getting ready to strangle me. But I find the bag very comfortable and secure to wear without this strap anyway, so I just leave it undone.The only thing I really dislike about this bag is the straps that hold on the tripod. They're fiddly to operate, take far too much time to tie the tripod, and are prone to slip loose. I would have much preferred some sort of rubber-backed velcro arrangement. A real design flaw on an otherwise excellent bag, this earns it 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a keeper for me.","review":"The story is outlined in depth by another reader and it's a good plot/story line actually. My problem is that I really liked the second half of the book when the plot thickened and characters became real but I hated the first half. The \\"heroine\\" starts off as a real turn off with her backwoodsy, live in a cave, dirty feet, etc...unreality. By the middle of the book she gets cleaned up some and becomes more appealing.

The shutter release has even more of a delay. Forget action shots unless you photograph sloths and tortoises...3. The case it comes with is huge. I can't see the point of making a camera so small then supplying a case so large.Having said all this, the results from the one film I put through it were fine. So if you take pictures of things that don't move and you don't mind lugging the enormous case around, you may be happy.PS.

Well he learned right away and was able to teach his 2 1/2 year old sister how to play. Now 3 months later they are still playing it at least 3 times a week without parental supervision. On top of it, my 2 1/2 year old knows all of her shapes, colors and numbers. I can not say enough about how fun and educational this toy is. Even if your child knows all their colors, shapes etc., it doesn't get boring because they still have to find the missing balls. Huge hit!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"4 1/2 year board with game!","review":"It's fun and educational, but too simple. They match cards to pictures on board, such as shapes, colors and numbers (up to 4). Unfortunately, it is not challanging enough. My 4 year old was board with it after playing twice and my six year even more. And, honestly, as a parent most of my kids' games bore me, but this was the worst!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first game!","review":"A perfect first game for our 3 yo. My daughter is delighted with the magic key (which is a nice fine motor skills exercise), the rubber balls and with the chance to practice her numbers and letters. It's a collaborative game which is great since she doesn't \\"get\\" competition yet. She seems to recognize the campy fun in the treasure chest at the end -- it's not a big reward, but something fun to end on. I can see where this would be boring for a 4.5 yo, but if you have an advanced 2.5 (recognizes some letters, can count to four and no longer puts items in his mouth) or 3 yo on your shopping list, this game will offer a lot of fun and is a nice introduction to the concept of games. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Birthday Present","review":"We originally got this game as a present on my daughter's third birthday. We loved it so much, we have given many away to our little friends when they turned three. It's a great, fun game that is educational, too. Kids just can't resist giggling with joy everytime the treasure chest opens. This a no-brainer great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The age range is a little generous...","review":"...but I guess its tough to market a toy with an age range of 2.5~3 years. My daughter was about 3 1/2 when we bought Cranium Cariboo for her for Christmas 2004. She does enjoy it, but its a little limited in scope. It only teaches 4 colors (red, yellow, green, blue), 3 letters (A-C), 4 numbers (1-4), and 3 shapes (square, circle, triangle). There wasn't much learning involved for her as she already knew all the colors, the majority of the alphabet, numbers through 15 or so, and all her shapes.She does enjoy looking for the treasures (rubber balls) though, even if she's not really learning anything. The game still has her interest and she asks to play it; I'll have to see how it holds up long-term.If the Cranium people are reading this, one suggestion would be to have replacable cards so you can insert new categories, colors, numbers, etc. I guess you could make your own with some card stock...?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs more cards!","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviews regarding the supplemental cards. How much could it cost to add a second set or for that fact sell them separately. After playing the game twice my 3 year old was finished with it. There no more challenge for her. I can't believe the age range is up to six years old.The game is so basic. Primary color recognition. Very basic shape recognition, circle, square, triangle, and \\"a\\", \\"b\\", and \\"c\\" letters only.I would love to buy some additional cards because my daughter loves this game.On the fun side. The concept is great. Kids love a suprise and after matching a card they get to look to see if they got a very pretty colored ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Easy for the Age Range given","review":"My 4 year old received this for Christmas. This game is too easy for him and hasn't taught him anything new. The age range for the game is given as 3-6 but if your child already knows blue, red, yellow, green, can recognize A, B, C, knows a circle, square, and triangle, and can count up to 4 objects then the game will teach your child nothing new. I would say the age range is better from 2-3.5. It is too bad that Cranium doesn't make and additional set of cards that have more numbers and letters on it. I guess I can make my own but for $$ it should be included."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Better Than Candyland","review":"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year-old to play and was amazed that right away she understood the concept of taking turns (whoever holds the key, takes the turn). She also easily grasped the concepts of matching the colors, shapes, letters and numbers after only playing once. To mix it up a bit sometimes I hide something else in the treasure box so it's not the same purple jewel every time at the end (sometimes a toy ring, raisins, etc.).Even though this game has two levels, I wish that that there were more sets of cards we could buy so my daughter is just not stuck with learning 3 letters of the alphabet and just a few colors. The game comes with two sets of cards... the \\"beginner\\" cards only allow young children the chance to recognize the letters A-C as well as red, yellow, blue, green. Then it's on to the \\"advanced\\" pack for A-Z (and no more colors). I wish other packs were available to cover other groups of letters as well as other colors (Cranium, are you listening?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game, not great","review":"My kids like this game, but usually tire of it after three or four rounds. The concept is very simple and each round has very little variation and as a result, my 4 & 6 year old sons don't stick with it for too long. It's a great game for younger children working on ABCs, colors, shapes, and taking turns. A couple of notes... The cards that slide in to each opening aren't too durable so watch out if you have a younger one who likes to tear things. Also, my kids quickly figured out that they could spot where the balls were by looking in to the open doors and quickly started cheating! It would be nice if the balls were a little less visable once the doors were open. Overall, this is a fun game and a good value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first game for little ones","review":"Fabulous game for little ones! My daughters loved it when they were 2 and 3 and still ask to play it even now that they know their ABC's and 123's quite well. It's a great game even when you can't play it the \\"real way\\"...very few games are like that without running the risk of losing all the pieces! I'd highly recommend it for young ones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great game for all!","review":"I am an early intervention/early childhood teacher and think that this game is great! My little boy will be three years old in a couple of weeks and he really enjoys the game. It gets a bit tough trying to keep him attending to the real rules of the game, but when he gets tired of \\"learning\\", he can put the balls in the holes and use the key to open the doors and find them! He loves using keys and this is fun for him. I'm glad that I paid a few dollars more for a game other than the usual board games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun but could be better with one change","review":"My 5yr old loves this game! It's one she can play over & over, sometimes even by herself. My one problem with the game is that the \\"doors\\" that are unlocked do not have interchangeable cards. By the 5th round of playing, my daughter had practically memorized the board. Being able to change the cards on the doors would make the game much more challenging. Other than that one alteration, this game is excellent for preschoolers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game","review":"My 2 and a half year old loves this game. It is quick to play and easy to understand. It can be played almost immediately out of the box. It helps if your child knows colors and basic shapes and the letters ABC and numbers 1-4 somewhat, but can reinforce that as well. My son has learned to bend down to spot the balls, but since you still have to get a matching card to open that door, it's not really much of an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game. Does what it's intended to.","review":"My 2 and a half year old and 5 year old paly this game and both love it. Once your child know A-B-C, 1-2-3, and colors, it can get rather easy, but my 5 year old still likes to use the key and find the balls and make the treasure chest open at the end. My 2 and a half year old uses it to learn the colors, numbers and letters, so it does what it is intended to do. It's good because it is learning, but doesn't feel like learning, just fun. Also, it just reinforces my 5 year old's mastery of these things and is fun sometimes to play a game like this so you feel like the smarter one! Very good game! Well worth the money for appropriate age group."},{"rating":"1","title":"No brainpower required for this \\"Cranium\\"","review":"It looks like a neat toy, and is fun to use, but it becomes boring after a short time, even for young children. There is no strategy, and no brain power involved. With a little thought, the game makers could have made this a game that would keep kids and parents interested longer. An o.k. first game for 3 year olds, but I wouldn't waste money on it. A much better choice: good old Candyland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm missing something...","review":"I was excited to play this game with my 3.5 year old daughter after reading all the stellar reviews. I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. I think the concept is great, and my daughter loves playing with the balls and opening the doors with the key, but I think it could have come with additional cards to vary the game up a bit. I don't think it even has enough cards to cover all the letters in the alphabet. I flipped the cards over and tried the \\"advanced\\" version, but we conquered that in 1 night. I just expected more from this game. Overall, I think there are better learning games out there for the age range."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun for a while but save your money","review":"I bought this game because I heard it won so many educational awards, but actually, it is a boring game. It was fun for the first few plays then was set aside. I e-mailed Cranium to see if there were any different cards for the game board, maybe to shake things up a little. They told me they were making more but I have not seen a thing. Several months ago they e-mailed me and asked if we would like to be on a \\"preview board\\" for new cards, I responded but they have never replied. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning toy--fun for everyone!","review":"This is a great toy. My daughter has figured out all the letters and pictures, colors, and shapes.

I like how the edition we received for my 4 yr. old has beginner cards & advanced cards. The beginner set allows kids to match letters, numbers, and colors with doors on the game board. Great fine motor skills are used for turning the key for each door! Advanced cards provide decoding practice, beginning reading skills, advacned counting, etc.We play this game over and over. LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cariboo is better than TV!","review":"My son played this game all day! The television never got turned on! Levi was as excited to play this game with us as by himself. He played it over and over again. I'm sure the initial excitement will wear off- but every visitor to our home is sure to be offered the Cariboo challenge!Other good points-- there is not a lot of set-up involved to play this game. The game is fairly self-contained--the pieces tend not to stray too far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for 3-year-olds!","review":"This is my 3-year-old's favorite game. It is not super challenging for her, but that's OK. Some of the games out there for 3-year-olds are actually fairly difficult to play, with complicated rules that are hard for young ones to comprehend. Cranium Cariboo is simple and straightforward, which means no frustration for me or my daughter.

Our 4 1/2- and 3-year-olds played this for about three rounds before they lost interest in the \\"concept\\" of the game, and basically just wanted to play with the \\"treasure balls.\\" Even the \\"advanced\\" play was easy for the children, and, really, how exciting is opening the same treasure chest with the same chintzy purple jewel over and over and over again anyway? The one good thing that I do have to say about the game is that it is not competitive but rather team work-oriented, but overall it was a waste of money. Cranium could have done better for its preschool gamers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning game","review":"I bought this game because it was requested by my childs speech teacher.

It is good now as it was when I first saw it. I only wish it was originally filmed in color.Originally done in 1959, there was a remake done in 2000 that was a made-for-TV mini series. Although it was somewhat updated, I still prefer the original movie with Gregory Peck (although the remake did fill some holes the original movie failed to address).On The Beach is very sobering about the implications after a full-scale nuclear war. What would have made this a \\"5\\" star is if there were two DVD's included showing cuts/deleted scenes, the science involved, and a commentary from the remaining cast and crew involved in the filming of On The Beach.I recommend the original black & white movie.

I recommend this film highly, for the older Seasoned members whom were living at the time the film was Made. Circa 1959. I must however recommend the remake, If you have not seen the Showtime On the Beach remake, you are missing a lot, The remake brings the futuristic setting, a War between China and The USA. Highly believable, Special effects. It stars Armand Assante, Bryon Brown, And Rachel Ward, of the Thornbirds fame.

A lone figure running down an otherwise empty Australian beach -- on what may be a humanless world -- is a hard image to shake. Escaping to the beach does not always guarantee a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product of the times, as bad as they were","review":"One of the strangest, most disjunct, dully polemical and just plain bad films to come out of the period. It's as if 3 movies were put in a blender and whipped together: tiresome distopian polemic, love story and submarine epic. How anybody could call Kramer's directing to be brilliant is a total mystery to me. About as subtle as being hit over the head. Ava Gardner looks dissipated and everyone seems to be sleepwalking. The sets are weirdly sanitized, and not one corpse is ever seen, leading you to believe that perhaps everybody just went on vacation and didn't bother to tell the Navy."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the Boring Side","review":"This movie was SO DISAPPOINTING!! Ava Gardner was irritating with her lack of acting skills. Gregory Peck was not convincing as a smitten man. In fact, he must not have been smitten not to have stayed to be with her at the very end.

Very sorry I bought this."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the Beach","review":"On the beach did have interesting scientific information.

I think it is impossible not to laugh at this film. Bruce Willis is a natural comedic talent, proven by Moonlighting.No matter how many times I watch this movie I always enjoy it.I would reccomend this movie to anyone regardless of age who want to watch a real comedy. There is no thinking required, just entertainment. If you do start thinking it only gets funnier....and funnier.The whole cast does a great job and use their natural talents. There is not a weak link in the cast. A great comedy film that is really under rated. Why are movies like this always overlooked by critics and awards?"},{"rating":"1","title":"very run of the mill Material","review":"this film was a Extension of those Seagram Commercials.Bruce Willis&Kim Basinger together on screen won't make anyone forget Basinger&Mickey Rourke from 9 1/2 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as I remembered it","review":"I saw this movie back then. And I can remember thinking this was another 80s movie showing a spoiled American generation who had no respect for anything . . . that was wasteful and greedy. Well I watched again it recently and it didn't seem all that bad. I mean it was typically 80s . . . for sure. But after having seen just disasters like Bridesmaids and The Hangover . . . this movie seemed quiet controlled. I just realized in hindsight that Kim Basinger plays a lot of characters who can't seem to hold their alcohol . . . or who seem to react strongly to it . . . . Anyway she was not a blond back then. She had brown hair in this movie. Whatever. The movie's ending was true Hollywood. And the clothes and house was all 80s. Good to reminisce with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love at First Drunk?","review":"Storyline very contrived as Kim and Bruce profess their love for each other on a rather slick squeaky sofa/chair after one long extended blind date. It just didn't make sense, you really have to suspend belief that their relationship barely a week old and bereft with alcoholic stupors could be genuine. Rent it if you want, Larroquette is funny as the obsessive crazed ex-boyfriend and Bruce has fun with this as his first screen outing and Bassinger plays drunk fairly well. But unless you can find it in a bargain bin, it's not worth buying"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful! I can't believe I bought it!","review":"There was too much sexual innuendo for me to get past in order to enjoy the movie. I watched long ago and did not remember so much trash.

A scene showed male and female genitalia (art exhibit), a coworker who details his sexual escapades, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moronic","review":"The so-called humor in this embarrassingly awful and unfunny movie is so uncreative and moronic. It is apparently for a demographic of viewers with an extremely childish sense of humor. A three year old will laugh at anything. Every turn of the plot is stupid. This is in the running for the worst movie ever made. I don't trust the taste of anyone who actually was impressed by this horse manure. I hope that Bruce Willis would have the class to turn down a role like this if he was offered it now. I think he is a very good actor. It's a shame what kind of garbage he had to be in, to get his career going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old but funny","review":"Old but funny, buy for a good laugh, and you will have a funny evening.

Her sentences are jumbled and all over the place which makes for a terrible uneven flow. She describes 5 or more characters in 3 pages which has me so confused as who is who..I even tried 'The Right Address' and felt the same inexperienced nonsense and hoopla.

Clearly living on the fumes and riding the coat tails of the stories listed above, Wolves In Chic Clothing is just one glass of cheap champagne.The story centers on a group od NY society womens who adopt a young and stylish girl to be their project (hello My Fair Lady). And yawn, all the clumsy descriptive curly-ques. Talk of \\"well heeled\\" Manolo wearing, Prada toting bitchy inner intrigue of a bunch of characters who are as boring as predictable.The story line boils down to some tired and dated message of \\"Rich people are bad people\\", \\"Poor people are real people\\".Don't waste your time. Buy yourself a DVD of Sex In The City, Or Devil Wears Prada for the real thing.Wolves In Chic clothing is the Designer Imposter of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, gossipy read","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot more than I first expected to upon reading the basic plot.

Julia, their endearing heroine, finds only disaster when she falls under the dangerous spell of glitz and glamour. When she meets the ringleader of a group of manipulative Manhattan elitist girls, they take her on as their \\"winter project,\\" intending to make her over into one of their own. It's a fun story that includes many yummy jabs at the sometimes moral corruptness of New York high society. I liked it! I totally look forward to their next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible trite garbage","review":"After spending two hours reading a paperthin plot with plastic characters I could not believe I wasted my time or money.

Garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Even though, I could point out a few flaws in the story line (you cannot afford a 2 bedroom apartment in Manhattan on a sales clerk's salary!), I did enjoy the book.

Gimlet-eyed authors Karasyov and Kargman have crafted an Eliza Doolittle tale that is by turns biting, hilarious, and poignant: a true snapshot of a certain set in a certain place at a certain time that will appeal to a wide readership. I stayed up way past my bedtime finishing it (in one sitting!) and cannot recommend it highly enough. Julia felt like a friend by the book's conclusion. Will now read \\"The Right Address\\" and look forward to future books by this talented pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful Book!","review":"Horrible, cliche-ridden. Probably entertaining for anyone under 21, but just really bad. And don't get me started on the horrid narrator in the Audio version. Every aspect of this woeful story rings false and forced.

Definitely recommend it if you like chick lit!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"Yikes! I usually like chic-lit now and then, especially when it takes place in NYC....but this was just a waste. It was very immature, and badly written. The plot was all over the place, the characters were foolish and it was hardly humorous. I much prefer chic-lit writing that is witty, and perhaps makes a little sense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glamour girl chick-lit...","review":"I've read other books that fall into this chick lit sub-category (Bergdorf Blondes, etc) and found that there is a thin line between love and hate of the uber-rich who star in these stories. The protagonist usually is someone who is not \\"born\\" into the lifestyle, so we can usually side with her. However, if the protagonist is just completely clueless, well, do we have to? In this story, a group of heiresses decide to take Julia Pearce, a salesgirl, under their wing...until something better comes along to distract them at least. Julia, who was supposed to be so \\"down to earth\\" doesn't bat an eyelash when her new \\"friends\\" get her a promotion, a makeover, and a fake pedigree. Add in some more stock characters (like the token gay best friend) and you've got the bulk of the story. Can anyone else see how this will end? Sure, chick-lit can be formulaic sometimes, but come on here ladies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend after she gave it a great review. I was hopeful at the beginning, but the book dragged on and I had to force myself to finish it. It was very immature, poorly written, and the plot was all over the place.

Not worth the time or money.. skip this one and read an original not set in NYC Chick Lit Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not waste your time or money","review":"I saw a lot of hype around this novel. I recentley saw it in my local library and I decided to check it out before buying it. I usually enjoy the author's work-but I did not enjoy this book at all. It is filled with unlikebale characters and a boat load of stereotypes. The writing is boring-I read only about half of it unitil I got bored to tears and flipped to the back to read the ending. Please save your time and money-this is not a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Purchase I've Ever Made!!","review":"This tutu should not even have been released to sell. It is a piece of junk. Other reviews say it would be for a 3 year old or younger but it will not even fit a two year old! My daughter is two and average sized, so on her the body is too short and the straps are too long. It does not even cover her chest and then you have the wonderful tutu part that sticks straight up, maybe this part was meant to cover the chest area! Then you bring out the slippers that are included, which are way too big for a two year old. Basically, I would not recommend this item for any child, no matter the age!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tutu TOOO small","review":"The size for this item is said to be for child 3-10. When I received this item the tag clearly read size4-6. My child is average size for 7 years old. She could not have worn this 2 years ago. The item needs to be clearly posted with the actual size.

The tutu is absolutely ridiculous! It was either sewn wrong or packaged wrong so the tutu sticks straight up! We have tried everything to fix it and it will not lay down. It is poorly made and very disappointing for my 4 yo who wants to dance like the ballerinas on the video...and she is a small 4 yo and the bodice is under her breast line. No way it will fit an older kid. They need to revamp this product if they are going to market it. I am disgusted that you put this on shelves. I should have spent the money on a real ballet set for her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made correctly","review":"It fit my 3 year old okay, but probably won't last much longer. The skirt does stick straight up. I think they sewed them upside down. We also have to return it... The straps for over the shoulder aren't very durable.

Not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly small","review":"My daughter turned four last month and is tall and skinny (40 inches tall, 37 pounds). The top of the outfit falls about an inch below her nipples. Yikes!!! Luckily we had a pink leotard already so she is allowed to wear the tutu with the leotard. The tutu stuck straight up in the back for a day or two, but has since given in to gravity and looks a bit better now. The shoes fit pretty well-- she wears a 9 or 91/2 to give you an idea. They look like they will fit for another year but I doubt the tutu will still fit after a few months once she grows any taller. I agree with the other reviewers... for the price, there should be a huge recall on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"My friends 5 1/2 year old daughter was so bored that after watching the DVD the first time, she asked if we could take it back to the store.

She is very tiny for her age. She's 4 years old now, I bought it for her when she was 3. It was too small then and is way too small now.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents Not pleased","review":"My 5 yr. old daughter loves anything ballet. The DVD is great, she picked up on the movements in only a couple of days but the tutu is so small. She is very thin but tall but the age range says to age 8 so we figured it would work for her. No! She really wants to keep the thing but the tutu sticks straight up in the air. I have never seen a tutu like that. The company needs to rethink their design, it's like we are supposed to use these on dolls. If you have a one year old maybe it would be worth buying then."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing!","review":"We bought this for our granddaughter and she was so diappointed because it didn't fit.

It should have come in different sizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"extra, extra, extra small!","review":"Like the other reviewers, we purchased 2 of these for our daughters - 4 and 2 years old. It is even too small for my tiny, 23 pound 2 year-old!!!! What a rip off. When they put them on, the tutu skirt points directly upwards under their armpits and thir chests hang out above the top. They will be extremely upset when I have to return them as they were gifts from Santa Claus. The sizes DEFINATELY have to be redesigned. Great idea, poor product (Unless, of course, someone thinks their 1 year-old would appreciate a tutu!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!","review":"I agree with the other reviews - the size on this is wrong. The description states that this is for a 3-10 year old. My daughter is only 5 and is small for her age and this thing is way too small for her.

Do not buy this unless your child is 3 or under."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!","review":"This outfit is terrible. My daughter was so excited when it came in the mail.

My daughter is 5 and wears a size 5. You would think she could use this item. Wrong. It looks like it barely fits a 3 year old. So unless your child is 3 or younger...don't bother. Save your self the hassle of all the crying and whining and trying to explain why the tutu is to small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also very disappointed","review":"I agree with all the reviews on the small size and poor quality of the tutu. My 4-year old wears a size 4T and is definitely too big for this item which supposedly \\"fits size 4-6.\\" The \\"top\\" of the tutu hit well below chest level and the skirt stuck straight up in air.

We laughed so hard that we embarrased her so. It was SO tight on her and the tutu itself stuck straight up in the air. I tried to exchange it at the store and found that they had no larger sizes, she was in tears! After reading some of the reviews, I am going to try contacting the company directly also. I would advise you to only purchase this for small girls under the age of 3. It is a very darling costume and my daughter is very anxious to get a new one that fits!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tutu too small","review":"My 3 yr old daughter LOVED her tutu, but it fit weird! She is a peanut, but the tutu exposed her chest, (it is very low cut), and the tutu part stuck straight up in the air, while her tushy was exposed a bit from the bottom.

Cute idea, but the fit needs to be worked on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Junk and way too small for a 3 1/2 year old","review":"You have got to be kidding. What junk for the price. My daughter LOVES the Bella Dancerella DVD, so I purchased this set to go along with it so she would look just like the girls on the show. It is not made well at all. The shoulder straps are worthless and it is made for at best a 2 year old size.

I wouldn't listen to Valerian every day, but every couple of months it sounds fresh again. In Next Voyage, Saisse continues a fine pianist, but this is drowned out by his garish programmed drums, and the fluidity of Saisse's song-writing (on Valerian) disappears into the monotony of his version of smooth jazz. Aargh - I'm selling this to the local record store for 50 cents, you can buy it there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Outstanding!","review":"Sit Back. Chill.

In fact I bought the book as a reference for 60s color scheme & rock posters but retro artwork added up to abt 30 odd pages out of the 240...I'm thinking contemporary fine-art artists/lovers might take to this book with more enthusiasm than illustrators or graphic designers, despite this, the book still manages to inspire me with Max's whimsical use of paint colors and his contribution to society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you!","review":"The book arrived in great condition.

Max's art is made of bright vibrant swirling colors that make one feel...happy to be alive. This big coffee table book has accompanying essays that discuss Max's life and work and place him in the context of history, but it's an easy to read essay and fun to read.

Max essentially penned the pages of Pop Art as the people's artist by making access a vital concept.The beautiful layout of this intriguing volume is a retrospective on Max's life, though with an emphasis on his more recent - Americana - explorations.

The product was completely ineffective on urine stains on my terrazzo floors. The product I normally use removes all traces of stains within seconds. As the \\"urine gone!\\" product states it has a 30 day money back guarantee, I contacted customer service and was told I could not receive a refund because I purchased the product at a store. The store, of course, states I can not receive a refund because the manufacturer offers a refund. In my conversation with the customer service rep.

After treating everything that came up under the black light (some stains were treated upwards of 3+ times to make sure they were removed), we lifted the carpet to inspect the pad.

As the title suggests, the books addresses the roles of Father, Son, and Spirit and the relationship that exists between them.Dr. Ware's main purpose in the book is to demonstrate that the distinction between the persons in the Trinity is not a distinction of essence. That cannot be because they each share the same essence (i.e, they are all three equally God).

It features excellent cinematography & good acting - especially by David Carradine playing Guthrie. I learned a great deal more about the Oklahoma dust bowl, how the hobos who rode the rails were treated, and about how some folks managed to eke out a living during the Depression. The movie highlights one of the several unpleasant episodes in California history - portraying the injustices against depression-era migrant workers that Woody Guthries speared in his music, and wrote of in his autobiography. Unfortunately, some of these injustices, now targeted at immigrant workers from Mexico & Central America, persist to this day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fictionalized history of Woody","review":"Since I already knew something about Woody Guthrey's story I was very disappointed by how far this wandered from the truth of his life story, they fabricated some parts, changed the context of facts and totally ignored his later life, including his battle with Huntington's disease. If you want to watch a slow moving too long remake of the Grapes of Wrath then you'll like this movie, but if you want to learn the much more interesting true history get American Masters: Woody Guthrie: Ain't Got No Home, A Vision Shared: A Tribute to Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly or Woody Guthrie: This Machine Kills Fascists"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worse quality ever for a timeless masterpiece","review":"I have bought this dvd because I read other reviews and I understood that the quality of this edition was very good.

The only problems with it are that the space on both ends that I believed I could store electrical cords on does not provide adequate space. When storing tools like shovels it is best to store them with the shovel end down as if too many tools have the tool end up the cart is not heavy enough to support them and will fall over.

Bends and bows over time. Not sturdy.","review":"When I first bought this it appeared to be a great, portable tool storage unit. It might have stayed that way had I only stored light-weight yard tools on it, but with the weight of shovels, edgers and an ax or two, it has bowed and swayed to the point where it is unstable unless it is propped up against something.

The only solution was to toss the wheels in the trash and lay a 2x4 on the ground to support the base. Even with that modification it is still very wobbly when removing or replacing tools from the front clamps; need one hand to hold the rack and one for the shovel. Considering the poor design, this would be an okay deal at $30. But at $45 it's a bad value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but cheap","review":"This review may be the result of my choosing to go cheap to get the job done. The product is fairly well made for the price but is quite flimsy for my application. Namely hauling snorkel gear and assorted goodies around.Used for hauling clothes only I still feel the product is marginal at best. It is large, but when you make something that will barely do large is a bad thing. Spend your money wisely and avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"If you like this type of film,-you will probably give it 4 or 5 stars. I don't. I bought this video mainly because Vangelis did the music and I am a Vangelis fan and collector. There was practically no music by Vangelis in the film. So I give the film 1 star for the actors and 1 star for the very small amount of Vangelis music. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Daring and Original Movie","review":"This movie in an involving story about a couple of prudes(Hugh Grant and Kristen Scott Thomas) meeting up with a wild couple on a cruise and hearing all the lurid detials about their lives.

For a one of a kind movie check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A disturbing, yet compulsive, film!","review":"If you have ever felt you have been in a dysfunctional relationship, think again. The obsessive, sado-masachistic connection between the two main characters has to be seen to be believed. The lengths they go to to cause each other pain are positively frighteneing. It is well worth seeing though, if you are at all interested in films about relationships.The contrast between the relationships of the two couples is very clever and the additional spin of adding flashbacks to the film gives it that extra edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Boring","review":"I find that the film was very long because it did not depict anything new as the story enfolded. A relationship between two people who are so engrossed in each other for superficial reasons is bound to fail. What is boring is that the only thing they had interest in was sex. The script does not instruct the audience about what two people who are in love can do to further their relationship. It does not depict interesting situations like manipulation or control or playing hard to get, etc. It does depict how cruel one partner can be to another. Moreover, why a victim in a relationship would not want to leave and find someone else is unrealistic. A dog or cat would be a better companion than Peter Coyote's character. I find the revelation of the failed relationship uninteresting and the sexual obsession shallow. I would not find it entertaining to ever see this film again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitter Moon Casts a Bright Light","review":"\\"Bitter Moon\\" directed by the amazing Roman Polanski is gorgeously photographed, impeccably acted by one and all, magnificently scored and with a story that will knock your socks off, both literally and figuratively! This may well be Polanski's best film. It most probably is his most personal.Watch it with knowing as little as possible about it. Be drawn into it the way you would be drawn into a carnival sideshow. The sideshow here is about sex...and love...and life...and, of course, death. This is a movie about passion and carnal questions and questings and the sado-masochistic impulses that work the puppet strings of the human race. It is a comedy and a tragedy, simultaneously. It is over-the-top and below-the-belt, simultaneously. It is arguably the best film ever made about the male/female sexual and romantic dynamic and dichotomy.\\"Bitter Moon\\" does, indeed, cast a bright light on the deepest yearnings and burnings of men and women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be happy with what you have...","review":"I don't know why, but I am mesmerized by this movie...

This is a long movie, but at times feels like an eternity. Superb casting, but the story?

It was difficult to care for any character other than the one played by Kristin Scott Thomas. Her performance, and a surprising twist near the end - which alone kept me from regretting seeing the entire film - brought the dark, ugly, unfunny movie up to two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives you some background","review":"I wanted to get some background on the events leading up to the passage of the embryonic stem cell legislation that Obama signed this year.

It is basically the history for which I was looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Yawn","review":"As a biochemistry major I was very excited about reading this book. I expected it to have in depth details on cloning and mention true clones such as identical twins. What a disappointment. The book went on and on for numerous pages about the ethical ramifications of cloning (yes, those exact same ethical ramifications TV and newspapers dealt with ad nauseam). Which yes, are important, but not enough to drone on about especially after readers have heard them all 10 times before. I actually found myself sighing and rolling my eyes over some of the ethical stances that were mentioned because they were so silly. I continued reading the book for a while in hopes that it would get better. It didn't. I finally threw the book under my bed (the black hole of bookdom) without ever finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faithful Treatment of Bunyan's Great Work","review":"Having studied Bunyan and the Puritans for many years, this recent DVD film of \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" was a real treat for me. It proved to be faithful to Bunyan's story, only updating the original flow when necessary for a more practical application. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to show it to our entire church family at a Saturday afternoon fellowship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilgrims Progress","review":"Not bad - followed the book pretty well but not as well done as I was led to believe.

In many places it was nearly word-for-word. The main actor did an especially convincing job; the lowish quality of the special effects was a bit distracting in parts, but not bad at all. Overall, a great work that should encourage many Christians in their walk. The evangelistic message was powerfully strong. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie.","review":"I was happy how fast it came. It was a very interesting movie.

Do not waste your money.Thanks and God bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"depends what you like...","review":"i don't want to be critical about this as in saying the movie was stupid, but it just felt like it got a bunch of people form church to make this movie. i understand a modern version of the film, but i believe if it had a budget it could have looked like Lord of the Rings or at very least Naria or Amazing Grace. The effects were like made for Christian TV. It felt like the movie was trying to be Christian rather than just being what it should have been. I don't think the movie was worth watching unless you love movie made for TV, then go right ahead and enjoy. As I said, if it had a budget it could have been great depending on the director. Amazing Grace and Naria did have an anointing on parts of them. The best part about that is, the directors weren't even Christians at all. Now that's God moving and doing what He wants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Woe, this will put you to sleep. It did me within about 5 minutes.

Movie may be ok for just a movie. But, as a Christian movie I give it 2 thumbs down. The movie does not line up with Bible scripture. It missed the mark when it comes to the Journey to Heaven.

The answers given in following Pilgrim's life should have an impact on the viewers. Nice presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing attempt on a classic!!","review":"The portrayal of this very worthy and well-known classic story is sadly weak. The idea to start it out in a modern setting was perhaps its strongest point. Appolyon is a person dressed in black with a white mask who is neither scary nor dangerous. He makes a person laugh. Why don't film makers do something serious? Appolyon should have looked and sounded like the Balrog in \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" The armor that Christian is given is a bit of ridiculous plastic. \\"Prince Caspian,\\" is authentic because he wears real armor. For interesting illustrations for this classic, I would suggest, \\"Dangerous Journey,\\" William B. Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, Michigan. I would not suggest purchasing this version of \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" This version is a real shame and perhaps could even discredit this allegory of Christian conversion and progression until reaching heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BAD ACTING !!","review":"I tried to sit through this, but the acting was terrible. The main character Christian was not too bad, but the others were just terrible. The whole movie was confusing.. I like Christian movies, but this I just couldnt finish. The special effects werent too bad, and the actual quality of shooting was pretty good, but I cant watch a movie with such bad actor's in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film lacks progress","review":"Pilgrims Progress - Journey to Heaven was a disappointment. I tried to give this movie the benefit of a doubt knowing how difficult it would be to make John Bunyon's story into a movie. But the quality was very low and the acting was terrible. I never finished watching the movie to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some might like it. . . I hated it.","review":"This movie was poorly produce and poorly acted - things which can be overlooked if the story is told well. So, I thought \\"How can you beat Pilgrim's Progress - it is a classic of Christianity?\\" Unfortunately, this is not John Bunyan's story. Oh, it is faithful to many of the elements of the original but there are additions and subtractions that change the story. In the book, when Christian is at the cross and his burden falls off it rolls into the empty tomb - one of the most important images in the whole story. In the movie the burden simply dissapears.The pace of the movie is very slow and they fill the space with evangelical cliches which over simplify the gospel. Bunyan would be dissapointed with the theology imported into his story. This dumbing down of Evangelical Christianity is prevelant through the movie.I was dissapointed with the acting, the special effects and the changed theology. Don't waste your time with this one. Read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film but NOT in German! (Kein Deutscher Intertitel!)","review":"Although I imagined that this film would be shown as authentically as was possible, I was terribly disappointed that I had no option to view it with the original, German, intertitles. There were, of course, English ones, that were quite well created using the German ones as a guide, typestyle and all, which I thought was a great touch, but I did expect that I would at least have the option of seeing it in its original form, and then also have the option for English subtitles, or maybe even better, intertitles. As a student of German, and that being one of the reasons I ordered this DVD, I was very disapppointed in its lack of \\"original film as created\\" option. Otherwise, a great mountain film, with specatacular natural vistas captured and a feeling of the time and the place which lingers on in a modern person's mind and imagination! Quite a great experience, but just a little disappointing for the German student!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A drama poem with scenes from nature","review":"The Holy Mountain is considered one of the best Bergfilms (mountain movies) ever, and the final scene \\"His world\\", in which we see the allucination of the protagonist, as he dies up high on a mountain, is an absolute masterpiece. The movie is interesting for several reasons. The dancing of Leni Riefenstahl, the new music of Aljoscha Zimmermann (a real pity the original soundtrack of Edmund Meisel has been lost), the experimentation with blue light, and the gorgeous images from the Alps. It is somewhat interesting to note that the initial dance scene (Diotima on the sea) had originally been thought for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, something almost impossible to fathom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Practical","review":"This is an excellent book for teachers in all content areas. The book offers several strategies to prepare students before reading a text, to assist them during reading, and to engage them in postreading activities.

The battery pak mentioned that can be used with this printer is available through DELL. It may take a bit of searching to find it. Click on Printers, then look for the Canon BJC-85, then click on more details under the printer icon, then related products on the next screen. It does not state for BJC-85 but it is the correct battery pack or ask Dell for reassurance, I did! I have been very pleased with the print quality of such a small printer, even the graphics are great. For Word Processing that requires mostly black ink, use the large BCI-10 Ink Cartridge it is better than the small black tank you use with color printing. I have not been able to locate the Infrared Driver for it does anyone know where that can be acquired?

Its stayed in my office since then, as I've had to reason to use it. When I did, it kept giving me an error message. I took it out yesterday to try to figure out what was wrong: I get an error about an incorrect cartridge or some such nonsense. It had the canon black cartridge in it. The same one it printed from last time. So I am not a happy camper. I actually tried putting a new cartridge in, with same result.

Now I'm in the market for a printer that will actually work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor output and very slow.","review":"I really wonder why people rave at this printer. It's terribly slow and the color output is truly awful.

I can't say I'm too pleased with it. It's noisy and does an awful lot of clicking and clacking to start, print a page, or shut down. The error light seems to come on too often, and figuring out what's wrong with it is a real challenge. The cartridge replacement is a hassle and if you're not fast enough the cartridge returns to its home position and won't come back out. The combination of buttons you need to push to get it out again is ridiculous (e.g., one of the steps involves pushing the cartridge button 16 times! No kidding!) The battery dies in a few days even if the printer is turned off; I guess there's some power consumption even when it's off. Besides, it's about twice the size and weight of the BJC-50.

In this area i have the clip of grip enhancer from pelican, my worm light and even a few games with room for more. But one fantastic feature is the inclusion of two thick elastic bands for tightly holding and protecting your games. Each one could probably hold 3 or 4 games. The case is also attached with a wrist strap and two velcroe strips on the back for attaching to a belt, backpack strap , or what you can think of.

However, what I got from this seller is a box of \\"Elastiant\\" from VetOne. This wierd product looks kinda similar to Elastikon but has a very strong, distinctive odor that is very bothering (unlike the real Elastikon).Elastikon from J&J; should receive 5 stars. But in this review I give only one start because what you get is something called Elastiant from VetOne.Don't buy this product. You will be frustrated for sure.

He presents information from a Western perspective, which I find easier to understand. Here there are specific meditation techniques presented in detail. You are encouraged to practice for a while at each stage using the suggested exercises before continuing on in the book. This book serves as a nice checklist for a complete Buddhist meditation practice, including meditative quiescence (Shamatha), (Buddhist) wisdom meditation, dream yoga and more.Alan Wallace's other book, \\"The Attention Revolution: Unlocking the Power of the Focused Mind\\" would be more appropriate if your interest is specifically in meditative quiescence (mind training)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, if you like down-home 50's slow rock","review":"To tell you the truth, this CD is boring! I just bought it because I love Rose McGowan, and she's in the movie. But the CD is just a bunch of really really REALLY old old old music that makes you want to go to sleep. There's a few songs on there that aren't that bad for instrumental tunes, but overall, the CD ain't nuthing great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill, give us more dialog!","review":"As a European who lived and travelled in the States some years ago, I must say that I was surprised by the very limited number of human contacts Bryson made while travelling through small-town America. He seems to be spending all his time driving alone, eating alone (fast food which he abhors) and sleeping alone, in a country rightly famous for the ease with which you can make new acquaintances.He makes no new friends, never gets invited into a local's house, casual conversation is minimal. Compared to his Aussie book (Down Under) which is rich in hilarious dialog, this one is almost 100% descriptive. If I am not mistaken, this is one of Bryson's first books which is perhaps the reason why his writing technique is not as good as in his later works. Nevertheless, if you are a Bryson fan, by all means buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes amusing but frequently annoying travelogue.","review":"Bill Bryson can be witty and can certainly turn a phrase, but the insights are few and far between in this book. He skewers easy targets; fat, poorly dressed tourists, southern accents, the American dependence on automobiles, strip malls, the decay of Main St mom and pop businesses, interstate highways and tacky tourist traps. There may be a few cliches he missed, but none come to mind. Bill came home to America and discovered that it isn't 1965 and it isn't Europe. Rather than discovering America, he starts with preconceived notions and merely reinforces them. His more recent book \\"A Walk in the Woods\\", is a much more thoughtful look at America and has some genuine insight, read it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cynics Dream","review":"I think the reviewers overrate this book, which leads me to believe that only people who completely enjoy or completely despise books decide to write reviews. If you're cynical, as my last statement proves I am, then you will enjoy Bryson's digs on small town America. But the reality is that he is only contributing to the stereotypes \\"normal\\" Americans love to hear. We want to laugh at accents and old fat people but you may find that some of the things he criticizes we hold dear and will defend. Is there a place on earth he can't find fault with? Approach this book with an open mind and don't take his barbs so seriously. After all, some of Bryson's shortcomings came through in this book whether he knew it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Another Bryson Book...","review":"Bill Bryson drives aimlessly around America by himself and complains. Not his best work. Anyone who tucks into chicken fried steak every night doesn't get to critique restaurants. If he bothered to study about any culture other than Anglo-American, he might enjoy some of the areas he traveled through. He manages to use racial terms I honestly have not heard in three decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but leaves a sour taste","review":"Having been to many of the places Bryson visited in this book, I find myself wondering how he could possibly have had such an apparently unpleasant time. Bryson's wit in this volume is not just biting, it's acidic, even heartless. This book will make you chuckle, but even most of the laughs leave a bad taste in the mouth. I have greatly enjoyed three other Bryson books, but I can't really recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio book is horrible","review":"I'm sorry I didn't read all the reviews on this before I got the audio book from the library - I would have learned more about this horrible audio book. Bill Bryson usually reads his own books and that's really the only way it can be with Bryson's books, because his humor doesn't translate well in other people. Kerry Shale, the fellow reading the book, reads very quickly (too much caffiene that day?) and while his change in voices is good, the overall effect is very bad. I listened for about 20 minutes and since the story was slow in developing I had to turn it off. If you read this one, read the actual book and don't listen to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, unremarkable travelogue","review":"Shallow, unremarkable travelogue that is short on original insight.

So, if the redundant humor/satire and bashes against the US will keep you entertained then go ahead and pick it up. Otherwise, it really wasn't worth it for me. I am glad he has decided to stay in England."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big Disappointment","review":"\\"The Lost Continent\\" is a huge disappointment of a book. Bryson is mean spirited, disrespectful, cynical, redundant, and seldom funny. I have not traveled to most of the states in this book, so it's not as if I was personally insulted by his comments. The only other Bryson Book I have read is a \\"Walk in the Woods\\", so this book is a bit of a surprise. I doubt that I will waste my time reading any of his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adolescent","review":"I am so disappointed with this book. Bryson comes off with an annoying and bitter adolescent attitude in this work. A week before I began reading The Lost Continent, I was lamenting about my nephew's 'blog. --The whole \\"oh gee, I'm soooo much hipper than everyone else and I think I'll make fun of everyone in my writing to prove it.\\" I see little difference between Bryson's book and my nephew's adolescent rantings.I don't have to have a happy ending or a happy book -- but Bryson is simply mean and shallow in his treatment of small town America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good travel reading","review":"This is my first Bill Bryson book, so I can't compare this book to his others. But I can say that I really enjoyed the sarcastic humor at the expense of middle America. Many authors try and fail to bring the same amount of wit to their books as Bill Bryson.Bryson's journey took place in 1988, which makes the book a little dated. But you have to wonder how much less fun the trip would be with a cell phone, email, GPS and Yelp. It's a little depressing to read about how much had changed in this country in 1988, and realize that was 20 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter, cynical middle-age man does America.","review":"Bill Bryson's idea of \\"discovering\\" America is driving a few hundred miles to a new city each day, and stepping no more than 25 paces away from his car. No wonder he's so bitter over everything he finds! Everything he sees is covered with concrete, greasy spoon restaurants and annoying tacky tourists. We don't get any useful information about any place he visits, only cynical commentary on the local fat people, or obnoxious tourist trap. There are a few funny moments, but most of his writing here is so grouchy and listless that the book drags on and on and on. Anyone who can turn up their nose at Yellowstone National Park, and find absolutely no flaw with Wall Drug has missed the point somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cynical, p**** but hilarious counterpoint to Blue Highways","review":"Bill Bryson brings a unique viewpoint to his writing abouttravelling around America. An expatriate for twenty years he returnsto rediscover the land of his youth and--not suprpisingly--he finds that some changes have been made. Most are not to his liking. Some red-blooded American readers may take offense at Bryson's withering descriptions of the denizens of America's small towns, tourists, K-Mart, RVers, scenic highways , southern cops and cultural icons, but I found it insightful and very, very funny. Bryson contrasts the America he remembers from his childhood with the America he encounters upon his return in ways that highlight changes the rest of us might not have noticed or just accepted without too much thought. Some readers may get a little tired of Bryson's chronic crankiness and exaggerated-for-effect descripitions of people or places that arouse his ire but I think they'll find his points are generally right on the nose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can You Laugh Too Much?","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the funniest books that I have ever read. Sometimes I would have to stop reading and do something else for awhile to give my body a chance to cool down from all the laughing. I have since gone out and bought every book that Bryson has written (having lived in England for awhile, Notes From A Small Island was a special treat). You might not like the book if you are a dedicated town booster and Bryson passed through your neighborhood, but if you do like your travelogues packed with wit this is a book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Petulant and smug travelogue","review":"I snatched this up after thoroughly enjoying \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\", but this book has forever put me off of anything else Mr. Bryson will ever write. It's relentlessly arrogant and petty, and overall just extremely tiresome. For someone who harps on and on about the lack of civility from those he encounters, he doesn't really seem capable of displaying any himself. Particularly in his encounters with waitresses he comes off as a first class jackass.If you want a narrow-minded journal of a pathetic anglophile's tour of the US, by all means pick up the book. Personally I think there are better ways to spend one's time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Real Insight into Small-Town America","review":"Appropriate sub-title: 'hemorrhoidal old man, stuck on non-stop Greyhound bus with a broken toilet, shares his view of small-town America as he rides cross-country.'I'm actually surprised that the publisher sub-titled this \\"Travels in Small Town America\\", since the author rarely gets out of his car and actually talks to anyone in the small towns he travels through. It seems he's too busy disparaging the towns as he drives by to offer any real insight into the people who've created lives there.I've had the pleasure of driving across America several times in my life and never cease to be impressed with its beauty and the kindness of the people you find in its small towns. That kindness is one of the things I love most about living in my adopted small town in Colorado. Mr. Bryson's book is so lacking in detail and authenticity, one wonders if he ever got out of the car, or just sat in the back seat reading the latest issue of The New Yorker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best","review":"This book reads more like a \\"why I miss England\\" book. For most of the book, he complains about every part of America he drives through. True, while there are plenty of boring places, and the \\"old town\\" lifestyle that Bryson loved so much in Iowa no longer existed by the time he took his tour in the 1980s, there really is no need to make the harsh comparisons between American and England. Each place has its own merits and faults. In all honesty, I think this book would be best read by someone not from America who wants to get a baised opinion about what is wrong with the country. There is little that is funny in the book (I laughed twice--total). I bought the book hoping for a great and laugh-out-loud story like \\"Thunderbolt Kid.\\" I was sorely dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean-spirited and repetitious","review":"Unfortunately, I find little to recommend this book. I am trying to finish the last quarter of the book, hoping to discover some redeeming qualities. I expected humorous descriptions and experiences. I expected to discover new places to explore on my travels. Instead, I found a mean-spirited writer, who apparently found little to recommend in small-town America. His descriptions of the many towns he visited are repetitive and boring. His thoughts about the people he met are almost universally unkind, elitist, judgemental,and sexist. Even the comments about poverty and wealth in America have the feel of predisposition, not insight. Sarcasm is a poor imitation of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible audiobook narration","review":"I love Bill Bryson. I love to listen to his narration of his books during my long commute to work. I didn't even notice that someone else was reading this audiobook until I started to listen. No bother, it'll still be great, right? Wrong. Kerry Shale narrates this at high speed, making you wish \\"slow down\\" was an option on the cd player. He's overly sarcastic, making Bill's subtle jabs sound down-right mean. It's only 2 discs long, but I can't help but wonder if it would have been 3 or 4 if Bill had read it in that wonderful way he has. I had to stop listening after about 5 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lost Continent-not so great","review":"This is a poor book, for the most part. Bill Bryson is a good writer, as his other books prove. However, I found myself quickly tiring of his whining and negative attitude as he recounts his travels through America. This book is repetitious and a little too cynical for my taste. I much preferred A Walk in the Woods. Though Bryson has a lot of amusing tales, for the most part, the attitude of his writing made me feel a little dark, soiled and depressed at the book's end. I'm glad I only borrowed this book from the library and didn't waste my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was so disappointed. I have read other Bill Bryson books and loved them. This one is terribly boring. It just goes over boring stereo-types of different regions of the U.S. I had to struggle to finish it. I kept hoping it would get more interesting, but it never does. However, Down Under (In a Sunburned Country) is hysterical, and has tons of interesting facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring travelogue from a Liberal","review":"This book is a completely uninteresting description of one mans travels through North America. Boring and self-serving, Bryson fails in his attempt to relive his childhood journeys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Bryson should not have left England","review":"This book is not only poorly written, it appears there was little if any research done prior to publishing, i.e. Gold was not discovered in Sutter Creek CA. He was so negative about all of America, it makes me wonder why he choose to return here. I have lived in England and found his glowing comments about this lovely country untrue in many cases. Both countries have pro's and con's. I did finish this book, but was unable to continue with the book on England."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no guide to the US","review":"Having visited many of the locations he expounds upon I feel his general sour view on life comes through almost all the time. He certainly didn't look for some of the interesting and beautiful attributes of many places. His gratuitous foul language when offering a disgruntled view about a community certainly counters some of the very descriptive language he uses to introduce some communities or locations. I only laughed twice in the entire book; both times were when he had a big dissapointment. I started to feel that he really deserved the bad experience. This is likely my first and last time to read a Bill Bryson piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"mean spirited & P. C.","review":"This book was not my first read by Bill Bryson and I will move on to other authors after this read. As I was reading this book I wondered why I had read as much of this author as I have.Bryson tends to look down his nose at people and things that do not meet his obviously cultured standards. His anger whether displayed or passive aggressive has gotten old.An example of my disappointment in this book is the author's report of New York City. Bryson couldn't find anything interesting within the 5 boroughs of the city.His politically correct self contentment is no longer of interest to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"seriously hilarious","review":"bill bryson....is a combination of hilarity and scholarship...i put him down as one of my guests for a \\"fantasy dinner party\\"...and this book is one of the reasons why"},{"rating":"1","title":"20% funny, 80% whining","review":"This book gets off to a roaring start.

He complains about EVERYTHING."},{"rating":"1","title":"love Bill Bryson-- hate this book","review":"Usually, Bryson is down right-laugh out loud funny... This book was a whiney travelogue of uninteresting places.There are many lovely, interesting small towns throughout the US, Bryson didn't find one of them. And similarly, there are numerous unique characters in the country and Bryson didn't meet any of them.

With the daily partisan hatred being flung from the halls of Congress, I didn't need to read it when I was trying to \\"unwind\\" with what was falsely marketed as a \\"hilarious account of one man's rediscovery of America.\\" Hilarious?? Rediscovery of America?? Nothing funny about it. Go back to England, Mr. Bryson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I keep reading?","review":"I had read \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" and loved it. So much so, that all my family members got it as a Christmas gift. On recommendation of a classmate, I checked this book out from the library. Thank god I didn't buy it. It took me forever to read. Mostly because he was just plain mean. I kept picking it up, thinking that it was going to get better. NO. If you aren't into this book within the first 50 pages, your not going to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his better books","review":"In recounting his journeys through small-town U.S.A., Bryson provides some hilarious episodes and some insights - particularly about the over-commercialization of the landscape and careless destruction of natural and historical treasures. But this book is marred by too many complaints about bad food and lodging as well as careless generalizations, especially about the South. He also appears to have made almost no meaningful contacts with the locals in his travels. Compare this book to William Least Heat Moon's \\"Blue Highways,\\" and you will see that Moon is much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I found this book to be a real disappointment. I was excited to read a book by someone who had done what I've done a number of times - driving cross country and stopping to learn about the land and people - as much as you can in a brief travel. Mr.Bryson seems to have given a cursory look wherever he went. His appraisals seemed to reside, for the most part (okay - a few exceptions) in preconceived notions. It was disappointing - very few insights and a lot of maintaining the sterotypes that are so easily applied to small towns. I'd suggest on his next trip he get out of the car and talk to the people a bit more. The book made me want to go out on my own so that this wasn't the last picture in my mind - it's not much of a picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pseudo-intellectual diary","review":"Mean-spirited meandering, arrogant, and self-absorbed.... Confuses ridicule with humor. Since Bryson moved to England and \\"became\\" cultured, he appears to view America as a vast wasteland populated with cretinous unwashed bumpkins. Try as I might, I could not bring myself to finish this awful book. I strongly suggest you find your reading pleasure elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Bill Brysons book 'The Lost Continent' sucks. I picked up this book from the library expecting it to be like his other novel, Bill Bryson Down Under. Instead, all I got was (as another reviewer commented) a hate trip down memory lane full of his gratuitous dislike for his home country. The book reads like an adolescent wrote it in high school. He talks about the epidemic of bloated women, calls each town boring, picks on each stereotype he can possibly comment on and doesn't offer much in the way of entertainment. You also get the sense he's a patriot for his adopted country, England, and doesn't have a mote of pride for where he was born. Apparently the grass is greener on the other side for this fellow. I enjoyed Bill Bryson's 'Down Under' as a resident Aussie, but this book has turned me off all Bryson. Trash"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Tedious Snide Comment After Another-Not Interesting","review":"I loved \\"Walk in the Woods\\" so was expecting something along the same lines. However, it didn't take long to realize this was not going to be the same funny and entertaining experience. Shortly into the book it became apparent the book was a vehicle for the author to ridicule everything he dislikes about the US, small-town America, people, and his past. The book is one snide comment after another throughout. The writing is dull, condescending, judgmental, arrogant, and uninteresting. Unfortunately, the writing doesn't even entertain because it's not critical-funny, it's mean-unfunny. The book is page after page of the author telling us how much better he is than everyone else. Save your time and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Bryson at his best","review":"Have read a bunch of Bryson over the years; From Troublesome words to Shakespeare to Neither Here Nor There.

His prose is flowing and very easy to read. This book is 300 pages and I read it in 3 days.My complaint is his lousy attitude toward people. He made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman. Plus, this is a book about traveling across America. I don't mind Americans complaining about what's wrong here. I do it myself occasionally. I don't mind people in other countries criticizing the USA. I make judgments about other countries, some unflattering. But there is something grating about Americans living in other countries coming back to travel the USA and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor. Stay in England if it's so bad here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"While humorous at times, the book seems to be an endless dialouge of Mr. Bryson's dissappointment of small town America. The author does a good job of describing the countless towns he visits enabling the reader to be an armchair traveller with a good view of life in U.S., but I found myself depressed at the end of each chapter as he conveys his distaste for the people, food, accomidations and atmosphere of every town he visits.If you want Bryson at his best read A Walk In The Woods, a \\"pee-your-pants\\" funny book of his travels on the Appalachian Trail"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend","review":"I enjoyed Bryson's Walk in the Woods and recommend it frequently.

Although I agree there are plenty of warts, such as fast-food restaurants in embarrassing numbers, I chalked those up to \\"progress\\" in a country that is otherwise truly magnificent, and I'll never stop being grateful that it's mine. Am just glad I didn't depend on Bryson's opinion before the trip, or I'd never have realized the dream of a lifetime! His writing style is clever and witty - too bad America-bashing is how he employs it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you really from here??","review":"Bill Bryson could be a fine writer if he wasnt so enamored with himself. While going on a 36 state trip for most people would be exciting and fun, Bryson makes it out to be the most boring and inane trip of all time. If he had spent a little more time telling us about the wonderful places he visited instead of the many way he can find them unappealing, he would have a fine book. I think he lived in the UK far too long.Not only was this book a waste of time, it was a waste of his."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lost Continent","review":"A boring trip written by a fat, coarse author. I'm thankful I've traveled many of the states that make up the USA without Bryson's help. It is true that many people in the United States regret the demise of the Americana of our cities and towns, but his portrayal was oftentimes unfair or simply incorrect. Too many drinks do an eye blear. Under those circumstances it might have been better for us and Mr. Bryson had he just forgotten this entire trip. Thank goodness, he writes more humorously and intellectually and less self-centeredly in his later years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meanness is not humor.","review":"Just because a writer can turna phrase doesn't make what he says funny. Apparently Bryson needed to make a car payment so he cranked out this book. There clearly is not a town or a person in America that Bill Bryson cares for, so it's a good thing he lives in England. This is not a gentle joshing of small town quirks or traditions - it's outright trashing of everything he sees right down to calling the waitresses ugly and wishing he could bash an old lady's head because she talked too much. I didn't finish it, and frankly, I'm not turning it back to the used bookstore - I'm throwing it away. You want a travelogue through small-town America? Go read Steinbeck or Charles Kuralt, or plenty of others."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are searching for something positive - keep looking","review":"It is clear half way through this thing that the author hates, among so many other things, strip malls, fast food chains, cheap motels, tourist traps and old people. Yet he drives endlessly through America searching them out - on a good day, endlessly complaining and on a bad day - making fun of them. What starts out as a mission of discovery turns into a mission of ridicule. The beauty of America lies in its diversity. Yet if you if you were from another planet and read this travelogue first, you wouldn't even stop in for a cup of coffee. And that's really too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with rockgeek56","review":"I got this book after greatly enjoying \\"A Walk in the Woods.\\" I had been so interested with that book I wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail!This book was just the opposite.

One of the downsides of reading Bryson in public is people look at your strangely when you break out laughing. Bryson, an Iowan by birth but currently living in England, drives around the USA through 38 states commenting on life in mostly small towns. He has a lot of good things ,and not so good things to say about us. Not a very deep read, but definitely an enjoyable one.And informative, too.

I think that this is the best of Bryson's books, although I've found all of them very entertaining.

It is simply driving and stopping for gas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies Lies Lies","review":"As a reader from the much maligned town of Carbondale, Il., I feel compelled to set the record straight. Bryson's account of his brief visit to my hometown is simply not true. (Bill- you can't buy beer in convenience stores in Carbondale. I know. My family has been in the liquor business for almost 40 years.) If ONE of his accounts is embellished, or, more accurately, a LIE, how can a reader believe anything written here? Go ahead...make up moderately entertaining, if negative and patronizing, tales about travels in America. But be sure to file them under Fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending and uninformed","review":"I was very disappointed in, and angered by, this book. Having lived in a couple of the small towns that Bryson skewers I was unpleasantly surprised at the arrogant, belittling tone he takes. If all you know about small towns is what you read in this book, you'd assume that all small-town residents fit the stereotype of being backward, country bumpkins who are a bit slow on the uptake and clearly can't match wits with such a pithy author. He insults both the towns and the residents. He mocked one town for being in his drive-thru view little more than a series of strip malls. Having lived in that particular town, it's obvious that he didn't venture a block or two off the main street, where beautiful scenery is plentiful. And I would also add that this town is the friendliest place I've ever lived. If Bryson's intention was to come off as a big city elitist he succeeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bryson's Best","review":"This book proved to be a disappointment. Whereas Bryson was witty and entertaining in books such as A Walk in the Woods and In a Sunburned Country, he was simply profane and sarcastic in Lost Continent.

Bill should have stayed in England if he thinks so little of the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruminations of a narrow-minded bigot","review":"This book effectively illustrates the point that left-leaning liberals - in this case the author - can engage in narrow-minded bigotry and intolerance with the best of 'em.

Reading Bill Bryson's experiences in small town America has sparked a yearning to return. His accounts of the people he met and the places he visited are both very funny and display a great deal of warmth towards his country and fellow citizens. (I look forward to him visiting Australia in the not to distant future and 'taking the piss' out of us!!-to quote an Aussie expression). In the meantime I will be brushing up on my southern dialect and I look forward to 'mahking the skwayer' some day in Savannah!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard Bryson","review":"I picked up this book hoping for the hilarity, irony and insight that I've found in other Bryson works, but was deeply disappointed. There are a few funny and keenly observed passages, but they are overwhelmed by a narrative that is predominantly shallow, repetitive and -- my biggest objection -- haughty and mean-spirited. Bryson is by and large a bracing, talented writer, but this work proves that even great talent can take a wrong turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toilet Paper Would Be More Useful","review":"If you're looking for a diatribe of total exaggeration and falsity, this is your book. Did I say book? Maybe doorstop would be a better description.Having grown up, and traveled extensively through the areas that the author describes with such deft fictitousness, I question whether he ever actually has been to the places he relates.I grew up in the Mid-West and moved out to the West Coast (Portland/San Diego) in my late teens, but the lifestyles the author describes of Iowa in particular are so bent out of proportion, and contrived, that this is one book that should definitely be left in the outhouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud","review":"As hilarious as when I read this book several years ago. Bill Bryson's wit and verve comes across on every page - there is not a dull moment in this travelogue. There are many \\"laugh out loud\\" moments in this book, which can be somewhat embarrassing as I read a lot in public places - such as metros, buses, parks...And not only laughter - Mr. Bryson can penetrate through to the lost soul of America with his sly observations - on consumerism, language, modes of travel... Not much escapes the vision of Bill Bryson. His perceptions range at different levels and he is able to turn the humour over to himself as well.After twenty years from publication date there is still much that is valid and real in these pages - and laughter is ever so important!"},{"rating":"2","title":"small towns, big enjoyment","review":"This is the third Bryson book that I've read in three months; Bill's persona has become my friend. In fact, I felt like I was in the back seat during his travels around America. I'm so old that I have been to most of the places where \\"we\\" traveled. Bryson's wit makes small town USA interesting, and sometimes sad for the \\"good old days\\" when our communities resembled our collective character. There is some disdain for big box chain stores and restaurants that dot every landscape and meld our communities into boring familiarity regardless of where we go. \\"We\\" had similar feelings about most of the places. I enjoyed the ride. \\"We\\" laughed a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive Past This One...","review":"The short version: I love Bryson's other books, I hated this one.Why?#1. Mean-spirited whining about how he hates everything. That got old real fast.#2. Not much in it that's funny. I don't think I cracked a smile the whole way. It lacked the wit of Bryson's other books, and so was stale and boring.#3. Gratuitous use of profanity. I'm not some old church lady, so spare the \\"Prude\\" comments. I just don't see that the profanity added anything at all. It wasn't funny, it was out of place--like he just threw it in hoping it would make the stuff around it funny. It didn't.If you've never read Bryson's work, skip this one and start with anything else he's written. If you like Bryson's work and want to read everything he ever wrote, still, don't buy this one. Maybe borrow it from your library, because you won't be reading it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bitter and unpleasant trip down memory lane","review":"Bill Bryson crosses the line between humorous sarcasm to just plain bitter, hateful commentary on perfectly lovely spots. He greedily latches on to any stereotype available and exploits it. He happily criticizes events and places he doesn't even visit. I'm sorry he had such a miserable childhood and angry relationship with his father, but I don't think that justifies trashing an entire country. To Bill, I offer sympathies for a sorrowful youth that has obviously left deep an painful scars even well into his adult years.I'm so sad to have spent money on this book. I loved Bryson's Walk in the Woods, and hope to enjoy the Sunburned Country. But the Lost Continent is going in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another mean-spirited book","review":"I had hoped for a humorous look at America but was stunned to find caustic remarks instead. This reminds me Bill Kaufmann's book Dispatches from the Muck Dog Gazette. There is no affection for small towns here. For some reason, the authors of both books find it amusing to bash small towns instead of embracing them for what they are. I'm barely three chapters into the book and plan on tossing it. I will not buy another Bill Bryson book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"It's not often that you see an idea that stupid brought to fruition.\\"","review":"To quote Bryson himself (page 95): \\"It's not often that you see an idea that stupid brought to fruition.\\"First page is simular to the last page, as is everything in between.

Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions. This CD totally KILLS that. First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him. And second, they abridged the CRAP out of it, cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire SECOND HALF of the book! While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesty journalism at its finest","review":"Riding in the passenger seat with Bill Bryson through 38 states and 14,000 miles makes for a highly comical and riveting drive. A hoot!Some reviewers tag the book as condescending, sarcastic and sneering. Bryson calls it as he see's it...just how things really seem.Along with pointing out positive attributes of our country, how can one also not notice the moronicities and ludicrousness which fevers the nation, whether it be in the people we encounter, the places, etc? Bryson is a genius in this category.In addition to his side-splitting activities from town to town and state to state, he rediscovers not only America but also his youth with many, many hilarious situations. Embellishments travel directly to the tickle-bone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. I so wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't .","review":"After reading A Walk In the Woods (during which I laughed so hard I cried more than once), I was expecting a similar journey around Small Town America. What I got instead, was a mean-spirited, spiteful, disappointing ride around 14,000 miles of America. Bill, can you honestly expect me to believe that in 14,000 miles you didn't find one town, that could make you happy? I often hoped the tone of the book would change, but it never really did. I did enjoy your re-telling of your travels with your father. He sounds like a much more interesting traveller than you have become.I'm glad I read Walk in the Woods first...no one would have been able to convince me to pick it up had I read this book first.If you are looking for a true book about Small Town America I would suggest Travels with Charley by John Steinbeck or my perennial favorite, Blue Highways by William Least Heat Moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"First book I ever threw in the trash!","review":"I read A Walk in the Woods, and though it had a slow section in the middle I thoroughly enjoyed it. So therefore for my birthday I asked for and received the Lost Continent. What a mistake that was. I read it until he was in North Carolina. That was about 5 states too far! I literally threw it at the wall after I read yet another condescending slam on some poor American slob just like me. What an ignorant idiot this guy is (or was back then). He should have stayed in England if America sucks so bad. I buy books to read and keep. This is absolutely the first, and hopefully the last that I ever threw away, and then made sure I dumped coffee grounds on it in the trash the next morning. Take that Bryson. Stay in England!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly planned journey","review":"This travel journal had such good potential but Mr. Bryson blew it. He timed his destinations in seasons of bad weather and missed so many opportunities. I did enjoy his anecdotes of traveling with his family during his childhood. I suggest, now that he is older, another road trip. Only this time consult an almanac so he can see things that are not covered in fog, snow, and sleet. I have enjoyed other books of his but cannot recommend this one. He comes across as sour and unfair in some of his critical commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like so many previous reviewers,","review":"I didn't like this book at all. I've been many of the places that Bryson visits in the book. I grew up in the same part of the country that he comes from. I hoped that this book would be a funny and light-hearted look at a side of America that I call home. While it is somewhat humorous, I found that his constant sarcasm and cynisism negated most of the laughs.Plain and simple, he pokes fun at America as a foreigner. I was hoping for a book that read like a buddy joking with me. Instead, reading this book is like listening to a girlfriend pointing out all that is wrong with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"a long, dull complaint of a book","review":"I usually like Bill Bryson's books - Notes from a Small Island, a Walk in the Woods, I'm a Stranger Here Myself, A Short History of Nearly Everything, all made me laugh. But not The Lost Continent. This one was one long complaint of a roadtrip; Bryson doesn't seem to find anything he enjoys until he gets to Yellowstone. There's no detail of his travels, just a repetitive litany of how bad the food is, how horrible the motel, how fat the tourists, and how dull the road. It's not worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean spirited review of Americans","review":"I thought this had great potential to be an extremely entertaining book. Mr. Bryson however has spent too much time in England away from his beloved Midwest. He was right that the people in the Midwest are the most hospitable that you can meet, however each state has wonderful people if you are a wonderful person. His view on America and Americans was funny at times but mostly just mean and vindictive when he didn't feel his was treated to even his low standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased the book (The Lost Continent - Travels in Small Town America) some time back and finally got around to reading it. Am disappointed in Bill Bryson with this book. Years ago I was given his book (A Walk in the Woods) and loved it. But this book about travel in small town America exposed Bill Bryson's very Liberal political bent. Even Mr. Bryson admitted that he was a lifelong Democrat. But he exposes the typical 'superiority - elitist' mindset of liberals in this book. When Mr. Bryson began to demean Republicans, and especially Southerners, I became upset with his book. He even lets the Liberal-Democrat anti-Christian mindset come through. You know - he makes humor at the expense of Southners and Christians, just as the late night TV talk shows do. I quit reading his book at chapter 7. There is no one I would give this book to, so into the trash it went.Tony L"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great travelogue of small town USA.","review":"This book is a collection of stories about Bryson's trip around the country in search for the perfect small town, which calls \\"Amalgam\\". It begins with a hilarious take on the Midwest (most notably Iowa, his home State) and stories from the family vacations of his youth. It is a travel book, and not intended as great literature, but it is truly laugh out loud funny. It is, I believe, a fair indictment of certain aspects of out society as reflected in the author's travels. A little caustic (think on the road with David Letterman), but really, really funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit depressing","review":"I've read and enjoyed other Bryson books, but this one was just not that funny. I feel sorry that some people who have never visited the US might read this and think we are a nation of Crudvilles. Bryson cracks on Beaufort SC because it's made up of retirees and military. So? I didn't know he disliked military families so much. I can tell by his anti-conservative attacks early on, but I don't understand this. He keeps telling us how cheap his father was, but he rants at the admission fees and evidently stays at cheap motels (pool tables with sheets for beds). The book has Small Town in the title but he visits Dearborn, New York City, DC, etc. It has its funny moments but overall I was left at the end thinking, \\"What DOES he like?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time reading this drivel!","review":"Mr. Bryson is a writer of astonishingly meager abilities...here is a potentially rich and fascinating subject to which he has failed miserably to do justice, and the monumental chip on his shoulder makes for tortured reading. If I could have awarded him 0 stars, I would have! Look elsewhere for intelligent, enlightened, and humorous travel writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"American Classic","review":"Brutal humour. I have read it three times and still laugh out loud. It appears this book has hit a raw nerve in some of my more sensitive fellow Americans, but if we can't laugh at ourselves what fun is there? Relax,it's the American way.God Bless Bill Bryson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best effort","review":"Fortunately this is not the first book from Bill Bryson I ever read or I would have given up. It is very insulting to Americans, especially small town people. Although his humor is at times funny it's also offensive (to me anyway). Even though he was born American, he was living in the UK and flew over to write this book. He portrays the heart of our nation as a bunch of idiots basically. Skip this one and get \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"dark job by a whiny hatchet man--read the later works","review":"My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one. As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it. Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all: one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity. Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the complaining","review":"I am a Bill Bryson fan but this book got old very quickly. Older middle aged readers might relate, as I did, to the endless car trips we took when we were young, in my case from Pittsburgh to Miami Beach in the summer without air conditioning. We loved the Burma Shave signs.The book did have a touch of Bryson's droll humor, but complaining is not funny and endlessly finding fault left me a bit defensive about small town America. I think younger readers would find it hard to connect with this book at all, other than as a history lesson, and the story of small towns in America is much more pleasant than depicted by Bryson. Maybe his writing can be better appreciated when his target is not so close to home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Bryson has lost something ...","review":"What a disappointment! I have read all of Bill Bryson's other books eagerly and they were some of the best entertainment I've had with a mix of sarcasm and an appreciation for life. This newest book is written by a Bill Bryson who has evidently become a bitter old man. His humor is weak, and his sarcasm is mean and cold. He has none of the balance of positive with negative that made his previous books a delight. If you love Bill Bryson . . . don't buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing.","review":"Try as I might, I found this book neither witty nor real. After the first chapter, one could only sumise Mr. Bryson to be a very unhappy person, and using writing as his tool for therapy. Every sentence of every chapter is such a dreary and negative depiction of people and life in the States. My only question... why did he choose to move back to the States?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sense of humour deficit alert","review":"It's quite clear from some of the previous reviews that this uproariously hilarious book has riled some of Bryson's rather humourless compatriots. Yes, he is scathing about the creeping homogeneity of life in the US (something which is creeping malevolently over to Europe - thanks guys) and some of his countrymen's insularity, parochialism and sheer ignorance but this book is imbued with a deep sense of loss and regret. Bryson is quite transparently upset at how his country is being dumbed-down and how the huge corporate chains and malls are destroying downtowns and communities across the nation. Unfortunately, many of your reviewers chose to see The Lost Continent as an affront to their patriotism rather than as a long-overdue wake-up call. It's now probably too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mean spirited journey","review":"I love car trips and also have memories of childhood back seat adventures, so I looked forward to this read. I made it about half way through and gave it up as a depressing waste of time. For a much better look at regional quirks and differences I recommend another mid-westerner, Calvin Trillin. In ALICE, LET'S EAT, for example, he visits places with people much different from himself...and writes with great wit about what he sees and does. If he makes a bit of fun of his adventures it is infused with a fondness for the people he meets and a delightful self deprecating attitude. Quite the opposite of Bryson's arrogant attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall Down, soda-up-your-nose funny","review":"Having just completed a 30,000 mile road trip to photograph citizens in 53 towns in the USA with the funniest names you've ever heard, I can tell you that Bryson's observations are excruciatingly on target and snortingly funny. He sees beneath the contrived commercial and pointless idiocies that coat America's boonies and larger towns. It's satire with an appropriate but minimal garnish of respect and every word is true. He sees us as we are and makes us laugh out loud. I want him in my car for my next foray into the boonies. If you don't think he's funny, then you must be in his line of fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down for Bill Bryson Fans","review":"Bill Bryson is one of my favorite authors, however this book was a big let down. The book describes Mr.Bryson's experience while traveling through the United States and reflects his opinions relating to those experiences. Unfortunatly, all of those experiences are negative. It is appearant that Mr. Bryson did not hold a high opinion of the U.S. or it's Citizens at the time of this writing. Though Mr.Bryson began as a travel writer,his real strength lies in his history based books. I'm still a Bryson fan. This just isn't my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"complaining!","review":"This book was the worst of all of Bryson's books that I have read! It is a nonstop complaint of cities and farmland alike. Bryson has absolutely nothing good to say about most of the places he visits. He writes of trying to find the \\"perfect\\" American town, yet he never ventures far enough to really find it. Instead, he rambles on about horrible food (of course the food will be bad if you don't want to spend any money), boring radio stations (cds or mixes would solve this problem), and mean americans (I would not be friendly either if you are going to complain about my neighbors and business). Please. This country has a lot to offer, and Bryson did not showcase much of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a trip, write a book, make some money","review":"Think of this premise: Take a road trip, write a supremely boring book with some of the dumbest cliche jokes on the planet, and because your name is Bill Bryson, make a whole bunch of money.I do recommend this book if you are stuck in prison doing a life sentence and its either read The Lost Continent or stare at the walls of your cell. For me, I'd stare at the walls.To be fair and talk about the contents of the book, it is the recounting of Bill taking a road trip to attempt to remind himself of what small town America is like. He remembered it from his childhood and returned from living in England to see if his memories were what small town America is really like.In the end, The Lost Continent is as readable as the phone book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly amusing (if you are in the mood)","review":"This reads like a book the author wrote to fulfil some contractual obligation.The 'plot' can be summarized as follows: Drive a car into a small town, check into some hotel, make disparaging comments on a few people and then do it all over again. There are some genuinely funny moments in the book but at times it does feel like the author is trying too hard to be funny. Also, a place is pretty or ugly depending on the author's mood.IMO, other reviewers who are offended by the author are missing the point as I don't think he was being serious (I thought this was a dead giveaway when he makes jokes on his parents). But then again, am not an American who grew up in a small town, so its easier for me to feel that way.All in all, a harmless little book which can (will) be forgotten the moment you turn the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"sardonic - derisively mocking or disdainfully humorous","review":"Bryson's account proves to me that education leaves a lot to be desired. Some quotes...\\"the Sunday New York Times - and it's well worth every trembling leaf. So what if our grandchildren have no oxygen to breathe? F**ck 'em\\". \\"The average Southerner has the speech patterns of someone slipping in and out of consciousness\\". \\"I was alone with a small bag of pathetic treats in the most boring town in America\\". I think the most boring part of the trip was Bryson himself. Although his writing shows glimpses of real humor, and real wit, most of his attempted humor is at the expense of real people. People who wisely left this pompous fool alone. I'm glad I picked up the hardcover version of this book at a garage sale for 50 cents. Then again, maybe I overpaid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Time or Money on This Drivel","review":"I picked this up because it looked like a fun read of a time gone by in Middle America. I expected a lively rolicking tale.I got into the first chaper, flipped thru, read random paragraphs and the book is now in my Goodwill pile.This was my first Bill Bryson book. A friend was raving about A Walk in the Woods and Bryson's writing. I stopped her and said I wasn't going to waste my money. I cited my experience with this book. \\"Oh. Ah. Yeah.\\" She said. \\"Yeah. I wouldn't've read anything else by Bryson if that were my first book of his either.\\"That pretty much sums it up.

This is a GREAT album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wooohooo I like this album a lot !! ^.^","review":"When I first heard of the single \\"Bring me to life\\" I fell in loved with it and decide to buy Evanescene\`s debut album I don\`t regret it at all.The songs are dark and if you just like woohoo happy songs this is not a album for you.But i like it a lot and \\"My Immortal\\" is my favorite in the album but I also like \\"Going Under\\" and \\"Haunted\\".If you like kinda dark music with a huge feeling you should buy this album now !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YEAH SWEET TOTALLY GOTHIC I LOVE IT","review":"I THOUGHT THIS ALBUM WAS SO AWESOME BECAUSE IT WAS THE COST OF ONE ALBUM BUT I GOT ONLY ONE SONG ON A LOOP. MAN, THESE GUYS REMIND OF THIS BAND CALLED KILLSWITCH ENGAGE CUZ THEY SING ABOUT BEING TRAPPED IN SOMETHING. MAYBE IT IS ALIEN GOO, OR THE FUTILITY OF THEIR MUSIC. LUCKILY THE GIRL SINGS REAL GOOD SO YOU CAN'T HEAR THE INSTRUMENTS IN THE BACKGROUND MAKING NOISE."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"the four singles(going under, bring me to life,everybodys fool, my immortal) off the album are definately worth listening to. the others are pretty average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Stop","review":"This isn't worth listening to. It doesnt have any potential or anything different about it than any other music. They dont participate in the life of music. .end of transmission. ."},{"rating":"1","title":"An athypical album","review":"The mixture of different types of vocals is not quite achieved in this album; the hard musics are too hard in opposition to beautiful musics like \\"my immortal\\" or \\"hello\\". Evanescence have to grow up and define a better musical style: the metal-grunge like \\"going under\\", or the ballads like \\"my immortal\\". But this compilation...sucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suicidal?","review":"Don't get me wrong, Amy Lee has a GREAT voice. However a lot of the songs are very depressing. Expressing your feelings about teenage life are ok, but it's sometimes not ok to talk about suicide, or any form of...well, sadness. A lot of people (especially parents) don't want that type of music. For more mature listeners such as young adults, this is a great choice. In non-lyrical standings, the music is great and the instrumentals on this song are outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undecided","review":"I am not sure if the album is a work of genius or a real knockoff. But I don't have much respect for the band or their label's (Wind Up) marketing Department. They Trample all over one set of fans to reach a bigger market. Smart, but evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beuatiful","review":"Don't listen to those people who hate this group. I have severe clinical depression, and although I'm on meds now, the songs resembled me so much it's scary!This album is dark, but is not graphic. Even the lyrics about cutting are vague. The songs \\"Hello\\" and \\"Imaginary\\" resembled me to a T! However, all the songs are beautiful, which is rare for a CD.The only reason I am not giving this CD 5 stars, is because it could act as a trigger for self-mutilation. If you have or are recovering from depression and/or suicidal thoughts, DON'T get this CD. Please wait until you are better mentally!Other than that, this CD is excellent!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I can't believe I wanted this so badly. The only good songs are \\"Going under\\" and \\"bring me to life\\". I was so exited about \\"My Immortal\\" because of how it sounded on the radio. Here, it sounds like Amy had a bit to much weed and was tired. I hate it when bands have a radio version and a CD version.Not worth the money.The other songs are so raspy and dry they would burn easier than californias forests."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"Yah i like this CD...Amy Lee's voice is awesome! I would kill for a voice like hers. My favorite songs are Going Under, Bring Me To Life, Everybody's Fool, My Immortal, Haunted, Tourniquet, Taking Over Me, and My Last Breathe...so yah...i basically love all of them! Buy a copy now! You won't regret it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Debut Album","review":"This is a great ablum. Vocals and music all come together really well and this album really does deliver. Amy Lee keeps her voice in check and is a welcome change to many other female vocalists. The vibe of the band is one of a Dark Rock genre but it is not grunge and is really tolerable. If you want some good music I would definitely suggest this album because it delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing","review":"This album is the BEST that I have heard in a very long time. The mix of hard rock/metal with alternative, and Amy Lee's beautifully unique voice seems to create a new genre of music. The melodies are all completely different, and each song would be a great single...every song on this album is a hit. Don't be surprised if these guys make a sweep at the Grammy's next year! Bottom line, buy this album. It has something for everyone. It's flat-out addicting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally overrated...","review":"I can't believe how much of a fuss has been made over a mediocre band. Sure... they have some decent songs (Bring me to life, Going Under) but they still aren't amazing. I find the lead singer's voice annoying and as far as musical content goes... there is nothing special about this CD. The guitar is just loud, distorted power chords, the drums are average and I don't understand why everyone likes them so much.I don't suggest you buy this CD, mainly because there a way better bands out there. They are definitely NOT the future of rock... unless the future is dull, talentless noise.Better suggestions:A Perfect Circle - Thirteenth StepTool - LateralusDream Theater - Scenes from a Memory"},{"rating":"2","title":"EVANESCENCE review","review":"I think that this is a very good CD. Track 4 and 5 are my favorites. Any one who likes this might also like \\"Former Simply Inflaculation\\" by Alanis Morrisicent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique!","review":"I heard one of their songs on the radio several times and found myself turning it up and really getting in to it. I got two copies of the CD, one for me and one for my fiance. We both love it. The songs are just amazing, especially the first two on the CD. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Debut","review":"I've seen some harsh critic reviews comparing the band to Tori Amos (huh?) and others (though, in what I've read nothing comparing them to Garbage with a similar gothic/tech rock sensibility). All I've got to say is AT LEAST IT IS DIFFERENT! For those of us (and I'm old enough to have a wide range of musical tastes) not into screaming boys (Incubus, Glassjaw, The Used) or pop (Justin Timberlake, Christina, Kelly Clarkson, etc) the choices are dismal. The writing on this album is a tad weak, the songs a little similar, but it is still good and a change from the usual. Worth the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cowboy Junkies with energy and soul","review":"IF Margo Timmons and the Cowboy Junkies had an electric charge and energy, they MIGHT sound like Evanescence. I'm not a rock rap fan, but I was electrified by the duet from Daredevil, and I must say the the rest of the CD holds up with great soaring vocals and instrumentals."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm..nah","review":"I thought I would like this CD, but then when I got it, all of the songs are very slow and melancholy, and they make me depressed. I only really like one or two songs on the whole album...bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay...","review":"This band/cd would be the best ever if they lost the female vocal. She makes it terrible in my opinion, her voice does not match the rock. The male's vocals on the other hand are fantastic. If he ditched the chick the cd would be off the hook. But in some people's opinion she makes the album good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The voice is good...","review":"..other than that, it is standard, boring pop/hard rock that never goes anywhere, partly due to the repetitive nature every song follows. It's like a pop interpretation of Lacuna Coil/Within Temptation and those bands aren't that good to begin with.An earlier reviewer wrote, \\"It should be a crime to not own this cd.\\", while actually one should be so dumb to not know of the aforementioned bands(among others) that explored the dark side and brought beauty in ways previously unheard of.Evanescence now gets the credit for doing a rehash of other band's original ideas and dumbs it down for the AMERICAN PUVLIC to swallow. And it worked!Unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its been done","review":"Bands like this have been around for awhile. To see this get air play and hear people talk about it like its the newest thing is pretty bad considering the fact the there are other bands that are better. Save your money and buy \\"Comalies\\" by Lacuna Coil or \\"Century Child\\" by Nightwish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total piece of cliche'd crap","review":"So I gave this a shot, against my wishes (didn't have much hope for them in the first place) and boy, was I right. All I see in Evanescence is a rip off of so many other bands from before their time. Its unoriginal, uninspired, crap. Amy Lee has a nice voice, and thats where it ends.. it seems that the music was created to appeal to a particular type of listener, instead of created by themselves, for themselves (something that most good bands do).If you liked this album, or any of their other albums, I suggest to try listening to something new. Check out Sirenia, Nightwish, and Lacuna Coil. If you like female vocals, in these bands is where the true talent lies. They make music for themsleves, and its more beautiful, than any crap that Amy Lee could concive of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this band, check out THE GATHERING instead...","review":"If you like MTV to spoon-feed you what they consider to be good music then by all means waste your money/download time on this album. If however you actually like to think for yourself and want to hear a great female fronted goth/rock/metal band (without the lame rapping). Then check out The Gathering!! Recommeded albums to start with \\"Nighttime Birds\\", and \\"If_Then_Else\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad. Really bad.","review":"Just a look at the cover of this album and I knew it was going to be bad. Just one listen and I knew that the uneducated masses of music listeners would hail it as \\"revolutionary\\" or a \\"step forward\\" because it had female vocals. Just one minute into it I knew it was worse than I had expected.This is a media-driven one-trick-pony which neither excites or impresses.This is not innovative. This is not the next big thing.This is garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth your money!","review":"Evanescence will keep on top of the charts for a while it seems. Personally after listening to their \\"promotional\\" songs in the soundtrack for Daredevil the movie, I was looking forward for their album to be released. With their debut album, Evanescence successfully manages to melt some strong riffs with the soft, consistent and original voice of highly talented Amy Lee. At the first spin, \\"Going Under\\", \\"Bring Me To Life\\", \\"Haunted\\", \\"Tourniquet\\" and \\"My Last Breath\\" are my favorites. One last note: If you liked this album and don't want to wait for Evanescence's next album, try \\"Sebnem Ferah\\" where available. Sebnem Ferah is a Turkish vocalist, who worked with Apocalyptica and Therapy on various albums. Identical with Amy Lee."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 Album Of the Centery","review":"Ever since I bought this album, it has never left my CD player. To me the songs are deep, emotional, well thought out, and unique. Never have I heard a band that was so talented. A must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"evanescence i love u","review":"this is a great record, especially if youre 16, confused & angry, and a girl. just about every song on this cd is exciting, amy lee has a great voice full of emotion backed up by the alt rock metal tunes. i guarantee you will feel her pain. the only no-no is where she says \\"i want to die\\" on one the songs, i think thats a bad message to send to kids who are young and might be suicidal. it might be truthful but its a terrible message. she should have said \\"i want to die, but i wont because....\\"note: my immortal is a real song (not the radio bastardized nickel back'ed version)this is the kind of cd you get obsessed with but tire of quickly. maybe stick to the mp3s?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's All The Hype About?","review":"I never understood the hype over Evanescence. Amy Lee's voice is okay, but I think she tries too hard to sound so dramatic and emotional. As a band, something about them seems kind of fake to me with this whole \\"gothic/rock\\" thing. The lyrics are always so mediocre, while the music is so over the top and dramatic, and every song sounds exactly the same! I have nothing against goth, but seriously, there needs to be a new twist to this genre. It seems like they try way too hard to keep up with the whole \\"i'm goth, dark, and creepy\\" image. It's just getting sooo old and redundant, and is becoming more of an act. I think this band is overrated. To me they're just pop/rock artists trying way too hard to be goth, with not much substance in their music to make them interesting as a band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant Singer, Poser Band, General Poorness","review":"This self obsessed voclaist, Amy Lee ranks amongst my least favourite artists. I saw an interview with her on MTV and she irritated me immensely with her laid back arrogance, strive to look like 'she doesn't give a damn' when in fact she really does. Her attempt to look hippie, scrappy, poor, when in fact she's rolling in money, has a rather posh English accent, comes accross as arrogantly educated, and is obviously no hippie is horrid. She claims 'music is easy, it's just something I do' - f**k right off. Arrogance doesn't bring you fans, you may well be a talented composer, but we don't want to hear outrageous comments about how good you are. Please be quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Lacuna Coil clone","review":"Is it possible that nobody had noticed? This non original EU band had just copied the italian great band lacuna coil that has a long way carrier with their creative own style. Now Evanescensce is making alot of money with this cd and with the statement that their first goal is to be creative and original. What a lie! Even Cristina's way of singing is found there!You better check out Lacuna coil and judge by yourself.PD: one star just for the effort of playing"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Pop/Rap Music","review":"I don't understand why people would call this band \\"a rock band\\", in fact they sound like a Pop band with some rapping, if you're looking for real rock/metal music , don't even think of buying this CD, you'll get totally sick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well","review":"This album has some good arrangements however, how can one take any band with a dj or back up singer seriously. The \\"Bring Me...\\" song is really disturbing in that the band could have done such a good job without the stupid male rapper vocals. Also, the lyrics are so highschool. There is no depth. Amy needs to read more books and develop her vocabulary. She does have a beautiful voice. This could be a good band and I am glad to hear that the guitarist Ben something is leaving. His solos are trite and his playing is redundant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear me, why?!","review":"It's quite fitting that one of the definitions for the word \\"evanescence\\" is \\"n : the property of lasting for a very short time.\\" Dear Lord, we can only hope.Just another group of white, middle-class kids wearing black and wining.

BAD CD ALERT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacuna Coil minus a spark","review":"This band is nothing more then a dumbed down linkin park version of Lacuna Coil, picks lacuna's album comalies and see what real goth rock is."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rocks","review":"Maybe I'm too old for \\"goth rock\\". I'm not generally into the whole goth scene and all that. But, if you ignore the videos and just listen to the music, it rocks. Great new band."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than the Image","review":"This CD is a rare CD in which every song on it is enjoyable for multiple type of people and music genres, hence the multiple *hit* singles. Even if you don't care for the particular band image the music alone goes beyond the image and is a great mix of energetic alternative-popish-rock with a few beautiful piano ballads thrown in. Amy's (the lead singer) voice is flawless and the CD is very well produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"I liked the first single. Then My Immortal became the most overplayed song of all time. But still I bought the CD because my friend told me how great it was.I liked the first two songs on the CD but then realized that all the songs sound the same with the exception of My Immortal which my ears can't bear to listen to again. Also Her voice is so scathingly annoying. I swear to God, after five minutes you're dying to hear yourself screaming just to drown it out. I'm not one of those people who only listens to American Idol winners but seriously- she can't sing.If you are thinking of buying this CD I would recommend not just sampling the clips. Find someone who owns it and listen to it all the way through. If you can stand it then you are stronger than me and who am I to judge you."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre at best","review":"I have listened to this cd several times and while it does have its alright moments, most of the cd is given to highly synthesized pop-rock which I abhor. This band has proven to be one of the most mediocre followers of the gothic/ligh-getheseme sound. The splash that it has made in popular music rather proves my point.It's rather good for those who like Linkin Park and other bands of the sort though. I, unfortunately, was talked into the purchase of this cd. It did not appeal to my tastes but I don't doubt that it could very well appeal to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon ! You've heard it before !","review":"This is Linkin Park wearing a skirt ! It's unbelievable how people describe this record as coming from outer space, and bringing something new to the music scene ! How many groups of so-called \\"Nu Metal\\" you can quickly remember ? Just because Evanescence has a girl with the mic doesn't make it any better !Try CURVE instead !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new, just for fans of the band i guess","review":"All the hype about this album convinced my girlfriend to force me to buy her this album. I was hesitant at first after hearing the song from DareDevil. Anyway, i bought it for her. We listened to it in my car, and before the 3rd song was over i noticed she was getting bored. So i decided to pop in Lacuna Coil's Comalies and she woke up. Now this CD is sitting somewhere in my car (together with my running shoes) and she has all my Lacuna Coil and Nightwish CDs... Sure taught her a lesson about relying in reviews too much. This CDs not that bad, its just not worth it unless you're really a fan of the band i think."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love FALLEN!","review":"Evanesence is such an amazing band! They have combined the cool calming tones of such artists as Enya, or Sarah McLachlan, and combined it with a hip twist of Limp bizcuit, and Tool... They married the two genres beautifully to create something entirely new and original. Fallen expresses so many emotions it's nearly overwhelming. I love this cd because I can honestly say that I enjoyed all of the tracks, there was not one more interesting than another, I love that kind of uniform reflection in a cd, or anything for that matter. This album gave me goosebumps it was so good... give it a shot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly beautiful","review":"This CD is really beyond words. Out of my entire music collection, and that amounts to more than one hundred CDs, I've never before had a CD where every single track was so distinct and engrossing. The lyrics can induce extensive though, and the music, combined with the phenominal vocals are just above words. This CD is going to be in my CD player for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, I love this album!","review":"If you haven't heard of Evanescence then you must live under-a rock. This band is so amazing, and I'm sure their album Origin will be hard to find for fans of this awesome band.This band knows how to rock and have some beautiful lyrics that grab a hold of you like a hook.If you don't like this album, then you don't deserve to listen to good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"all i can say is WOW!! this is one of the best cds i've bought in a long time everything from the Lyrics to the vocals. this band has somnthing going 4 them its a breath of fresh air to the genere. I highly reccomend this cd you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very unique","review":"I've been amazed with this group ever since the Daredevil soundtrack made \\"Bring me to life\\" so popular. The balance between hard-hitting guitar / intrumentals and beautiful vocals is unbelievable.Unfortunately, the originality ends there and most of the album tends to sound somewhat repetitive. I would still highly recommend this album for people who are looking for some new rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love evanescence","review":"I really like this group and I think that eventhough the singers are not good actors in the video the photograph and the voices are great, so I recomend this cd to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring the music scene to life","review":"Well, what can I say? thw First time I heard Bring Me To Life I was blown away, and the rest of the album is equally as mind blowing.The chilling voice of Amy haunts every track, the first track sets the mood for the rest of the record. Going Under is a superb starting song, it's spooky beginning gives you goosebumps! The second track was a hit across the world and is a classic. Other Tracks mix the heavy rock guitar riffs and chords with Amy's haunting voice, to create an all round amazing album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS NEW AND I LIKE IT","review":"I have one word to describe this album, AMAZING. Evanescence's sound is unlike any other arist in the rock industry right now. No other female rock artist has so successful completed an album with such a variety of sound...its got everything any heavy rock fan is looking for and more...I highly recommand this CD to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great surprise....Excellent CD","review":"I orginally bought this CD thinking it would be ok, I don't really like hard rocks that much but I've heard a few of their songs on radio so I bought the CD thinging that I had probably heard all of the best tracks on the radio already. Needless to say I was very pleasantly surprised when I poped the CD in and started listening to it. All of the songs follow the hard rock with guitars and bass that you have heard on the radio with a few slow songs that are excellent as well mixed in-between. Great guitars, solid bass, and great vocals make this one of the best CDs I've heard in a long time. Almost of the songs are well crafted and could have been hits on their own, none of those \\"filler\\" songs just stuck in there to make the CD longer. You are going to listen to all of the tracks on this CD over and over again. This CD is definately a great surprise hit and you won't be dissapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"*stands in awe* this is mezmorizing....","review":"well...wow...how do i start. this album is absolutely depressing...but i LOVE it. the first track, 'going under' is my favorite. 'im dying again'...it sends chills up my back. well anywayz, i bought this album at the beginning of the summer when it first came out and i was blown away. its haunting and depressing. its not really goth, but its very close. if you like music with meaningful lyrics, youll like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I LOVE EVANESCENCE\\"","review":"Hello everyone, first of all lets just say I'm a fan of all types of music, but this is the best i've heard!!! I'm in love with Amys voice, it takes you on an emotional roller coaster. The music behind it goes with every lyric and pitch of her voice perfectly. On track two \\"bring me to life\\" Paul sounds like Mike from linkin park, but the rest of the album is even better, it touches me deeply. I personally think the heavy riff with female vocal thing is awesome, but not just a common female vocal, Amys is special just hear it and you'll know, i get goosebumps everytime. Theres another band called \\"Lacuna Coil\\" its alright, but lacks the energy that Evanescence brings to the table. Every song from start to finish is good, but my personal favorites is \\"going under\\", \\"tourniquet\\" and track 5 and 8 I forgot the name though. But the ending to track five is so strong it'll make the hair on your forearm rise!! Linkin Park is good but Evanescence is better."},{"rating":"1","title":">>>Linkin Park meets Tori Amos meets mascara<<<","review":"This band really is not very good. The only slightly good thing is Amy Lee's voice, but if you want an actually talented female vocalist in a metal band, check out The Gathering, Leaves Eyes or Ayreon's \\"The Human Equation\\"(there's 3 on that album). If all this was was Amy Lee though it would probably get 3 stars, the rest of the band are pitiful. The drums are boring and untalented, the guitars are basically the overdistorted power chords you get in any numetal band.Don't even get me started on the male singer's voice, lets just say he should close his mouth and never open it again. This album does have it's moments, but The Gathering and/or Leaves Eyes are miles ahead of this bland numetal (as much as you hate to admit it, they are basically Korn with a female singer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"one hit wonders","review":"i loved the song bring me to life and my immortal was okay until it became the most overplayed song ever but the rest of the cd all sonuds the same.everyone talked about how different and refreshing it is. so when i listened to it i expected a lot. and i was sorely dissapointed. this is not new or different. this has all been done before. depressoin has sold since nirvana, except that nirvana was awesome.and now that ben moody has gone solo evanessence is no more. this cd really isn't that great. i recommend you buy the singles instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"It really is a shame, because Evanescence has a lot of potential. When I first heard them on the radio, Amy Lee's vocals captivated me and their sound drew me in. When I listened to this album, I was sorely disappointed.You would do well in sticking to just a single because the album pretty much all sounds the same. It's as though they liked one song and decided to make the rest a slight variation of the first one they recorded.Furthermore, goth-rock you may be, but not everyone is so obssessed with the vampire mystique, and it seems every song here could apply to the undead. Been done before, and quite frankly, it's sort of boring and pretentious.Maybe they will evolve, and I hope they do, because Amy Lee can seriously sing, and hers is a distinct voice that deserves to be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of 2003","review":"This is easily my favorite album of 2003 (fave for 2002: Audioslave, fave for 2004: Velvet Revolver). Innovative mix of spooky metal with a hip hop flavor - thoroughly modern. Then add a female singer and female dynamics - just can't get much better. Every track on here is a 10. Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool, just like A.D.D. from Chicago","review":"I really like the CD a lot, great voice too......there's a band from here in Chicago called A.D.D. that are very similar except that they're heavier. Which is wayyyy cool. Kicking tunes too !! Check them out at www.addarmy.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music to kill yourself to..","review":"My wife purchased this album on the strength of the single 'Bring me back to Life'. I think I was able to make through 1 and 1/2 listens to this album before giving up.The music is fairly standard fare, with nothing special to offer the rock/metal scene. Bland, but inoffensive.The main gripe I have with the album is with Amy Lee's vocals. They come across as if she is trying to sound depressing and are completely mismatched with the music.If you want something that is going to be of the truly dark and depressed side of life, take a look at Paradise Lost or Anathema.If you are looking for nu metal with a twist, you may enjoy this album, provided you don't mind the fact that the music sounds like all the other nu metal bands out these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"There has to be more","review":"This is the group that is getting an obscene amount of buzz, for what appears to me to be no apparent reason. True, Amy Lee has a voice on her, but so do many. The sterility of the music surrounding her is really surprising. The overproduction and lackluster guitar work is in perfect evidence. It's the tired traditional quiet verse-loud chorus given no new spin except for that a female is blasting her lungs out. Metal shouldn't sound like it has no passion, to put it bluntly, it shouldn't sound ready-made for radio, which sadly this does, and not in a good way. Whatever, I'm done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very talented folks - but not my style","review":"I think this band has lots of great, valid, musical/artistic talent. Really and truly - the woman has an awesome voice, great piano-playing, drums, guitars, etc. However, I absolutely HATE the juxtaposition of the blurred rock guitar, the piano, and the high tone vocals - - it just sounds like a bunch of random crap thrown together. Just for the record - I am under 50, have very varied musical tastes, love female lead vocals, love rock, have over a decade of piano training, voice training, am no where near tone deaf, am scared of only very real threats (predators, natural disastors) to me or my son, and am not lying. So you could say I am a \\"hater\\" of this band, but I am not any of the things the previous posters have mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Potential","review":"Evanescence is all about contrast. Amy Lee's smooth voice over heavy, rock guitar riffs, with some piano and synthesizer just to keep you off-balance. Despite five million records, there is very little groundbreaking material on this record, just three good songs and filler. On the contrast theme, I do think Ms. Lee has a great voice. It's strong and powerful, but also very smooth and even silky at times. As far as the songwriting, Bring Me To Life is just a great song- I believe the record sold five million to date on the strength of that one song. It looks like there is some great potential here in the songwriting department; but it's not on this record. My advice: You've already heard the best songs on the radio. Save your money for next time- there is great potential here."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the suicidal dark teen","review":"Anyone with suicidal issues and depression need to buy this album. This album is only for the deep-minded. Hollow-heads won't understand a thing of it. Don't think that all the songs sound like \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" because they don't. Each one is unique and very spiritual. And when I heard \\"Tourniquet\\" I was really blown away, cause this song was so simple and and yet so deep. God used this album to touch my heart. I don't think I'll ever get tired of this album, because I don't listen to it for the entertainment.And check this: \\"Bring Me To Life\\" has been turned in to a worship song. This band is awesome! They deserve every good review they get. It's good that somebody's singing about real issues and not about sex and swearing. If you talk crap about this album you need to get over the fact that Evanescence is more popular than you, and that they're making more money than you ever will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I can't seem to listen to this cd enough. It is perfect for listening to while working out or doing anything around the house. I think this cd will be a timeless classic rock cd. The songs have an excellent combination of lyrics, sung beautifully, and rock music. I think as a whole this is one of the best cd's I have listened to in a while. I hope they can match it in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn... This thing sends me to sleep","review":"This was an utter disappointment... There are so many repetitous songs on this album that it gives me deja vu. \\"Didn't I just listen to this song?\\" kind of thing. Bring Me To Life is the best song on the album (no surprise it was the first single) but Paul Maccoy contributes to this a lot. And the worst? There's a lot of competition there. Tourqinet has potential but never reached. Overall, it is just to slow... Not a catchy tune on the whole cd. Evanscence are trying to be deep and mysterious and it just doesn't work most of the time. Amy Lee's voice is far too soprano and grates like finger nails on a blackboard. She drags out every sylable and lyric like a funeral march. And the most annoying thing is that she never varies her voice (probably coz she doesn't have the ability) except on Going Under, which isn't really a great song anyway. If you want music to sleep to then evanscence will be your god-send."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting...","review":"I was blown away by Amy Lee's vocals when I heard the album for the first time. I cannot believe people giving this album one star. This combination has never been heard before, a hypnotic voice with guitar that sounds angry. This is beautiful music. I listen to the album once everyday even though I have very tight schedule. Go buy it now..you won't regret if you have passion for good Rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Electrifiying Debut","review":"What can possibly be crowned the voice of a generation, Amy Lee of Evanescense delivers a solid, captivating debut performance. \\"Fallen\\" captivates the listener from the first listen. This band, and particurally Lee, are something very special. Yet, all of the credit can't go to Lee, the elaborate arrangments that accompany her voice are a major part of the overall sound and it's success.Her voice is unbelivably strong in it's phrasing and power, giving the listner a very visual and emotional experience. To say that Lee's vocals soar, is an understatment.While she is at her strongest on the more powerful, musically driven tracks like \\"One Last Breath, Tourniquet and Going Under\\" Lee also shines on the darker ballads like \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Hello\\".I would classify this as one of the top 5 albums I own. Music fans of all genres will be able to appriciate Amy Lee's haunting vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better alternatives to Evanescence","review":"Forest Law, great job! I totally agree. :)Anyhow, for everyone else, if you're interested in female vocals, you should listen to some of these bands.More than likely, you'll put your Evanescence CD in the trash. In my opinion, they're not a _bad_ band; they're just average. I think most the following bands would be in the same genre and they have more talent.Lacuna CoilWithin TemptationTheatre of TragedyAfter ForeverNightwishTristaniaAnd for female vocals that resemble male vocals, we all love Arch Enemy"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true reflection","review":"All true art acuratley reflects the human soul. For instance \\"Hello\\". The music is both lovley and alive. I would'nt call Evanescence a hardcore rock band, nor exactley Gothic, just a portral of what we won't say; not out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Year 2003 candidate","review":"Don't judge this album by \\"Bring Me to Life.\\" The rest of the album is much better. Amy Lee's vocals are phenomenal, and they actually work well against roaring 7-string nü-metal guitars. Top notch production, songwriting, and arrangements push this one over the edge. Amazing debut. I can't make a list of best songs because this album is consistently good from start to finish; however the clichéd nü-metal vocal nuances of \\"Bring Me to Life\\" hurt an otherwise decent song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music!","review":"I fist heard Bring Me To Life when Daredevil came out. Once I heard it I knew I had to get the album Fallen. I'm glad I did. It's probably one of the best CD's I've listened to in a long time. The music on the album is a mix between Christian and gothic. I would definately recomend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy but monotonic","review":"You hear one song, and tell yourself --- wow, I've got to hear more. Then you hear the second and you do a double take --- wait, is that the same song? Bottom line, all songs sound the same!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal, Uninspiring, Annoying","review":"What people don't seem to understand, is the Evanescence are NOT the \\"breath of fresh air\\" everybody thinks they are. They are a label-generated band, with label-generated music, that blatantly rip-off Lacuna Coil (who are one of the best and most talented bands in the world). Amy Lee's vocals are pitch-corrected, which is very obvious to anyone with basic knowledge of recording, and she sings from her throat, which makes everything sound nasaly. It's just annoying. Let's face it, Amy Lee is a 'goth' version of Britney Spears, and is only slightly more talented as a vocalist. If you want to hear real music, written by real musicians, with the most amazing frontwoman ever, listen to Lacuna Coil."},{"rating":"1","title":"compromised","review":"There is a glaring problem with this disc. On track 2, the band enlisted the \\"assistance\\" of some moron (the singer from 12 Stones, from what I hear) to belch some idiotic rap from the gaping hole in his face, just under the chorus. This turns what would otherwise be a beautiful song into an intolerable, revolting mess. You cannot imagine just how damaging this pinhead's contribution is - you will spend the rest of time the disc plays plotting your revenge against this dimwitted fool. There is a single out there without this a-hole's \\"contribution\\" - I suggest you get a copy of that and burn yourself an unsullied version of this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops","review":"Although I bought this CD by mistake it is probably my favorite CD that I own. I like every song on the CD and Listen to it more than any of my other CDs. Definitely one of my better mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad cover art, by the way.....","review":"No big deal, no great innovation as people keep saying... this is a blend between nu-metal and gothic, and it's really boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible album","review":"This is the band I've been waiting for. Whatever happened to good rock? Evanescence will answer that question for you. The songs are full of emotion and the dark, moody and beautiful voice of Amy brings them home. She's definately my new favorite vocalist and this disk has not left my CD player since I got it.Don't go by the single, although I thought it a decent song the rest of the tracks have something special that the single doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy Lee is amazing","review":"I bought Fallen after seeing Evanescence in concert in February at the famous Metro in Chicago. This was weeks before the C.D. even dropped. The tickets cost a mere $8. That was the best money I've ever spent. The concert was amazing and I knew within the first notes of the first song that I would be buying Fallen as soon as it hit the shelves, also money well spent.Maybe it's the tortured soul within me but this sound and these lyrics were something I could relate to. They were what I have wanted to belt out many times had I had the ability. And Amy has a certain distinct quality to her that I found very inspiring. There is so much emotion behind every word she sings. It's truly amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I cannot believe this band is out there","review":"I have to say that I discovered this band on the Billboard music awards last night. I guess I am out of it because that is the first time I recall hearing them. I couldn't believe that voice. At the start of Bring Me To Life I was amazed. I thought the song was going to be a Sarah Mclachlan like sound. Then it kicked in. Well needless to say I went over to my computer and downloaded about 5 songs and listened to them. I am absolutely amazed by this band. Especially that voice. I am on my way to buy the cd so I hope if I get busted for illegal downloading I can just bring the cd in and show the judge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanescence: A great group","review":"The first time I was introduced to this band was after hearing \\"Bring me back to life\\" I automatically fell in love with the song. I just had to hear more from the band. I listened to some more of the tracks from the Cd. They were all so interesting, and songs that you just want to sing along with. I bought the CD, and I must say that was one of the best CD's I ever bought. You can't go wrong with buying this Cd. I'd rate this a 5/5 without a doubt.Congrats to them on the 5 grammies they have been nominated for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misunderstood","review":"I detest reviewers who base their knowledge of a band strictly on what the radio plays. \\"Bring Me to Life\\" fits what it was designed to fit, it brought Wind-Up Records the fame for two of its artists, and breathed life into the movie \\"Daredevil.\\" It was something that fit an empty niche on the radio, and was subsequently all that played in that niche.The rest of the album, however, is much more artful and incredible. Epic in scope and premise, and it fits Amy's image perfectly (seductive but foreboding). By now \\"Going Under\\" has been no doubt their second single, and perhaps it will change your opinion slightly, but it doesn't defer away from the common radio-rock enough to be my final example. Songs \\"Tourniquet\\", \\"Taking Over Me\\", \\"Haunted\\", \\"Imaginary\\", and \\"My Last Breath\\" are dark and complex.I do agree, they do have room to grow, but I don't think they're going to be stuck in the niche their first big single put them into for long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Awsome","review":"All the songs have meaning and insight on how people actually can be like \\"Torniquite\\" and \\"Bring me to Life\\". I liked all the songs and most of them have the difficulties and hardships of peoples lives in them. I would rate this a 5/5 on my top choice list."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the heck?","review":"When I first heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\" on the radio, i fell in love. Even though the band is not \\"new\\" and \\"groundbreaking\\" I think that they really an incredably talented band and their cd is amazing. Trust me, it's worth it. But, exuse me, what the heck is all of this crap about them being the same as Linkin Park? Are they seriously talking about the same band? I'm thinking they just heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and decided that they were too smart to actually LISTEN to the cd and figure out that they had a guest artist for ONE SONG. On the other hand, maybe they are just jealous that Evanescence has more talent than some crap band who, at the beginning of their career was really good, but now, well, they basically had two songs, and they just remixed them a lot and put different names on them. The truth hurts, doesn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitley deserved \\"Album of the year 2003\\"!!!!","review":"Man!I don\`t have enough words to describe this AWESOME ALBUM,the only thing that i can say is \\"BUY IT NOW IF U LIKE TO HEAR SOME REAL MUSIC\\".Although this album is not for the \\"KIDS\\" who like to \\"sucks the lollypops\\" like beyonce,justin etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"No variation","review":"I must say that I was hoping for more when I bought this cd. The whole album sounds more or less exactly like the song \\"Bring me to life\\" and in the long run it all becomes rather boring. Personally, I'd prefer a more melodic approach. In small doses, Evanescence is alright but the album feels like one long song instead of 11 separate tunes, much because of the way Amy Lee is structuring the vocal parts. And I'm sure this album will be regarded as very time typical in a couple of years. To me, Evanescence sounds like a nicer Skunk Anansie with a touch of Audioslave as well as The Calling. For depressed goth rockers wearing black this album might be a treat. Ten bucks says this band will be forgotten after the second album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutly Horrendous!!!","review":"This has to be without a doubt one of the worst bands i have ever heard.Her voice is terrible plus she just drones on and on until you become clinically depressed. And then that guy comes in and starts rapping and it sounds like linkin park. Every single song sounds exactly the same. The lyrics are horrible too. Gore metal lyrics have more variation than hers. Why does she sound so depressed all the time. What does she have to be depressed about? Nothing. The music is just as bad as the lyrics and vocals. The guitars are dreadfull. They are tuned way down so that they have no definition. If you have any self respect do not by this abomination."},{"rating":"1","title":"makes a nice coaster","review":"she sings well in the studio and sucks live. same guitar riff in every song. epitome or what is wrong with american \\"music\\". all the do is copy (poorly) bands like lacuna coil and nightwish from overseas.anyone who calls this band \\"fresh\\" knows nothing about music, for to me \\"fresh\\" does not involve repeating the same tired routine again with a different package and a new schtick. guitar tone matches linkin park (and they are sooooo fresh, bleh), stlye matches linkin park at its worst. yet one would not call linkin park a \\"fresh\\" band.i only use linkin park as an example for they are the easiest and most well known of everything in the pop-metal (two words that do not belong together) genre.my god, will someone save me from bad, talentless, regugitated music passed off as \\"fresh\\" and \\"new\\"?thanks nightwish, thanks lacuna coil, thanks flowing tears, thanks beesech, thanks the crest, thanks sinergy, thanks darkwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent, but reminds me of a better band...","review":"...which is called Lacuna Coil. I've been a fan of Lacuna Coil for a couple of years now. I found out about Evanescense from someone on LC mailing list. When I heard Evanescense, first thing that struck me is that it's very similar to LC. Still, LC is a better band. Cristina puts more feeling into her singing, and the musuc itself is heavier and richer.To summarize, Evanescense sounds like a watered-down version of Lacuna Coil, adapted for general audience and more radio friednly.Seriously folks, check out Lacuna Coil (either Comalies or Unleashed Memories album), and you will thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn it off - pleeeeeeeeese","review":"I guess it takes all tastes and vive la difference and all that but I agree with MR. \\"4 stars?!? You guys are nuts!!!\\" Apart from tempo variations every track sounded like the last - Bloody 'orrible like someone pounding on a dumpster with a large hammer and someone inside moaning to be let out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, they have fallen","review":"Evanescence has decided to no longer define themselves as a Christian band. I have no problem with secular bands. Evanescence, however, waited until after the peak of sales for their popular cd \\"Fallen\\" to make the announcement. They've taken advantage of the people who were looking to support an area of music that is often overlooked. I support them in changing their label from Christian to secular... at least they will not be seen as hypocrites... but it seems manipulative of them to have chosen the timing as they have so that they could maximize profits. This cd is very appropriately titled \\"Fallen\\".(If you are looking for a nice, clean cd done by secular artists, this it great! The songs are a bit repetetive though. Many of them sound sort of like the same song over and over, just with different words.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAKE UP ALREADY.","review":"Evanescence sucks. Their just as bad as this other angst ridden garbage like Nirvana and Linkin Park. Amy Lee can't sing, and she's overrated. Her, Kurt Cobain, Chester Bennington, and Mike Shinoda are the worst rock vocalists ever. In fact, almost every rock band of today is just the same boring flat out garbage. A note to all these sucky bands:Quit whining about how miserable your lives are already, none of us wanna hear about it. It's a good thing we have bands like The Darkness and Jet, because hopefully that is a sign that will be saved from this angst-filled crap soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"what would you classify this as.........","review":"I don't really know what demographic or mallkid sector they are going for here, but I can tell you one thing this is bad music! Just from one listen through this drudge I can say with certainty that the guitar work is childish and thoughtless, the drums are right on cue with the guitars, and just because you have a female lead singer doesn't make you relevant or even good for that matter. It follows the same imputant formula that every radio band displays in all of its nauseating glory. I know that these two bands don't fall into this particular musical demo, but just the same I would rather listen to a great band like the Pretenders, or Sonic Youth. Two great bands lead by two great female lead singers. And I do encourage people to checkout my other reviews, it only seems fair that I p*ss you off with them as well. Have a great day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cher with guitars","review":"Thats how accurately I can describe the sound. Amy Lee, whos voice is probally THE most manufactured and overrated in the music industry, croaks her way through some of the most vile, bland, tearfully bad \\"music\\" that undoubtely will attract more than its fair share of slimy fat goths, who, ironically, have skin as pale as Amy Lees on the cover.Want metal with great vocals?

I can't even tell if the restof the band is any good because the vocals turned me offso bad. Vocals isn't always the high on my list as I canSOMETIMES look past lack luster vocals IF the rest is good,but it just shows how bad \\"Amy Lee\\" really is at singing.She really needs another job. Well, she makes money offof misguided teens so I guess she is doing fine moneywise.Honestly, I've never been so turned off by a singers voiceto the point to that I can't even tell if the rest of theband is any good.

If everyone smashed c.ds like this, then it would be a perfect world. But they don't, they just keep living their stupid mockery lives, and get married and have children.

If I could, I would give this CD -3 stars. Horrid beyond words can describe. Within a year, this band will thankfully be forgotten. The band's ready-made goth look only adds to debachery and rancid fluff of commercial rock. (...)heheheh..Ladies and Gents..the modern day spinal tap is Evanescence. The reasons would be too long and many why you should avoid this album, but let me sum it up for you..if you have any creativity whatsoever, and enjoy good original tunes in the alternative rock genre, go with a band like Dredg. It's a fresh sound, and it has soul. If you like commercial pop you will probably like this album, and will probably be on your way to buy the new Linkin Park CD as well.. if thats your thing, then fine, but I'll choose my own music, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was dissappointed","review":"I bought this album based on hearing one song off of it. While Amy Lee's vocals are quite good, I was shocked at the poor technical quality. There are several digital glitches in the recordings. Didn't anybody listen to this before it was released? This album will not help future sales of Evanescence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallen from rock heaven...","review":"Let me introduce you to Evanescence. A band out of Little Rock, coming from an unknown label, and getting its big break on a movie soundtrack. Who would have thought this band could go 5x platinum and have 10 million records sold worldwide.Well... Fallen is the result. The album that got them where they are.Between the strong guitars of Ben Moody and the chilling vocals of Amy Lee, this album is a stand out.Although the songs to tend to sound the same the first few times you listen to them, each song is unique. \\"Imaginary\\", \\"Taking Over Me\\", \\"Whisper\\", and \\"Everybody's Fool\\" have to be extreme highlights.I love every song on this album and I love the band. So I guess I have a kind of bias opinion. But I do recommend you listen to this album. You will probably enjoy something on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I usually dont listen to Rock type music, but this music has really got a good twist and variety too it.

Amy Lee's voice is hauntingly powerful and unique. Although the songs tend to be a bit formulaic, this is not just your average death/goth CD. Every song will get stuck in you head, but because of how good they all are, you won't mind. Some of the best songs are \\"Going Under,\\" \\"Bring Me to Life,\\" \\"Tourniquet,\\" and \\"My Immortal.\\" You may not like the songs on the first listen, but as you listen more, the songs get better and better. I have no doubt that Evanescence is here to stay, and you should have no doubts about buying this CD. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanescence Rox","review":"I think that Evanescence is the best new rock group out there on the market right now. Their music is what keeps me going all day. I live for their music. If I didn't listen to their CD at least once a day, I would be going crazy right now. I don't know how people can judge their music with just seeing their picture. I know that if I saw their CD last year, I wouldn't of bought it from the cover, but I bought it anyway and I listened to it and I couldn't stop listening to it. It is the best CD ever. You don't have to be \\"gothic\\" to listen to their music and understand it, you have to give it a chance and \\"look between the lines\\" or so you say. I love the Evanescence CD Fallen. Just give the CD a chance, and I can gurantee you will like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal?","review":"I don't think so. I can't believe people actually listen to this and say \\"Yeah this stuff is hard as hell.\\" This stuff is so far from being hard or real metal it's not even funny. I'll give the chick credit though. She has a good voice, and is a very good singer, that's why I gave this album 2 stars instead of 1, but people, this stuff is not metal. If you think you're a metal head by listening to this type of music you're sadly mistaken. If you want to hear some real metal that makes this band sound as soft as the Spice Girls listen to Slayer, Kreator, Cradle of Filth, or old Metallica. That is what metal is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Band is Only Amy Lee","review":"Yes the songs are great .... the band is good they paly well but what stands out is Amy's voice and her piano playing ...well the rest of the band i cannot say much as there is not much talent in Guitar player or the drummer nor the bassist..Mind you they play well but nothing great..there's not a single solo riff or a few moments of solo instruments...Its not that i dont like the music its great but i sure hope they can get better in their next album as there is lots of spaces to improve upon....But all in all Amy stand's out with her amazing haunting voice ... kind of reminds me of Greg Lake of ELP..Anyway its a good start and a good album as well.."},{"rating":"2","title":"KIlled me!","review":"At first, like everyone else I judged this band on their success with \\"Bring me back to life\\", but you can't truly appreciate this band until you hear the beautiful range that Amy's voice acheives. True enough some of the songs in this album are steeped in dark themes but just give \\"Immortal\\" a chance and you can appreciate the beutiful writing evident here as well...very deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO FABULOUS BUY THIS RIGHT NOW","review":"Amy Lee is AMAZING. This band ROCKS. Since I've bought this CD (the day it came out) I have listened to nothing else. There are no words to describe how wonderful this band is. If I could I would give it 100 stars. Her voice is wonderful, and the guitars, drums, and piano parts are amazing. If you want something that completely rocks, buy this album!!!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"I enjoy listening to music of all types and most of the time while I may like a song, it rarely impresses me. This album impressed me. There is not a song that I don't like. Evanescence is one of the best groups I've ever heard. The combination of rock, vocals, and lyrics just amazes me. I would recomment this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"definatley evanescence","review":"bring me to live is overplayed on the radio just a little bit. i loved it when it first came out, but now i cannot stand it. love the slow songs on this album. my immortal is just a beautifully crafted peice of math. i love the guitar riff in \\"tourniquet\\" and ends with one of my favorite songs. i don't usually like girls trying to be all hard core, but this is just outstanding slash awesome. good stuff if i do say so myself. the only setback of the album is \\"haunted,\\" which is definatley haunting if that's what you're looking for. it doesn't do anything for me, however. get some jollies by checking out this album. good day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"Wow..Evanescence is a really talented and amazing group!

The Vocalist is just amazing!!! Lyrics and the arrangment of instruments were put together with a true creativeness that you just can't find in today's \\"proper\\" music...THIS BAND WILL BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanescence is awesome","review":"I've been waiting for a decent rock band to listen to and then came Evanescence. WOW. It was like nothing I have ever listened to before. Their music is enjoyable because you can tell that the lyrics came from their heart. In 'Hello' (the song Amy did as tribute to the death of her sister), you can hear the sadness in her voice. (Also notice that she's never performed 'Hello' live... bummer.) Also, those of you who HATE and LOATHE Evanescence for one reason or another hear this: GET A LIFE. If you hate them so much, then why do continue to 'waste' your life concentrating on them? Personally, I think your 'friends' hate them and you're just a stereotypical follower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I got this CD because I loved their radio hits \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"My Immortal.\\" While those songs are beautiful, they are not representative of the rest of the album. Although I tried and tried to get into this CD, the hard rock teen goth style just isn't my cup of tea, and the lyrics are too depressing. If you are a fan of bands such as Linkin Park or Seether, you might enjoy this. However, if you only like \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Bring Me To Life\\" because of Amy's powerful vocals, you'd be better off listening to Tori Amos or Sarah McLachlan."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"when i was 'goth' i hated them for trying ot be goththen i decided to make a channge in my life, i had a new girl, i was happy, so i bought neww clothes and got a new attitude towards lifeso i decided to try out some old cds laying around and i saw this and i thought hey, i never gave it a shot, why notbut alas..i hate them even more cuz theyre songs are generic boring and bland *redundancy needed*im glad they broke upoh yeah, i gave it 2 stars cuz her voice is amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"i was recommed that i try them by Amy's younger sister's friend. who is my friend. i found the lyric and boy, are THEY GOOD OR WHAT???? she a good old arkanasen who can sing. in my opionoin. wow. what a voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"more talent then they know what to do with","review":"i had to write a review after seeing the 2 idiots at the bottom of this first page, basicly there's only 2 reasons you wouldn't like this band,A)don't like bands with talentB)don't like female singers in a rock band or any bandthis album is incredible I can't wait till there new album , everything about the band is nothing like you've ever heardLuguna Coil, or whatever the name is, don't even compare, to Evanescence, i listened to them , and they got nothing, not to mention Amy lee's voice is uncomparable to anyone on the planet !she takes your breath away on just about every song,so for all the clowns that don't like it, don't know what talent is in the first place... get a life,lol stick with your simple music, that goes nowhere, after all 1 star reviewers ! there record sales speak for themselves over 6 Million. !!!Rock on !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my essential albums","review":"I surprised myself by buying this album--I am a die-hard classic rock fan who rarely listens to anything made after the 1970s (even though I wasn't born then). Evanescence is not the sort of band I normally listen to, but I have to tell you that I couldn't be without this CD. Amy Lee's vocal talent is obviously the first thing to mention--Lee's incredibly captivating, powerful voice is at once a contrast and an accompaniment to the surprisingly polished, heavy guitar riffs of Ben Moody and the instrumental work of the rest of the band. The lyrics are dark but addicting, and I often find myself unable to get any number of the album's tracks out of my head. I love every song on this album, but \\"Going Under\\" \\"Everybody's Fool\\" \\"Haunted\\" and \\"Tourniquet\\" are my favorites. Even if you're not a fan of this genre, give this album a shot--it'll surprise you and leave you eager for more from this band from Arkansas."},{"rating":"2","title":"my opinon has changed!!","review":"My first impression of this band was linkin park with a chick.

The voice of Amy Lee is awsome. It's range is great. Her voice fits her type of music style.Sure some of the other reviews say it's ok, but it's an awsome CD. Some of my favorites are My Immortal,Hello,Whisper,and Bring Me To Life. The CD isn't all rock, My Immortal and Hello are soft. You have to listen to the CD.

This is plain r&b whith a bad annoying voice, guitars and they throw that with good lyrics. I admit the lyrics are good but everything I mean come on? Why do people listen to artifcial crap like this? The media trys to get teenies listen to Avril and Evanescence calling it 'the new wave' or whatever.

Grammy nominations? Digidesign (the maker of Pro Tools) should be getting the grammy for this one. Has anyone ever heard this wretched \\"band\\" peform live? This album is 100% product of digital production and editing. From one end to another overdramatic singing with not a hint of subtlety, variation, or dynamics. It's cold, lifeless, sterile, and boring. Yet the masses lap it up like kittens. I weap for our culture that people will buy anything that is packaged, processed, and rammed down their throats. What's happened with Evanescence is the new model for the reeling recording industry. Take a few acts and RAM them down everyone throats until they buy. And if you fall for it, you only have yourself to blame. Evanescence are a musical Big Mac. Sucker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"This cd is very very annoying.

People are now trying to promote any band that has somehting new or different. I simply look at the music, i pay no attention to the fact that this is a nu-metal band with a female singer... and I see them as being similar to all of the other nu-metal linkin park type bands out there. However, I believe that Linkin Park are better than this band.I'm sure many will disagree, but if you enjoy music that doesn't just use a head banging beat and catchy chorus to gain a fanbase... I do not believe you should pay attention to this band.Overall, though, they aren't terrible, I just believe that they have gotten very over rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suicidal Junk","review":"I hate this CD.

If you like this you have no taste. This is mainstream and this fails. Amy Lee is cocky and arrogant, she trys to act underground and angsty but she has more money than I can imagine. Only one kind of girl looks up to somebody as pathetic as her. The cliche \\"goth\\" girls ranging 12-17 because this kind of music can totally relate to the pain of growing up in suburban america, don't forget to keep cutting yourselves to relieve all your mental anguish, ladies! Look at rock these days, now look at rock a decade ago. The difference is disgusting, while mtv had some credability left then, it is all but gone now. Go ahead, disagree with me, I could care less.

Crap like that has had such a hold on the charts that I thought I'd never see something like Evanescence in the mainstream, but when you are as good as this band, you force people to pay attention. When you blend the vocals of Amy Lee with the metal of the rest of the band, the result is beyond what you could ever comprehend until you actually hear it.

Amy's voice is spectacular and Ben's guitar work, while basic, just sounds good.However, I recently purchased Comalies by Lacuna Coil, and it totally blew me away. Christina Scabbia has a beautiful voice, different than Amy's (she actually sounds like Madonna on a couple songs). But the music with Lacuna Coil is so much more complex and just better.And if you have not seen Christina, you will blown away as much from her looks as her voice.I would recommend buying both, but bottom line is, Lacuna Coil is just a better CD. But they are much less commercial than Ev, and I doubt if you be hearing them on top 40 radio ever.I am not bashing Evanescence either.

(Lots of Christian rock artists write similar songs...\\"My God my tournacit bring to me your salvation\\". Anyway, this is a great rock album.

'WHO IS THAT BAND?' When she told me 'Evanescence', I went to a record store that same day and bought the CD. 'Bring Me To Life' will forever be my favorite song on the CD, as well as one of my favorite songs of all time. Amy's vocal and Paul McCoy's rap really work well together. My other favorite is 'Hello'. Amy's voice and the haunting melody just sends chills down my spine. 'Evanescence' were very deserving of their two Grammys. In my opinion, they should have received one for each of the five categories they were nominated. So many people try to label them, but I consider them to be 'rock', period. They cross all genres, having been featured on, I believe, seven different Billboard charts, from Adult Top 40 to Modern Rock. Quite simply, they are a GREAT band with a GREAT CD.

It's finally here, and it was all that I could have hoped for. For those long time Evanescence fans you will be awed once again. This album has several new songs while others that were released in limited edition, some have been remixed and give it even greater depth. \\"My Immortal\\" is such a great song along with many others of the like. Evanescence has had some greater background pieces, some more piano, and more strings. I love this cd and would strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something more than the dime-a-dozen rock of today. Amy has such a powerful and wonderful voice, and Ben's lyrics are just so awesome. The songs evoke such emotion and most people can connect with the messages in each song.

Its really not worth buying, and I'm glad I didn't spend any money to listen to this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The ingredients for success are here, particularly in the powerful voice of the lead singer. Unfortunately, there's little that is new or interesting in the music. Frankly, the \\"woe-is-me\\" gothic darkness thing is tiresome and shockingly immature from this group who are no longer teens. Fascinating how their target audience has swallowed the bait, though. Certainly these tunes are preferable to the pre-packaged, programmed pop singers of today. But these songs aren't really any deeper or better; they merely have a different shade of surface gloss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"Rating the CD, I'd give them 4 stars. However, rating how they perform live, I'd have to give them one star just to be nice. The CD is amazing, and it's one of the best I've heard in the past year, but the live performance isnt great.

The music is terrible, I getting very sick of hearing amy lee piss and moan about how sad she is awww poor baby . The only reason teenage girls listen to her is because they feel they can \\"relate\\" to her pain. Give me a break!!!! I saw an interview she did with VH1 and she self proclaimed herself a \\"Gothic Princess\\" How arrogant can she be.

PEACE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated & Depressing!","review":"The hype surrounding this album is truly astonishing, however I feel it doesn't live up to the hype at all. The lyrics are extremely repetitive and each song is more depressing than the next. I can't bear to listen to it at all now because it's such a downer! I feel this band is extremely overrated, especially the lead singer, who has a very weak voice that's piercing to the ears at times. I don't recommend this album to anyone, I guarantee you'll be disappointed, especially because it's being touted as a 'masterpiece.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPPED OFF LACUNA COIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"if you like this album you will most certainly go crazy over Lacuna Coil. Evanescence and this album is a straight RIP OFF of a REAL music group called Lacuna Coil. Lacuna Coil has been doing this longer and better with SO much more feeling in their songs as well. Evanescence sounds like this music was just put together like LEGOS compared to Lacuna Coil,..no feeling!! try \\"Comalies\\",..its their best album and far better than Evanescence. \\"Unleashed Memories\\" is a good cd as well. nothing against Evanescence but they flat STOLE their style from Lacuna Coil and DOES NOT pull it off as well as Lacuna Coil does. trust me, this is the only review i have ever written. i just felt i had to write it after hearing this cd after all the raving that has been done about it. if your a mindless 15 year old girl then you might like Evanescence better. but if you truly love music i PROMISE you like Lacuna Coil much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Band is just Amy Lee","review":"Yes the songs are great .... the band is good they paly well but what stands out is Amy's voice and her piano playing ...well the rest of the band i cannot say much as there is not much talent in Guitar player or the drummer nor the bassist..Mind you they play well but nothing great..there's not a single solo riff or a few moments of solo instruments...Its not that i dont like the music its great but i sure hope they can get better in their next album as there is lots of spaces to improve upon....But all in all Amy stand's out with her amazing haunting voice ... kind of reminds me of Greg Lake of ELP..Anyway its a good start and a good album as well.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Share quality music with your teenagers","review":"Let's face it: There is little quality rock being produced today. When you listen to this CD you'll realize how deprived you have been for so long.Besides, you're kids will like it. You'll have something to share. Maybe they won't spend so much time holed up in their bedrooms and not interacting with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I listen to it everyday","review":"I got this CD when it was new in 2003. I've been addicted to Amy Lee's music ever since. I also have their follow-up album \\"Anywhere but Home\\" and eagerly await their next release, which should be in March 2006. If the music were clothes, I'd have worn them out by now :-D"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent start","review":"Evanescence uses a forumla that works really well on this CD. Amy Lee's high soprano operatic vocals over catchy guitar hooks and smooth melodies about pain and anger are displayed throughout this CD. I do think that Origin displayed more musical diversity when it came to songwriting for evanescence but this album was polished to reach out to a target audience, and I'm sure their follow up album will display more of their songwriting and musical composition skills. The videos from the album are really well done and having meaningful messages, they will continue to make great music videos in the future too I hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively Wonderful! You must buy this CD!","review":"Amy Lee's melodic voice combined with edgy guitar riffs creates an original sound that works surprisingly well on this debut album. In the midst of all the rap/metal and Nickleback sound-alikes, Evanescence is a real stand-out. First, because there are so few females in the male dominated rock industry and second because her voice is just so haunting and powerful that it follows you. It's like Sarah McLachlan meets Linkin Park. There's that same eerie, poetic melody, but with a sound you can rock to instead of lull you to sleep. I've read several people make references to Tori Amos, but I just don't see it, other than they're both females. If anything, this album is more reminiscent of POE. If you like \\"Bring Me To Life\\", the song that's been getting tons of airplay, you'll like this album. \\"Going under\\" and \\"Tourniquet\\" are more of the same, while \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Haunted\\" feature that powerful voice minus the guitars. I highly recommend this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clear Channel rocks my socks oh yeah!","review":"Here's something to blast out of your Sony boombox during Greek Rush! You saw the video on TRL and hear the song all the time on every 'cool' radio station! You know your Quiksilver-clothed peers will think you're really 'cool' to be listening to it! Who needs to explore any other music when your favorite music brand, Windup Records (home of Creed!) is spewing as much as much music out as you could possibly want? It's like Nike, just do it! Remember, kids, buy Windup! It's worth every penny of your hard-earned mall job dollar. Buy this because it's really cool and it's a lot like Lincoln Park. Don't forget to pick up a few Abercrombie pullovers at the mall! AAAAAArrgh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get ready for the crash","review":"It took Evanescence a half a decade to come up with the songs on this CD (for those of us who remember the garbage they cut to CD when they released Origin in 2000 and the two EPs prior to that.) They managed to cull out just short of a dozen songs for Fallen, and they result is still pathetic. The next CD, which they will surely be under pressure to write, will suck far more than this one. To make matters worse, they won the Grammy for Best New Artist - sure to send them to the cut out bin on future CDs, just like every other artist to win that award.Fallen has to be the most repetitive CD I've ever heard. The first two songs are a sign of the remaining nine. Same goes for the lyrics. Over and over with the same trite, high-schoolish, I'm-in-so-much-pain whining. Amy--cut your wrists already and save all the misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, Make It Stop!","review":"I can't state it any clearer than Forest Law's review. Evanescence is awful. They're a corporate band on a corporate label run by corporate greed. Funny how the stories of Amy Lee being Christian were swept under the rug as soon as that first awful song hit the top of the chart, huh? She's a fake, but a well-coached one. The entire Wind-Up label is a joke. It should be called Flash-in-the-Pan Music. My advice to Evanescence: INVEST WISELY. My advice to those of you who are thinking of buying this: go to the used CD store. There are thousands of them there. Right next to Nickelback and 3 Doors Down and Creed and Good Charlotte and the rest of the rock radio crap that's currently riding this wave of teen idolization. Wake me up in 2006."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album has 'Fallen' into the trash can.","review":"I've heard this band beiong compared to Linkin Park many times, and I thought to myself \\"Hey, Linkin Park isn't that bad of a band. I think I'll listen to this Evanescence album\\". Sadly, I found out that this really didn't sound like a Linkin Park album one bit.The main problem that I had with this album is that every song sounded the same to me. And the thing is, that song sounded like crap to me. So this whole album felt like an hour-long crappy song to me.I give it 1 star*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voice, but dissapointed","review":"Music for the most part sounds like Linkin Park and many songs sound the same. Scoring: 1 Star for A great Female voice and 1 star for the frequent piano- power chord guitar mix = 2 stars.Order the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for a debut...","review":"... but I've heard better! The songs, while rocking and quite good, do just sound like variations on one theme. I love \\"Bring Me To Life\\" as a track, but having heard all the versions of it possible (with the \\"rap\\", without the \\"rap\\", accoustic, live, etc) I have to say that the song is only as good as it is because of Paul McCoy of 12 Stones. That's a REALLY good album.Seriously, give 12 Stones a listen and I guarantee you'll agree with me on which Wind-Up band has more talent. I'm not saying Evanescence are bad, the album's quite good for a first go, but as someone who has been reviewing CDs for some time and is themselves a musician, I can say this is not as good as it's hyped up to be. It IS the best album of the year... but that isn't really saying a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated hype....","review":"First off I'd like to inform all the radio-friendly listeners that this is not original...if you knew anything about metal then you would know that great bands like Lacuna Coil and Nightwish were doing this way before Evanscene...but for the mainstream they are head and shoulders above the rest.The music is okay, nothing special though. The female vocals take centre stage with some great vocal talent. But then there is the nu-metal vocalist...omg how much does he sound like other bands like Finch and Hell is for Heros, an obvious strategy to sell more records. And the music is fairly average.Conclusion:The female vocalist deserves five stars the male vocalists deserve one and the band deserves 2.5 stars. Contains lots of catchy hooks for the radio friendly audience to sell by the millions.If you are a true fan of metal and music as a whole do your self a favour and pick up a Nightwish, Lacuna Coil, Opeth, or Pain Of Salvation album, and get some value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm fallen forever...","review":"This CD is really awesome and I can't stop listening to it! Evanescence is really awesome and I in love with the band. I love the sound of Amy's voice because it sounds so awesome! I love every song on the CD because it is so awesome!But every song on the CD except #9 is talking about the girl from my dream and it is haunting me. The song Whisper is talking the girl from my dream because it has Latin at the end. The girl from my dreams tries to kill me in my dreams. When I listen to the CD sometimes it hauntis me and I want to scream.I love this CD because it is so awesome and I can't stop listening to it! Now when I hear the word \\"evanescence\\" I could fade away into the darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you hate this band, you suck!","review":"Amazing cd from beginning to end I don't give a crap about the idiots whining about mainstream rock, there's nothing wrong with most rock music period I don't care if it's on the radio or not if it's 30 years old or brand new rock has always and still is very good. Ok that out of the way this debut cd is amazing! I doubt Open Door will be any better but this one cd makes these guys almost legendary right away! I don't see how anyone can hate this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian rock?","review":"wow who would have thought christian rock could be this good. i mean this entire cd is about god, and yet it is very hard to distinguish the diffrence between this and many other non-christian rock band. the cd see,s to have a theme of being lost and falling(hint: FALLEN)away from life.this cd also has the biggest fault that so many cds have now. the theme. everything in it sounds the same. its just one really long song with little spaces here and there. if you like creed or linkin parks more \\"peaceful\\" songs then this is defintly a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of my favorite CDs","review":"The trick with this album is- the more you listen to it, the more you like it. Amy's voice can you give you chills- it's the perfect accompaniment to the hard rock background. The lyrics, I feel, rely on love as major theme, but, unlike some love songs, these songs are far from sappy. The music goes from being loud to sometimes being quiet and somber- but the transition of one song to another is excellent throughout- the CD flows, making it all the easier to listen to. There is not a song that I don't like on this album, and that is a real treat to find. This CD is definitely ear candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Rock to Life!","review":"This band blows me away! I can't remember the last time I heard rock this good. I also think it's the only CD in my massive collection that DOESN'T have at least one track I hate. I'm a picky music listener, and a cautious buyer on new stuff, even by artists I like... but I would jump on anything by these guys! The vocals send chills down my spine, and unlike the generally out-of-character \\"ballads\\" done by 80's rockers like Guns N Roses, the slower songs don't seem out of place at all. They meld perfectly with every other beat on the disc. This is what great poetry sounds like as rock music. What's even wilder is, if you like \\"Bring Me to Life\\" from Daredevil, Evanescence only gets better from there! Anybody out there looking to sell their old independent album?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I had first heard the song Bring Me To Life because it was WWE's theme song for their latest Pay-Per-View, No Way Out. I liked the song so much, I bought the CD on a whim. I am so happy that I did. As soon as the first song played, I knew that this CD was about to become one of my favorites. I play it so much, my friends are sick of it. Amy Lee has a great voice, which sounds amazing with the music stlye the band uses. I can't wait until Evanescence puts out another CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I got to know Evanescence by some MP3's on MP3.com and I was like \\"WOW\\". So, haling from The Netherlands, I ordered their first album Origin. The mixture from Gothic rock, and some metal influences had something special.So when word came oud that there was going to be an new album, I was really curious.It turned out to be very disappointing. All the refreshing and experimental influences were gone and the musical direction had turned to a direction I don't like that much.To put it in another way: They sound like Linkin park with a female vocalist. Well, there are enough clones of linkin park already.Is fallen that bad? No. It's high quality music, but it's nothing special. Please return to the old sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock hard Music Fan","review":"Evanescence at first took on the Christian band scene and I do not know why they chose so but I am certainly glad they did. Not only does this cd reach into your soul and amaze you with the ability they have of relating themselves to you. Yes, some of these songs you can only relate to if you have been depressed before but im sure everyone has been depressed at one time or another. All in all this cd is touching with songs like \\"My Immortal\\" but also has a rock kind of feel to it with songs like \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"Going Under\\" and with songs with a mixture of both such as \\"Everybody's Fool\\". I strongly suggest everyone listen to this cd and give them a chance before judging them by the way they look on the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Overated","review":"When there \\"hit single\\" came out, this band was all the rage and was called things such as a \\"breath of fresh air\\" or \\"original\\".I rushed out and bought this cd and sadly failed to get into it after listening to it for about 10 days.The lead singer has a very beautifull voice, but thats the only good thing i can say about this cd, it gets very boring soon (just like all pop music).If you want to see a real beautifull cd you should check out Labyrinths s/t."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gabage","review":"This is the most annoying band in the world. They have the most annoying songs call fallen and my immortal(weak and annoying )How can all you people give this piece of crap more than one star????? The singer is god dam horrible!!!! She can't sing! Try Arch Enemy if you wanna great vocal by girl(who is prettier then this dumb face ). This is just another MTV and radio friendly dumb boy/girl band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally, someone inspired by Linkin Park!","review":"You can have bands inspired by the following; the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Ramones, Guns n' Roses, Nirvana - and they don't suck.What is the problem when bands are inspired by recycled, shallow, angsty former boy-band poseurs? They continue to inspire more crappy recycled, angsty, whining poseurs. I'm aghasted to hear if this Amy Lee is inspired by Sarah Maclachlan and Tori Amos. It's like Linkin Park supposedly inspired by the Clash. Rock has \\"fallen\\" to filth so low that even Britney's latest album is more ORIGINAL that this garbage, and I'm serious, I meant it as a listener of Zeppelin, Pumpkins and classical music like Mahler and Beethoven.Contribute your 20 bucks to this group and you'll spawn more of Linkin Park imitators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been here seen there","review":"There have been numerous Evanescence type of bands in the last decade so what's the fuss here? Even the only good thing, My Immortal sounds uninspiring and too trite. And just talk about the same bland songs in a pool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying Too Hard","review":"I will be the first to admit that Amy Lee has a unique and beautiful voice but in their album \\"Fallen\\" it seems to me that they were trying too hard to be \\"creepy\\" and \\"gothic\\" in order to attract a certain fanbase. I don't know...it seems kinda fake to me. A hit and a miss. Weird lyrics that don't make any sense compiled together to seem falsely dark and demented. Nice try but awful. Stop trying so hard. (I give a two simply for the quality of Amy's voice) This album is nothing special simply just another band struggling to appeal to today's angsty and brooding youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most overrated album of 2003!!","review":"I bought this album for the singles \\"Bring Me To Life\\", \\"Going Under\\", and \\"My Immortal\\". I was so disappointed!! The rest of the album sounds absolutely NOTHING like these songs! After song seven, I began to wonder if track five was set on repeat!! \\"Hello\\" sounds remotely close to \\"My Immortal\\", but doesn't quite add up. Do yourself a big favor and just buy/download the singles! I'm selling this to some other unsuspecting person A.S.A.P.!! Go ahead and press the \\"not helpful\\" button, I don't care!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a blatant rip off of Nightwish","review":"If you all want to hear how it is really done listen to anything by a Finnish band called Nightwish. Evanescence is just a cheap American pop clone. Now that you all know my true feelings I will also say that people should really stop reviewing things multiple times to raise or lower a rating, that is just plain childish."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldnt give it 0 stars?!?","review":"This album is pure trash. This is why. I saw this band live at the hard rock cafe in Vegas last year, you might have seen it on TV. This is the worst concert I have ever been to in my life. First off, Amy Lee cannot sing at all, it is a fact, she sounded flatter than the chest of a 10 year old girl. On bring me to life, oh my god it was too funny, because Paul McCoy from 12 Stones wasnt there obvious, they had their guitarist \\"sing\\" that part, he flat out screamed it like at the top of his lungs I was crying laughing. But honestly unless you are looking for a goth avril lavigne I strongly suggest not buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, I'm Christian but also goth! Look at me! Look at me!","review":"Okay, I have very few things to say about this album.1) It sucks. I'm not just some pissy nu-metal hater (well, I am...), I've heard the entire album several times. It's talentless, vague and radio-friendly garbage.2) Evanescence only wishes they could be what Lacuna Coil is. If you really like Evanescence, check out Lacuna Coil--you'll be pleased.3) And now the only rewarding quality of this album--Amy Lee is pretty hot. But you don't need to buy the album for that... there are pictures online for free. Yay. She may be a talentless horrible person, but she's got nice cleavage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-Off","review":"They're a complete and utter rip-off of Nightwish. And, like another poster mentioned, they ripped off various nu-metal bands...but who cares about nu-metal? Anyways, check out Nightwish in the link above; and/or, check out Lacuna Coil above. They're both great bands. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Crap","review":"You heard me all you wannabe goths, this is stupid crap. The singer sounds like some chick that is on her . plus the guitarist and drummer can't play if their life depended on it.

Some Nu-Metal bands are good, but this is not one of them.Send me hate mail, my e-mail is Auragorn@aol.com hahaha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album!","review":"Alot of people consider this \\"goth\\", frankly i dont see how or why. To me this band is a total reminder of 80's music, specificly 80's joan jett blackhearts. Nice clean rock and roll with beautiful female vocals.Highly recommended for rock or metal fans, dont be discuraged when people try to find ways to link this to gothic music, this is pure rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite album","review":"I was happily surprised when I had listened this record through for the first time. I like all the songs but I have to admit that you can't find a better song than \\"bring me to life\\" on this album. Other songs that I like are the peaceful \\"my immortal\\" and \\"hello\\"... The rest of the songs seem like they're missing something, like they were never actually finished.. But it's still a great debut.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanescance - the outsiders view","review":"I haven't actually heard the full CD, just snippets from my friends and from amzon itself beofre buying. From what I have heard it is brilliant. I particularly like Bring Me To Life nad Imaginary, they are two brilliant tracks. Going Under is great too. If you like bands like T.a.T.u and Linkin Park then you'll like this alot. Although you may be like me, I am not a great fan of Linkin Park or T.a.T.u but I love this. My favourite is Robbie Williams and that is nothing like Evanescansce!

It's a travesty against Evans across the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"voice of an angel","review":"This disc is incredibly well mixed, as someone mentioned, a great production. The tone of the disc as a whole is haunting and ethereal. A large part of this involves lead singer Amy Lee's magnificently lyrical voice. One could liken her voices sound & style to early Sarah McLachlan (Touch).This is not to short the guitar work by Ben Moody. It has a great edge to it that makes this a true hard rock album. A perfect match to Amy's vocals.Check out their site, evanescence.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arkansas Rock","review":"The band has high energy without the rock/rap sound. The essence is dark, reminds me of a female ozzy, that has a shot of faith. The lyrics are dark, however, they have an uplifting message.

This Amy Lee chick sounds like she's dying when she sings. It's sad that so many people can actually call this rock I mean, this is a cd I would buy just to crack it. I can't believe so many people like this crap, I'll tell you what real rock is, try Linkin Park, Metallica, Korn, stuff like that. About the only thing I can say good about this band is that Amy Lee is hot. Honestly the most annoying part about this band is that people can actually call this rock. I don't mean to sound sexist but, girls and hard rock, they just don't mix. Sorry ladies. If it was possible I would give this album less then 1 star but this rating thing don't go into negatives. If you feel depressed and want to hurt yourself in some way but this album and listen to it, otherwise don't even bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Just Don't Get It.","review":"I really don't see how there is anybody out there who actually thinks that any of this groups songs are good. I'll give them credit for halfway decent music, but that's not the reason I gave it such a low review. The reason for that is because the lead singer has one of the worst voices that I have ever heard. It's like listening to fingernails on a chalkboard. This girl's voice is something that the world should have to hear again, or have even heard in the first place. It just goes to show you how talentless a band can be these days. I really hope that it doesn't get any worse than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm lost for words.","review":"....So I lied.This album is a wonderful mixture of rock and gothic music, all neatly crafted together to be easy on the ears, while keep the listener intent on the background beat and Amy Lee's lyrics at the same time.One thing that someone should respect about this band is the variety in their music. The album opens up with 'Going Under', which shows off Amy's rocker voice, accompanied by catchy guitar chords. Yet when the track 'Tourniquet' begins to play, the keys of the piano play a sullen melody, with Amy's more Enya-esque voice singing along with it.To be quite frank, I am surprised that the band had been around before the movie Daredevil and hadn't gotten some kind of recognition. \\"Fallen,\\" has to be one of the best CDs I have ever listened to, and I predict it will stay the best for a very long time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE!!!!!!!","review":"More minimalist nu-metal guitars, cheezy synthesizers, angst-ridden vocals, etc. etc.And not unexpectedly, this CD has the same rhythm throughout -- the same rhythm that's been used throughout all \\"rock\\" music of the past 5 years:Boom ^ ^ ^ Clack ^ B' B' Boom Clack ^ ^ Clack ^ ^ B' (repeat).It's torture already."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have given 0 stars but...","review":"I'm just way too generous. Actually, it's because I can't. One star is the lowest I can give so consider it a 0. Evanescence is a major example of the new generation of music. They're completely untalented, overrated, and I strongly believe Amy Lee or whatever her name is should go and pursue her great dream of becoming an opera singer. That really wasn't her great dream but I think she should anyway. Why is it, you ask, that Evanescence is the most popular \\"band\\" out there(they're not even a band, Evanescence IS Amy Lee or whatever her name is)? Because mainstream music listeners have no taste in music. Evanescence's guitar riffs aren't even riffs, and Amy Lee or whatever her name is sounds the same in every song. So stop blabbing about how Evanescence are pure geniuses and go buy yourselves some real music.Any comments? email me at geekslashnerd@yahoo.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Brutal Heavy Metal Since Linkin Park!","review":"The heavy metal diehards at MTV have outdone themselves!

Let's inject it with estrogen!\\"And so we now have what is probably the most terrifying, offending, gut-wrenching piece of goat-praising brutality EVER released! The vocals are so tortured, so heartfelt, so moving, the synthesizers so lush, so spooky and haunting, and the guitar work so bone-crushingly heavy, that you'll be clenching your teddy bear 'till the very end.

This is complete crap, and this band might have some of WORST musicians I have ever heard. (besides Blink 182) The only thing they have going for them was a decent lead singer, and if she was smart she would dump these losers and go solo, and maybe she might have a shot of leading a decent rock band. I am glad to see that since 2002, they have managed to release one album, and one album of Live material from this album..WTF????? Face it people, this bands 15min of fame is over, and if you are giving this over 3 stars, you might want to take some classes on music theroy. Stop giving sell out MTV created artist your money, and start supporting other musical artist that deserve more then your 30bucks for a version of this..and OH...a LIVE version of more of the same crap....GOOD GRIEF!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evanescence Who?","review":"Evanescence Who?

I like how she makes her own clothing also. But I am sick and tried of people labeling this band Goth. Goths are long time gone or older now..Like in the 50s-80s...If you want real gothic music then listen to bands such as Dead Can Dance,Play Dead, Joy Divison, London After Midnight,Dreadful Shadows,Bauhaus..They were goths. Goth is not a bunch of people wearing makeup no you got them wrong..I am only 15 and I know whats real goth and real punk and real music..You may not argree with me But thats ur option and you can say whatever you want to..I am not telling you to stop listening to this band or anyting I am just speaking my mind in a nice way dont say its a mean way or anything cause I am not like that.

For those of you who are thinking \\"hey look, how cool am I, I'm a goth now because I like Evanescence!\\" are just fooling yourselves. The purpose of this \\"band\\" was to trick the average pop junkie into thinking they were goth.The music is simple, the lyrics are simple, so all in all this leads to a very simple boring CD.If you want real goth music check out The 69 Eyes, Tristania etc. Or if you are just looking for something slightly different from the watered down boring pop that is constantly doing the rounds on the charts take a listen to Lacuna Coil, these Italians know what they're doing, but whatever you do don't download/buy/steal \\"Fallen\\" - you be wasting your time/money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who listens to this junk?","review":"I hardly know this band but my niece loves that stupid song \\"Bring me to life.\\" Every person who listens to this is must be a prissy 14-year old girl who can't seem to get a boyfriend by listening to this crap.

At first I thought it might be \\"Linkin Park Jr.\\" with the slight twist of a female vocalist. Turned out to be the perfect complimentary style I've been fond of most recently (i.e. Kidney Thieves, Curve) - aggressive yet subtle, masculine tamed by feminine (or is it vice-versa on this record?), rock smartened by electronics (but not overdone). The vocal harmonies are beautiful and production is excellent. As far as the \\"weighty\\" lyrical content, it's a unique perspective and you're either into it or you're not. I read a rather misleading review earlier regarding this album and Christianity, and I felt (as a Christian) it needed to be said (in defense) that it's a relief to see other Christians exploring/struggling with more difficult subject matter in order to vocalize/contend with the darker side of life. After all, we're only human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallen is a work of art","review":"it's like beautiful painting translated into music, all the words will linger with for a long time, you'll be humming pieces throughout the rest of the week, you have to get this album you are missing so much if you don't. i'm one of those peopl who rarely buys albums because they are so expensive but this one is worth every cent you spend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album I heard in the recent years","review":"One of a few albums where I liked all the songs in it.

And I just bought this the other day! So what finally made me go out and buy it? Well, watching MTV the other day, the video for \\"My Immortal\\" started playing. I was taken in by Amy Lee's beautiful vocals along with the piano and strings and, of course, the heavy guitars which come in later. Anyways, I'll cut to the chase. Evanescence are a band that have shown tremendous maturity for a debut album! Amy's beautiful vocals and the rest of the band's superb musicianship definitely come through. Some might say that their music comes in as being way too melodramatic. Personally, I don't think so. The combination of angelic vocals, heavy guitars, strings, and synthesizers is just balanced and perfect without going overboard. Again, I just can't believe that I just got this album the other day. If you haven't bought your copy, I suggest you go out and buy one NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallen on top","review":"I personally had never heard of this band until just recently I heard \\"Bring me to life\\" on MTV and I instanly fell in love with it. I went and bought the cd and it was better then I expected. This band, Evanescence deserves to be compared to bands such as Linkin Park. They are that good. Songs like \\"My Immortal\\", \\"Going Under\\" and \\"Taking Over Me\\" are just a few of the highlights of this cd. I would recommend this cd to anyone that is a fan of Linkin Park."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I say that I am so amazed with this CD?","review":"Coming from a family who loves musical and opera, I listened to this CD by accident. And the songs with the beautiful, mysterious voice of the female lead bring a certain truth to the materials chosen. The CD can only be described by one word in my mind: PASSION. The songs such as Bring Me To Life, My Immortal, Going Under have a strong sense of truth, rawness and fire that I find lacking in today's bands. I wonder if the next CD of Evanescence will live up to this amazing repertoire. Maybe yes, maybe no. But for me, this is the CD that I play. Take that from someone who listens to opera and musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this band","review":"This band is so terrible. It's fun hating them!

Yeah right.","review":"I find it sickening how people compare Evanescence to Linkin Park and call them \\"goth\\" so much. Honestly. Just LISTEN to them!! They mine as well have 'POP' tattooed across their foreheads. The musicians aren't that bad, but their singer is horrible.

The content was not very good. I was expecting a good, clean, entertaining cd and instead I found one that was quite disturbing. The lyrics main themes were breathing and bleeding. I had heard so many great things about this album, like how they were Christian (which they definitely are not), and their words were so great. The only positive thing I can find about this cd is that their music, especially guitar and piano, was very well done and they are talented musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanescence is very talented for a U.S. band","review":"This band, for those of you who don't know- should never be compared to lighter sounding Christain rock bands who are all so often inferior in talent. This is a dark, brooding gem of U.S. rock. It is similar to some other European bands such as the Italian band Lacuna Coil (also with a female and male vocalist). I am so glad that a band from the U.S. finally broke from mainstream music to produce something truly fantastic. I only buy CDs that don't have any filler tracks. This is one of those CDs where most every song is excellent. I encourage all of you to check out similar European bands such as Lacuna Coil, The Gathering and Within Temptation as well. You will thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love with AMY LEE!!!","review":"if you all think this cd is good...you have to hear their old stuff and 3 songs that didn't make the final album cut. Songs like Understanding, Forgive Me, Missing, Breath No More, Further Away, and so many more will totally rock your ears! Evanescence's sound is totally unique compared to the [poor music] that's out there right now, that's why they're on the top 10 on the billboard for almost 5 weeks now. Job well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Evanescence has yet to rule the billboard charts. I've never heard such energy in one album. The arrangement is absolutley out of this world. As for the vocal performance on this CD \\"Captivating\\". The single \\" Bring me to life\\" sounds like a scene from the Matrix movie. Unforunate for it to be on the Daredevil soundtract. Even though, I still love there CD and can hope the next single is \\"The Immortal\\". Believe me, thats something to look out for. \\"Five stars Evanescence, for a job well done\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Rock at its best!","review":"I got chills when I first listened to this haunting CD! Tracks 2, 4, and 9 especially! This is the next big thing in music. Enya meets Linkin park in a mind-blowing dark experience in sound. I cannot get enough of this CD! I hope they keep making music - I greedily anticipate their next album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's only one reason...","review":"There's only one reason to listen to this band: Amy Lee has an incredibly smooth and powerful voice. Though it has no-doubt been run through more filters than your drinking water and spent dozens of hours in Pro Tools, it works. She is fun to listen to.The rest of the band is your average nu-metal radio band. They have next to no chops, and they don't really bother to give us anything interesting musically (that main guitar riff in \\"Tourniquet\\" is kinda cool, though). But, they back up Amy decently, and that's enough for a few listens.In short, if you want to hear a good female singer in a rock band, then pick up this album. If you demand anything interesting from the other members, then leave it on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Music, Excellent Vocals!","review":"My 11 yr old daughter loves this so much! She plays it or the other one every single day! My husband and I love it too, so it is not a problem!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awesome album","review":"I was listening to some music on a website, and when I heard music from Evanescence, I decided to buy Fallen, the album that includes the songs. I really like the music, because it is mostly rock, but it also includes classical instruments. The album has two songs with just piano and orchestral music, My Immortal and Hello. Amy Lee's singing were the best in those two songs. I also thought Everybody's Fool was meaningful, because I agree that people shouldn't get attention by pretending to be someone else. I liked every song, but I guess my favorite song was Going Under. If you like this album, I recommend you to buy Evanescence's recently released one, The Open Door. This album made me start listening to goth rock. Other goth rock bands that are good are Nightwish and Lacuna Coil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definetely falling into this","review":"I decided to buy this cd since I'd heard \\"bring me to life\\" and \\"going under\\". Evanescence is a band who can really make good music. On this album you can find heavy rock songs like Going Under, Everybody's Fool, Taking Over Me but also peaceful and fragile ones like My Immortal and Hello. There are also songs where you can get little more out of them like Whisper, Imaginary and Haunted, which bring little bit personality on this cd. The things that I also love on this album are Amy's beautiful voice and the sad lirycs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing debut CD","review":"I have never really been a heavy metal or hard rock fan, but thisCD has me hooked. Amy Lee has one of those voices that I couldlisten to all day no matter what type of music she was singing.I don't see how they could top this CD, but I'll be waiting tobuy the next one to find out. The most amazing thing to me, isto hear the upbeat, hard rock songs, and then hear how amazingAmy's voice truly is on \\"Hello.\\" I am looking forward to hear-ing more from this group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark rock","review":"I like this album but it's not cheerful stuff. Kind of makes me want to put on alot of black eyeliner. The songs are not overtly depressing, though!! If you have heard any of their songs on the radio or seen videos on MTV/VH1, then you should know what to expect on this CD, and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound comes to U.S.","review":"It's really great to see the primarily European female-fronted goth rock sound hit the U.S. (see \\"The Gathering\\", \\"Lacuna Coil\\"). I love everything about this album. I would disagree with those reviews complaining the style isn't new or that they are ripping off Lacuna Coil. What a completely juvenile response. I've been listening to Lacuna Coil since their first EP. I'm really glad their sound is influencing other bands. Excellent, excellent, excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Mood","review":"The first time I heard Amy back in 2002 I fell in love with her voice and such a pity at the time they didn't have an album out. The CD is amazing with dark vocals and lyrics. The most pop worthy song is probably: Bring Me To Life. Aside from that one, I like the rest of the songs. It sets a dark tone, preferably to listen to during the twilight hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity and disapointment never rocked so hard","review":"When I first heard of this band it was reading the lyrics to their overplayed hit off the album. Spiritual in nature and moving in content, but the writing is quite banal. It is the highlight of the album however. MY Immortal grasps at half spiritual mantra and half love song and succedes in acheiving neither. This is just lyricly.As far as musical composition is concerned I was even further disapointed. The technical writing shows a very limited creativity. The same notes and progresion will be used with only slight rythmic variation through out entire songs. The addition of hardcore-esq vocals in some songs ruin them.Not a bad first album, but I hope their musical quality grows and the lyrics escape the self-loathing angsty trite rut they seem to be in."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure why everyone is so excited over it","review":"I've been listening to this cd for about a week or so and the best thing I can say about it is amy has a great voice. The music is rather boring. There's no memorable riffs or anything and the lyrics are incredibly cliche. Most of the songs sound quite similar to each other to me as well. It's not something that I'll be listening to for the next couple of months that's for sure. I guess it does have a \\"haunting\\" sound to it, or whatever, but that type of music is just boring to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"best rock album in 5 years","review":"At the risk of repeating one of the 1700 or so other reviews of this work, it is a masterpiece, although comparisons with Limp Bizkit are just plain wrong. Actually, it is more like Creed with talent. Amy Lee's voice is astonishing, and her lyrics are even more so, although to say they are melodramatic is a BIG understatement. The guitar work is sometimes awful (too heavy-handed) and the chorus and strings are just plain self- indulgent - I bet they'll never have to sing \\"saving me, raping me\\" from \\"Haunted\\" again!. At any rate, these are just nitpicks. This is a fantastic CD, and I can't wait for the follow-up(s).Best songs - \\"Going Under\\", \\"Bring Me To Life\\",\\"My Immortal\\", \\"My Last Breath\\", \\"Whisper\\"Worst Song - \\"Tourniquet\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect CD for today's music","review":"When I first heard Bring Me To Life in the motion Picture Daredevil, I knew I had to learn out the name of the song and who the group was. I then immediately bought the CD, and at first I was just interested in Bring Me to Life, but when I heard My Immortal, followed by the rest of the tracks on the CD, I knew then I definitely got my money's worth. At when I downloaded the band version of My Immortal (from the group's music video) I knew that Evanescence and Amy Lee were very talented and that they would definitely be making it big, and their presence athe music awards was definitely felt. I definitely give this CD and the band 5 stars for their incredible music, the soulful and deep lyrics, and Amy Lee's unbelievable voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"this sux","review":"she's annoyin=g and why she dresses like a \\"Goth\\" if they don't gven reach the G cause they aren't that hard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring boring","review":"So, I downloaded this crap of an album to make sure I wasnt going to wast 15 bucks on it, and Amen for me! This album is horrible, it should be used to treat insomnia--I was FALLEN asleep while listening to it. I guess after Avril Lavigne last year record companies felt the urge to find another crappy female singer who think she rocks because she wears dark eye liner and does signs with her hands. It's sad, cuase when I see this girl she's like a bad female version of Trent Reznor, and that, she should take as a freakin' complement. Also, why is she the only one on the damn cover? this is a band, not a solo artists. I can't wait til the egos collide and this band breaks up. Definetly a one hit wonder, and all because you people kept on buying the album and requesting the song on the radio.

For those with the ability to do so and the time to waste on it, this is the album for you!For those without the ability and who like their messages delivered straight up without the crap, look elsewhere.

I can't believe people are calling it metal. It is an insult to real metal. Evanescence is alternative pop rock. Amy Lee is not an exceptional singer. She is above average, but she doesn't have what it takes to be really great. Her voice is very distorted and it sounds like she has never heard of breath control. I would much rather listen to talented singers, like Tarja from Nightwish, or Vibeke from Tristania.Also, their songs are boring. They go verse, chorus, verse, chorus, blah blah blah. The lyrics are sub-par. It doesn't take much imagination to come up with something so simple. Nevermind the riffs are something that should only appeal to a 14 year old Hot Topic poster child.Evanescence is just a trend that will hopefully pass quickly. If you are looking for metal, this isn't it. If you want to swallow whatever the mainstream music industry tells you to, then this CD is for you. Frankly, I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily Forgotten...","review":"The first couple of songs were worth a listen; however, by the fifth track, I noticed something...the songs are in EXACTLY the same key and the same subject matter is repeated incessantly - love and death. By the end of the album, I was bored. No doubt the album \\"rocks\\" at times, but there is nothing new or original here, just repetitious themes (both lyricially and musically). I doubt if one year from now, I even bother to listen to the one or two tracks that were okay. Buy the CD single \\"Bring Me to Live\\" and spare yourself the expense of purchasing the entire album, that way you won't have to listen to the various incarnations of the same song."},{"rating":"1","title":"why can't I upload this music to my MP3 player??!!!","review":"I love the Evanescence music, so, naturally I ran right out and bought the CD at Best Buy.

Now what am I going to do??!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous","review":"This CD has one of the most annoying album covers I have ever seen. And in this case, it's very wise to judge by the cover. What's inside is even more irritating.Never mind that its members backpedaled on their Christian faith. The most offensive aspect of Evanescence is Evanescence itself-a calculated mix of sweet-sounding female vocals, nü-metal crunch, and a gruff shouty-guy who made the band sound like an evil version of The B-52's. At last report, the shouty-guy had unexpectedly exited Evanescence's European tour, perhaps never to return. Stay far, far away, shouty-guy. (The Onion AV)"},{"rating":"1","title":"naaaaaaaaaah!!!!!!","review":"this cd is uimpressive, i listened the single they have on radio and was captivated with the female vocalist but the poppy music and raped male singind messed the whole song, so i decided to listen to the cd (burned of course) expecting something more and it was the same riffs and same structures and gets boring and repetitive. compared to goth bands (lacuna coil, moonspell, tiamat, the gathering) they fail, and compared with really great bands with female vocalist (new arch enemy, lacuna coil, nightwish, sinergy) they fall even further, so like others say, the lead singer should break with those linkin park wannabees and start again with better musicians or more mature writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Execellent CD! Give it a listen! You'll be glad you did.","review":"I first heard Evanescence on the Dare Devil Soundtrack. I loved their two tracks \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"My Immortal\\".

Lead singer Amy Lee's vocals are beautiful and haunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice debut","review":"Amy Lee has a nice voice, and her supporting band members do a pretty good job as well. This could be an interesting band to watch down the road. The album is well produced and has a somewhat \\"commercial\\" feel, but I still enjoy it quite a bit. There's just something about women and big guitar riffs - though there are a couple of slower tunes on the album, too. It rocks \\"medium\\". I prefer this band to the similarly styled band Lacuna Coil (there's just something much cheesier about their arrangements and vocals)"},{"rating":"1","title":"catchy music with lame lyrics","review":"Basically, if you've heard one song on this album, you've heard them all. They all sound the same, and they all have lame, cliche lyrics that are all about the same thing. Evanescence are trying very hard to be goth, but it's not working. They are pretty much a pop band using depression as a gimmick to pull in all the other wanna-be goths."},{"rating":"1","title":"PATHETIC!!!","review":"This music is just aweful. If you want to listen to good music listen to the Frames or Vic Trill, or maybe even Celtic Frost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only two good songs","review":"I bought this CD after hearing two of their songs on the radio. I was disappointed. Amy Lee's vocals are amazing, but the guitars and drums drown her out. Overall, this is a very mediocre CD. The only two songs that I like are \\"My Immortal\\" due to the theme of lost love and melancholy and \\"Hello\\" because I love the piano that's interlaced throughout the song. I don't know what lead singer Amy Lee sees in the rest of her band, but she'd be better off solo. I gave this CD two stars for the two songs I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible..","review":"Cookie cutter modern rock.

Listened to the CD and realized this...the only thing they have in common is a lead singer with a great voice....that's it. And at that Cristina of Lacuna Coil's voice is much more dynamic anyway. I went into this album thinking if it sounded a 10th as good as the Coil it would be a great album....it just couldnt even achieve that, it doesnt help that I really dislike Linkin Park and the guitars might as well be being played by them cuz I don't hear a difference.Overall, bad, boring, disappointing...if you want a good band that does the same thing, but has a little thing called talent outside of the singer...Lacuna Coil is the band you must check out. MTV shouldn't tell you what's good and what's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"utter garbage","review":"This band blows. Their album is crap. Their songs are mushy mixtures of rehashed power ballads with elements of neo-pop-contemporary-classicalism and a dash of female vox that are nothing spectacular if not normal. Drop this in the waste disposal and check out Lacuna Coil instead if all you are really intersted in is a band that has a chic singer that rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribile vocals","review":"I can't believe how many people rave about Amy Lee's vocals, to me they sound like fingernails on a chalkboard. Some of the music is ok but the vocals are enough to make a sane person go crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn it off, Beavis!","review":"Is it just me or does this girl's voice go right through your head? I've heard other people say she's got such a wonderful voice, but whenever I hear it I have to turn it off. It is so whiny, I can't stand it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's bad if MTV is all over it!","review":"After all the great reviews I've been reading here, I decided to check this album out - how very disappointing it turned out to be. People are raving about this because they obviously haven't taken the initiative to discover better music on their own. As usual, they take the lazy route of letting a MOVIE SOUNDTRACK point them to a their latest \\"fave\\" artist, instead of taking the time to search out the much superior forms of this \\"gothic metal\\" genre - bands like the oft-mentioned LACUNA COIL! People - stop letting the marketing geeks run your life. You love this band because you don't know the alternatives. If you think Evanscence is so great, then you'll absolutely [love] Lacuna's latest album \\"Comalies\\"! But, of course, most of you won't hear it, because it's not on MTV or a on a Big Movie Soundtrack!! Your loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallen= okay music, stupid lyrics","review":"I am sick of people saying how deep and beautiful the lyrics are on this album. The lyrics to every song on here are extremely melodramatic and they are most definitely trying too hard to be gothic. I know many depressed teens who could write better lyrics than this. I am being nice and giving it two stars because the actual music is okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"bubblegum crap","review":"This album is beyond crap. All songs are very boring with wierd lyrics and that girl's voice is horrible. Bubblegum crap and it can't get any worse then this folks.

I received it in a timely manner.Would do business again. Thanks for excellent service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignantly Beautiful","review":"I first heard this on Yahoo's internet radio Launchcast. The sound of this group is so original and brilliant, that I couldn't get enough of it. The songs really resonated with my soul and moved me. You can actually understand the lyrics, which is rare these days. The harmony between Amy Lee and her background accompanist was passionate beyond words. One of the best cds that I have ever purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanescene: Fallen","review":"Fallen has a deeper, darker sound than The Open Door and is definately more intense than the new self-titled abum by Evanescence. I love this album on the whole; there is not one song that I don't like! Frontwoman Amy Lee uses her voice beautifully throughout, changing subtly from tracks like the high-intensity \\"Going Under\\" to the softer \\"My Immortal.\\" Definately worth a listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMY LEE/ EVANESCENCE","review":"Amy Lee has the voice of a freaken angel! I love her music. The dark, gothic feel gives me chills! Fallen is by far the best album I have ever bought. I am very much anticipating her next one. She is truly the best vocalist alive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre to bad","review":"nah.. i have heard better. The first three songs are hard to desipher from then it goes to a crummy slow one then back to the undesipherable guitar riffs and vocals. If you feel the need to hear a woman sing for a \\"change\\" get some one worth listening. eg: the yea yea yeas, or the distillers. this is not a great example."},{"rating":"1","title":"So?","review":"Hmmm. Nu-metal with better vocals. Well you can pour chocolate syrup over cow manure but how much better does it really taste? It's on par with a Creed album. To comapre it with Tori Amos is just silly. I keep hearing this hailed as some sort of \\"gothic rock\\" too. Huh? EvanEssence isn't awful, but they're nothing to get excited over."},{"rating":"1","title":"why must everyone love it so?...","review":"its really not that good, and im not one of those people who hates something just cuz the band peoples are posers, its truly bad attempted music, and the singer cant even sing,YEP, evanescence sounds like a good idea but once you here it its just like, oh wow...that was pointlessthis band can go in the crap pile along with avril and limp bizkit"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's talk BAD!!","review":"If you do not even consider this cd gothic, or the best thing it ever happened please move on. But if you think this album is great, you are deeply mistaken. I'm not going to talk about every music, because sincerely this album isn't worth taking that much time. The vocals DO ARE GREAT!! SHe's a wonderful singer, and her voice would be perfect for a real metal band. But that's about it.... the lyrics are non-sense and if you know anything about music, you can guess the whole song, just by listening to the first 15 sec. It's pure NU-Metal. The guitars are weak, and they sound like a really bad Lacuna Coil's rip-off. And every single one of you who say WOW what an amazing display of good music, please try to listen to REAL goth metal bands, like Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, etc... before judging this as good"},{"rating":"1","title":"next please","review":"I heard about this great new band, so I wanted to give them a listen, as I am constantly on the lookout for anything that's new and, especially, good. Once was more than enough though; they sound like highschool students trying to make a pizza for the first time with all the wrong ingredients. Absolutely without relevance or substance. Not poisonous, but I'm keeping my distance. Two stars because they honestly tried to make a good pizza; but they just haven't got what it takes to become three star chefs. Next please..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look beyond the supposed commercialism","review":"When you take away all of this supposed commercialism and get down to it, Amy Lee has a fantastic, powerful, unique voice. While the musical backing to some of the songs sounds similar, each song is made it's own by lyrics that are dark yet relatable and somewhat inspirational. It is easy to point the finger at media and claim that bands such as this are overrated, but by doing so you are buying into the very thing you claim to be against. Give Fallen a chance and make your own decisions about this incredible album. You'll be glad you listened to the album instead of listening to all of the media-driven critic hype. If all of the \\"similar bands\\" that Evanescence is supposely ripping off of are so great, why aren't they on the top of the charts? And if they were, people would be ripping them apart just like they are Evanescence. Make your own decisions, but at least give them a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"what?","review":"Okay \\"Bring me to life\\" is the only good song on this. Who wants to hear this goth stuff it's just a person singing being depressed. Be like D-rad and listen to Good Charlotte."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Linkin Park mixed with Sarah McClaclan= Evanescence. Only thing is, those two don't mix well. I swear if I hear \\"My Immortal\\" on the radio one more time I'll hit a note (scream) higher than Amy Lee's whiny annoying voice has ever hit. I swear, it seems like the media is trying to shove this band down everybody's throats, and people are buying it. Bring Me To Life was good the first 10 times, but after that (at about the 323574th time its on the radio) it gets very old."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album!","review":"When I heard bring me to life on the radio,I really love that song and I've got the album,it sounded great.Amy Lee who is the frontwoman of the band sings pretty good and the band members are awesome.I will enjoy this album as much as I can and besides bring me to life I like the other songs like going under and my immortal.This is a great album of 2003.I'm sure that the band is goin to have some tour dates real soon because amy lee is very talented and she could sing really good,they are alot bands with band mebers who are men and the lead singer is a female like garbage and no doubt they are but evanescence is a grat new band."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Close, Yet So Far","review":"This album continues the trend of modern rock bands with sub-par instrumentals relying on catchy hooks to carry them. Drums often sound programmed, and even when there is real drumming it gets stale fast. I think the guitar tracks were all copied and pasted from a Linkin Park cd in Pro Tools. The bass, well, if you manage to hear it in the guitar noise you are a better man than I.After all of that, this band has some redeeming qualities. The vocals are gorgeous, and the songs actually sound original, even if the arrangments are stale. What makes this band so sad is that they really could be good, but they weren't willing to put out the effort to do something original... shame, shame, shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound's like Lacuna Coil....... and that's great!","review":"This is definetly a good album and worth listening to many times. BUT! Lacuna Coil from Italy does the same thing since 1996. When I first heard the song Bring me to life I thought it was them! Anyway, it is sad to see that being backed by a major label a band is instantly succesful while others doing the same thing have to work for years.Now enough of my complaints. Evanescene certainly deserves the good ratings because this is a top class album. Personally I'm a great fan of combined male & femal voices. It give's the music a great atmosphere & melanchony. Very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanescence is close to goodscence!","review":"The CD Fallen is a welcome addition to top 40 airplay for sure and it is nice to have a new, if recycled spin on the airwaves. Amy Lee's voice is far and above worth the price of admission here. Much like anything the Cranberries put out was listenable because of Dolores' voice. This is also very close in nature to the disbanded October Project. I deduct one star because of the obligatory ... rap-sung verse that diminishes the songs... Rock, or Rap, but never think that you can do both!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"why do people keep comparing them to linkin park?","review":"why do people keep comparing them to linkin park? they only have ONE rap-metal song the whole cd! i think they are very different from linkin park, so if you're buying this for female rap-metal, look elsewhere.that being said, i think this is a great cd. but i wish people would stop proclaiming how amazingly original it is. it's true that this may be one of the first female metal bands in the states that sounds like them, but if you read other reviews, you'll know that they sound a lot like the female-vocal gothic metal scene in many parts of europe. specifically, they really do remind me of lacuna coil, except that lacuna tends to have more male vocals in the background.but this is a good cd. and nice that the states finally have a female-fronted band in the metal scene that would actually be able to be compared to the others in europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely BUY THIS!!!","review":"I picked this cd up after hearing \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"My Immortal\\" on the DareDevil Soundtrack only to fall in love with all of the songs once I heard them. I can honestly say that there is not a single song on the album that I don't like, or that I skip through when I listen to it.Amy's voice is angelic while her words are dark and mysterious, with her voice, and a powerful mixture of guitar and drums makes for an excellent cd, one that I would recommend any fan of any type of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE WORST BANDS OF ALL TIME","review":"The extent to which I hate Evanescence cannot be expressed in mere words. \\"My Immortal\\" is surely one of the worst things ever committed to tape; nothing but screaming, whining and boring piano for a good 5 minutes. People find this uplifting? I cannot understand why DJs and a good portion of the general public think this is any good at all. I HATE THIS BAND MORE THAN YOU CAN EVER UNDERSTAND. I BEG YOU NOT TO GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Good!!","review":"Evanescene's FALLEN , its amazing , I mean, I was going to give them 5 stars, but after listen to a band CALLED NIGHTWISH , my rate went down by far... if you love EVANESCENE , and you think their music blown you away , just give it a try to NIGHWISH'S albums OCEANBORN and WISHMASTER... and then you'll probably going to be like me... Evanescenes [is]horribe live...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"OK, while i dont mean to be offensive, the americans dont really do gothic music properly. Its all too industrial and cheesy which is why i prefer Nightwish, Lacuna Coil and Arch Enemy ( A really good European death metal band with a woman singer). Ok, so Evanescence do have some good songs but i mean, they sound like linkin park which i hate. Please, the band is just bad and amy can shove her bring me to life song chorus up her a** because id rather bring her to death!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amy Lee is Sexy and She Can Sing","review":"...But you'll be better off just getting the single \\"Bring Me To Life\\". The followup stuff is about as exciting as Heart in the mid 1980's- not very. \\"Bring Me To Life\\" is a great song I will give them that. But the clown that sings with Amy kind of ruins it. It would have been one the coolest songs in rock had they instead used Ozzy Osbourne in his place. The guy doing it makes me and my 16 year old little bro laugh our asses of everytime he says something during the song. And we haven't laughed so hard since Sheryl Crowe did \\"Picture\\" with Kid Rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Urgent","review":"I find this CD extremely difficult to listen to because of the \\"urgency\\" (sorry, but that's the most descriptive word for it) of nearly every song.That urgency makes it very fatiguing to listen to more than two songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evanescence is a buch of jerks","review":"I am a student at University of California at San Digeo and I am really angry with Evanescence. I have their CD and i kinda liked it, but Forensik was supposed to open for them at SOMA at San Diego, and Evanescence just denied the for no reason. This is not a good thing. Forensik is a good band. I have heard their demo and they are going to go big once they get a record deal. Evanescence has made a big mistake not letting them play. I was supposed to be the penguin in the mosh pit and anyone that knows Forensik knows that they have awesome shows. Evanescence's CD is not all that good. They just got some good airplay on MTV which sucks because they are not that good of a band. Forensik is a much better band; they have really good talent. Contact me if you would like to know more about Forensik. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!go to http://www.forensikmusic.com/ for some good music. I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS CD, go to Forensik's website and listen to their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Putting her face on this band","review":"I think this album is boring. I think it doesnt do its job. I think evanasance is a wannabe. I think she needs to get a real job. I think this broke very soon after i got it. I think this won't play in most cd players. i think the cover looks stupid. i think it gave me the idea to staple picture of my face on lots of things. i think art is stupid. I think i don't recommend this. I think ive said enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"this is the best album i own, the songs are just simply great and it seems that the band has put there heart and soul into making this album. I first got hooked to evanescence when daredevil came out and i herd Bring Me To Life, that was such a good song, i then got the album and noticed how good it was. the best song on the album is My Immortal without a differ, it is simply beautiful. i cannot wait for the next eavenscence album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think \\"WOW\\" covers it all!","review":"I love everything from classical to Linkin Park and POD.Evanescence has somehow managed to capture a clasical sound, wrapped up in a Linkin Park style, added some very deep (and sometimes dark) lyrics, and created a magical and soulful experience. Sort of a depper, darker Linkin Park with a female lead - and, no doubt, perspective.I simply cant wait for their next album. I may be 40, but i know great music and huge talent when i hear it! :-)This isnt everyones \\"cup of tea\\", but i've been playing this album for the last two days over and over - it just gets better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely AWESOME!","review":"I do mean awe-some, as in it creates awe whenever heard. Amy's voice is excellent! The lyrics are thought provoking and meaningful. It's exactly what we need. The topics are softened by her voice. It's just a great CD all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT!!","review":"Truly A Five Star Gem! It's been a very long time since I've liked every song on an entire album. For what it's worth this is coming from a 47 yr. old child of the 70's raised on Led Zeppelin."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to admit...","review":"I first heard of them on MTV and something about the lead singer struck me because of the voice...that voice. The rock and her voice, awesome. Something about how I've been searching for mucis with taste. I listen to rock and I listen to girl singers who sing and I have to admit I am a Avril Lavigne fan but MAN I've got a NEW fan. This woman can DEFINENTLY sing. The lyrics are awesome and I wish I heard of this band before, the CD cover really scared me because it looked like a devil worshiping CD but OoOOoOO awesome CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fallen by Evanescence","review":"Absolutely incredible. I know this is an old product but it is ageless. Dark, brooding,and at times haunting. I'm a baby boomer and I crank this up in the car and love where this music takes me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Bonus Track","review":"There is an unlisted bonus track on the album which I am surprised no one has mentioned. There is 2 versions of My Immortal on the album, the acoustic version with the piano interlude and the rock version as heard on the radio.The album is good with hits like My Immortal, Bring Me to Life, Going Under, and many more.This album is really worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD I Own!","review":"The songs on this album are absolutely phenomenal. I've honestly listened to it a hundred times because it is so fab! The haunting, ethereal voice of Amy Lee combined with back up vocals and a wicked, grunty rock tunes makes this the band of the year and this album just has one potential hit after another.I guarantee if you buy this cd you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Your Empty Heads... Put This Into Context","review":"Attention Evanescence fans! Let me take a minute to explain in a blunt manner the significance of this band. Evanescence= Linkin Park + Attractive Female Vocalist. Linkin Park = Trash. Trash + Female Vocalist = an obvious sales gimmick devised by recording executives to get mindless drones such as LP fans to purchase more MTV filler garbage. This band will die out sooner than you think. Don't waste your money on this. Despite the fact that the band themselves and the media labels their music as \\"Metal\\" or even \\"Nu-Metal\\" is pure idiocy. You want metal? Get Slayer, old Metallica, Hatebreed, Manson, Killswitch Engage, Chimaira, Fear Factory, Cannible Corpse, and thousands more to choose from.

But if it wasn't for Imaginary, I would give this cd 1 star. Amy Lee's voice irritates me on most of the songs. It sounds..fake. Like she is wringing/twisting/bending her voice.And this isn't real gothic either(for the peeps who are labeling this as gothic).There are better bands out there, so don't hang on this one.EDIT: and oh yeah..raping My Tourniquet(Soul Embraced cover) is the worst part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rocky Gray","review":"The drummer for this band, Rocky Gray...is an incredible guitarist and used to play in Living Sacrifice and Soul Embraced. The song \\"My Tourniquet\\" was written and originally performed by Soul Embraced.As for Evanescence as a whole, I think it's pretty freaking cheap for a band to forsake what it stands for and buy into mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has been done to death before, and much better","review":"I'm sick of people claiming how \\"orginal\\" and \\"meaningful\\" this band is. People please, just because it's the first time you've heard such music by no means makes it \\"original\\". Bands like Lacuna Coil, Tristania, Theatre of Tragedy, and Sins of Thy Beloved have been doing this music for years, and again with much more talent. Sure, the lead singer has a good voice, but compared to what? Pink? Avril Lavigne? Madonna?...I'm not saying that this band [is terrible] I'm stating my opinion that I don't like them and I'm sick of people praising then for making something that they ripped off of many respectable artists. If you like this album, fine, but I suggest you do yourself a favor and check out the roots of this music, you might actually enjoy it. And if you didn't so be it. It can't hurt to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"more poseur crap cranked out by a major record label","review":"for years, the big record companies and radio stations (all owned, or almost all owned, by Clear Channel)work tirelessly to synthesize and mimic some type of 'scene'. in this case, the 'goth' music scene is what is being copied by some major label radio-friendly wanna be band. do yourself a favor, get the 'real deal' goth music: Christian Death, Bauhaus etc. This is poseur crap music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some singles, but thats about all","review":"You can listen this album from start to finish and think you'll just listened to the one song for 40 minutes. Unfortunantly, all the songs blend into one another and tho this album has the chart-topping singles 'My Immortal' and 'Bring Me To Life' thats about all it's worthy of.Personally, I've listened to it a couple of times and now I've ripped those two singles from the cd I listen to them in compilations with other songs on my computer, but the CD just sits and gathers dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album","review":"We all got a taste of Evanescence (excluding the lucky people in the Little Rock, Ark. area) on the \\"Daredevil\\" soundtrack with \\"Bring Me to Life\\" and \\"My Immortal.\\" In my case, it was more than enough to get this album as soon as possible. Trust me, if you liked what you heard on Daredevil, you will not in any way be dissapointed. Ms. Lee hits the nail square on the head when she says their music is epic. Every song, with the exception of \\"Hello,\\" (which is in no way a bad song) has pure energy rushing through it. Another positive is that there are actually guitar solos in some songs...A definite rarity in today's nu-metal era. Not to mention Ms. Lee's vocals and lyrics are simply stunning.

The tracks sounded perfectly good before, and with the addition of some violins here, some additional lyrics there, and a few other extras, they have been kind of watered down.That being said, there are SOME good tracks on this album. \\"Going Under\\" is interesting, and Amy Lee continues her string of excellent piano ballads with \\"Hello.\\"...However, this album will undoubtedly sell well. With a hit single like \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" it would be a little hard not to. ....Anyway, I can't really say I recommend this album. I thought that Origin was so much better, and this one doesn't really stand on it's own without the additional tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful!","review":"After bringing home \\"Fallen\\" and listening to the first track, I was completely sucked in.

Everyone should check out Evanescence if you already haven't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Voice, Haunting Lyrics","review":"This is an amazing CD and my favorite band. Amy Lee (the lead singer) has a hauntingly beautiful voice. Her voice is like an angel but it fits witht the alternative rock style that this band is. The songs on this CD can be a little dark but I think most people will enjoy the songs and appreciate the lyrics. Every song on this CD is amazing, which is why I think the entire CD is worth the buy. You will not be disapointed.

This is puerile, regurtitated cliche angst for the Tori-meets-Linkin-Park generation. Amy's voice is absolutely beautiful, yes, but the lyrics are cracking me up in a not-so-very-funny way. As it happens, the Daredevil soundtrack got the best of Evanescence's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unique? Give me a break....","review":"I appreciate the fact that Evanescence are as popular as they are, being a female fronted metal band and all, but what they're doing is really not as cutting edge as most MTV-fed teeny boppers would have you believe. As opposed to the \\"Goth Gods of the Linkin Park Generation\\" or whatever other names have been slapped on them by Teen Magazine, they end up sounding more like a poor man's Lacuna Coil. Only whereas Lacuna Coil's \\"Comalies\\" is complex, sweeping, and beautiful, Evanescence's \\"Fallen\\" seldom manages to rise above boring nu-metal tunes that we've all heard a thousand times before."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crapload...","review":"I'm not just talking about the band, but anyone who has reviewed this album is a complete arse. You have people who only listen to the top 40, who's reviews go something like: \\"OH MY GOD, THEY ARE TRUELY THE GREATEST BAND IN THE WORLD, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT TO PUT BORING GUITAR RIFFS, UNINTELLIGENT LYRICS, A FAKE GOTH IMAGE, AND A RAPPING VERSE IN THE LEAD SINGLE? BRILLIANT!!!!!\\" And then you have people bashing them because it's \\"cool\\" to bash anyone that has sold more than 5 copies of an album, which normally looks like this: \\"Duh, I don't LiKe thIS Band BEcaUse THEY are PoPuLaR, bands LikE SlIpKnOt and KoRn suCk, Too, DuH, jUst BecAuse.\\"In my opinion, everyone should go F*CK themselves, get it done and over with, quit all your b*tching, just shut up already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever","review":"This is one of those albums that was fine after a few doses but then gets beaten into submission by radio and girls who have to play this every month ( If you know what I mean ).

This is exactly the kind of music you would hear if Snow White decided she wanted be hardcore...but at least if that had happened her music videos would have included some midgets!!! Theres a reason why some of the customers that bought this bought Jewel...IT'S THE SAME MUSIC EXCEPT WITH SOME UNIMPRESSIVE GUITAR. Another thing I'm sick of is people telling me that if you didn't like the \\"bring me to life\\" single that you'll like the rest of the album.

This band is definately not a new style since there are plenty of European bands that use a similar set up. The band seems to have a lot of influences from the Italian band Lacuna Coil, which I highly recomend to anyone that likes this band. Overall the band did ok, but I reccomend trying out Lacuna Coil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom of the pile","review":"Dont buy this cd, if you want to listen to some real gothic metal listen to Lacuna coil, the gathering, or nightwish. Evanescence [isn't good] there guitar riffs are very similar to linkin parks. There music is nothing new, and all you people that say you have been looking for a cd like this for a long time, you have got to be kidding me. There are many other female rock/metal singers with alot more talent then Amy Lee.Go buy a real cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"They want to be The Gathering, but they end up Linkin Park.","review":"Honestly, the only reason that Evanescence is getting so much attention over much better female-led bands is because they happened to be on the Daredevil soundtrack. To reiterate what many of the other negative reviews have said, yes, Amy Lee's voice is good, but the music and lyrics are [not]. Oh, I forgot, the guitars are HEAVY and BRUTAL like LINKIN PARK! That makes Evanescence AWSUM! Whoops, it's actually the same riffs we've heard umpteen times in various other nu-metal bands. If you want to listen to a truly stuning female-led METAL band, check out The Gathering."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Creativity, Just an LP Rip!!!","review":"ok, I've heard about 5 songs from this album, each of them sounds like either like X-Ecutioners & Linkin Park - It's Going Down, or Linkin Park - With You or With You (reanimation remix). Their guitars suck, that guy who's trying to be an emcee like Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park gets on my nerves. They may sound \\"hot\\" on a cd, but i bet they suck in concert. Don't waste your money on this unless you like this type of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello Evanescence","review":"It was this year 2012 when I discovered this band and fell in love with Amy lee That Powerful Voice Wich was a surprise I normaly like Slow Jams but this band changed that ,well I still like slow songs but they made me reevaluate my mind set stop being as close minded My Favorite is bringing me to life ,i also love evrybodys fool,but also my immortal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best starter","review":"this is great rock cd. the lyrics are fresh and catchy. it has the rock escence and the vocals of an angel with some piano splashed throughout!All songs are excelent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, something new that sounds great!","review":"I don't listen to a lot of music, but I bought this album the day it came out. Evanescence does a tremendous job of mixing beautiful and aggressive vocals with a strong rock background. The songs have imagination and don't just resmeble the last ex-relationship song you heard on the radio. I don't usually sing in the car, but I'll roll up the windows for this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best cd I've bought in a long time","review":"I went to go see daredevil and although the movie was terrible 2 of the songs stood out and both are on this cd. This cd is produced so immaculatly that i find myself not skipping any songs on it. I like every single song, and i don't think i can think of any other cd that does that for me. Amy's vocals on the tracks are amazing, she hits every single harmony that you've always thought, \\"wow that'd be cool if the singer could hit that note\\" but couldn't. She hit's that note and then goes higher, and its not a scream, its singing and beautiful. My only regret with this cd is that it isn't 5 hours long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sounding nu rock band, but not what I was expecting!","review":"They bring a new kind of sound,thanks to their singer,but they shouldnt compare them with bands like:Linkin Park,Saliva,or Trapt;cause they're not as hard sounding as them.There more like 3 Doors Down band, but in any case a good sounding band never the less.P.S:NOT LINKIN PARK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evanescence-Fallen","review":"I picked up this cd because of the two tracks on the Daredevil soundtrack that really made the cd worth getting. So when I got it I expected some good music and from top to bottom it doesn't dissapoint. With dark music and vocals Evanescence turns away from some of the other music that you would put in this kindda catagory. Bring me to life is still the best of all thier songs with my Immortal kindda taking a break from the harder rock that is on the other 10 tracks. Tracks like Haunted and whisper are darker and set more of what the band is about. I have been looking for darker music to listen to and Evanescence is a step in the right dirrection and that is what make this cd so enjoyable for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off The Hook!!","review":"This group has brought something so new and so fresh to the music scene I actually listened to the whole CD twice so far from track 1 to 11. This CD has the perfect mix of harmony and rock that will just blow you away. Totally get this CD and listen to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This could've been a lot better.","review":"My friends kept on telling me about this band on the Daredevil movie called Evanescence. They said it was really heavenly vocals over really heavy metal. I thought, cool. This sounds like something for me. A lot of bands I like have calm vocals over hard rck. (Queens Of The Stone Age, Cream, Masters Of reality)EH! Wrong!What we have here is yet another trendy, wannabe goth metal band that sounds too much like Linkin Park, Korn, Staind, the list goes on. This would've been cool if:A.The lyric wirter could've spent more time on the lyrics. (Save me from the nothing I've become? Heard it a million times, my friend!)B.The music had texture, and not a few chords meshed together to make a song.C.NO RAPPING!Anyway, I had hopes for this band. If you do like goth music, try Bauhaus, inventors of goth, or The Cure. Don't listen to this. It's not worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"Evanescence offers nothing fresh to the already stale music industry. Most of their songs seem to have the same boring guitar parts and Amy Lee's voice is boring and not unique. I honestly can't believe people think their music is refreshing and unique!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Hits Wonders!","review":"One Hits Wonders are what Evanescence are. They will will NEVER have a big hit again!

Is there ever going to be and end to the self pity music scene? I won't waste time going through each song because they're pretty much all the same. I wish I could at least say the musicianship is good, but I can't. So if you like your cheese with a whole lot of moody whine than this is the band for you! But I would get the most out of your listen because I have a feeling this is the first and last we will hear of this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is garbage","review":"what is the big deal about this band.. is it because they have a female singer with a horribly annoying voice remenscent of nails on a chalk board?...or is it the crummy recycled power chord guitar riffs?.. please.. this band is a joke.. they are only popular due to the fact they play mainstreanm rock music with a female vocalist, don't be fooled"},{"rating":"1","title":"How is it possible?","review":"How can it be that a recording with no melody, no rhythm, no tune, no variance in pitch, and nothing new lyrically... how can such a recording become a monster seller and command the accolades of the elite music press? Who is in bed with whom? Five Grammy nominations can't be wrong, you say? Sure they can - the Grammys are all about industry self-congratulation and attaboys for selling low-grade junk in volume.I have no issue with the angst of the band, but when it's the ONLY thing that they do at all (never mind whether they do it \\"well\\"), then you're better off listening to NIN or some old Joy Division - at least those bands actually made music.Please skip this disc and put Evanescence out of our misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Pathetic Mainstreem Crap","review":"How the heck did this band get so popular? Simple, Evanescence are nothin but another trendy band that sucks ass along with Avril Lavigne, Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Puddle Of Mudd, Sum 41, Hoobastank, Fountains Of Wayne, and Blink 182. If you real music, look no further than Pantera, Down, Superjoint Ritual, Damageplan, Lacuna Coil, Slayer, Deicide, Killswitch Engage, Chimaira, Slipknot, Death, Lamb Of God, Metallica, Sepultura, Hatebreed, Shadows Fall, Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, Obituary, Nile, and Suffocation."},{"rating":"1","title":"what about listenning to real music works?","review":"---------> Dillinger escape plan, morning again,unearth, refused... Oh and an easy one for you noobs --> Killswitch engage, it's a good transition record to real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is boring talentless mainstream garbage.","review":"If you wanna hear a good band check out Lacuna Coil. Lacuna Coil has female vocals over beautiful metal music. Evanescence is just a mainstream mindless nu metal band with a not so good female vocalist. Lacuna Coil is the band you should be listening to, they actually have talent and mix female vocals with REAL metal instead of cheesy nu metal. This cd doesn't even get stars due to the fact it was made for the simple fact that the musicians are money hungry. AVOID THIS CD IT IS HORRIBLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful...","review":"this is a wonderful album. it's got everything: hard rock, soft rock, alternative, classical, and pop. amy lee's voice is beautiful, and the music is great. i highly reccomend! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really excellent CD!","review":"I really, really love this CD. I can't even pick a favorite song- I love them all! Amy Lee has an amazing voice and the lyrics are excellent. I was only disappointed with one thing- I downloaded their song \\"Missing\\" but it did not appear here. That's too bad, but this is still something I would strongly recommend. This is a very unique and talented group- if you're not familiar with them, you should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet CD!!!!!","review":"ok this is the best cd ive boughten in a long time!! wow buy this cd you will not be disappointed...the only way to describe this cd is simply...amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"forget goth rock, pop rock and linkin park comparisons","review":"what is wrong with some people these days, i didnt have a favourite band until evanescence came along, and i LOVE them. screw all you people who rekon they're crap, you obviously dont know good music when you hear it. as for calling it pop/rock/ get rid of the pop and just call it rock, i do agree however that it is not gothic rock, as none of the members are actually goths. now for all those people who compare them to linkin park, wtf are you listening to? there is no way in hell that evanescence is anything like linkin park, did you hear any rap (other than bring me to life), any screaming vocals? NO. so u can forget the linkin park comparisons. There is not one track on this album that is crap, but my favourites have to be haunted and whisper, hello is another great track. i could be here forever saying how great this band is. oh yeh and amy's vocals are just the best, how she incorporates emotion into the singing it's GREAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This is a spectacular album by newcomers Evanescence. It's a spectacular musical effort, with complex melodies, good lyrics and a lead singer with the best voice around.'Fallen' is inspiring, and every song is worth listening to because the album is so diverse.This album has come with many positive reviews, but I think an unfair amount of negative ones. People are bashing the CD simply because 'it's depressing', or because it doesn't meet their 'metal' expectations (NOTE: Screaming isn't music, kiddies.)BEST TRACKS: Everybody's Fool, My Immortal, Imaginary, Hello, My Last Breath...ALL OF THEM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A message from the #1 EVANESCENCE fan...","review":"Before I heard Evanescence, i was \\"Going Under\\", but when I saw DAREDEVIL THE MOVIE, i was blown away by the songs that were actually Evanescence. When I was watching the scene of the funeral, i was saying to myself \\"I luv this song!\\" (When it was actually \\"My Immortal\\")And when Elektra was using the sais, and slashing the sandbags, BRING ME TO LIFE was playing, and that song bought shivers up my spine, it just took my breath away.This album will trully \\"Bring you to life\\", I have never been so obsessed of any artist before.You will love this album...TRUST ME!!!This album is 4X Platinum, and EVANESCENCE are winning nearly every awards for best songs, and has won 2 GRAMMY's. They are truly amazing, and this Album will blow you away, I garuantee."},{"rating":"2","title":"BeTtEr ThAn PoP","review":"i kno most people think that evanescence is just another \\"pop\\" group, but your wrong their lyrics r deep and depressing all at the same time and Amy Lee can sing, not like most artist these days, so my advise is go and buy this CD u'll b glad u did"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but quite overrated...listen to something else","review":"Dont get me wrong. This is good for starters, but PLEASE do not think that this is the best gothic metal band around.There are better bands out there that Evanescence have just ripped off, such as Lacuna Coil and Nightwish. Bands such as these deserve the REAL credit as being accomplished. And LC were there BEFORE Evanesence, so please talk some sense those people who constantly say that it's the other way around.This is an okay start, but for more diversity and symphonic metal, check out Lacuna Coil, Nightwish and Therion. Don't listen to those posers who slit their wrists and say, 'OMG! It says my suicide! OMG it's so gothic!' Because they're WRONG."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Surprise","review":"Like everyone else, I first heard Bring Me to Life on the radio. At first, I thought it catchy, then I found myself channel-surfing just to hear that song again. Still, I did not buy the CD (in case that was the only good song) until I heard Going Under. I immediately ran out and bought the CD and popped it in. Initially, I was only really interested in those first two tracks, but eventually found myself humming some of the other tunes at really odd moments (like in the middle of a meeting). Some of the angst gets a little repetative (the words \\"hollow,\\" \\"pain,\\" \\"bleeding,\\" and \\"betray\\" are a bit overused), but the discordant melodies and driving guitar are a truly powerful combination. Now, I'd have to say I'm pretty much obsessed with the whole CD - and am in fact listening to it right now. I carry the CD with me everywhere I go and play it whenever I get a chance. I haven't been this taken with a band since I heard POE's \\"Haunted.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for young punks!","review":"As a 30 yr old fan of main-stream \\"alternative\\" rock (of which I hate the genre title) I must say this is one INCREDIBLE CD! This album is raw emotion coupled with a sensitive yet edgy sound. For those who enjoy music for its artistic impression this is THE sound. Amy Lee's voice will stop your heart and take you inside her head leaving you waiting for her next breath of song. In a sea of whining, leftover, grunge rejects and wannabees this sound is far deeper and meaningful than the teen herds give them credit. Evanescence is not just another Linkin Park, Godsmack, or (dare I say) Fred Durst...they actually get what rock music is about, and clearly show how music, even \\"alternative\\", can really move and inspire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expected One Good Song","review":"I bought this CD because there was this one song I couldn't get out of my head. I spent the money thinking I'd probably only like one or two songs at most...but I was almost instantly in love with the whole CD.If you liked 'Bring Me To Life'...then buy this CD. At least half the album is comprised of songs with the same style and attitude. The ballads add some variety to the CD and they quickly win you over with her pure vocal talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired.","review":"I had been hoping that this band would have original-sounding female vocals but was horribly mistaken. The lead singer's voice is very uninspiring and dull. She sounds like she just got out of her voice lessons and is following all of the rules; whole notes held for 4 counts, etc. There is little original feeling, just preoccupation with the technical aspect of the voice. The rest of the band sounds like a carbon copy of Linkin Park. I don't like Linkin Park in the first place; I really don't want to hear another version of them. The unoriginal sound of Linkin Park is revisitied in Evanescence. They're also just as overplayed. Overall, this albumn was a disappointment. A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mtv fans, go find another craze to feed off of...","review":"These guys remind me of Hot Tonic and \\"mini-metallers\\"/\\"mini-goths\\". Honestly, some kids must have nothing else better to do than to listen to [ordinary] music on the badio and follow trends set by mtv and other such screwy tv channels. This is definetly not original and no, people who act depressed and dark are not \\"cool\\" if that's what kids are after these days *cough*. Although some people do think it's \\"original\\" and \\"cool\\" so that's why they're so drawn to this new band. \\"In a world where everyone is the same, it's better to be different\\". Come on, seriously, where the hell did that come from? Every human being is equal to one another, if they're normal or not. It's ok to be normal. This cd is not worth the money, I suggest you look around some more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatiful Voice, boring music","review":"The truely sad thing here is that Amy Lee's beautiful voice is wasted on this trite collection of music overlays. The music which accompanies her angelic voice is boring and cliche - it sounds like throw-away material from linkin park. The best we can hope for is that Amy Lee goes solo or else finds someone who can make a musical score on par with her breathtaking voice. 2 Stars - best not to waste your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO really listen to this?","review":"2304 reviews? This band is a joke!My Immortal is the worst song of all time. Amy Lee can sing???who said that?

Don't listen to this crappy evanescene or crappy linkin park."},{"rating":"1","title":"dark, cold, depressing, awful","review":"I thought this CD was great... until I looked up the lyrics on the internet. After the first three songs I quit, thinking that maybe I didn't want to know them after all. I'm starting to wonder if Amy is suicidal!! EVERY song is about bleeding, dying, screaming, cutting, killing... you name something dark, depressing, and scary, it's in there! I'm just about to turn fourteen and I swear, not much scares me, but I just froze with fear when I heard someone screaming in the background of song number six, \\"I WANNA DIE!!!\\" The only reason I could think of liking this CD is if you are depressed and are looking for someone who feels the same way you do. Or you could just completely ignore the lyrics (which is hard to do) and enjoy the electric guitar and her voice (which in spite of her suicidal attitude, really is amazing). After hearing that scream in the background I threw my CD in one of my closet drawers and locked it up. I'm never going to listen to it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOOOO!!!!!","review":"Really, people think Amy Lee is good? She is horrible! She couldn't sing if her life depended on it!

The piano and eerie tunes make for one of the best rock albums I have heard in a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"with the exception of lincoln park, the cult and some other bands i really am not a big rock fan. i havnt been since the early 90's. id rather listen to trance and synth music like depeche, etc. well, all that changed when i saw this band on jay leno on march 6. From the first note, i just stood in my living room, paralyzed. i couldn't beleive my ears and eyes.From the vocals to the music ,to the lyrics,\\"bring me to life\\" is a masterpiece. Probably the most perfect and refreshing song i have heard in ages.This band owned the stage that night. of course the next day i went out and bought a copy of the cd. It hasn't left my car stereo since. EVERY SINGLE TRACK ON THIS RECORD IS A GEM! if i had to pick,I'd say \\"tournequet\\", \\"haunted\\", \\"going under\\", \\"whisper\\" and \\"bring me to life\\" are the standout tracks. If you, like I, want this band to do well..dont burn this cd, go out and buy it instead. it is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"linkin park meets garbage and meat loaf","review":"delightful surprise with this first album. for those who love LINKIN PARK, try EVANESCENCE. this band has a potential # 1 with \\" bring me to life \\" . very intersting mix of dark gothic, with LINKIN PARK sound, a very like GARBAGE voice, and some MEATLOAF accord spinkled on top of it. Strange but very interesting recippe. This album rocks big time and is definitively worth the 14 bucks investment. the doctor prescribe to listen to it very loud and without moderation. 1 down note, still need to see how they will sound live because this remains the real test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Wow... that's really all I have to say. This cd is absolutely... amazing. After hearing the first single, \\"Bring Me To Life\\", I wanted to pick up their album, but then came to find out that it was not yet released. I bought the Daredevil Soundtrack for their 2 songs, and waited for the release of \\"Fallen\\". I was hooked upon first listen of this cd. The music is dark, gothic rock... but yet, not depressing. It sends chills up and down my spines everytime I listen. Amy's voice is so angelic, yet very powerful at the same time. This cd is outstanding. If you enjoyed the first single from Daredevil, you will surely enjoy this cd. If you take the time out to purchase this... it will be well worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most talented new female singers","review":"After hearing \\"Bring me to Life\\" and \\"My Immortal\\" on the Daredevil soundtrack, I knew that I must have this cd. Once I bought it, I managed to listen to it more than 10 times in a row. Each song has a unique feel to it that keeps you interested in every single track. Amy Lee is one of the first female rock singers that actually knows how to sing, not to mention that the lyrics and mixes are amazing and unique. I really enjoy how she encorporates different styles and voices in the background, techniques that add to the already great songs. There are a variety of types of songs, ranging from gothic rock to punk to soft and somber. I would recomment this cd to anyone who is either a fan of rock music like Linkin Park or Blindside, someone who enjoys really interesting mixes, or who just likes hearing a female singer who has real range and actual talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Blue!","review":"I was completely shocked when I heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\" (off the Daredevil Soundtrack). I was becoming bored with same guitar stuff, and Evanescence blew me out the water! Very electric, with a touch of hardcore, and to top it off a female vocalist!!???? That's pretty much unheard of in this line of music. Her voice is likely to send chills down your spine! Wonderfully haunting songs. I would recommend it to just about anyone!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Beautiful!","review":"I was really suprised by the quality of this album when I listened to it all the way through. Yeah, I heard the fantastic _Wake Me Up Inside_ and the tender _My Immortal_ many times on the radio. This album has an edge to it. Amy Lee sings as if she is screaming in anguish (as in emotional pain). The guitar parts by Ben Moody are pure Rock and are excellent. This is really an album to sink your teeth into. I can't recommend it enough. 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY AMAZING","review":"ok when i first get a cd that i have never heard before, the first thing i do is listen to the entire thing and see if anything sticks out to me. well, usually when i do this, theres only a couple songs i actually like. but this cd was entirely diffirent! every song appealed to me! i have listened to this cd 10 times over(no joke) and i still am not tired of it! but despite the amazing vocals, one of my favorite things about this cd is the feelings behind the lyrics. this is almost the ONLY band i can find that does not revolve its music around sex and immoral things like rap musicians tend to do. amy lee even expresses this feeling in the song \\"everybody's fool\\" i say if u are a parent lookin for a good but clean cd for your child, this is it. and if your jst lookin for some great music, buy this cd! its definitely worth it! i cannot express that enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Buy this ablum...","review":"I understand it is aimed at little pop punk fans but this album is just not rock/metal.I would be ashamed to call my self a devout lover of metal music if this came ionto the genre.I hate this album with a passion.I would strongly reccomend you buy albums from real bands such as (hed)pr, static X, coal chamber, bionic jive, blink 182, greenday, alkaline trio etc...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please these people just copy Linkin Park","review":"There is no one who can take this group seriously. they so copied a bunch of linkin park gutair riffs and stuff like that.Take \\"Bring me to Life\\" starts off with the piano (as in In the End by Linkin Park) Then goes into the background gutair riff(as in Pts. of Authority by Linkin Park) Then copies the gutair riff of dont stay by guess who linkin park. then sends in a poser rapper after the part wake me up.(making it sound like a discrace to linkin park.) dont buy this cd.

So dont by this. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, anyone?","review":"They're only big because they have a girl singer and it's a rock band. Wow. How originl.

I've heard better female soprano vocals elsewhere (i.e., Dido, Sinead O Connor, Tori Amos) and see no other reason this band found promotion other than possible corporate assumption that all 3 styles, above, would broaden the marketing target.If you want GREAT duo female/male vocals (over dark gloomy music, of course) check out In a Reverie or Comalies by Lacuna Coil, Lucid Dreaming or Vovin by Therion, or Beyond the Veil by Tristania."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT real music!!!","review":"I ahte Evanescence like they were hitler themselves.

It was a mixture of music that I love but have never heard together. Amy Lee's voice is amazing and the vocal range is unbelievable. She makes the hard rock and orchestra blend together perfectly with her voice. This was one of the few Cd's that I own that I listen to every single song. My favorite is \\"Hello\\" it is such a great song and you feel what Amy is all about by the way she sings it. Thanks to Evanescence they have opened up a new way for rock to go and introduced me to 12Stones due to their collaboration on \\"Bring Me To Life\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your everyday female-led band.","review":"Where should I begin? This was one of those might-as-well-try-it purchases at the local Wal-Mart. I'd heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\" on the radio a few times and it definitely sounded good among all the Staind and Limp Bizkit crap the radio usually plays. So I bought it. The heavy tracks are great, the singer/piano songs are okay, nothing is truly bad. \\"Tourniquet\\" has proven to be my favorite song on the record. Some call the guitarist untalented and relying on single-finger power chords, pedals, and distortion, but I say \\"So What? It works doesn't it?\\" Indeed it does. I'd recommend this to anyone tired of the same old song and dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goth emo with no hooks","review":"Evanescence is the textbook example of a band becoming extremely popular only because they are shoved down the throats of all who watch MTV or listen to pop radio stations. Fortunately I don't watch MTV and rarely listen to the radio. The truth of the matter is the entire band is talentless. They peddle the same power cords and simple piano melodies in every song. The only bright spot is the lead singer who does manage to show that she does have some vocal talent. What she needs to do is drop the losers she's with and begin singing something that people might actually remember in 5 years.\\"Fallen\\" is nearly your typical nu-metal offering in the same vein as Linkin Park except it lacks any of the hooks that made Linkin Park songs bareable. Save yourself some time and money and this one pass to the wayside of soon-to-be-forgotten over hyped pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"How is it that people can compare Evanescence to Linkin Park?

I thought a new band had broken through with a fresh sound. I bought the CD and I was totally disappointed. Yes, the single is an awesome song, but the rest of the CD is lacking. Every song sounds exactly the same and the only variation is the tempo. Amy Lee has an amazing voice but she needs better songs to sing. A lot of this material sounds recycled from the early 90's. The urgency and the rawness of \\"Bring Me To Life\\" is void on every other song.

Bring Me To Life is a totally awesome song with some added rap. My Immortal is a beautiful song with meaningful lyrics. Haunted is fast-paced with a good beat, and you can get the meaning of this song from the title. Fallen by Evanescence is definitely worth getting! I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG THIS IS THE BEST CD EVER!!!...","review":"OK i love this CD so much! you really will love it i think it is awsome... amy lee's voice is so powerfull and the songs have a nice message its one of the best cd's i have. if you like nice voice, good tune and cool songs then buy this cd!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this sucks","review":"I got this album as a christmas gift, and i have to say it sucks! The lead singer of the band is terrible, and could not sing at all. I sound better on the toilet than she sings. the guitar work on this album is boring as hell, and the songs dont sound good at all. buy linkin park if you want to hear real music. this sucks! I wish i could give it no stars. i soldthis cd about three days after i got it. i never even wanted it anyway, but somehow i got it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring me back to reality","review":"It's depressing when your favorite band never makes it. It's even MORE depressing when a band comes along and completely rips of your favorite band and makes it. When I heard Evanescence, I didn't know what to think. They sounded like Joydrop with a singer whom only had a tiny portion of the talent that Tara Slone holds. This music is a shame! I even downloaded most of the tracks from the CD to give it a fair chance. Still nothing. How can they be called good, let alone ORIGINAL? For the love of God, please buy one of Joydrop's CDs before even thinking of buying this one. Believe me-- it's like choosing chocolate cake over an M&M."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm... I disagree...","review":"OK- here's the deal.. if you were expecting some sick tori amos-linkin park fusion band.. look somewhere else. this CD starts out PERFECTLY, with Bring me Back to Life, but... it only goes downhill from there. Bring me back to life is the only hard song on this cd, the rest of it is a depressing tori amos type twisted [stuff]... no offense to tori. but after track number 2.. the track falls to about a 5/10. and it only gets sappier and sappier. truly not the album i was expecting. this is NOT a rock album.. but if you are looking for an emotionally saddened and cushy-mushy filled album, then GO FOR IT! but if you just like the sound of their first, and hopefully only, single \\"bring me back to life\\" then just get the single.. it is a one and only track like it on the whole cd. so like i said before.. i disagree with everyone else.. pretty much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's point and laugh","review":"Evanescence is the illegitimate child of Nightwish and Lacuna Coil, filtered of any life for mass consumption. (Even moreso for the latter.) The real kicker is that none of the bands this is derived from are any good.Amy Lee has to be the most overrated vocalist of the millennium. She doesn't sound dark or \\"mysterious,\\" nor is she talented. Her singing is glorified pop vocals with a superficial melancholic edge, no doubt processed beyond recognition.I once heard that 1 out of every 8 pennies, or some ridiculous statistic, has passed through someone's system at some point.

I wouldn't recommend this cd to anyone especially a christian who thinks this band is a Christian band, they are NOT! I bought this cd thinking that it sounded cool until I read the lyrics. The lyrics are very disturbing. Especially since the lead singer of the band, Amy Lee claims that they are christians, just not a christian band. It makes you wonder about that when you read her lyrics. 12 stones, Kutless, 38th parallel are some great christian bands that don't compromise where there lyrics are concerned. Or if you are into the bands that aren't christian bands, but they claim to be christians, try lifehouse, p.o.d, or blindside. You wont find anything in there songs about the godess of imaginary light. Overall it is creepy freaky and very disturbing. There is definetly better things out there. I don't think this is what God ment when he said to be In the World, Not of It."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe people enjoy this","review":"What a sad age when morbid music like this becomes the newest biggest hit.

I have to admit that Amy has a pretty good voice, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!","review":"I love this cd i think that they are sucha great group They should be voted number1 album of the year i especially loveThe song Bring Me to Life"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Rock, More Passion, Less Anger","review":"When I first heard Evanescence, I immediately thought of another bad Linkin Park imitation. After purchasing Fallen, I couldn't realize of how wrong I was. The band sees to triumph on where Linkin Park falls. The most noticeable change from the mainstream is that there isn't so much hate in the lyrics. There is, could it be, purpose? Originality? Amazing! Who would have thought that this was possible in this day and age, and especially in this genre. And the lead singer, Amy Lee, is amazing. I haven't heard a female lead in a rock band for quite awhile, much less one that was somewhat good. But I must give credit where credit is due. Upon first placing the disk in my stereo, the first thing I noticed was how beautifully Amy's voice combined with the slamming guitar solos and passionate lyrics. In conclusion, put some time aside to listen to this gem. It's not so mainstream as you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and haunting","review":"You really can't fault this album.The dark, dramatic, gothic sounding music is completely atmosperic and haunting, and Amy's vocals add the edge that the music needs.It's difficult to find a band that almost anyone who listens to this area of music will enjoy, but I beleive Evanescence is one of those bands. I can't see anyone being dissapointed in this album. It's original, epic, and doesn't continually sound the same throughout.Also, heavy music has been greatly lacking a female singer who is worth the hype... and Evanescence bridges that gap, setting a new standard.Most certainly worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving Piece of Work! Only To Sky Rocket!","review":"This new group is phenomenal! I can't speak high enough for them and this album. Amy's voice is exceptional and the lyrics are truly heart wrenching as well as haunting and speak to the soul. The band truly works exceptionally well together and compliment each other.Some albums can be a disappointment when it's only one or two songs that are successful, but the entire album is completely inspiring. Nothing but praises from me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, rock and it's melodic too.","review":"Maybe the nu-metal scene is already packed, but this band brings something new to the table: Beautifull female vocals.The music is something you would expect from \\"Linkin Park\\" and bands as such, so there is nothing really new or surprising. The similarity to Linkin Park comes more obvoius in track #2 with 12 Stones' singer rapping.What this band has that other nu metal bands don't is Amy's beautyfull singing behind it. She is definitely a talented singer, and makes this CD worth checking out.Yet again, the guitars are too simple, makes me think that this band has more potential, more than what's used in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD!!!","review":"I first heard \\"Bring Me To Life\\" on my local radio and I was almost sure it was Linkin Park doing a duet/collaboration with another band. After I bought the CD and listened through it all, I knew there was definitely a difference, I love both bands, but Amy's voice......I love Amy Lee's voice! She could sing any genre: classical, rock, pop, opera(possibly...) even country. She has so much talent, paired with the band itself and it's talent, I love the whole band and all the song they've made......I am patiently awaiting their next album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We all know Amy Lee is amazingly hot...but","review":"Okay so Amy Lee is beatiful, but if you look past that you will fing a really good album. With most of the [music] coming out of the hard rock/alternative area it's nice to have a women give new life to music that was starting to sound the same. I've heard friends say that all the songs sound the same, but if you actually listen to the album all the way through, you will realize they are all unique. Track four \\"My Immortal\\" is a good example of Amy using her talented voice with a soft piano in the back ground.I highly recommend this album, and hope that Evanescence stays around for a long time, and shows us all how to rock!!Oh Amy, you rock my world!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I've read","review":"I am a certified holistic health practitoner, and the owner of Reiki4Paws in Arizona. As a practitioner, I get many questions and often need to find resources for clients, so I read many books. This book is one of the best resources I've read for people who are new to energy healing. I actually bought a copy for my vet. Ms. Coates explains the basics clearly, without confusing readers about the different names for different philosophies or modalities.

Readers also get enough information to do further research, if they desire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really much help","review":"This book contains most of the scales, in every key, as well as most of the important chords to be used in jazz improvisation.

I have spoken with tech support and after trying several different fixes there has been no improvement. I have tried this printer on several different machines running Windows XP PRO via a USB Cable and get the same results. I have to print in draft mode to get any kind of normal speed out of it. If you are the type of person who doesn't mind a painfully slow printer (like watching the grass grow) then I guess that this printer will suffice.

Not all essays in the book are equally impressive, but there are valuable observations - and humorous passages.

Alongside the 'cool' Liberal - Clooney, Pitt, Gyllenhall, etc. - the pudgy, inadequate accountant played by Kevin James in the movie, is the default White character presented by Hollywood these days.For this reason I have no alternative but to regard this as much a racist film as Al Jolson 'blacking' up for a minstrel show in the \\"Jazz Singer.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"All the funny scenes are in the preview, but this movies still has some cuteness that saves it.

The producers of Hitch should have hired the King of Queen writers; then they would have had a great comedy hit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just ok","review":"Will Smith always pretty much does the same role so not alot changes with Him on the Screen.Kevin James is kinda like the White Cedric The Entertainer in this film with His dancing&Antics.

It tries a bit too hard to feel like Jerry Maguire (there is even a scene where one of the characters is watching the famous \\"You complete me\\" scene), but Will Smith is admirable in the lead as a \\"date doctor\\" who encounters a little trouble when trying to find love himself. A movie like this does not require much analysis, except to say that it is well-crafted and there are a few funny moments, especially in some of the scenes with co-star Kevin James. One thing it excels at is defying most of the cliches of your standard Hollywood rom-com. The ending is a little hackneyed, but by that time the film had endeared itself to me so much that I didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money and buy the dvd instead","review":"Either this was not filmed in HD, or it is a very poor transfer/encoding.

Yawn! But Will Smith is such a great actor that he's able to take a stale script and turn this movie into something quite enjoyable. Add to his performance a great comedic turn by Kevin James, and you've got one very predictable but very funny movie.Smith plays Hitch, A New York City matchmaker. Gauging from his lifestyle, he's a success. His latest client is a big, goofy guy [James], who's secretly in love with a beautiful heiress. Hitch grooms the guy in all the right moves. Meanwhile, Hitch meets a girl [Eva Mendes] who will turn his life upside down.The plot is absurd. It's the performances that make this movie work. Smith and James make it something both touching and loud out loud funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitch","review":"\`Hitch' is an above average romantic comedy which has some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments and plenty of Will Smiths charm and humour. Smiths character, Hitch, is a dating consultant who, whilst easing the path of many geeky men in their own lovelives, has trouble wooing the lady he is interested in himself. This makes for many funny scenes where he coaches his clients to be suave and sophisticated on the one hand and then watching him royally mess things up on the other. The scene where Hitch has an allergic reaction to shellfish is especially funny and Smith carries it off with style. This isn't an amazing Hollywood blockbuster, or trying to be some deep meaningful art piece, it is a simple fun romantic comedy and as that is all it's trying to achieve, it carries it off well. Worth a look on a lazy Sunday afternoon or to rent on a quiet date night in.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitch!","review":"hitch is a great movie with a great storyline. if you love will smith you will love this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It has its funny points","review":"I like Will Smith as an actor, but I'm not crazy about this movie.

After hearing so many people saying how much they thought this was funny and great, I looked forward to seeing this movie. I saw it last night and almost fell asleep. I think I laughed once throughout the whole movie. I love Kevin James and he's always funny in the King of Queens, but this wasn't the way he should have broken out into film. Will Smith was way too smooth and Amber Valeta should stick to modeling while she still has half her looks. Even if this was truely funny, all the funny parts have been shown on TV Trailers for so long, that the semi-good parts weren't new to me.

Needless to say when he meets up with a hard as nails local gossip reporter all of his professional skils are tested to the limit ......This is definitely a 'date' movie or one could say a 'chick flick' but trust me it's a hoot and the viewer never really knows wher in the world the story is going ...It certainly has been a long time since I thoroughly enjoyed a great story, great movien and great acting ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornball -","review":"A simplistic story about how \\"Hitch\\" (Will Smith) helps clueless clients make a good first impression.

Boy, did I pray for engine trouble, so we'd have to land and I could get away! Sucks or what? I liked Smith in 'I, robot', 'Independence day', etc, but this was awful. It's a one-joke movie. Problem is, the one joke was the one plastered all over the TV spots and trailers (the jet ski incident).

And though this film does just about everything right, I found myself frustrated with the end. To me, it just seemed like they couldn't decide between three different endings so they decided to put them all in there. She comes to apologize...he says no.

He's a real professional, his methods are a great success but of course he doesn't have a girl. When he finally sets his heart on someone, he takes her on the most amazing day out in New York, it had me swooning \\"oh I wish for that kind of romance\\" (I really am pathetic!). It's a complete disaster, especially when she finds out his profession, but leads on to a very satisfying conclusion.I loved this movie and highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Refreshing!","review":"I didn't have much anticipation for this film and I though this was a routine chick flick. However, Will Smith shows that he can take any acting role given to him and make it work. He's become a veteran entertainer. This film surprised me. Kevin James (King of Queens) is hilarious as the accountant, trying to win the heart of his boss. Eva Mendes is a lovely presence on the screen as the gossip columnist who uncovers Hitch's secret. The story is wonderful, original and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a refreshing change of pace and will entertain all who watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and fun","review":"Will Smith does a great job of seeming like a normal guy instead of just another arrogant hollywood nutjob.

Ella is really the star of this album as she tends to do most of the singing and she is at her absolute peak, Louis provides his incomparable vocals and of course some heart-wrenching trumpet solos, and (with the possible exception of Stompin at the Savoy which I don't care for) all the tracks shine.

The movie is a faithful adaptation, with a few minor changes: the black man Crooks, for example, doesn't get involved in George and Lenny's scheme about getting a ranch and \\"living off the fat of the land\\" as in the book. Also whereas the shooting of Lenny after he's accidentally killed Curley's wife is long and drawn out in the '39 movie, here it's relatively quick - though a short flashback tag is added for no particular reason.

As heart - moving the novel is as difficult it is for a director to reflect its emotions on screen. However, Gary Sinise using an adaptation by Horton Foote has reached much more than that.The story is about two vagabonds or migrant workers travelling together, looking for work on ranches to earn enough money to make their dream of having their own piece of land come true. Two men who are completely different in appearance and character prove that real friendship is possible.George, played by Gary Sinise, is the intelligent part of the duo, who takes care about his strong but simple-minded friend Lennie, excellently played by John Malkovich.The director didn't change much of the novel and that's one reason why the movie is as good as it is and with its perfectly chosen actors it's really worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I found the movie had a convincing portrayal of friendship.

You will hurt with them and hope for a happy ending which you know will not come. I consider this much better than the Burgess Merideth and Lon Chaney version and a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real hidden gem","review":"Having been a big fan of the book, I was a little skeptical when I first rented this movie. I had never seen the original version with Lon Chaney and Burgess Meredith, but I did not see how such a short book could translate in to a full production movie and still hold true to the book. I was pleasantly surprised to see how well Gary Sinise told Steinback's classic tale, and how all of the characters were as believable as they were in the book. Perhaps the biggest surprise performance in this movie comes from Joe Morton, who plays the stable worker Crooks. The scene he shares with Malkovich's character Lenny when the other workers go to town is a subtle reminder of how everyone could use a friend from time to time, and it really hits on the friendship theme which is often ignored when this book is discussed. This movie is a must see for fans of the book, or for anyone who wants to see a movie which earns its stripes by its story and performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't hold a standard-sized mat.","review":"The wood of the frame seems fine, and the stand and hanging loop were adequate. However, the frame won't fit a standard-sized mat because there's so little space. Once I added my mat and the photo I couldn't actually latch the back onto the frame! And of course, I had to open the package before I discovered all this. So now I have a non-returnable frame and mat. There was nothing in the description that led me to believe it wouldn't hold a standard mat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Items and Wrong Receipt!!","review":"I ordered 4 white frames to give family members wedding photos for Christmas. Not only did I receive the wrong items (3 black frames and 1 white frame), but I also received an incorrect receipt -- which states that I purchased The Exorcist Book, the Bible and a Peanuts Box Set.

The film must be peeled off to reveal a sticky surface that is then carefully applied to the interior of your windows. Care must be taken to avoid air bubbles that will visibly show between the window and the film.* I HAVE NOT attempted to remove the film but given the materials properties, such as thin film and sticky adhesion I can only ascertain that it would rip or tear when removed and in no way shape or form be reusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"the biggest attraction ever.","review":"this window tint. if you are inept at applying window tint, dont buy this. it is not re-usable, and that claim was never made by the manufacturer.

It appears to be intended as merely an overview and/or basic review.The book attempts to provide a broad range of topics:1-History2-Botanical Facts3-Cultivation4-Techniques, Effects, and Customs5-The Connoisseur6-General informationHowever, each of these topics has very little depth. It will not provide any more insight into growing, use, or culture than what you could find on either of the two large online cannabis forums.There is much missing in this book, and many inaccuracies. Included recipes leave out how much to put in. Growing recommendations and expectations are patently wrong. The cultural history is incomplete. It's hard to believe that a former High Times editor put this together.This isn't a terrible book on cannabis, but there are so many better ones out there. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"super skinny","review":"Too Dark Park is probably my favorite SP album, if I had to choose one. I've had this Spasmolytic/Shore Lined Poison CD Single since it was first released probably 20 years ago. Haven't listened to this disc for awhile but I decided to dust it off and give it a listen. The 2 remixes are excellent. I especially like the mix of Shore Lined Poison. The live cuts are solid too. Choralone [live] is a chilling post-apocalyptic tune. Fantastic cover art too. A good item for the collection of a SP fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and fun!","review":"Justin is a confident, smart, and ambitious 5th grader with great political aspirations. When he and his academic rival are selected to be the king and queen for a class history project, the royal couple's delusions of grandeur threaten both of their campaigns for class president.Kathryn Lay's delightful middle-grade novel is quite funny, with a charming mix of characters who aren't always what they seem. Cleverly titled chapters add to the fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny But very Adult Humor!","review":"Great shorts and funny storylines but too adult for even someone that is an adult! It's just my opinion and I'm 18 and this movie left me speechless and I couldn't believe what happens in this video! The youtube versions of this series is mature rated but this dvd is just plain wrong in it's entertainment choice. If you like jokes about sexual body parts and silly wreckless killing of children then this is for you! I thought i have seen it all but now after watching this I know now I hadn't! I liked this movie for the Dr. Tran episodes but the extra shorts are a bit much! so Dr. Tran is numbuh 1! and the shorts are numbuh 2 poo! That's clean compared to the kinda humor in this movie. Totally recommend to everyone over 18!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: Trantastic!","review":"I really find it too bad that people who didn't see this at Spike 'n Mike's will miss out on the 3D-glasses gag. I still have my glasses from the festival.

I'm not sure I have heard something like this in quite a long time. I am fan of Dave Matthews and Blues Traveler and I truly believe that this album will attract the same fans. The sound is unique, in an interesting way blending jazz and classic rock. Dom Dorman is also quite versatile - playing both the quick and riveting Last November as well as the ballad-esque Southern Spain. I truly believe that this band has a future and I would recommend the album to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Losing a child","review":"This book needed to be written. As a bereaved parent myself, I understand the importance of wanting to keep the memory of a dead child/children alive. Julia Quinlan's willingness to re-live the painful memories of her child's suffering and ultimate death show remarkable courage. She is indeed a very courageous woman. Her appeal to the younger generation of the consequences of dugs mised with alcohol is vital information. However, what comes through more in this book is the care-giving provided during Karen-Anne's (and her family's) ordeal. I admire Julia's honesty and her credibility in writing this book. She deserves to be heard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoe Slot is too small!","review":"I purchased this and also the 33\\" shoe cabinet. I took me about 1 hour to put this together. Not too bad except for the fact that the magnet for door attachment was drilled in the wrong slot, and the screw for the door knob is too short. My biggest disappointment is that the shoe slots were way too small. I can barely fit my daughter size 3 tennis shoe in the slot. I have to remove one of the divider and even then, the slots were too small for a size 6 tennis shoes. Pretty bad design, and not very useful. I won't even waste my time putting together the 33\\" cabinet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Free At Last","review":"The title of the book was the initial attraction. This is something I had trouble doing for several years after accepting Christ as my Savior. I always had the nagging voice of the enemy telling me I could never be totally free of my past wrongs.Chapter by chapter the book points out so many scriptures of how much God loves us and what He promises and tells us. There are short comments from other women too. I was finally able to break free of that past and truly receive His love without a doubt left.This book will is great for great group study or individual study. Each chapter has about 7-10 questions or comments with focused scripture, and there's a leader's guide at the end with answers and additional comments.I am ordering another topic of study today, and going to the Women of Faith conference this year in Tampa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Textbook","review":"Simply put this is the worst textbook I've ever read. If there was a negagtive star rating I could give it, I would. Stacey's attempts to draw analogies between business and other completely unrelated topics are overdone, belabored, verbose, and very frustrating. This book continually causes me to ask the question \\"Is the author going to make a point before the end of the chapter?\\" This book was an assigned textbook for a course I am taking so I am being tortured and forced to read it. Strange and wacky thinking doesn't equal innovative thinking!!!If you don't have to buy it, DON'T and then beg the instructor to change his/her mind and switch to another textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to ASP.NET with VB.NET","review":"I agree with those who put 5 stars for this book. If you haven't had previous experience with ASP.NET, this is the way to go. Just excellent. Together with Professional ASP.NET will be sufficient to get you started with ASP.NET and VB.NET."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Space Where There Was None","review":"I used these mounts to hang two bikes in a space next to a stackable washer/dryer combo. Previously, I could only hang one bike from a ceiling hook. The great thing about the FastTrack system is that you can space the hangers anywhere along the rail, which makes it easy to fit these bike hooks and bikes in a small space.The wheel hook could stay a little more still when putting the wheel into it. Since it is up high on the wall, you can't steady the unit except with the bike wheel. Sometimes, with thicker tires, like on mountain bikes, it is harder to nab the wheel under the hook - the hook will push back to the wall and you have to try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I Had Thought of That","review":"I have to admit, I actually borrowed this book from the library first to see if it was worth purchasing and it definitely is!! Great ideas on fairly easy projects that I can't wait to try. I'm no Martha Stewart, but I think I could actually DO most of the projects in this book. Very inspirational and the projects actually look NICE, not like grade school crafts. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideas, Ideas, Ideas","review":"I found a few ideas to try that I never would have tried prior. Not everything is for everyone, but most should be able to pick out one or two projects that pay in themselves for the cost of the book. I would have, however, appreciated more step - wise pictures and having the instructions with the item, instead of in the back of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flea Market Finds: Instant Ideas & Weekend Wonders","review":"On the positive side, the photographs are excellent. That's the only good news. This book does nothing but tell you how to make ... out of ... I'd return it if I could.

You have to be a moron not to have come up with anything in this publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REAL WINNER!!!","review":"THIS BOOK IS THE SECOND BEST BOOK I READ. IM USUALLY NOT A READER BUT THIS BOOK CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. I COOULDNT PUT IT DOWN. I FINISHED IT IN ONE DAY! I WISH IT NEVER ENDED. IT IS A REAL WINNER YOU WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING BEFORE IT ENDS!

HIS FIRST ONE WAS GREAL ALSO."},{"rating":"2","title":"maybe it's me...","review":"I have owned this book for years, and I still find myself picking it back up and re-inspiring myself to be more devious in my own comic-writing.Personally, Julie Doucet is my favorite comic book artist, and I learned about her first through this book. Eli Langer has pushed the limits so much & gotten away with it. I love his story. It's also nice to be able to put a \\"face to the name\\" and get to see the artists' mugs- which are often also quite amusing.All that I have to suggest is that if you are not willing to expose yourself to the whole \\"bloody-pedophelic-rape-abused\\" experience, I would say don't buy this book. Otherwise, it s a great read, especially to an aspiring underground-comic artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"this is one of the best albums out there on the market. along with all the other releases by Caribou.but this album i enjoy because you can see the transition from Start Breaking My Heart to The Milk of Human Kindness. another album from Caribou where all the songs get stuck in my head and i love to sing along with the cd. its amazing.the way Dan Snaith uses layers and textures to build his music is so incredible. the vocals on I've Lived on a Dirt Road All My Life is simply so beautiful and amazing sometimes i wonder how he came up with it. love it. love this album. and the videos are awesome"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful voice and great songs","review":"This debut album has more well written songs on it than most albums I've heard the last few years---catchy and memorable--production style is pop ( could have been maybe more rock/organic, but I still like it) This girl has the voice of an angel, like Allison Krause, but different. Can't wait to hear what she does next. I think she'll be huge one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"it will get the job done.","review":"Grass doesn't exactly run from this size line. I go with a braided line same diameter much stronger. You get more for less on the braided because it lasts a lot longer. this line I find breaks often and I have to replace it constantly. That can be time consuming and frustrating. This does come at a great bargain though, and if you are a homeowner just needing to get the job done, it will certainly do that. I no longer use it for my business though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"It looks cheap and unimpressive flashing like a carnival light at the county fair.

I would prefer the steering lock instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product. Do not waste your money.","review":"Shipping was very fast. Product requires 2 AAA batteries that are NOT included. I applied the batteries and product did not turn on even after switching batteries and flipping the on/off switch a few times. After about 5 min, the product heated up to the point I couldnt touch it. I used a towel to remove the scalding hot batteries that are now wasted. Dangerous product. DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hokey but I love it!","review":"My car was recently stolen, and thankfully recovered a month later undamaged. Now I want to take all the preventative measures I can. I got the Club (red), and this device. My car is old so a real alarm is not an option. But, this device with the velcro attachment concealed looks real to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Cheap constructed, not really believable and the holder loses its stickiness quickly so you either super glue it or it will fall again.I only liked the fact that you can replace the batteries and I use the reusable ones. But after it fell the last time, I got sick of it and don't even use it anymore. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the real thing","review":"The device has 2 LEDs and the blinking alternates between those two lights .The frequency of the blinking is too fast and normally a anti-theft device has only one LED. It looks absolutely nothing like a real anti-theft device. I got it and I felt this would probably attract thieves (it's like a freaking open invitation for thieves saying \\"come! I don't have an alarm system installed!\\") . I decided not to use it. Also, it's over-priced for a simple led circuit. I will not recommend anyone to get this if you truly care about your car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Silly little thing doesn't work. I tried different batteries but it never worked. Maybe I got a bad one? Don't know. It works just fine in my trash can, with all of the other things I don't want. Good idea, but a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would I purchase again.","review":"Is it Star Wars technology no. But this product has always worked when I turn it on. Easy to replacethe batteries when they need replacing. When used at night I think someone would think twice beforebreaking in my car. I wish the there was more of the backing tape, so it would hold on to the surfacewhere it placed better. But for the price I paid for it a good product. Would I buy it again, yes.But purchase two like I did to get free shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best...","review":"It works, but that is about all I can say. It doesn't look real at all compared to any car alarm light I have seen, and it drained the two AAA batteries in less than a month despite me turning it off in the day. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adhesive not strong enough for led light","review":"The stickers are fine and probably have some deterrent value, although they could be more imaginative as a \\"fake alarm\\" sticket. The leg light keeps falling off as the heat in the car causes the adhesive to melt. It keeps ending up on the floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great...","review":"I bought this item to simulate an alarm in my truck...lights flash impressively and it does exactly what I want it to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Save your money it's junky, cheap and not worth the price.Mine stoped working in cold weather and the battery cover broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Don't waste your money. The way the two LEDs blink make this thing look like what it is... a toy. Very disappointed. Can't believe I spent more than 1 dollar on such a crappy thing. Even a kid would understand that this thing is not an alarm."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG BLUFF FOR THE BUCK","review":"These things look real enough, especially at night when, presumably, they're most needed. Of course, they may not fool every would-be car burglar, but any with half a brain will probably opt not to test them. And, at just over 20 bucks for the pair (including shipping), that's a pretty cheap bluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh....","review":"The main pro of this product is that it looks real enough. I wouldn't place it directly in view for a would-be robber to see because the person could tell it's not connected to the car's electrical system in any way (and is therefore fake). Thankfully my radio has been stolen already so I was able to place it inside where the hole is, just showing, and it looks like it could be attached to something.The con is the thing is garbage. Yes it is cheaply made, it's just alternates flashing lights. The battery life on this thing is ridiculous. Lasts about 3-4 days, roughly 8-10 hours per day on 2 AAA batteries. Not exactly what I was looking for. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"In One Word: JUNK","review":"This is a cheap piece of junk made in a well-known foreign Asian land known for producing junk. The two lights are NOT LED and do not flash quickly like a real security system. They are dull lights, alternating from one to the other. Don't waste your money or batteries. Anyone will tell its fake. I threw mine in the garbage...wasn't worth sending back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geli Raubal -- A \\"Mystery\\" of WWII ?","review":"There is yet another anomaly in this substandard DVD series on WWII. It has a section concerning the unsolved murder of Geli Raubal, Hitler's niece -- widely suspected to have been carried out by Hitler himself, but still not confirmed to be so. What is so mysterious about this? Weren't there innumerable others whom Hitler has secretly murdered? Also, this was not a \\"mystery of WWII\\", but an event related to Hitler's inner circle well before (8 years prior to) WWII.

After seeing a surprisingly negative review of this movie when I logged on to buy the DVD, I decided to add my two cents. This is a VERY entertaining movie. It's well-paced, originally plotted and funny! Really. As the two heroes of the story fumbled their way through one sloppy crime after the other, I chuckled and looked forward to each new scene. This is not just for hardcore Western lovers. My mother enjoyed it, my kid loved it, my brother liked it, etc. That's why I'm buying it. Of course, I happen to like my westerns light -- think of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Quigley Down Under, Support Your Local Sheriff, Shanghai Noon, etc. I give it 5 stars for being purely entertaining.

I never get any imports, or anything that dosen't fit my budget but when I saw this had two songs I've never heard before, I jumped to it. The Single Ex-girlfriend (which I already loved) is definatly a real girl-powered song and Full Circle and Big Distraction are great songs.

After browsing amazon.com for good reviews on a classic adventure movie like BRAVEHEART, I came across LAST OF THE MOHICANS. I dowloaded a few songs from the soundtrack and fell in love with the music. Naturally, I had to see the movie.I'll get to the point...THE MUSIC AND SCENERY WAS AWESOME. I thought the acting was NOT up to par, I thought the love story was completely underdeveloped and I thought the script was horrible. I was completely lost the first 45 minutes and so was my mother, who teaches Cooper's novel. BUT...I have to say, the ending scene was beautifully done--visually.Anyway, go buy the soundtrack--that's where the real magic of this movie is.Anyone agree with me on this...because I see many great reviews for the film on here...honestly, I thought it was semi-cruddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is the reason I own a DVD player!!!","review":"I told my friends that this was coming out on DVD.

I finally figured out that the whole scene was gone, making the scenario very choppy and frankly, it ruined the rest of the movie. I am VERY SORRY I ever ordered this movie on DVD. I want my VHS copy back!!! Since I gave it away, and not being an Indian giver (no pun intended), I am absolutelyn furious.

The new less-than-seamless edits, poor color and lighting, and muddy dialogue transfer are more than enough reasons not to spend your money on this version. I agree with the others who hope this is not the last definitive version of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Picture Quality","review":"It's too bad I waited so long to see this BD version after purchasing it from Amazon. It's way too dark, even when viewing at night with all the lights off. I gave my previous DVD version of this movie away once the BD version arrived. I wish I could get it back. Even the dark scenes on the DVD version had more detail than this crummy BluRay rip-off. I know now that when you first open up the BD case and find only the disk, be alert to a mediocre effort in providing a good quality BD product. What a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing DVD (Director's Cut)","review":"Great picture quality and sound, terrible editing. They edited out the intensity the original film in theaters and VHS gave to the plot. The battle scenes that were added made the film boring. The soundtrack that was edited away took away from the intensity of the love between Nathaniel and Cora. I went searching for the VHS version and bought that version. Fortunately, I didn't get rid of my video player when DVD technology came out. I definately would NOT recommend the DVD unless they release a version of the original film that was released to theaters or at least a DVD version that is identical to the VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Director's Cut","review":"This movie is one my all-time favorites BUT not this version. The Director's Expanded Edition really changed from the original - the only expanded scenes I noticed were at the battle of the fort. The wonderful theme song by Moira Brennan was entirely cut out of the waterfall scene, which, to me, was one of the most beautiful parts of the movie. I'll sell this one and go back to the original theatrical version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film On Colonial America","review":"Michael Mann's 1992 film of James Fenimore Cooper's novel is brilliant work in every way. From the cinematography to the acting and costumes, the film takes the audience back to the adventurous wilderness of 18th century America.Daniel Day Lewis is brilliant as Hawkeye, the American settler whose blood ties to the Mohicans make him more of an Indian than a colonist. The film is filled with immaculate choreography of 18th century warfare and faithfully replicates all costumes and armaments. Wes Studi as Magua delivers an impeccable performance as the embodiment of hatred and revenge. Do not miss this brilliant film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It had it's moments","review":"If you are expecting a film that is true to the novel, FORGET IT.If you want a film that is historically accurate, FORGET IT.But, if you just want an 18th Century (Okay, pseudo 18th Century) action flick, go for it. We've come a long way since the Randolph Scott version (and the silent one with Bela Lugosi as an Indian) but this could have been SOOOOO Much BETTER. The unrealistic dialog of the novel was dropped (THANK YOU) but some of the fighting sequences looked like the belonged in a Jackie Chan movie. The musical score was fantastic, (especially the opening music) the seige and massacre sequences were quite good, but it ends there. Even though reenactors provided invaluable assistance and knowledge, Mann didn't use it enough. The real saving grace for this one was Wes Studi as Magua. He didn't play the part like a cartoon character. You actually felt sympathy for his character in places.(It makes me detest the British even moreso)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Of The Mohicans (blu-ray)","review":"We have the regular dvd of this and were hoping for a better quality picture(one of our favorite movies).Upon viewing,we were terribly disappointed in it.Our original copy is actually better!Not sure but would love to return it otherwise it goes into our garage sale stack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"I really liked this movie and watch it whenever it's on TV.

One film that you can go back to time and again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great version - flawed DVD","review":"This version is less like a music-video and more like a real movie. It is a matter of taste, ofcouse, which you prefer; personaly I like this one better. The movie is still visualy impressive and still has a more agressive scrore than most movies, but the characters have more room to breathe.Gone are also some of Lewis' 'smart' oneliners, which is probably the biggest single improvement.I had no problems playing this DVD on my computers DVD-drive (as others report to have had), but the DVD *is* flawed. (See the other reviews for details). But even so, it is still good entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The director's expanded edition dissapointment","review":"I bought this movie a while back on DVD glad to see when it came out. Excited I put it in as soon as I got it. Probably the biggest disappointment I've had in a long time. It was no where near as good as the VHS. Much of the dialogue is removed, including the before mentioned conversation between hawkeye and cora and several others. Some scenes and dialogue were added, but mostly deletes. The sound track does not align with the scenes very well. It is obviously bent and stretched to accomodate the new stuff. Overall I give it two stars only because it was a good movie before it was re-arranged. I would highly recommend anyone buy the VHS and we can all hope that the company will release the original version on DVD soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic got ripped - Blu-Ray version","review":"So much for Director's Expanded edition. It's shameful how some people would do anything for money.I triple-dipped on this one, VHS, DVD and then this piece of Blu-ray trash. It was dark and the color is off (greenish). It might be just a tad sharper than the DVD, but for 1080p, I expect nothing less than perfection, especially viewing on a 100\\" plus screen. BTW, the disc itself is NOT defective, others have similar experience.The only reason it got 1 star was the movie content itself, a classic ripped from 480p to 1080p.Do not buy; just get the DVD version if you do not have one yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreeing with Book Lover...","review":"I am going to go with the previous review made by \\"Book Lover\\" on this one. We watched this movie in my English class Thursday, Monday, and today, and I was very disappointed with it because I'd previously read the book. However, since I was the only one to have done so, the discussion when the movie was finished today was biased towards the film. Even my teacher admitted to not having read the book, and so I was alone in my stand. But apart from myself...there were severe contrasts between the book and the movie, enough to drive the literature lover insane. Granted, the historical aspects of the film -- costumes, scenery, buildings/locations, etc. -- were very accurate, and the performances by the actors were excellent, and the soundtrack was beautiful...but refer to Book Lover's review, and you'll see what I mean. It's not a bad movie. It just has some major, major flaws. James Fennimore Cooper deserved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item is not a Blu-Ray quality product","review":"This item is another example of transferring dvd content directly to a blu-ray disk and then marketing it as being of blu-ray high definition quality--- IT IS NOT. The image quality is less than the image quality of Last of the Mohicans on a dvd played on a up-conversion dvd player. The color is so poor(low chroma) that it appears to have actually been copied from an old VHS master where much of the data has vanished over time. The quality of this item is pathetic when compared to any real blu-ray mastered item. I am really offended to be scamed like this again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still holds up","review":"I still remember watching this movie in the theater when it came out and being blown away by the beauty of the cinematography. It's been almost a decade now and the film still holds up.The dvd is good(except for the complete and utter lack of extras), and the director's cut does basically no horrific damage to the original.If you're a junkie for lush backdrops, a gorgeous score and well shot and bloody battle scenes then give this flick a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for a better edition...","review":"I was very disappointed by this DVD - this is the first time I've ever felt strongly enough to write a negative review of an item. My main complaint is the abysmal sound quality: with DTS sound it should have been ideal, but, as stated by others, one can hardly hear the dialogue or even the beautiful music score. It would also be nice to have a choice of theatrical and director's cut - this doesn't seem to be a problem for other sets. This great movie deserves much better treatment than it received here. (And so do the fans willing to pay this kind of money for it!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much anticipated, very much disappointed","review":"We have the DVD widescreen version of this movie and love it. When we were notified that the Blu-Ray version would be available, we were totally excited. We got it and watched it the same day it arrived. Horrible! Most of the scenes are so dark you can't see what is going on on the screen. The scenes that are not dark are so distorted color wise. Every scene has a yellow hue. We will revert to our DVD and put this Blu-Ray aside. We have duplicated many of our DVD's with Blu-Ray and this is the first disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theatrical Edition got its heart cut out (Oustanding movie, crap DVD)","review":"This is a truly great movie that's been scalped and hacked by Mann and his personal vision.

However, it seriously misses on the original dialogue (.ie. there is original dialogue missing during the argument between Duncan and Hawkeye inside the forth.)Also, the original movie had beautiful music that is missing in the DVD version (.ie. Clanad's \\"I will find you\\" musical background is missing in the scene where the heroes climb the mountains following Magua's war party and the Munro's daugthers.)It felt like a cheeseburger without the cheese and with fried tofu for meat.

The cinematography (Dante Spinotti) was breathtaking and surprisingly the entire film was perfectly cast (Bonnie Timmermann).I bought the VHS of this film because many of the reviews stated that the Director's Cut was such a deviation from the original. I did not find this to be the case. Aside from some dialogue and music that had been edited out, the movie is practically indistinguishable - which leads me to my question - how do you know that there is more footage of Uncas and Alice? Anyone watching the film is riveted by the strong, quiet performance of Eric Schweig and questions the prominent billing and minimal part of Jodhi May. Nevertheless, the viewer is left with a strong sense that there is indeed something more.Is there? Or is it the extremely fine acting that leaves the viewer longing for what should have been for the ill-fated couple?"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible transfer","review":"As stated in other reviews, the dark scenes are very black and one can barely make out what is going on.

There is a fair sense of balance here, with the honor-based ideals of both cultures coming under scrutiny. The British and the French are typical arrogant Eurocentrists, but Magua is a good example of how a blind quest for vengeance can lead to corruption. My only gripe is the Hollywood-forced addition of a love interest for Hawkeye(though Mrs. Stowe is quite lovely). Obviously a broader appeal was needed but it just seems stale and typical. By contrast the subtle romantic touch between Stowe's sister and Hawkeye's brother was much more earnest.Still, this along with Black Robe is one of the better films detailing the Indian Wars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb masterpiece!","review":"This is on my fav's list for sure.Excellent plot,historical accuracy,acting,music score.A rare gem that was well made all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"i am young","review":"I do not understand these complicated things. all I want to do is whine and sleep.

However, the night it got mailed to my house I decided to watch it with my roommates and was SORELY disappointed. There were no scratches on the disc, yet the image would become pixelated and entirely unwatchable at random parts of the film. I thought it was my Blu-Ray player, but I checked 8 different Blu-Rays and another 8 regular DVDs and I never encountered the problem with them.

The DVD doesn't even contain the option to view the original version and has very little in the way of \\"extras\\" such as behind the scenes footage or interviews with any of the people involved.

It's way too dark. Any scene that takes place inside, with natural lighting, is ruined by this transfer. To give you an idea of just how dark this transfer is, remember the scene where the Indians attack the British column early in the film? Right before the attack, Magua walks down the length of the column and as he's walking, he draws his weapon and strikes a green British soldier who smiles at him. This transfer is so dark, you can't even see the look on this kid's face. If I was the cinematographer, Dante Spinotti, I would be very angry about this transfer. I watched the first 25 minutes of the movie and turned it off in frustration. It's too bad because I was enjoying Michael Mann's great commentary.

Don't let the catch-phrase on the DVD cover fool you! It's not expanded. Yes, some scenes are edited differently and there's some extra dialouge just before the end credits, but Mann has removed some really great dialouge that, for me, makes this movie one of my favorites. This film hasn't been expanded, it's been altered. Why did Mann do this? The film was fine the way it was. If Mann was going to add footage to it, he should not had sacrificed original footage.

An updated screen treatment of an inadequate 1936 screen treatment of a sterile and verbose early American novel. Cooper was not a great writer. But he was the first to voice a theme that Mark Twain finally successfully realized in Huck Finn. That American culture--flaws and virtues--springs from its contact with the frontier.It's a shame that the writers didn't return to the original source material to find the urealized potentialities of Cooper's work. Maybe someone will succeed one day in doing what film adaptations of earlier unsuccessful films and books should do: remain respectful of the author's intentions, but find the core of meaning that the earlier artists missed.

Hawkeye is a classic, (ugly!) character with a very odd, but laudable view of the world in the book. His best friend is Chingachgook. In the movie he is a tough, handsome womanizer who is Chingachgook's adopted SON! These are paltry few of the rotten things about this Hollywood horror. If you want to hear about Hawkeye and the rest, read it the way it was meant to be told!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic movie","review":"This is a movie which has been a favorite of mine. I didn't rent it but I found it in my house, watched it and enjoyed it.The plot is about the proud daughter of an aristocratic British general and the warrior of the Mohicans named Hawkeye who was an adoptee, and the trials surrounding their fondness during a time of tempestuous circumstances, mostly the ongoing warring between them and the British, who end up being surrounded and flanked by the French and I won't give away the ending but it is a fast paced film that isn't boring and features some real beautiful cinematography. I enjoyed it enough that I would watch it a third time and I can say I highly recommend it.- Aryan Somers, November 2011 -"},{"rating":"2","title":"I went out happy!","review":"We watched the beginning of this movie in school, and I wanted to see it all! I rented it, and it was GREAT. I then went to the WIZ and got the Widescreen version! {Well, thats all they had.} The film though was more like a PG rated film instead of an R rated film. Oh yeah, it's safe for the family."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the Amazon reviews before I got this","review":"I don't mind expansion nearly as much as I mind all the deletions from this version. I love this film, but the DVD expanded edition is awful. What is with these directors? It's like George Lucas saying Star Wars films are his and he can do what he likes with them. I'm sorry, but these films become part of our lives. Mess with them if you must, but at least give us the choice. I've been replacing my vhs with DVD, but back to the vhs version for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, bad DVD","review":"As others have noted, the original movie is awesome. The VHS version is awesome. But don't spend your money on this pathetic DVD. Some of the problems:The complete removal of the Clannad song presents an interesting, though inferior, variation of the movie. Technically, the DVD has visible glitches, which should have been corrected before the DVD was released. Some of the darker scenes have been lightened, which only serves to destroy the mood and remind you that you're watching a movie. You'll also learn why the last scene was edited severely in the original movie as you slowly begin to fall asleep from the boring political statement that is made....The DVD should have included the original version so that we could all ignore the absolutely lousy director's cut. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Directors Cut Sucks","review":"I like this movie, but not the directors cut. That fool should have left it alone. In this version they've deleted scenes, removed dialog, altered the soundtrack, and added some very unneccesary and tedious extra footage that really just doesn't mesh well with the rest of the movie (IMHO). I was disgusted when I saw the changes. This is a great movie, it should not have been tampered with. The original version is available on VHS.LONG STORY SHORT: Great movie, but the directors cut bites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This is a terrible DVD. If you want the movie, buy the VHS version instead. Want to know why? Just read the other DVD reviews below. I don't think I need to repeat what everyone else has said already.

The DVD version is barely two stars; the theater and VHS version is more than 5 stars. dmw's description of the Theater, VHS and sadly the DVD versions are exactly on the mark. \\"The VHS widescreen version in THX is a wonderful piece of entertainment. Unfortunately, this Director's Expanded Edition has destroyed the flow and continuity of the original.\\" The DVD version is a tragedy.

Why Mr. Mann did this is a mystery, but he surely did lower the overall entertainment experience of watching this DVD. They should call it the Director's Diminished Edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mann's Awful Director's Cut","review":"If you love this film. If you saw it in the theater and are longing to re-experience the thrill and romance. Forget it. Usually brilliant director Michael Mann has trashed the film with this director's cut. For example, Mann destroys the impact of Russell Means' final speech by adding a maudlin, politically correct diatribe in the final moments of this version. Buy the widescreen VHS of the original theatrical cut if you want the best version of Last of the Mohicans. The director should be ashamed to withhold the theatrical release from DVD. Don't waste your money on this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shameful TRAVESTY of the Literary Masterpiece","review":"Why did they call this movie \\"The Last of Mohicans\\", when it represents an outrageous travesty of the great novel? They should have named the movie \\"Tarzan and the Savage Indians\\". The important theme of interracial romance (written over 100 years ago!) was too taboo for Hollywood, so they white-washed it. The central heroic characters (who are Native Americans in the novel) were reduced to background static. I dare you to actually read the whole novel, before marking my review 'Unhelpful', and then decide for yourself how you feel about Hollywood's wanton, idiotic, greed-driven re-write of great classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"received it fast","review":"I can't belive how fast we received it.

She had seen it many times before, and it was one of her favorites. I had no idea what it was about, but I had heard of it. I thought it was one of the saddest films I had seen in a long, long time. The love shared by Hawkeye and Cora was expressive enough not to need words. The musical score was EXCELLENT, and I would like to get my hands on the CD version of it. The ending was powerful and moving. My friend and I were both wet-eyed by the time the movie was over. Though the battle scenes were pretty graphic, I would recommend this to anyone who loves drama and bravery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gee, you think a decent DVD version will come out next year?","review":"I think its a set up.

I mean, come on, this one doesn't even have the trailer!It did have the correct ratio and that is something, but it ain't much given what else is out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"An action film with intelligence.","review":"Easily one of the best American films of the Nineties. A moving tale of love, war, revenge, and redemption. Wonderfully shot on location with rousing battle scenes. I found the battle scenes to be more interesting than those in, say, Braveheart. This intelligent film has fine pacing and is graced with a very interesting music score. Wes Studi gives an excellent portrayal as the sulking, vengeful Magua. This film was directed by Michael Mann who also directed The Insider and Heat (as well as Miami Vice). If you want an action film with intelligence, The Last of the Mohicans is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original VHS Movie Great - DVD Version Butchered","review":"When I purchased the \\"Director's Expanded Edition\\" I assumed this would, indeed, be an enhancement. But how dissappointing; the cuts are unexplainable and the additions laughable (such as at the end in which Chingachgook gives a long winded speech...so uncharacteristic of his character). Now I've seen the original on VHS several times, and that version is just wonderful! Knowing what was in the original and then watching this DVD version was such a let-down. I have a hard time believing the Director would actually butcher his own work. If you loved the original, you'll be disappointed with this version..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray - Poor Production work","review":"Just received this Blu ray recently in the post.Many of the scenes were so dark that I had to turn my TV brightness levels right up. This is the only Blu ray I have that has this issue. Althought this is a Region A,(US), disc I can play this in my all region Blu ray player.My TV was calibrated using a professional disc, so I do not like to change any settings and have never needed to do this before. This film needs to be properly remastered on Blu.What nonsense to call this a 'director's cut'. This film therefore in its current Blu ray presentation is very poor indeed.It is high time that 20th Century Fox remastered this film.Shoddy workmanship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a beautiful movie!","review":"This was a beautiful well acted movie when it came out, and is still a beautiful movie, although I have taken a star off for the directors cut version.Why do directors feel compelled to re-do their work after the fact? And, what was Michael Mann thinking by taking out the Clannad song? It was a haunting and poignant song that captured the essence of the moment as Nathaniel was rushing to save Cora, and that ultimately led to the climax of the movie. In this case, the song should have been left in, and would have added to the movie, as it did in the original version.I would have liked a few bonus sections, such as how the movie was made, and maybe an explanation of the times it was based in. I understand that Daniel Day-Lewis, Russell Means and Eric Schweig had to train strenuously for the fight scenes and racing up those big mountains. A little information like that in the directors cut would have been interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie!","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. Daniel Day Lewis is a terrific actor, and the movie is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critique of this DVD edition, not the movie","review":"I was SHOCKED by the loss of some of the most memorable moments of this movie. With the exception of George Lucas chopping apart his original Star Wars trilogy, I typically trust director's editions. Imagine my surprise at the removal of character development with certain dialogue excised.What was Michael Mann thinking???This actually looked like a TV edit rather than an expanded vision from the director. This is an inferior portrayal of a personal favorite.How about a version that keeps ALL of it together? The theatrical elements AND the additional footage?I got this DVD on sale at retail with a free bottle of Coke. At least the Coke lived up to expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray Only- Dark and Yellow Tint!","review":"This Review applies to the Blu-ray release. I love this movie and as a movie would rate it at least a 4. However, this release has a very dark appearance (i.e. absence of light) in many scenes as if filmed under a heavy cloud cover. It also has a yellowish tint in many scenes. Increasing the brightness level by 100% on my professionally calibrated 65\\" plasma couldn't fix the lack of light issue and the yellow tint makes the film look old. If these problems are due to a poor HD mastering process, the disc should by recalled and a \\"fixed\\" version reissued. If due to the \\"directors intent\\" I think he screwed up. I don't appreciate a movie that looks like it was actually filmed in 1757 and kept in a box someplace until this release. To bad I gave my DVD version away in anticipation of the Blu-ray release."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies","review":"I couldn't pass up this movie for the price. They sell it regularly for $10. I got it on a Lightning deal for $5. Great movie for a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel Day Lewis is Phenomenal!","review":"This is a great movie. It helps people understand, somewhat, the plight of the Native Americans and how they (especially their women) were treated. I think Daniel Day Lewis was great in this movie. He is not feigning to be Native American in this film, (just in case you haven't read the book) but he pulls of the character well. I won't spoil the ending, but, as you know, love conquers all. Watch it. It was free with my Amazon Prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Favorite movie","review":"Love the movie, but I hate the director's cut version of the LotM.

The story does not really follow the book, but none the less is exciting and very viewable numerous times. On location scenery (North Carolina) and camera work is spectacular. Reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Version of a Beautiful Movie","review":"I agree with everything the majority of the other viewers have said.

It is a perfected mix of entertainment, storytelling, and cinematography"},{"rating":"1","title":"BluRay - Excellent director commentary, poorly presented color","review":"It's always good to hear Michael Mann talk about anything and the commentary here is excellent.However, the color in this BluRay presentation is not good. Much worse than the DVD and theater release. Darker, inaccurate, and unpleasant to the eye. There are exceptions. The officer uniforms and the flags at the surrender negotiations are in full magnificent color, but the surrounding scene is muted and ugly. The scene, early on, where the carriage crosses the BiltmoreEstate bridge, is so muted and so lacking in contrast as to be nearly unwatchable. What a shame. I'll stick with the DVD of this magnificent movie and be totally content. Skip the Blu-Ray edition is my recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing DVD - not recommended","review":"I would not recommend the DVD version of LOTM. It takes away the music, in some scenes where the music is critical, as well as some quips which were crucial to illuminating the characters. Also, the additional scenes, to my great surprise, did nothing to add to the film; indeed, they interrupted the general flow of the film and were rather annoying. Until I saw the DVD version of this film, I never thought editing was a much needed process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinematography extravaganza","review":"Another beautiful movie centered around Native American culture. Although a fictional movie it touches on some truths about history of these great peoples. This movie is romance mixed with adventure mixed with tragedy. Incredible cinematography, acting, scenery and soundtrack. Great song by Clannad. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen as yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie deserves better","review":"I don't know why the rest of the world was given the theatrical release of the film, while the U.S. got this mess. The expanded director's cut sounds really great, until you watch it and realize that it also has parts chopped out, and the parts added are missing the score. Unlike the fantastic job Jackson did with the Lord of the Rings movies, this director and studio really short changes the fans with this edition. They should have at least made it a double dvd with the consumers choice of which version they prefer."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks.","review":"Strangely I was watching this last night on tv, and I wasn't aware that it was a director's cut, it's been a while since I have seen the movie and I have some fuzzy memories. I thought that I was going crazy, some of the lines I remember weren't in the movie, the beautiful song was missing and the incredibly moving score didn't seem right. As the movie came to a conclusion I was wondering what happened to the stirring movie I remembered, apparently Michael Mann happened to it. Most of the time I love the new director's cuts of movies I have seen, usually they add to the movie explaining things that might have been left out. I cannot recall a movie that l liked so much in theaters and watched to death on VHS that I like less as a DVD. Truly a failure on the part of Fox and Mann, I will take the advice of another poster and get a copy from England."},{"rating":"1","title":"How was the \\"R\\" rated?","review":"There's absolutely no action in this film! The fight sequences looked like something Walt Disney and friends could have slapped together! I sat through the whole thing, awake, which, by the way is not easy, because not only does this thing have no action, the story's not very interesting, either. The acting is overly melodramatic and the film itself is entirely to LONG.For a good movie set in the same era that's also a lot cheaper, pick up The Patriot."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film is fantastic for its","review":"scenery, actors, actresses and soundtrack. The only complaint I have with the video I bought is black bars above and below the picture. My version is not listed as widescreen. The box has a statement that the movie is formatted to fit my screen, which usually means no black bars. I contacted Twentieth Century Fox, via email, about the bars and received no reply. Despite this annoyance, the movie still is well worth owning. Just be aware that when viewed it looks very similar to widescreen format; although, it's not supposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breathtakingly beautiful film","review":"This film was a real string to Daniel Day-Lewis' bow (no pun intended); having proved he could play every type of English character (from a toff in the Merchant-Ivory Forster-adaptation 'Room With A View' to a modern-day London punk in 'My Beautiful Launderette') he passes himself off admirably here as an American settler gone native: Hawkeye, the last of the Mohicans. Based on James Fenimore Cooper's comparatively dry and slow-moving novel of the same name, Michael Mann's film is a rousing, beautiful and romantic adaptation, with a buff Day-Lewis charming the winsome Madeleine Stowe and skilfully slaughtering his enemies in brutal hand-to-hand combat. This is one of the few Hollywood movies to incorporate history, romance and action so effectively. A very, very good DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece of adventure","review":"Frankly, I cannot think of anything that could possilby improve this movie. The acting by Daniel Day-Lewis is sincere and moving and brings the character of Hawkeye to life. Wes Studi as Magua is truly outstanding. How he did not garner best supporting actor is beyond me. He is a study in hatred and revenge and his scenes are riveting. Kudos also for Madeline Stowe and the French General whose name escapes me. Chingachgook, played by Russel Means is flawless. The story is timeles and the setting which is supposed to be upstate New York is actually North Carolina is stunning and beautifully filmed. What I found most outstanding is in the scenes where the action is building or in full fledged engagement the music hauntingly entraps you and surrounds the scene with absolute rapture. Last of the Mohicans is a first class adventure and will, to my mind, be a timeless masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"last of the mohicans","review":"top of the line video, a must see i have been very happy with the whole amazon experience.am always looking for new products movies etc. amazon suggests to me"},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"I Will Find You\\"","review":"I am very upset with this version of Last of the Mohicans.

I played a 13 inning game where the closer for the computer team came in the 8th inning and pitched for five innings. Not a very realistic thing.

Such a circumstance is unfortunate to say the least, but the resulting essays are informative, inspiring and downright funny.Beetner's writing style combines pointed humor and plain common sense in the best American story-telling tradition of Will Rogers and Mark Twain. There's a lot to be learned in this deceptively thin paperback. Fortunately, the reading experience is sufficiently pleasant to repeat as often as needed.I look forward to more work by Michael Beetner in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute!","review":"I bought this crab a couple years ago and I loved it then and I still do, but I noticed that the shell didn't look like the picture and the shell's bright blues and yellow-browns faded a LOT over these past couple of years.

Well, that's not true. What's nice is that they have a simple design to them, which should take no more than 3 minutes to build. The main feature is that by pushing a stick down in back, it'll make their left arm move up and down. That arm is also the one that holds their special staff.

There is nothing absolutely groundbreaking and shocking here.

Michael Moore was beating on the Democrats as much as the Gop. Kossacks where feeding on each other! This Administration got a free ride from the MSM from 9/11 on. No second guessing of WMD's, Chalabi and Curveball, No Questioning of the Patriot Act, Iraqui troops levels. No further investigation by MSM of Man-whore Gannon, Outing of Plame, any of Shrub's appointments of lobbyists to regulatory positions, special provisions in the bankruptcy bill for asset trusts, amendments to the Medicare bill disallowing price negotiations for the american people.

It would take A LOT more songs to really show off all sides of this truly talented artist. The songs do show how amazing and equally comfortable she was in a variety of settings---jazz trio, concert stage, orchestra, strings, or just a piano. My personal favorite is to hear her in an intimate setting with minimal accompaniment, and this CD has 'em as well. It gives the casual Sassy fan an idea how she sounded under various settings and make the choice what the preference is. What's amazing is how little Sarah's voice changed or deteriorated over the years---what a remarkable instrument she had, the likes we might never see again. This CD would give you an idea of her range and versatility, but the songs taken from her concerts---\\"I'll Be Seeing You\\" \\"Detour Ahead\\" and jazzy sides \\"Shulie A Bop\\" where she gets to improvise---are personal favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Vaughan, extraordinary songstress","review":"This CD is worth getting for the simple reason of her interpretation of songs : The Sweetest Sounds (the same song that Brandy sang in the Whitney Houston produced special, Cinderella) where Sassy sings beautifully; the World War II song, I'll Be Seeing You, where she sings so sweetly that you would think she would never see her lover ever again or a timeless interpretation of Smoke Gets In Your Eyes.

It is about the size of a mouse, only it's empty except for the squeaker. I put both squeakers in to make it fill out and squeak more easily.... it's tiny! It is good for a small dog puppy, not a larger breed puppy, unless it wants to play with something the size of a mouse. My dog gets very excited about toys but this was quickly abandonned after a little over 5 minutes. She's 13 lbs.

I gave it to my 17 lb corgi-jack Russell mix who had it destroyed within 30 minutes. She pulled the squeaker out of the \\"secure\\" pouch and it had to be taken away from her. There is no point to the extra squeaker since the toy is destroyed. The toy may have \\"less stuffing\\" than most but still enough to be pulled all over the room. She tore the limbs and ears off easily. I know my little dog is rough on toys, but this one was no better than the cheap toys at the grocery store.

'Sliver Nemesis' is no different then any other Doctor Who story in the late eighties: it's lame. The decay of this series after its peak during the Hinchcliffe era was a slow and progressive decay through odd stories to silly ones, cool Jack Kirby-esqe designs becoming camp Broadway costuming, dark backgrounds all became intensely lit giving away all elements of suspense and horror, and worst off they tried to make the side-kicks 'coooool'(the ultimate end time sign of any show). Buy this video at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last appearance of the original Cybermen","review":"This was one of the best adventures of the seventh Doctor.

A mysterious comet that falls to Earth. All three want it and it's up to the Doctor and Ace to stop them!Overall, it was a great ending to the original Cyberfleet and we also get an insite to the Doctor's \\"dark\\" past. A must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cybermen, you, again!","review":"\\"Don't worry we won't hurt you\\" How many times has the Doctor said something like that to people that don't belive him at first. The storyline has a few twists and turns and it has an ending that could give you a weird look if you're used to hearing the Doctor saying he'll never forfeit to someone. The fighting sequence was nicely done as the humans actually beat some of Cybermen because they finally figured out their weak point, gold. Also, if you need some humor listen for the line,\\"Hello I'm the Doctor and I belive you want to kill me.\\" Don't buy this if you don't like jazz cause you'll here a lot of it in this. The rest of the story is good, but you should know that the Doctor has some kind of relationship with Lady Peinforte and also the Nemesis statue. Overall Silver Nemesis is really good for a Doctor Who fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This CD is so wonderful! I like to listen to it especially while studying.

When the frames did arrive, I was very disappointed with the quality.

It's coverage was spotty with some select in-depth examples. As an example, the coverage of the RunCommand was two example statements: DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdWindowCascade and DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdOptions. The explanation for RunCommands was as short as the two commands.

Anyway, I enjoyed it greatly, and wish there were actors in today's Hollywood as skilled & fascinating as Yul Brynner and Charlton Heston.

However, that is only because I bought the kindle version and that cuts out the glossary and some other referance stuff but that was amazon not the book book so I don't mind to much.

Once again he out did himself with another reference book. This time it is for oils and such. A definate must have for your nature based library. Contains many essential oils and what they are used for. Best if used by someone who has a little backgroud with this type of religion. It is a great quick reference and has a very user friendly layout."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of The Best By Far from Scott Cunningham","review":"I've work with this book soooooo many times, that any other book on the subject seems..well...small.

A great reference and an easy read","review":"So happy with this book! It's an easy read if you are intending to read it cover to cover, but it's also great just to use as a reference. It has plenty of great recipes and the book is divided up in a way that makes it easy to just browse recipes and get ideas. I first picked it up trying to learn to make incense. I intended to just find a simple recipe, but ended up reading almost the whole book in one sitting. He also lists substitutions for herbs you may not have on hand or that may be difficult to find. I find that list very useful and reference it often when using other recipes as well. I'm a beginner to this sort of thing and i found it very easy to follow and very inspiring. But i can see this is a book i will keep handy even as i gain more experience and knowledge.

It saves you from wondering if you are being sold the real thing at the local Wiccan, Pagan, or Botanica store.

As always, Cunningham shows his great talent for writing a wonderful \\"how to\\" guide, and the reader discovers that he has many forms of spellcraft at his disposal. Describing everything from the making of different kinds of incense (combustible vs. non-combustible), soaps (solid vs. liquid), sachets (for the bath or otherwise), ointments, oils, powders, tinctures, inks, and salts, Cunningham covers every imaginable base. From which form of magical herb combination works best towards which purposes (uses of incenses vs. uses of ritual baths, for example), to notations about traditional use vs. modern use, to cautions against poison or bad-smelling combinations, to recipes for a wealth of different purposes. For anyone who likes doing it all themselves, this book is a godsend. I use this book quite frequently as a starting point for ideas and as a general reference.

Spinrad proposes three social forces in conflict - the Hegemony, the Democratic League, and the \\"chaotic\\" Brotherhood of Assassins - and populates each with two-dimensional stick-figure heroes and villains. It's ok if you are into lasgun assaults under plasteel domes on Mercury, but it's not the philosophical conflict of ideas that it pretends to be. No way it was \\"the great science-fiction novel now an underground classic in colleges all across America\\".At times it can be just ridiculous; for example, when the first intersteller probe comes back from Cygnus 61, everyone sits around waiting for the film to come back from the lab. And a secret agent travels to Mercury under cover as a business man deciding whether to relocate his desk calculator manufacturing plant there, as if that makes economic sense.

Now I can't switch between the two trays. Initially this was not a huge problem because we could still manually pull the 4x6 tray in and out. However, now after I've replaced an ink cartridge, it requires printing to 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper for callibration and won't recognize that I've pulled the 4x6 tray out.

We know what it is and we know what we're in for, a teenage cop-com that is just for a bit of light entertainment.Cody Banks is a run of the mill teenage heroine, the story is standard Hollywood, though is a bit interesting. Hannah Spearritt has a paltry role that seems mainly to serve the purpose of having a pretty girl in the movie.

The Zi/o ball has panels that are starting to peel slightly (not peeling severely but the black underneath the orange panels is visible on two panels) after about 8 months of rare use. And the tacksoft looks like I've been playing with it for multiple years, after about 2 months of heavy use.Both the Zi/O and the Tacksoft seem like good bargains for INDOOR balls and have great grips, but they aren't made for outdoor use cause the grip wears quickly on both balls. Spalding needs to step its game up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow went waaay down hill, total crap!!","review":"I have purchased this ball before, a few years ago. And have tried several different ones throughout the years. This ball used to be a good top of the line outdoor ball. From day one the panels started coming up at the seams, I tried to ignore it for the most part. Also has a fake feel to the skin itself, channels are not too deep, and the grip itself gets slippery pretty easy. I have played for about 20 years, and have a pretty good feel for the game, primarily run PG and SG on the court so the feel of the ball is important to me as it is for many other players. I did not attempt to return this ball, I put a blade in it to end the misery, and so noone else would have to use such a crap ball.Should note that the previous ball I purchased was great, it lasted a long time and had a good feel.

To those who advocate it, may I quote a figure from the past: GET A LIFE! No, we're not helping each other too much; that's, believe me, the least of our worries.Speaking of the past, the concept of \\"co-dependency\\" is getting to be a bit of an anachronism. It was a product of the 1980s, the self-help decade. If you want to read a more valuable comment on that era and its \\"movements\\" and cult gurus, I recommend \\"Selling Serenity\\" by a guy who worked for the publisher who made the self help fads into household expressions. It's true, and much more fun than the self-pity of this co-dependency noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"a great book","review":"I recommend this book to every woman or person who feels obligated to help others.

First, Carol joined AA and got that weird smug look on her face - instead of going out and being with her real friends, she became addicted to the meetings! If she got upset because she was late for work, suddenly her \\"alcoholism\\" was to blame. By the way, I only saw her drunk twice in the two years we went out - hardly an alcoholic, although definitely not too tightly wrapped.Then, she decided she was codependent, and of course so was I, and now she had more pseudo-science to spout. She became unbearable and I dumped her ass. She still doesn't follow through on any plans, she still is inconsiderate and rude - these cult beliefs haven't done anything but given her all kinds of made up diseases to take responsibility for her bad actions.Glad I have moved on and don't have to read this silly stuff anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful!

It was suggested that I read it again by a psychologist because I am going through a divorce from a man that doesn't express his emotions well. At 40, the reading this time took me to the GATES OF HELL! I started questioning myself and who I actually was. It took my best friend to remind me that I wasn't all the things that my STBX was saying I was. His goal is to hurt me anyway that he can.

Additionally, I don't like Beattie's overall philosophy, extracted from work with alcoholism, that once Codependent, Always Codependent.A better foundation for beginning to work through these issues has been one of continually self-awareness, healing and breaking old codependent habits.Instead of Beatie, I would recommend Breaking Free From the Codependency Trap, which provides a brief overview of codependency, but incredibly practical solutions for individuals, couples, therapy sessions and group therapy.Breaking Free of the Co-Dependency Trap"},{"rating":"2","title":"Codependent No More","review":"Finding myself a soon to be divorced woman and mother of four, I entered counseling and after one session, this book was recommended to me.

The relationship I had with myself was the first one I needed to look at. Realizing my behavioral addictions - was one of the most baffling areas of life - I am the only one who can help myself, by hearing myself and following the advise of others. This book helps. It's the effort I put into my own recovery - by reading, working and following the activities in this book. Life does not have to be the terrifying world it was. Life is a process.

My son got it from his church library, and loaned it to me.It was the most inspiring book I had read for some time. How very true that we worry and fret about so many little things, forgetting that we do not have to--we make so little difference in making our own decisions. We tend to forget that our lives are always in God's hands. And we think we are wiser than God?In reading this book, I have been trying to drop some of the baggage that I have been carrying around. And,how comforting it is to rely on Him for guidence.I have recommended it to so many of my friends, and they in turn have passed it on, and on, etc.This is truly a reminder to renew our beliefs in what our life really means. And, don't we all need that once in a while?God's blessings to all, and PASS IT ON!

Jesus is quite simply the most transcendently important figure in the history of theology. Moslems, Christians of all variety, Bahai, Torah Observant Messianic Jews all consider the religious inspiration of Jesus manifest. At least as significant, great moral leaders and thinkers from Spinoza (who considered Jesus the greatest of all Jewish prophets) to Schweitzer (who began the study for the historical Jesus) did not doubt for a moment the unique spiritual importance of Jesus.One other online reviewer noted the famouns C.S. Lewis analysis that Jesues was either insane, evil, or divine. It is not necessary to go that far (Moslems and several Messianic Jewish groups simply consider Jesus a great prophet).

The ancient Mediterranean world of Alexander the Great and Augustus Caeser comes to life vividly under the spell of Cahill's pen. We understand the world that Jesus of Nazereth better because we understand the politics and culture of the period.I was raised on the Christian gospels but never before understood them and their writers as I have come to understand them after reading this book. Jesus, Peter, Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, and Paul became \\"real\\" people to me.Even if you are not a Christian or have rejected the doctrine of Jesus, you come away from this book with a new respect for his message and its effect on the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"About What I Expected (sigh)","review":"This is a pretty sorry attempt at describing the life and times of Jesus.

But, not here; I have read a few of his books. This is by far his most boring one."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor scholarship","review":"Not well researched.

Terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Place to Start -- And Then Go Deeper","review":"I've read Desire of the Everlasting Hills three times now, and gotten more out of it each time.

Very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight for any reader","review":"I just want to respond to the reader in Branson, MO who suggests that this book is theologically unsound. He obviously did not read the book. For instance, although Cahill does state that Christ is present in all people, he also presents strong evidence for the bodily resurrection of Christ. I loved the book and would recommend it for Christians and non-Christians alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profound","review":"This is the answer to all those questions most people had as they questioned the Christian messasge as presented by the established church.

I am going to order several copies for my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good at times, but overall disappointing","review":"After his enthralling and splendid first book in this series, How the Irish Saved Civilization, I could not wait for more. However, in the second book, The Gift of the Jews, Cahill had a fantastically rich and important story to tell, but his writing did not match up to his first effort. I really am sorry to say that the decline inthe quality of the second book continues here. Again, Cahill's topic is of unsurpassing importance but his writing does not meet expectations. I still think he is a very talented writer, but I think in these last two books he is having trouble in deciding exactly what he wants to say"},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd best","review":"Cahill is a fine writer but I thought Philip Yancey's \\"The Jesus I Never Knew\\" actually achieved what Cahill attempted and failed at here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and fascinating","review":"This book was an excellent read that I could hardly put down.

Too much of his writing is merely quoting sources. Actually it is rather boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cahill version of Bible","review":"I found the book to be annoying and had a hard time finishing it. It felt like World History 101 sprinkled with some of Cahill's own personal bible translations. Jesus speaking of the \\"S____hole?\\" Hello, hello, Cahill, you say that's the literal translation?? For all the pretentious sophistry, I never got the sense that Cahill has a clue what Jesus and the atonement, or Judiasm for that matter, are really all about. If you want to learn what the New Testament has to say, pull out your old fashion King James version and read and ponder for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book doesn't measure up to the title","review":"I am glad I didn't buy the book - I borrowed it. Cahill is in over his head. For example, he states that Jesus taught us to be kind and love one another and for this he lost his life. Earth to Cahill - Jesus lost his life because he said he was the \\"one who was to come\\" in response to the High Priest's question regarding his identity. By this he meant that he was the Messiah. Had he said \\"no\\" he would have walked out a free man. This is just one misrepresentation. Another is his discussion on \\"looking at women lustfully\\" - Cahill totally misses the point. Jesus' immense influence on history is an excellent topic and if you are interested buy Kennedy's \\"What if Jesus had never been born\\". Don't waste your money on this book.R. C. Lewis"},{"rating":"1","title":"debunking the hills","review":"I haven't read tcahill for many moons but I remember ranking him on a level with Cruise O Connors the UN guy who made the Congo mess even bloodier and turned to pontification and/or self aggrandizzement.

Normally, when I describe the life of Jesus, I avoid use of the F-word, but I guess this is Mr. Cahill's preference. But even more importantly, Cahill takes the time to talk about the Savior genitals. I apologize for the blunt nature of my review, but if Amazon can sell a book that mentions it, I should be able to talk about it in my review. Never has a book left me with such a violated and angry feeling as this book. I could not even finish the book, which is rare for me. So Mr. Cahill, how do intent to explain yourself on judgement day?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Desire of the Everlasting Hills","review":"For someone like me, who has always looked at the church and religion with disdain, and therefore largely ignored it, this book surprised me -- it fully engaged my mind and heart. Cahill took a subject both enormous and detailed, and distilled it down to its purest ideas and neatest plot line, and did it like a novelist, not a historian. The book is a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"This is neither the desire of the everlasting hills nor the wishful thinking of the desperate, ignorant valleys. Mr. Cahill's enhancements and speculations are based on what? No clue here! Who was Jesus? Who the hell is Mr. Cahill?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glimpse of Jesus's World","review":"This book is an interesting look at the cultures, people, languages, and events that shaped the world around Jesus. From the influence of Alexander the Great and the Greeks on the Jews to the personalities and writing styles of Jesus's early followers, many intriguing influences are discussed. While not comprehensive, Cahill's mostly-secular work is both engaging and accessible."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL FOR A NEWBIE TO CHRISTIAN HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF JESUS","review":"This book was a wonderful introduction to the world of historical Jesus. I loved the way Thomas Cahill prepares for Jesus's story by giving a short but important history lesson on what was occuring at the time. For someone new to the world of historical accounts of Jesus, this book was everything I wanted it to be. It helped me to connect a face to the name Jesus. I also enjoyed how Cahill shows the different accounts of Jesus as written by the gospels. Each separate account reveals a side of Jesus that everyone can relate to. I would recommend it to anyone searching for more knowledge about Jesus Christ and his legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the close minded","review":"Well I am sure that if you only accept orthodox theology, this book will either scare you or enrage you. This book succeeds brilliantly in detailing the history and customs of the \\"times of Jesus\\". Definitely informative and entertaining.The kind of book that opens up new levels of investigation for a \\"spiritual detective\\". Great book....highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging. Makes You Want to Read More","review":"The most wonderful aspect of this great book is that Cahill invites the reader to explore further with other writers who have been more 'scholarly' about this topic, in particular Raymond E. Brown's work on the New Testament. Additionally, Mr. Cahill is a terrific wordsmith. He knows how to engage you, move you, help you understand. His analysis of the four gospels and their particular distinctions are very well done. One can appreciate the differences between Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John without getting hysterical about their inconsistencies. He addresses the tough questions of Christianity and does a nice, even handed job. There is nothing offensive about this book at all, regardless of your denomination. In particular, the section concerning the Apostle Paul and his life as a spreader of the \\"Good News\\" is inspiring and helps one understand the political and religious atmosphere of the first century A.D. For that alone, this book is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Now have all the Thomas Cahill Hinges of History books and, although a little heavier reading, all are wonderful.

I was very disappointed with the system for a few reasons. One reason was the DVD player. If you are buying this system to play dvds, you may want to reconsider.The Ps2 dvd player misses many options- it is devoid of the ability to always switch the screen ratio of a movie.Another reason I was disappointed with the system is the price. For the price, I expected a system with much better graphics- the graphics are not spectacular- only a very small step up from dreamcast(and even dc beats ps2 in some areas). Plus all extra controllers and peripherials are very priceyThe last reason is the speed, the ps2 seems really slow to load.Other than that the games are pretty good, I recommend GT3, Twisted Metal, Red Faction"},{"rating":"2","title":"ignore alalusts review","review":"Check his other reviews he has just gone around slagging off PS2 while raving about Dreamcast in the same review. Definitely has an axe to grind. PS2 is a good system and this is the game that really shows what it can do. GT3 isn't perfect though. Despite what you may have read, only two players in multi-player mode (reviews mentioned four AI cars). Less weird cars than in GT2, and much harder to proceed than in GT2. Still, a very good game though, and this is a good bundle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying anymore","review":"Aside from Gran Turismo 3 and Twisted Metal Black, all of Playstation 2's killer franchises are going over to XBOX. Plus, XBOX has a total of 40 1st and 2nd party studios making exclusive games for it, along with massive 3rd party support that eclipses even PS2's support. If you are looking for a console this christmas, look to the XBOX for superior graphics, better DVD playback, high definition gaming, builtin broadband adapter for internet gaming, 4 ports without the need for a multitap, hard drive for saving games instead of memory cards and for storing your own personal game soundtracks on, and realtime DD5.1 all for the same price as a PS2!

Get It Together is a fun, funky collection of lounge and soul tunes from a very talented singer, songwriter, musician and arranger. On tunes like \\"All in My Mind\\" and \\"Love Train\\" (not the O'Jays classic) Mr. Belasco has the Curtis Mayfield vibe down perfectly. Other songs are more straight forward pop, but just as enjoyable. My only disappointment is that there are a few instrumentals included. They are good songs, but Mr. Belasco has such an interesting voice I want to here him singe on every song. This CD is highly recommended and I hope it does become available on download someday as I have to believe it would help give him more exposure which he richly deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still enjoying it, two years later...","review":"This is the typical album that doesn't go out of fashion (sorry Spice girls, Britney Spears and Take that Fans ! ).

I tried to correct it by manually adjusting each individual settings but nothing worked. The picture quality was not too bad in bright conditions, but in darker conditions i was not prepared to just accept it. After all I spent AUD$1450 on a camera and I'd better get what I pay for. It was a shame because the size and shape of the 520 was really good plus some nice features too. Anyway I took it back to the shop and bought the Sony TRV18 instead.

It is a revelation to hear them bring to life these melodies and changes by Herbie Hancock, especially when you think about how Herbie's music is usually identified with keyboards and then realize that there is not a keyboard to be found on this recording--just trumpet (Payton), guitar (Whitfield), and bass (McBride). This is music you can listen to over and over again, and it just keeps growing on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the original","review":"I have just received this CD.

We used them to hang bikes, car racks and sports equipment in our home's office, and the installation, finishing and modularity all made for a great look (if a little cluttered by our stuff!) The metal frame (what the modular parts actually attach to) is sturdy, easy to mount, and does not flex. The plastic covers are solid as well, and I imagine you could paint them to match, if necessary. All the modular hooks and mounts are very strong as well, and we were able to hang my tank of a downhill bike along with our road bikes without flinching.Installation is simple, drill pilot holes for the self-anchoring screws (or use studs), and attach the metal frame. Then slide the plastic cover on, and start storing your stuff!If you are deciding between a dedicated bike rack, and this, I really suggest this, it can be re-purposed to do another job when you decide to move, or need to hang something besides bikes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Wall Hooks","review":"I would buy single wall hooks instead.This one is okay, but it can get expensive when you buy all the various attachments for the track.A little bit of a pain to install if your wall studs don't match up to the holes on the track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers as Advertised","review":"Fits on my antenna and makes the car easier to find in crowded parking lot.Fits snuggly on the antenna and looks good.Has a string attached...I guess if you just want to hang it someplace, but the string is useless if you put it on an antenna (scissors fix the extra string thing).Certainly worth the cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but I had to","review":"This AMAZING one-star review is my personal protest against authors (publishers?) who use descriptive adjectives about the quality of the book IN THE BOOK'S TITLE!

Not all are dancible for West Coast Swing, but Midnite Hour and Toughen Up get my feet going, and for a slower blusier groove try Take Me Back Baby. A couple of excellent Lindy Hop songs are Honey Dew and Caldonia. I bought this along with American Music Texas Style and they make a great combination (a lot of the same musicians on both cd's). Both cd's are full of great dancing music, so get them both. If you're a fan of big band jazz and swing this is guaranteed to make you very happy, these are two of the best cd's in my collection, and if my house was on fire I'd run inside to grab them !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but","review":"I second the reviews below. This is a 5-star movie, but the quality of this transfer is horrible. Parts of the movie are very scratchy and full of film debris. Worst yet, to me, are the subtitles. They are laughable. Almost every subtitle contained some error. While it was (sorta) fun to laugh and the odd subtitles, that tended to remove me emotionally from the film. Too bad.

Sadly, the only DVD release was the long out of print cropped US disc, which was not worth the hundreds of dollars it sold for on e-bay, or a reportedly dreadful import from China. When I heard it was getting a new release I was extremely excited, and pre-ordered it immediately. \\"It can't be worse than the alternatives\\", I thought. How wrong I was :( This DVD release (along with Raise The Red Lantern from the same company) is simply one of the worst DVDs I have ever seen - and I've seen some of the worst the format has to offer. How any company can justify releasing such a shoddy product is beyond me - it must take some effort to make the film look even worse than it does on VHS or the import from China. Amazon should refuse to sell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Film--Rotten DVD","review":"As the Chinese government wants to supress Yimou's work for it's less than idyllic portrayal of China, they couldn't have a better partner in crime than MagicPlay Entertainment.

I wanted to purchase this microscope for my son for Christmas so I placed an order and waited for a response.

I ended up having to go with a different microscope from another vendor with a steeper shipping charge since Christmas was so near. Thanks for nothing Shopzeus."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I had the same problem with ShopZeus as another reviewer. We were disappointed in the microscope. It is technically a fine microscope but after you look at the 5 sample slides, what then? There is nothing that can be used to make more slides, you'd have to buy that separately. I hit a dead end trying to return it. There needs to be a number provided by ShopZeus before you can return anything. I emailed asking for this number and never heard back. Amazon replied promptly to my help request and refunded the money but asked that I return the item to ShopZeus. I couldn't find an address for the company on their website, Amazon's website or the box. What a pain. Take a look at Eye-Clops. It was a great hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sooooo happy with this microscope!!!","review":"We are using this microscope as amateurs - for general curiousity and eventually for homeschooling - and it has been just wonderful. It is also much easier to use than I remember my high school microscope being 25 years ago.This scope is easy to focus and use (although I hesitate to let my 6 and 8 year old focus it at 40x due to the risk of cracking a slide), and it has bright lighting, crystal clear images, and sturdy metal construction!!I initially balked at the price tag, but after the kids received an inexpensive scope that was terribly frustrating for them because they couldn't get a clear image (it had a mirror underneath that you had to move to reflect light), I decided to purchase this one.This is such a timeless gift. And $100 spread across the next 10 years and three kids is really quite a good value!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for a GOOD inexpensive Microscope?","review":"I've bought several other inexpensive microscopes to do some examinations at home.I breed dogs and frankly need this for breeding purposes.I cannot express how much better this product is that any others I've tried.The microscope is easy to use, extremely sturdy (most of it is NOT plastic). It doesn't tip, has an electric light which gives MORE than adequate lighting. The focus knob is large and easy to use (altho it does shift a bit occasionally). The images seen have exceptional clarity.It only comes with a few sample slides (which are SUPER to look at) so you might want to purchase some blank slides and stains, etc, separately.If you're looking for a really good, inexpensive microscope for an adult or child's home use, this is your best choice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners","review":"All Metal construction, decent objective lenses, integrated light source, fine and coarse focus knobs, a small specimen kit, and a very good price all add up to make this an outstanding purchase for the budding scientist.This microscope would do well in a high school lab or even as a solid backup in an undemanding college lab.I bought one for a twelve year girl, and she has no idea how to use it, but she's willing to try, especially since we know it will WORK unlike the plastic garbage being sold in the sub-hundred dollar range.This is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome microscope","review":"I think that this is an awesome deal.

It came off and broke before I could use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived in unusable condition","review":"(...) The microscope is metal which I like however it arrived unusable. I can't comment on the optics because I can't see anything through the lens--very disapointing. Amazon on the other hand is great, they are already sending me a replacement. I hope that this was a fluke and that I will be satisfied with the replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality","review":"This was purchased for my son's 13th birthday. I had looked at microscopes in the $25-50 range, figuring it would get beat up quickly, so why spend very much. A store had one of those cheaper ones set up, and I was very disappointed in the brightness and distortion at the edges, and it felt cheap. So, I jumped up another notch and purchased the My First Lab microscope for 90 bucks. For about twice the price, this thing is 100 times better! It is very bright and completely free of distortion. The eyepiece is easy to look into with a wide field (compared to some where it was impossible to hold your head still enough to peep through). We've looked a all sorts of things, but the most fun is to put a few leaves and a sprinkle of dirt into some water, let it sit a few days, and then look at a drop under the scope. Little critters swimming everywhere! My kids can't get enough of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great microscope for a kid!","review":"Santa brought this microscope for our eight year old daughter who is a bigfoot enthusiast. Don't ask. Anyway I was not sure she would dig this, since she never asked for one, and honestly she did not know what a microscope is. Christmas morning it was a hit. She loved looking at the premounted slides, and found them exciting. She asked, \\"Can we see germs with this?\\" When she learned she could she wanted to make slides of germs. (bacteria). It has red and blue staining to do gram staining. WOW, reminds me of when I took microbiology class!! It also has more lens paper than you would ever need.My daughter now collects bigfoot evidence in the woods behind us and looks at it under the microscope. Her search team have compiled enough evidence and they officially announced to their second grade class that bigfoot is real.

If I had to compile a list of the Top 10 West Coast psych albums, KAK-OLA would be on it, right along with the best of the Airplane, the Dead, QMS and Love. Derivative? Sometimes, but who cares?

The highlight of this CD has to be track #8 \\"TRIEULOGY\\". Overall great, catchy psych! Also check out AORTA & OXFORD CIRCLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recomended..!!!","review":"Simply put, this is a good album. Historians and completists will note that this was the group Gary Yoder was in before Blue Cheer, and indeed, much of this album sounds like later Blue Cheer, and I mean that in a good way! The later Blue cheer Albums were a forum for Gary Yoder's songwriting, and he wrote some good ones. Kak also had Chris Lockheed on drums, who later played on the legendary (and very rare) solo LP 'Population II' by Randy Holden, another Blue Cheer alumnus. Kak were often accused of being a bit 'derivitive' but that doesn't bother me if the influences are good ones. (Quicksilver, Moby Grape..etc...) They were considered a 'second string' SF band, and often were an opening act for the above mentioned groups. Buy this..you'll like it!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Kak is straight forward rock from the late 1960s. It has a unmissable garage twinge.But the playing and the arrangements here are more fleshed out than on your average garage album.

He's just a guy in the right place at the right time. The right ancestry couldn't have hurt. Wireman's the son of the president of the solar system., not that it means much on Alpha Centaur. It seems Earth and the solar system are under \\"Invader\\" control. The only thing his father presides over is a government in exile that the centurians could care less about. Then one day the situation changes...since I didn't see a synopsis provided by Amazon (unusual) I'll copy it down here: Wireman came back to a vanquished Earth on a mission to save it.

The lack of music videos is a bit of a sore point with this DVD, but it is still worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"extensive footage","review":"If you love the Foo, then this DVD gives it to you. Tours everywhere with bonus footage at the end. Not as well shot as some of their more recent dvds, but the sound is great and it is well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"After years of waiting.....a true dissapointment","review":"I know that title sounds a little negative but I have some good reasons for it. I'll start off with the good points about the video. It was nice to see the recent live concerts like the one from Toronto. I also like the way that there was a variety of songs on there such as Weenie Beenie, I haven't seen them play that live since 97. Although, I found it dissapointing because the live footage was only very recent (I would loved to have seen some older stuff on there). Also, I did not like the way they did not include any music videos. I have always thought that the Foo Fighters always have great music videos. It would have been ideal to have a two disc set- one live 95-03 and the other made up of music videos and maybe some more behind the scenes stuff. After being a Foo fan since the beginning and seeing them 6 times in concert since then, I was extremely dissapointed with the material on the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Amazing DVD.. but i'm biased","review":"This DVD is now the best DVD i own... but most likely because i am in it! i was at the toronto show on july 7 2003 and thats whre the majority of the DVD was shot. along with an acoustic set in washington d.c., few songs from slane castle in dublin and an audio version of their first show in reykjavik, iceland. although the DVD lacks professionality, it shines in the area of good tunes. especially dave's solo acoustic material. but overall, toronto is the greatest part of the DVD. i showed up 6 hours early and was front row the entire show. it was a hell of an experience and i urge every other foo fan to experience it through this excellent DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could it BE more confusing? And what's up with the SECRET Ireland footage?","review":"Navigating this DVD is confusing as hell. Aside from that, the music is great, video quality is excellent. Audio on DC and Slane is awful...it's like someone has turned the volume up to 11 on a bad little boom box. All in all, though, it's jam packed with good Foo stuff.DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE THE \\"BONUS\\" CONCERT? I was copying the contents of the DVD into iTunes so I could view it on my iPod, and I found and extra section on the disc containing 35 minutes of concert footage in Ireland...Dave's got a button-down green shirt on, and he keeps talking about The Hives in between songs...the footage is not mentioned or listed anywhere on the DVD's menu, and not accessible using a DVD player, or DVD playing software on the computer...it's weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love the Foo Fighters to death but this DVD just didn't do it for me. The live concert in Toronto (which takes up most of the live footage) just didn't have very good sound quality. Also, as others have mentioned, half of the live songs are \\"audio-only\\", accompanied by a slow-moving slideshow of concert photos. Why?! Finally, I think it would have added a lot to the DVD if some other bonus materials like interviews, footage of the band not on stage, and their song videos were included. Overall it was definitely a disappointment...better production next time?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is not worth your time or money.","review":"very watered down book, just common sense, nothing remarkable.

I have some left over Sealed Lead acid batteries from a project. So I bought 2 of these 12 V CFL bulbs. They screw into a normal household light fixture (but never do that to an existing fixture which of course is 120VAC.) So I used a cheap basement drawstring bulb fixture, wired it to the 12 V 10 Amphour battery. When the power went out - huricane Irene, click- and there was so much light we did not need to use any candles or flashlights. This stayed bright for over five hours until the power was restored.

Recording quality is good rather than perfect, with a slight edge to Coleman's sax sound, but this is a minor issue which doesn't interfere with the music, and as this is a live set quite understandable.This is a fine chance to hear Coleman's every nuance, something that can get a bit lost in some of his other latter day ensembles, and he certainly seems on top form here.Kuhn's distinctive style ranges from tuneful jazz to Messian like abstraction, he has no problems playing alongside Ornette.The two work together well, and produce a music with a simple beauty on the outside and a deep expressiveness within.Serious listening if you have the time, perhaps not the ideal backdrop for a dinner party (try it though), but then if you're reading this that's probably not what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great non-Pumice Hand Soap","review":"I wrote this only to clarify that the review by Elaine George from 2007 is not accurate.

These graphics may add white space, making the book less intimidating to the green reader, but this is a specialized topic for a specialized audience, which doesn't need such pedestrian graphics.

They will experience Svejk, a character for the ages who deserves his place along Falstaff or Don Quixote, as the author Hasek deserves his place along satirists like Swift and Rabelais.This original drawings that accompany the text in every edition I have seen are wonderful.

This is at the head of the list. Not only is it the funniest and cleverest novel I've read, it does so in a translation from the native Czech. If you can read this and not laugh, you need to see a physician, because you may be dying or possibly dead already."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say about Svelk, who bumbles his way through WWII","review":"All I can say is that this book will take you away. It will keep you laughing well into the night (which is how I tried to read it) Holding back the laughter so you don't wake anybody up. Although maybe you should, they probably could use it. And while they're at it, get something to drink, because there's plenty of it in this book! Actually a very cleverly disguised but all too true observation of politics and personalities, this book will get you knowing exactly what the author is telling you. But knowing, and not thinking, because you follow Svelk...and if he thought about something, he probably wouldn't have made it through the way. I recommend this book to anyone who seeks the light-hearted or the witty, and everyone in between. As long as you like to roar with laughter"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Profoundly Hilarious Study Of Humanity","review":"This is one of those books that you can never get enough of and it always amazes you with its simplicity and originality. The book is like an endless gallery of human characters lost and exposed by the turmoil of the war. It is a comedy of words and situations, yet it is also in a way the revenge of the small people against the big mindless \\"system.\\" It is the ultimate guide to not taking the world seriously. It is unbeleivably enjoyable. It helps of course if you are eastern european makes it easier to recognize and identify. But still the greatest book ever if I had to choose one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good Soldier Svejk and His Misfortunes...","review":"Perhaps one of the most comical books and best acerbic political satires ever conceived, this book is utterly permeated with sarcasm and the farcical adventures of the \\"good\\" soldier Svejk. Putting the defects of the Austria-Hungarian empire into the limelight Jaroslav Hasek hillariously dethrones them. It is a weeping shame however that the novel has not been completed as it quietly dies shrouding the rest of Svejk's adventures in mystery. Also, one might say that the \\"toilet humour\\" and sarcasm together with the convenient misadventures become somewhat monotonous and cliche after the first 300-400 pages. And yet, despite its weaknesses and length, \\"The Good Soldier Svejk and His Fortunes in WWI\\" undisputably deserve your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't imagine a better anti-war book","review":"The obvious objection is: what about Catch-22? Yes, but that protagonist's motives are quite clear. Svejk, though, is hard to figure out - and here's the beauty of it - because he is so shallow. It's Hasek's way of exposing the hypocrisies of authoritarianism. That sounds too bookish. He pokes fun at everything. So why only four stars? The translation is difficult to warm up to, especially in the dialogue. Nevertheless, I encourage you to read this book, and perhaps even model yourself after Svejk. Anti-hero? Think again. Or don't (think again, that is), and see if the outcome is any different. That, I believe, is Hasek's point."},{"rating":"2","title":"clinical pharmacology by Laurence,Bennet&Brown.","review":"An excellent book.I have been teaching clinical pharmacology from this book to paramedics,undrgraduate and postgraduate students without the need to consult bigger textbooks or reference books. It is to the point,giving the clinician/student what he wants without spending long hours in the library. My congratulations to the authors for writing such an excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most unsatisfactory","review":"2 major zings.The versions of the songs were greatly simplified.

Definately worth buying!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good practical coverage","review":"If you are interested in how wireless works there are other books. I hesitate to say it but there are even better books. Where you get your moneys worth with this item is its down to earth coverage of all the areas you really need to think about.When you design your network, lets face it, you don't care about the frequency characteristics, you want to know about security and running your implications. I liked the Wireless Internet because it gave exactly that kind of information. It doesn' waste words. Its very condensed but still extremely readable and doesn' miss any important pieces.Ive read a few other books in this space. Some have interesting parts but they all manage to miss the boat. This is the only one I have seen to cover the bases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as the Title Suggests","review":"This book is all you need to know about the wireless Internet, covering everything from radio signaling to devices and applications.Rhoton has a talent for explaining complex topics at about the right level - the discussion is easy to understand, but not too elementary. If you have something to do with wireless data, I recommend you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate source for mobility","review":"The Wireless Internet Explained is well worth the money. Mr. Rhoton has made an invaluable contribution to the new economy with a very readable book that explains, in very plain English, all aspects of wireless technologies. The book flows smoothly enough for you to read it at the beach, but it contains so much critical information that you should bring it back to your office. The most compelling parts point out the differences between mobile applications and their traditional counterparts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Considering all the positive press surrounding this film, I had high expectations. I ended up disappointed. I could barely stay awake - and the movie's only 90 minutes long. The much-ballyhooed opening shot of Natalie Portman is underwhelming. Six minutes of her crying, with a soundtrack like a Middle East version of \\"I Know An Old Lady...\\" left me shaking my head. The only good thing about that opening scene is that there are only about 84 minutes to go! I didn't find any of the three main characters very engaging, and I didn't find the cliched \\"cultures clash, try to get along, and ultimately end up bickering again\\" motif particularly enlightening. The packaging says the movie is 93 minutes long; I was actually glad the credits started rolling after about 85 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the story - hated the download","review":"The download was not readable all the way through. I like to read at night with the letters in white and a dark background and it wouldn't allow me to do that all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"This video was a waste of time. If you are looking for the classic cartoon shorts, then this is not the video for you. You only see clips; there are no complete cartoons on this video. Save yourself some time and money and pass this one by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mickey is magic","review":"I remember renting the video when I was five. I loved the cartoons, especialy Thru the Mirror, as my favourite Disney classic is Alice in Wonderland. It's a shame it hasn't been re-released on video in England. I hope it does come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real gem among romantic comedies","review":"Despite being a romantic comedy, this is not your average chick flick. It is free of the saccharin sentimentality that makes many such movies unpalatable to most men (and to me.) Quirky and surprising, this movie will make you cackle with laughter if you are willing to immerse yourself, even momentarily, in its magic fate-driven atmosphere. This has a beautiful, old-fashioned feel to it, in the vein of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\"--sweet but edgy. Though the characters are somewhat lacking in depth, they are not in charm. Timothy Hutton is quite yummy as the brainy and ironic professor, and Maria Grazia is both charismatic and unfairly sexy. Skip the big-budget Hollywood dross and indulge in this understated and memorable treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Really Bad Movie","review":"I bought this DVD because the story sounded interesting, and because I really liked Timothy Hutton in Ordinary People. This movie is really stupid, low budget, and silly. It's just so unrealistic and dull.Save your money and order a good DVD such as Ordinary People. You'll regret buying this movie. It's just as bad or even worse than that Stanley Kubrick film Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise starred in a few years ago. Utterly forgettable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is a great Toy","review":"I got this scooter for my 9 year daughter a year ago. She never have any problem with it.

Before it broke, it was alot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressive","review":"I had to return it the next day, got error message saying to remove and reinstall tape....found tape to be partialy stuck in camera upon removal...damaging expensive tape...not cool! This happened every time a tape was inserted. I only managed to get 20 mins of recording in before this happened. I did like the quality of the still pictures, much improved over my GRDVL510.The 510 has not been without problems ....frequent head cleaning notices.. not to mention the pixelated images. I was using JVC tapes and was advised by JVC to switch brands ...now using Sony..so far ..so good.I have to say my 8 year old Sony 8mm handycam still works and has never required a head cleaning. I should have stayed with Sony products...You live ..You learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but could be better","review":"I sold my mavica camera to get this because it has a digital camera built in, but even though the pixels are the same, teh quality is not. Also, it is a pain to find where you left off taping, but other than those two things, it is a great camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb Ergonomics, Terrible Audio","review":"This looked like a great camcorder in the store. It was easy to use, the buttons in all the right places. As soon as I bought one and it arrived, I realized my mistake. The camcorder has a constant buzz when you start using the DV tape to record or playback. This buzz is recorded onto the tape, since it seems to come from the tape motor which is unfortunately very close to the right audio channel.Video quality was decent with only a slight washout of colors. The Night Alive feature was pretty useless, with bad focus and poor color; however, the front light was nice for low-light conditions. Zoom was smooth and well-positioned.The 3.5\\" LCD was VERY nice. I'm definitely hooked on that feature.I'm going to try the next model up, the GR-DVL920U, to see if it has the buzz problem, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"User friendly but Poor images","review":"This camcorder is user friendly with many great functions but, unfortunately, performes poorly in low-light situations or while shooting indoors with poor color reproduction. The color improves a bit with the NightAlive function but the shutter speed is so slow it causes a blurred image. NightAlive function cannot compare with the superb effect of MagicPix that Panasonic provides on their camcorders. In good light the picture sharpness, although good, is nowhere close to a SONY.I returned my JVC GRDVL820U and am buying a SONY !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one size does not fit all","review":"I bought this camera/camcorder thinking that I would solve both my need for a digital camera and a camcorder. The camcorder worked beautifully. I was thouroughly impressed with the DV side of it. The still camera comletely sucked. The quality being offered is to put it lightly: OFFENSIVE. My advice would be to go out and get a 2 megapixel digital camera, a decent DV camcorder and save about $150 dollars. Trust me, you'll be happier with the results you get, That's what I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool camera","review":"this is a solid camera and it is good. i liked the style and light-waitness of it. big lcd display too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BBC FILMS - Well done","review":"This movie is more about angst and longing to find comfort than a girl/girl love story, though its there. Great rental, totally worth while watching. The camera work is a little shoddy at the begining but as the movie goes on everything just keeps getting better. Read the reviews if you were buying the movie for more indepth analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the..","review":"Late at night I began to watch this and at first thought it was a cute little movie about two girls who liked each other. Boy, was I wrong. The end was sickening and very dysfunctional. It made the rest of the movie feel like a joke and lie. The plot twist may appeal to some people but I thought it was horrible. At the end I felt disappointed that I'd stayed up until 2:30 am to watch it. If you like liars and faked suicide and attempted murder this movie is for you.Come on young lesbians, don't watch this crap just because you want movies about people like you. Besides, I hope nobody is like these girls in real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Words can't express how disappointed I was by this film. The title should have been called My Summer of Lies. Love?! Don't start me -- if everyone had such dysfunctional trysts the jails would be full. Maybe I am expecting too much from a lesbian film to hope that it wouldn't end as it did: in betrayal, attempted murder, anger, pain and despair. And lies -- oh so many lies. Try Saving Face for a beautiful sweet lesbian romance -- this is none of these things. Simply awful, disturbing and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for Insomniacs","review":"I so wish I could say something good about this movie, but I cannot. I'm middle-aged and do not need a lot of excitement in a film, but this one truly bored me to tears. I've read the other positive reviews and wonder if we lesbians are just so craving something that we can relate to, that we'll accept anything that comes along. If this is the case, then there are many other lesbian movies much more worth one's time. Put this at the bottom of the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a waste of time","review":"I give it two stars for holding my attention to the end.

Well written, with very precise, intelligent, and oftentimes humorous commentary. Mr. McLennan knows his stuff, and the only thing in my mind that he could be faulted for is not going deep enough on some of the topics. That is the nature of the book, however. It is mean to be a high level overview of all aspects of Sustainable Design.

My lower back can get sore after extended drives, even though my car has decent lumbar support and I sit up straight with the seat almost as straight as it will go.The main problem with this as a back support for driving is that it is too large to use and remain sitting straight. Underinflation is an option, but it is not very stable in this configuration, even when driving straight. So my back is more mobile and this actually adds more back strain than it helps (especially when cornering).I will try this in an office chair but I am not optimistic that it will be useful.The valve is the standard one used in cheap water wings and other toys.

I discovered that since the seats are so close now, when I used the cushion my face was too close to the seat back in front of me.

Alot of these previous reviews are sounding like they didn't pay very much attention. Sean Bean's character and his evil companions are NOT part of the IRA in the movie. Maybe if you had payed more attention to the movie, you would have seen taht they are part of the ULA, which is some kind of ultra-violent faction or something. That may not have been made very clear, but it was made very clear that they were NOT part of the IRA.

The ending felt rushed and put upon. Nothing leading up to it felt truly suspenseful but more like a collection of scenes that were supposed to build intensity but managed to do nothing of the sort. When it was all over I didn't care much about it. Aside from that pretty big snafu, there isn't really much to complain about. It is competently made and technically fine. The music is perfectly suited to the genre, the acting is decent enough (Ford is Ford and this is yet another role he can snarl through), but the story is just so \`not there'. It just felt so unimportant and empty. The thrills are barely registered and the characters are somewhat boring. I understand that Jack Ryan has a following, and so maybe those familiar with his character can find development that the film didn't have, but for those of us unfamiliar, this was just rather hollow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great thriller, Harrison Ford was awesome","review":"Harrison Ford plays Jack Ryan.

I would have given this CD a five star rating, but was somewhat distracted by this flaw. I'll buy another copy and see if the flaw is still there.

Unfortunately for them, they had little to offer in the way of a follow up to \\"Sharona,\\" other than the overtly sexist \\"Good Girls Don't.\\" Once you get past those two tracks, \\"Get the Knack\\" is pretty bleak listening.

They didn't offend any racial groups. We just loved them, and then hated them because we felt stupid loving them.That's a shame, 'cause this is timeless catchy pop rock that will outlive any \\"knuke the Knack\\" memories.By the way, \\"My Sharona\\" is STILL one of the greatest mindless pop singles ever.

So, I balked.And now, 26 years later, I realize what a mistake I made in waiting. Re-issued with excellent sound, packaging and bonus tracks, this is the Cadillac Knack.

The blade is poorly designed, so there are always big chunks of ice or food material left over. It doesn't matter how high a speed you use, or for how long. There are other design problems as well. It's difficult to get a good seal at the bottom, so stuff leaks out a lot. Finally, the spout on the pitcher is way too small. You always end up dripping stuff all over the place.

Contents were spilling when full even before lid was deformed. Blades are not as sharp as with other blenders. I think that if they were a bit sharper they would take care of some tasks (such as pureeing tomatoes for Mexican rice) faster and better. Bottom line: there must be something better out there.

Not only did the purple color not match what was represented on the website, it did not even match the color on its own box. Amazon was kind enough to send out a replacement, however it also was purple and had to be returned. I did not use the blender so cannot comment on its use, but wanted future buyers to beware in case they expect a true blue because it definitely is not that.

It does a great job on a thick barbeque sauce I like to make. It even made great smoothies.

Be as it may, he was loyal to the very end, and with no material gain (unlike other spies).

Rather than buying this book, I suggest you check it out from your local library, and not waste your money. All of the things that would make this autobiography worth reading are simply not there. Instead, you get Philby's smug account of his career in the most general, broad-brush terms. Egotistical, self-absorbed, self-impressed -- the author's writing style, and personality, makes for a very dull book. But, that gives you an idea of why he was so successful for so long -- he obviously thought he was the smartest kid in the classroom and could outwit everyone else.

Mr. Breuer has written 30-some odd military books and is clearly the kind of writer who believes in quantity over quality, and it shows in this sloppy work. Mr. Breuer retells dozens of stories that were orginally reported in the book, HOUR OF REDEMPTION, by military historian Forrest Johnson, but Mr. Breuer neglects to cite or even acknowledge the existence of Mr. Johnsons's book, the first work ever written on Cabanatuan camp, published back in the 1970s. Johnson's book is infinitely better researched and has the integrity of someone who invested heart and soul into his subject. And the extraordinary GHOST SOLDIERS speaks for itself. Altogether, Breuer's thin research, treacly prose, and obvious haste make this book a disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not finish it........","review":"I wanted to read this to learn more about the War in the Pacific.

I picked it up hoping for some plot-driven relief from a Henry James novel. While the plot was compelling, Tryon's pretentious style almost made me prefer James. Further, Ned Constantine and his family are the shallowest of characters and, even though I wanted to like them, I found myself hoping for their untimely ends. Ned was the one character in a position to unravel the secret of Harvest Home - or at least get away - but he made bad decisions at every possible juncture. In a book this length, it is asking a lot for a reader to believe that even a shallow, stupid man could be so blind.

After completing the book I was in total shock and threw it across the room hitting the wall and breaking the spine. The entire book fell apart. I've been looking for another copy for my daughter who is 17 years old. Can't find one anywhere. I hear of many strange events happening in small towns, but this took the cake!

I would not order from this seller again without verifying what he/she is selling."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! What a Great Book!","review":"...I ordered this through an auction on Amazon. I am so glad that I did. I remember the TV movie, from 1978, because my mother loves horror stories. I also read the book, for an English class, when I was a senior in high school. I am half way through it, and just as intrigued, if not more than when I read it the first time. I had forgotten a lot--well, I graduated from high back in the '80's. I can barely put the book down. Thomas Tryon is a master at writing---the descriptions that he uses are uncanny. He is an excellent writer with great ideas. The character of Widow Fortune is unforgettable.

This book is beautifully illustrated and contains many wonderful designs. There are sweaters (and more) that will see your entire family through every season of the year. Of course, everything is relative to personal taste, but I found this book to contain a lot of fresh looking designs that I would actually make...even for my husband! What's more is the instructions are very well written. Each pattern comes with diagrams showing the measurements of each piece per size scale and specific instructions are provided on how to make your gauge swatch. If you've seen patterns that tell you how many stitches and rows it takes to make a 4\\" swatch but fail to take the pattern stitch into consideration (thus leaving the guessing work up to you) then you will appreciate this.If you are looking for a variety of sweater patterns to make for the different people in you life (or yourself!) then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwanted side effects","review":"Research on this product indicated it would help lower cortisol levels.

Space-faring earthman Carson Napier was separated from his beloved princess Duare at the conclusion of the previous novel. Now, he is after her once again, determined to get her home safely to her kingdom of Vepaja, and the result is the literary equivalent of one of the old Saturday morning serials with just a pinch of social commentary. From the Room of the Seven Doors, down the River of Death to the City of the Dead, where a mad scientist presides over a kingdom of zombies, and the beautiful city of Havatoo, which is a paradise but only if your lineage is pure, Carson and Duare bounce from predicament to predicament. Will they survive their adventures? Will Duare drop her haughty facade and accept Carson's love? Is there any doubt? Not really, but getting there is the fun. This series benefits by being more humorous than most of Burroughs' work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Professial Presentation But Dangerous Information","review":"I used this book from April to June 2000 cruising the Bahamas on our way to Panama via the Windward Passage.I found if the wind blew from the east then the book did not give information on other anchorages that one could change to E.G. White Cay Berri Islands and Stanley Cay in the Exums.In other instances the best anchorages were not even mentioned by Wilson. The books G.P.S. waypoints were dangerous wrong E.G.George Town .The lack of information on entrances from the sound to the banks E.G.

The BA charts are woefully lacking in detail -- especially depths -- and discussions of shore sites are in many cases unduly negative. We visited a number of places about which Mr. Wilson used disparaging terms and found them delightful. Coverage of the Exumas assumes one is approaching from the banks side and gives little attention to approaches from Exuma Sound. In some places the author gets on a soapbox for environmental concerns and in other places he tacitly approves practices (such as feeding fish at snorkel sites) that are not ecologically sound. Fails to acknowledge existence of the Explorer series of charts that are by far the best for practical use in the area. In general, the \\"yellow pages\\" info is current and useful, but all things considered, there are better cruising guides for the Bahamas."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't have purchased if I would have had all the facts","review":"I purchased this printer for my mother. She doesn't own a computer and would always have either myself or a sibling print her pictures for her. So I thought this was a great idea since it has 2 USB ports and takes 4 different memory cards. Well what you are not told is that the USB ports are only for HP products and they do not sell an adaptor or anything else so that this product can be used with another type of camera. We have a Sony camera where the pictures are burnt on to a cd, so that is why we were looking for a printer that you can use a USB cable for. I emailed HP support and they told me to hook it up to a computer and then print or they suggested several HP camera's we could purchase to use the USB ports. I GIVE THIS LESS THAN A STAR.The product did print one nice picture off of a memory card but really isn't serving it's purpose for my mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Store Quality Pics","review":"We bought this printer after a Salesperson gave it a high recommendation. We were told that the pictures would look like store bought photos. After hooking it up and loading the software we started printing. We were extremely dissapointed! Our pictures were VERY grainy. We tried switching the print option to best instead of normal, which helped but our pictures were still not perfect. The colors looked washed out, even though we were using the HP paper. Also, when we printed borderless pictures it wouldn't print to the end of the paper. We still had a finger width border on the left side(or sometimes it was on the right hand side?!). Maybe this can be fixed, but the software is difficult to understand and we were unable to figure it out. The best pictures were the ones we printed with the border, but it makes the picture small with a LARGE white border. Not exactly store quality!

They make the finest prints, and in my case, fit right into my photo trailer business. I shoot and print 'on demand' sales.With each new style printer, one has 'new' ink cartridges. By remaining with the tried and true 57 and 58 ink cartridges, I have the knowledge that my product will be satisfactory to MY liking, as well as my client's liking.The 'like new' or refurbished HP7760 (all of those in that catagory) give marvalous prints, at 8x10, one will get a photo without the heavy grain one might get on others.

They still work, just make awful looking print outs with lines through them. I don't feel like throwing away another 30 bucks just to have the nearly full cartridge fail in a couple of weeks!

Even the sleeve notes refer to several of the tracks very negatively which begs the question - what is the point? Astrud had moments of sheer genius, some points of popular appeal and some moments of absolute dodginess - unfortunately if you listened to this album your impression of AG would be a second rate, cover version crooner.

My first blender was returned with a terrible noise in the blade assembly. The second was quiet as a dream but gradually developed the grating noise as well. Warranty replacement was easy but took a long time to receive the new unit. Upon working with both the old unit and the new one, I determined that the noise varies with each assembly. Sometimes works like a dream, sometimes unearthly noise. It seems to be a design flaw in the jar base. Noise can vary by placement on the base. FRUSTRATION. When it works it's great but maybe not worth the hassle. Hard to believe three different blenders would have the same issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crusher, not a blender","review":"If you want an ice crusher - this is it. It can crush ice without any liquid at any speed. However, if you want a smooth texture, this will not do the job. I mainly use blenders for smoothies and to puree soup. Because of the blunt blade and wide bottom - it will not emulsify no matter how long you run it. When I made my smoothie, I ran it longer to see if it would become a creamy consistency (like I would get from my other blender) but it just made the ingredients warm. Another problem is that it doensn't handle single portions well. It splashes all over the jar making it impossible to add ingredients without getting it in your hair and making it necessary to scrape the sides. I returned it and bought a Hamilton Beach MasterBlender for $20 (Bed & Bath) and it's fantastic. No ice chunks, creamy smoothies and silk-like soups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great until....","review":"Oh yeah, I loved my Kitchenaid blender for it's ice crushing talent.

They look great, and seem to be substantial. However, the rubber coupling that connects the blades to the motor is designed to fail. And it will fail long before it should. And it is very difficult for an owner to fix, although it should not be. KitchenAid is very unhelpful, and denies that there is a design flaw. We own all KitchenAid appliances. We will never buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"KitchenAid 5-speed blender","review":"This seems to be a very well made blender, one that suits my purpose perfectly: making Weight Watcher malteds with skim milk, diet vanilla soda and 3 - 4 ice cubes. It works powefully and quickly and, even though I did not relish the thought of the color red (the only color available for the price), it looks fine in my white kitchen--red goes with almost everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality not as expected","review":"Notice that they are also selling a coupling part. I expected Kitchenaid to be of good quality and last a long time, like my mother's stand mixer. I haven't used my blender very much, although I did crush small amounts of ice on its pulse mode. Anyway the coupling unit broke off 4 of its 6 teeth and now I'm afraid to use it. Fortunately they sell the part, but I will have to get someone else to replace it since I have arthritic hands. I bought a Kitchenaid toaster at the same time and it also broke within 2 years of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubber coupling failed after one-year","review":"I should have listened to the other one-star reviews. Yep, the rubber coupling began to break off (the rubber teeth on the base of the blender that the top rests on--the part the turns the blades in the top). The rest of the blender is in great condition. Very sad. We'll be buying a different blender. (We use this for making frozen fruit smoothies 5-6 days per week.) Poor internal design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best blender treats you as you treat it","review":"I swear by this blender. It makes perfect smoothies with ice - the best blender I've ever had - although other reviewers are also right about the coupling. After a few years of service, my coupling broke when I tried to make a smoothie using frozen strawberries, but considering what I'd put my blender through previously, and the fact that ***you can send away in the post for a new coupling for a few dollars which is EASY to attach*** I'd buy this blender again. I don't think most people know kitchenaid provide consumers with spare parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coupling shot after two months","review":"If you ever plan on blending frozen fruit this is not the blender for you. After just two months all the teeth are broken off the coupling from making fruit smoothies. Also, all the smoothie camps out above the blade while it spins wildly while blending nothing. Big waste. It looks pretty and has a good lid, but that is about all it has going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubber coupling will fail","review":"The rubber blade on the base which connects with the glass container will fail after several years.Don't waste your money.

I have burned out motors of several, cheaper blenders previously under the same kind of use. The fact that you can throw the blade into a dishwasher is something very unique to Kitchenaid I believe and it comes very handy. One problem that is common to all american-made, american-designed blenders is present in the Kitchenaid blender also. The high profile of the blade causes small quantities to get stuck under the blade. Why they couldn't lower the blades I don't know. ...See my updated review (after the blender died on me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making Fruit/Protein Shakes? Don't Buy This Blender!","review":"I'll admit, I was wowed by the color, size, weight (very sturdy) of this machine. And it operates with very minimal noise. Clean up is exceptionally easy too. However, I drink about 2 - 3 protein shakes per day. Included in my shakes are frozen bananas and strawberries. No matter how long I leave this blender running, there are always LARGE chunks of fruit stuck to the blades, stuck under the blades or floating in the shake. My last blender lasted me for 5 years, it was a cheapo model which I paid about $30 for and it managed to blend everything in a matter of seconds.

Sixty years later, after reading Wouk's recent The Language God Talks, I was reminded of what a magnificent writer he is.

Generally, books about war fit their stereotype quite well--the hero is the commanding officer who leads his men courageously into battle. However, Wouk showed that even our most heralded commanders are human and make mistakes like the rest of us. Captain Queeg was unbalanced, but was he so unbalanced as to warrant a mutiny? That is one of the central themes of The Caine Mutiny, along with Willie Keith's change from an immature mama's boy into a man capable of commanding an entire ship in the United States Navy. Wouk seemed to have a much better grasp of war and human nature than most authors who have written so-called great novels, showing how most men are vulnerable, and military men are no exception. I would definitely recommend this books to everyone I know"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Like A Screenplay","review":"The Caine Mutiny was an excellent read (that goes by more quickly than its thickness would have you believe). It was exciting and adventuresome. However, parts of it read like it was written directly for the screen. The predictable crescendos and love story lacked the depth that one hopes for from an otherwise great piece of literature. It is definitely a book that commands attention, and perhaps served as an inspiration to the screenplay author of \\"A Few Good Men.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Caine Mutiny","review":"While the beginning of Wouk's novel deals only with the foolhardy love and family life of future ensign, Willie Keith, it offers a good backround to the rest of the book. The multi-dimentional relationships aboard the Caine offer an interesting perspective to human interaction, while further propelling the plot. As Keith matures, Queeg, the ships captain becomes more paronoid and withdrawn. He exagerates minor infractions of rules, and enforces increasingly high penalties. As the story continues, Lt. Maryk relieves the captain during a storm, thus saving the ship, and \\"winning\\" himself a court-martial. The end is an interesting look into how the characters aboard the ship behave after Maryk's trial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious flaws in a compelling novel","review":"This is a very cynical novel. It also lacks credibility.Captain Queeg is not a believable character. Ten or fourteen years out of the Naval Academy (depending on which passage in the book) and old for a Lt. Commander, his superiors would know that he cannot accept responsibility for his own actions. And yet for this and his many other shortcomings, including incompetence and cowardice under fire, he is portrayed as a typical Regular Navy officer.The trial is an travesty of the Military Rules of Evidence.

I give it four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a modern classic","review":"Surely we have all known some of the characters in this story, it could be set anywherethat people work together, not just the U.S. Navy. The eerie familiararity you feel for thesecharacters, who are trapped like prisoners on apathetic, obsolete, WW1 type vessel that is stuck in the backwaters of the fleet, is whatmakes this story work.

At that point, they actually help in the escape of Arnold who, however sympathetic, has comitted a criminal act. So they are then guilty of aiding & abetting a criminal. I know that this didn't bother anyone else reviewing this, nor am I a moralist. But it seemed quite wrong, especially in a family film. The ending somewhat abets this by having Arnold give back the money & perform community service. But I don't see how in a film you can encourage aiding & abetting a criminal.

I love good coffee and this machine makes as good a cup of coffee as I have ever had at home. It beats all those expensive German brands by taste and heat. I have a small country kitchen and the Empire Green is not just another neutral color (black or white), but adds to the feel of my kitchen, while taking up less room than a ten or twelve cupper. I keep a twelve cup coffee maker in the closet for social occasions but this makes such good coffee I imagine when I have guests over, Ill just keep rebrewing in this one until all are served, because it just tastes better.

That said, this tastes pretty good when mixed with just water. I love mint chocolate chip ice cream so the mint taste wasn't over bearing or too minty at all. I took one star off BC it was difficult for me to mix it with other components like fruit with this flavor opposed to what I typically drink which is the extreme chocolate flavor. Also, I got used to the taste and couldn't bare any longer BC of my inability to find good mixes that are low in calorie while tasting great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Rich Chocolate is a little bland, but gets the job done","review":"I've bought several varieties of Optimum Nutrition's whey protein, and I can definitely say that it's one of the best out there based on the results I saw when using it as a supplement. The powder also dissolves very well in liquids compared to other leading whey protein products and the taste is pretty darn good. That being said, I think some flavors are a little milder than others. The Double Rich Chocolate is one of the less flavorful in my opinion, so if you are looking for something sweeter, I would recommend Extreme Milk Chocolate. All in all, you really can't go wrong with ON."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Just what I expected to get.

I'm very happy with this particular flavor - Double Rich Chocolate. What I like about it is that its not very sweet like the other (Extreme milk chocolate). The protein content etc is the same as others and I won't be adding any information about that. I'm not too much into building, so I have this shake on the days I go to the gym - 3-4 times a week. I would say its a very good post workout supplement.I recommend making a milkshake out of this. Here is a quick recipe: 1 scoop of this powder, 8 oz Soy Milk, 4 strawberries, 3/4 to 1 banana, (peanut butter optional). Put all these in a blender. It makes a very yummy shake. Try it with soy milk, IMO it tastes better than dairy milk.

Most other brands range from 20% or more, which, if you're taking two scoops after workout and eating an egg or two in the morning, will add up to one unhealthy diet. This brand helps manage your cholesterol while maintaining a pleasing taste. And yes, the taste is actually pretty good.The only negative is the artificial sweetener used. For the same price, you can get their Natural series, which has no artificial sweetener. I suggest that product instead if you're worried about the effects of sucralose on your body.Did I mention the price? $0.50 an ounce!

Was getting tired of vanilla. I use a hand mixer to make sure it's stirred well.

A small price to pay over the typical chalky taste many of these products have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pays off to get in bulk (10 pound bag)","review":"This showed up on time and this waaay cheaper here then it is on Optimum Nutrition's site.

The taste is more like vanilla ice cream that forgot it was supposed to add flavor to it. Imagine ice cream without taste and sweetness and you have what this taste like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolate-Mint is delicious!","review":"I bought this protein power because chocolate and mint is always a winning combination and this powder lived up to that expectation. I wanted something that I could easily throw together in the morning since I rarely have time to make myself a filling breakfast. I ended up also purchasing a blender bottle which worked perfectly with this.At first I mixed the shake with only milk which was very filling as I usually make between 24-28 oz (to last me until lunch). Since I was going through milk very quickly because of this I started mixing half milk/water and eventually only water. Even when only mixed with water this flavor was still really good and I could finish an entire 28 oz shake easily.Overall this flavor is very good since it can be mixed with either water or milk and still be tasty while also filling you up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item bad taste","review":"I do not like the taste of this at all an will stick with the vanilla from now on...

I got the double rich chocolate and the taste isn't that bad. It isn't as sweet as most other powders but its a no-nonsense powder with no extras. I checked some of the powders I was using and was upset with all the additives such as crystalized taurine and creatine but ON is a straight and to the point powder.One additional thought: If it isn't sweet enough you can do two things, 1) decrease the amount of liquid used, or 2) add a touch of fat free or reduced fat chocolate syrup to add a bit of sweetness without too many calories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best","review":"This protein is the standard of the industry.

I would recommend this flavor to anyone..FYI if your not sure what flavor you want if your looking for a new one everyones taste is different try the packettes..different varities for one use only this way you can rule out the ones you dont like when your purchasing larger sizes this way you wont waste your money learned that lesson the hard way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Great product I use this Gold Standard Whey as a daily dietary supplement and found the brand to be one of the better on the market.

It is top quality, it has BCAAs for post-workout recovery, glutamine-it's all there. Just take a scoop after lifting weights and in the morning for some added protein. The taste is also super great. I like banana cream the best, but strawberry banana is good as well. It goes great in shakes. My special recipe: about 4-5 oz milk, one scoop of this, some nonfat yogurt (I like to use Greek), some oatmeal (try it!), some flax seed (very healthy), some frozen fruit, two egg whites, and a splash of pomegranite juice. It tastes amazing and is very healthy and packed with protein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanilla Ice Cream.

It's a great product, goes down well, and in combination with my 5x per-week lifting routine I've noticed great results.I've tried chocolate, vanilla, and cookies 'n cream.They were all pretty good, but my favorite is the chocolate. While the vanilla one tasted fine, for some reason no matter what I mixed it with (whether it be water or milk) I would always have a TON of foam after mixing it; I would then have to let it sit for a few minutes for the foam to turn back into liquid. So, beacuse of the foaming issue with the vanilla one, I think I might go back to chocolate.But still, it's a great product and I will continue to try other flavors as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, good price!","review":"Good protein is hard to find. There are a lot of choices but I've heard good things about this brand before I even purchased it...and I'm glad I did.Price is great and the taste is better than most protein products I've tried. The Mint Chocolate tastes like a Thin Mint shake. Musclemilk tastes a little better but it's not a pure whey protein product like this is.Back to ON. It mixes really well so you won't get too many protein chunks floating in your shake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tasting protein","review":"There are other types of protein that I have tried over the years, and this is by far my favorite. With various different flavors to choose from, my personal choice is the Vanilla Ice Cream. With the vanilla base and a blender, you can create fantastic protein shakes by adding strawberries, peanut butter, or even chocolate. Drinking protein shakes every day, I prefer the option to change the flavors, without buying additional flavors of protein.This is also an effective protein source that I have had personal success with, and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to add muscle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, get the fruit ones.","review":"Okay, so I've been using ON Whey for a while. I feel like it gives me a little more bang for the buck compared to the traditional store brands (especially since it includes the BCAAs).My only complain--which I admit might be completely in my head--is that the chocolate/coffee/whatever flavors that ON makes don't mix anywhere near as well as the fruit flavors. Typically, the \\"heavier\\" flavors leave lots of unmixed globs no matter how well you shake up your serving. Meanwhile, the \\"lighter\\" flavors tend to mix rather well.Pretty minor complaint, though. If you're trying to build some muscle, I suggest ON over any other brand. It's hard to beat for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yucky Aftertaste","review":"Heard good things about ON products so I decided to try this.

Just don't expect it to blunt hunger for any amount of time. If you're eating right, it won't matter anyway. Mixes well with creatine, cost is great comparably and I will buy it again. My opinion is that some of the other proteins add fillers, and say it has a lot of other ingredients to make it more appealing and ON doesn't do that.

All flavors are best when mixed with milk (adding yogurt is also great), but I find that some flavors with just water are tough to choke down. It tastes like fruity pebbles. Great for a meal replacement, as it curbs appetite for several hours too. But I like this for its versatility. Not too heavy, great tasting, mixes great with water or milk. I like to blend it with 2 ice cubes, 12oz water, and a heaping scoop post workout for best results. Be wary or the vanilla ice cream flavor - very strange taste that I'm not a fan of.

It does not taste exactly like the real thing ... if you know how the sugar substitutes (e.g., equal, splenda, sweet and low, etc.) taste like then I would say that it's tastes like chocolate milk with the \\"fake\\" sugar ---- makes sense b/c otherwise the product would have loads of carbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I used to use the wheybolic Extreme that they sell at GNC, but it had way too many calories in it.

After using it after a few months, I have to say it does really well to increase muscle mass and decrease fat. However, I heard that this helps with lean muscle, and I have come to basically a dead-end where I'm not noticing as big of an improvement while not noticing that much more muscle, which is the reason why I gave this 4/5 stars.As an FYI, the package advises eating a gram of protein per pound you weigh everyday. According to the instructions and my friends, that's the only way to notice big improvements. I should note that I didn't follow this rule all the time, which may have limited my ability to lift more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all!","review":"I don't know what people are talking about when they say the Chocolate flavor is awesome.

Why take a health product that has unhealthy ingredients? I won't be buying this again.It has artificial flavor. BAD!And worse, it has Acesulfame artificial sweetener. Do some Googling on it. It causes cancer in animals and is reportedly worse than aspartame and saccharin.Oh well, the search goes on.

Most water mixed powders I can drink down pretty quickly, but this one I could not drink quickly.Mixed with milk alone, this tasted pretty good. Had a fruit punch milkshake kind of flavor, which while odd was completely stomachable and decent.I also like to make smoothies, and I will say, this mixed with strawberry+banana+yogurt+juice was not great. Using a fruit punch as my juice made it better but Vanilla powder goes so much better in this smoothie. The fruit punch had a strong noticeable flavor and I think other flavors would not be so prevalent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has caffeine","review":"I bought the coffee-flavored whey protein just to realize that it's not just coffee FLAVORED, but rather the second ingredient is coffee.

I would not buy this again. My advice, stick with the chocolate flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"fatally flawed flavor","review":"Terribly sweet flavor, it kind of makes me want to spit it out, it's that terrible. I made a mistake by ordering this flavor instead of what I usually get - the Double Rich Chocolate. That one is delicious, you can mix 3 servings with 16 oz of milk and it is good. While Extreme milk is forcing me to use just 1 serving per 16 oz of milk, to be tolerable. I guess combining it with cereal or using it in some other way might make it less terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good protein powder...","review":"I've been using Optimum Nutrition products for years. A couple of years ago I found a couple of jugs of whey protein I purchased didn't mix the greatest. It would leave large clumps in the blender. I figured maybe the switched the recipe so I switched to another brand for awhile. About a month ago I decided to try ON again and was pleased when it mixed up smooth.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is the strawberry flavor left kind of a funky aftertaste and its gotten a little pricey. Just in the time since I purchased this product the price has went up $6. I had heard the price of whey went up but the other brand I buy is $10 less for the same 5 lbs jug so its hard for me to justify spending the extra on the ON brand.

I have one scoop with 12 oz. of water every morning and I am already seeing results. I think I have been taking this for about a month. It's done wonders for my abs. They feel so solid and definitely did not feel like that before! I didn't switch up my workout routine or diet at all. I just drink this every morning and it's really done the trick.

It definitely does not mix easily without a blender or mixer, be prepared for 5mins of stirring and you'll still end up with lots of clumps. You also can not mix this in water as it tastes awful in anything more than 3 ounces of water and even then, pretty bad. If you put the normal 6-8ounces of water, it tastes like water with a tint of chocolate. Not a good taste..With milk, the mixing is even worse with a spoon but at least the taste vastly improves and it tastes a lot closer to chocolate milk.. Sorry, I will not buy this product again. I am still searching for a good protein shake, Twinlabs has a good one that mixes well in water or milk, but I won't refer it since it will put into doubt my review.

I just came form a powder I bought locally, (1st-phorm level 1), which mixed well with 4 oz. of water and tasted like a shake. It also cost $43 for 3 lbs.! I previously mixed my shakes in milk because they didn't taste all that good with water. I haven't tasted many different current powders, but I can say this isn't the best tasting stuff out there. Due to price and reputation, I'll stick with ON, and will just keep trying different flavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste","review":"Great product. Very easy to mix it in water or Milk. Tastes great. No after taste. Very low sugar. I would strongly recommend it to vegetarians or athletes like me who could use some protein supplement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid product for a good price","review":"It's a very good protein shake with a good balance of nutrients.

I think we all know that optimum makes darn good protein powder. Probably the best for the price, in my opinion. SO yeah, i was surprised with the taste of Cookies n' Cream. Tastes much better than I thought... definitely you can pick out the cookies and cream (there are actual little black particles in there for the cookies!)and I would venture to say there is even a hint of tootsie roll in there, haha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastiest Protein Out there","review":"Tried Double Rich Choclate.

This fits the bill well. I take two scoops to get 48 grams of protein...I am a big guy at 6'2 and 250lbs....so 24 grams at one sitting is not going to cut it for me. I love the fact that it mixes very easily with a spoon or fork. The taste is neither good nor bad when mixed with water. Muscle milk tastes much MUCH better...but also has double the calories. This is perfect for what I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Great taste, especially if you mix it in with chocolate milk.Good value for money, hard to find another protein powder product as good as this out there for the price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Flavor and No Grainy Texture","review":"I have been looking for a good protein shake and have tried several different kinds (eas soy protein, warrior raw protein blend, vega nutrition, and spiru-tein) ALL of which had nasty textures (gritty, sandy) and horrible aftertastes - not only simply mixed with milk, but also with fruit as smoothies. This is the first mix I have tasted that is not only bang on consistency wise, but I almost get sad when I get to the end of the cup because it's all gone. I love it because I get my chocolate/sweet fix, while giving my protein a boost. I also love the fact it's not overly sweet. I would compare it to chocolate milk but with just a touch of sweetness. I'm not great at writing reviews, but I must say I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I've been using ON products for a little over a year now. For the most part, I've been very pleased. I bought the 10 lb bag back in November because at the time, it was cheaper than the 5 lb tub. Tastes the same but as far as usign it in my shaker cup, this has been very clumpy. Tried some Syntha-6 a month ago and not once did it clump and it tastes much better. Maybe it was a fluke thing with the clumping, but this will be the last ON product I purchase for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible taste....","review":"I have had this product before in the double chocolate and vanilla flavors, and all i can say is that this strawberrry flavor was just terrible.

About an hour after drinking the first shake, I got sick (won't go into the details). I wasn't sure if it was the powder or one of the other ingredients in the shake, so I tried it again the next day. I got sick again. I paid $52.99 for this giant container, though, and really hoped I hadn't received a bad batch. I tried it two more times and got the same results. I've since stopped drinking it but wanted to post a warning after seeing some other recent reviews of people getting sick.I got such a big size because I'd bought a 1lb. container in February from Amazon and really liked it. No issues with the product that time. I don't know what's in the 5lb. container this time, but it's not good. I won't buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit hard to dissolve, tastes good","review":"I used the Vanilla flavor the last two times but...Amazon didn't have it in the big tub this time, so I tried this - Chocolate Mint.

This protein blows it out of the water. For starters, I know that lots of people say it, but the taste is phenomenal. I have the rocky road and I plan on trying the cookies and cream flavor next time. Also, I definitely feel as though it is helping with my weight lifting. Not like it's a miracle supplement, but it helps me between one set of lifting and the next, giving me faster recovery times than I am used to, and helping to get my protein uptake up to what it should be.

As for the flavor, I don't quite think it tastes like a cake batter (maybe it does with milk???).

I was expecting better results with this product. Here is my disclaimer however, I weight trained (6x/week) during the entire course of taking this product but did not incorporate any cardio workouts to supplement my weight training. This may have had an impact on weight gained (cardio work is an important aspect of weight training due to the loss of fat that occurs from it).

I tried it with fat free milk in just a shaker bottle and it was tremendous.

I tried it three different times. The first time in a fruit smoothie. Using same ingredients I typically use for a smoothie, it tasted weird. I couldn't finish the smoothie. Thinking maybe some of the fruit was bad, I tried it again with 8 ounces of almond milk. It mixed fine in a shaker cup but tasted watered down and just ... weird. I can't explain it other than just saying the taste was unpleasant.I tried it one last time with just 5 ounces of almond milk. Still gross. My son said it tasted like rancid pudding.

I got a couple 5 lb containers each of the French Vanilla Cream and the Extreme Milk Chocolate.

If you can make a few sacrifices in other expense areas, and instead spend more for the Platinum Whey, it's like night and day in my opinion. The Platinum Whey tastes 10x better, it's thicker, feels like great quality and goes down easy. I've had family members make a Platinum shake just to drink it because they like the taste!

I wouldn't go as far as to say it tastes like, say, a Nestle chocolate milk or anything, but it's solid. I still have to take big gulps, but I don't have to chase it with anything after drinking, which is nice. It tastes solid, and I'd venture to say it's probably as good as chocolate protein gets. This is my second type of protein, the first being the strawberry flavor from Vitamin World. I say it's on par with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookies and Cream Whey Protein","review":"Great protein supplement. In the past I have gotten the chocolate flavor, which also tastes good, but cookies and cream tastes great too.

I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who is looking for protein, especially for use with work outs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product from Optimum.","review":"Good product from Optimum, but caused a little too much bloating in me. First of all, I don't think double rich chocolate is the best flavor when mixing with water. But when taken with milk, the flavor was a lot better, even enjoyable.I have now switched to Cookies and Cream. And though I've heard many complain that it's much too sweet, it tends to agree more with my stomach. The flavor is great, even when taken with water and bloating for me is greatly reduced. I don't know why this is the case. But I think it might have to do with the differences in flavoring ingredients.My recommendation is don't do what I did. 10lbs is too much to commit to without really knowing how this product will play with your body. Buy the smaller container and try different flavors to find out what works best for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I have only been using the stuff for about two weeks, i have seen some muscle build. Which is good for this fast, my advise is to eat many protein filled meals such as tuna or red meat along with a protein shake to see better results.

It make me sick to my stomach and light headed like I was gonna vomit. This lasted about 2 hours. This didn't make since because I was having a great day and a great workout. I have tried this ON protein in the past with no complaints. I think the protein was either contaminated with something or spoiled.

In fact, there aren't any spices whatsoever on this rack; they are ALL seasonings. There isn't anything on there that was worth the $20. The rack was poorly constructed as well and the plastic shaker bottles fell out very easily with just a simple turn. I hate to talk negatively about something, but this isn't worth your money.

I could not put it down and wanted to read the whole thing over again as soon as I finished. This book is filled with history, love, treachery, intrigue, a truly evil villaness, battles and more. Ceawlin and Niniane are a wonderful couple -- I enjoyed the pairing of the pagen Saxon who would be high king and the Christian British Princess Niniane. Learning to make a marriage with such two opposing lifestyles and customs, the hatred and mistrust between the Britains and Saxons make for compelling reading.This is a must read for any lover of historical fiction, and sheds light on a little known period of England in the dark ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Excellent","review":"This book is absolutely excellent!

Miss Davis was hot-tempered and sharp-tongued at times but her fans know she was really something of a prude so it seems highly questionable she would dish dirt like this. (Remember she had a feud with her last film director because the film included a dark comic joke concerning Joan Crawford which Miss Davis thought was in terrible taste. And Joan was of course no friend of Bette's!!) This frankly reads more like a drag queen's nightclub act not an interview with a star.

There is enough material here that reads like the Bette we all read about, to make a good read with confidence she pitched her remarks where she wanted them to go. The only dubious report is Bose getting her in interview to almost admit to her affair with Howard Hughes whereas our Bette was quoted as saying she was \\"the only star in Hollywood who didn't have an affair with H.Hughes\\". Well, it's iffy. But who cares now? Her photos included here are lovely - it breaks your heart. Anyone who has worked in the industry knows they all dished the dirt - it was their world, present and future and they reveled in it. They were all larger than life. This book does in effect find a balance between Bette the Difficult and Bette, the professional actor born with great drive and talent who just wanted to do the best job everytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hadleigh asks and Bette laughs!","review":"Want to learn something about Hollywood from the Queen herself? Wrong book.Whether she spoke or not, whether it's printed here or not: Some remarks and questions of the interviewer are ridiculous.Only a few answers sound like Bette and it's a good example for what she had to deal with all her life: millions of silly questions and small talk.However: thanks, Bette, it's fun how you make fun of it and refuse ...For everyone who want's to get to know Bette Davis and enjoy a great interview: Dick Cavett-Show 1971 and don't miss her laughter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it authentic?","review":"When I read the customer reviews of this book, I was thinking of buying it -- because it contained so much \\"new\\" material.

I had the pleasure of interviewing Ms. Whitney and reviewing this autobiography for The Detroit News when the book was first released. I was struck by her graciousness and kindness, but I was also struck by the gritty strength she conveys in this book. Frankly describing incidents like her hit-and-run on Grand River Avenue in Detroit, and her guarding the bathroom door of a Chicago club while the heroin-addicted Billie Holiday was getting shot-up inside, she just puts it out there, none too concerned what her cult-TV fans will think of her. You've got to appreciate that. And it's pretty clear, throughout the book, that her motives are not to make herself look good, or bad, but to shine a light on the effects of a gruesome and very common illness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving and inspiring book","review":"I am a long time Star Trek fan who bought this book because I have had the honor of meeting Ms. Whitney at a couple of conventions, and she has impressed me with her warmth and wit. I read this book in a single sitting because I could not put it down. Unlike the other Trek memoirs I've read, this one focuses not on a TV series, but on the incredible story of a woman's fight to find peace with God and herself. This book is a must read for anyone who has ever experienced tragedy, loss of self esteem, or addiction. The one thing that concerns me most is that I feel too many people will look on this as just another Star Trek book when its audience should be far greater than just Trek fans. The author has bared her soul in an attempt to help others, and the courage that must have taken is awe-inspiring. Bravo, Grace Lee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and moving.","review":"I have had the pleasure of meeting Grace Lee Whitney and hearing her speak. She is exactly what she seems in the book.

I followed his routes on my atlas and discovered that he did not always follow a west to east route, but rather zigzagged north to south to east as his interests changed. In India he narrates his fascination with the role of monkeys in society, the strange vestments and customs of the people there, so alien to anything he had ever seen or experienced. Then he spends years and years in the Orient, befriending the Chinese emperor, learns to speak Chinese to the point where he practically forgets his native Italian, even becomes governor of a Chinese state. From adolescence intoto adulthood, Marco travels with his father and uncle during 30 years, discovering the marvels of a world unknown to the west, by ship, elephant or camel, or on foot over some of the world's highest mountains, against all odds but driven forth by endless curiousity and optimism."},{"rating":"1","title":"CORRECT THE AVAILABILITY","review":"I bought this book for kindle version, and when it was transferred it appeared to be the sample version, on the cloud it was complete and I tried to send it again, the same stuff: uncomplete, sample version on kindle again.

I very rarely quit reading books, but this one wore me out. On the plus side, I did experience what life was like for early explorers. Distances were described in days of travel rather than miles. Hardships \\"on the road\\" were extreme. But the heart of the book, the descriptions of the places visited and the people of these places, left me truly wondering about the veracity of the experiences. Lush gardens with mellons piled high in the middle of a desert seemed highly improbable. But even more annoying was the feeling of being lost in an unknown world. Although Polo did not have any maps when he traveled, having maps would have helped the modern armchair traveller to know where Polo was so the reader could more easily determoine where in the world was Marco Polo.

After about a month of use (about a pot every weekday) it started producing mysterious leaks. Somehow there was always a puddle under the machine, sometimes of coffee and sometimes of water. Eventually the steal-a-cup spring loaded thing quit, so unless I held the pot up against the filter basket during brewing it would overflow and make a righteous mess all over the place.

Unfortunately, all the impressive extras in the world don't really amount to much when the main function of the device - giving a close and comfortable shave - doesn't work. According to my husband, it's jumpy, clunky and leaves stubble and clumps of hair where you're meant to have a clean cut.If you're looking for a shaver for yourself or the man in your life, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

What I got was a pain in the neck. Unless you want to keep a lumberjack length beard, this is not the trimmer for you. The attachments do not give you a close trim and the razor itself only worked for about 4 months before it started cutting me through the foil. And I'm not even talking through holes in the foil.

Also I was tired of regular razor shaving and i wanted electric shaver to do the work for me.I must say that the razor is an Ok shaver; Ok, because it didn't match my facial hair structure. In order electric shaver to cut hair, the hair has to be standing on the face. But my facial hair lies on the face, so it's hard for razor to cut them. Also face must be shaved at least every other day; otherwise it won't be able to cut the long hair.Hair length adjustment accesory is nice tool as well. Not only facial hair can be shaved with it, but also body hair can be trimmed.Rotating styler is a nice tool, as well. You can easily correct the sideburns, and neck can be cleaned with it from ugly hair.In the end, i must say, that electric shavers aren't for everyone.

Being one of the few people in the area with some literary exposure, he is revered by the locals as a pundit. He tries his hand at several things from teaching to massaging to a local medicine man to a famous politician.The book is very vividly written and the narrative is smooth and fluent.

After learning how to love, he saw that what his mother was doing to him was not love for him, but for herself. Her narcissism was destroying him until he began to see her through eyes of true love. Knowing true love shows how despicable narcissistic love is."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh if i had the wings of a canary over these prison walls i would fly ...","review":"poor burt lancaster had just won an oscar 2 years before, and he was running up against gregory peck, peter o'toole, marcello mastroianni, and jack lemmon (robert preston in \\"music man\\" wasnt even nominated!) so truth be told he really had no chance of winning in this marvelous semi-accurate biopic of murderer-turned-ornithologist robert stroud. while the movie takes considerable liberties with the facts (stroud was much more an SOB than the sympathetic character lancaster portrays) it is on its own terms an eloquent argument for fairness -- even for those barely meriting same. strong supporting performances from karl malden, thelma ritter, and the still-hairy-headed telly savalas. good picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Etched in my mind","review":"This is one of those movies that I first saw as a boy in the '60's and would watch every chance I got, which was 2-3 times.

I vividly remember seeing it in the theater when it came out, and being strongly affected by the story, and by Lancaster's portrayal of Stroud.Unfortunately the real Stroud was nothing at all like the character depicted in the film. He was, from all accounts, a vicious sociopath, a man who killed when it suited his needs, manipulated people around him, and was able to game the prison system to his own ends.Still, this is a wonderful film that manages to craft an uplifting story from the life of a man who had little about him to admire. Quite an accomplishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah - I am a cider drinker too!","review":"The Wurzels released an updated up-tempo version of their 1976 hit \\"I Am A Cider Drinker\\" featuring guest vocalist BBC Radio 2 DJ Tony Blackburn.

Taken together, these fragments, completely controlled and deadpan, approach the beauty of prose poetry.

To anyone who studies Ethics, it may be to simple, but to me, who has barely encountered the notion at all, the ease of understanding was important. There are parts that I read a couple three times to understand, and parts that just went over my head, but these parts are few and far between. For the most part, I could understand the ideas he wrote about. The sad thing was that I have come away with the idea that there is no Ethics but what we bring to it. But then, what good is a man's grasp if it cannot exceed his reach? No wonder they still study Ethics: they are trying to bring some universal Ethics down to us from on high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same content, different title.","review":"It should be noted that Being Good: A Short Introduction to Ethics contains the same content as Ethics: A Very Short Introduction by the same author.

Yet we're supposed to take away that \\"Bush is a pretty okay guy, who manages on the fly?\\" Please Mr. Woodward.

The book is disorganized, lacks perspective and is bereft of any level of analysis.Woodward's ability to get senior people to talk is unparalleled. It is a pity that he makes no effort to dig beyond what his contacts tell him. Worse, Woodward doesn't bother to add any historical or geopolitical context to the actions he describes.

Woodward casts him unfairly as a bit of a bumpkin. Also, there is his laughable characterization of Rumseld and Wolfowitz as reactionary and almost malevolent figures trying to influence Bush. Yet, somehow Woodward is able to treat superficially and without comment Clinton's contributions to the whole 9-11 mess and the aftermath. Finally, Woodward demonstrates remarkable ESP powers by describing what various people are actually thinking, even when their words suggest something different.I can't recommend this book as an objective or insightful anaysis of Bus at War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievingly Disappointing","review":"This was more like 400-pages of transcripts, recordings, and notes which were drier than a piece of beef jerky.

I agree with others who feel the journalist did not dig deep enough.

Bob Woodward won't be bringing down anymore governments. He has completely bought into the back-scratching revolving-door Washington set that doesn't want to offend anyone, lest you be taken off the good party list for the next year. He manages to write this without making anyone look even a little bad. His images of Bush are like the old Saturday Night Live skit, where Reagan ushers out the little girl scout from the photo op and starts talking in Russian to Gorbachev. Bush even interviewed with Woodward, and his self-serving accounts go unchallenged by Woodward. This book is an embarrassment, and Woodward should be ashamed.

Woodward manages to describe one of the most emotional times in our history with no emotion whatsoever.In fact, the only emotion in the book comes from Bush himself, who was interviewed by Woodward.

Bob Woodward shows how the planning as well as the unexpected took place as America prepared and executed its war against Al Queda and Taliban in Afghanistan. The author draws from personal conversations he has had with the President and his war cabinet. However he doesnot dwell on any of Foreign Policy implications of the different decisions or the lapses of intelligence that led to 9-11.The author clearly brings out the different opinions of the different personalities involved mainly between the Sec of Defense Don Rumsfeld and Sec of State Colin Powell with Condi Rice being a moderating influence and reality check.Overall a good book which I would recommend to understand how the US military and intelligence agency plans and executes one of the strangest and unorthodox wars that US has ever fought."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not about politics, it's about our nation's leaders","review":"I'm currently reading Bush at War, and I'm enjoying it a lot.

Short on analysis and long on actual accounts, this book will disappoint closed-minded left-wingers who prefer to think of Bush and his advisors as power-hungry morons. How else would you explain the low scores the book received from a few reviewers below, who criticised Woodward for kissing up to the President. Anyone who knows anything about Woodward understands that he is anything but a kiss-up. Those of you looking for cheap shots should steer clear of \\"Bush at War\\" and read an Al Franken book. Those looking for an in-depth account of Bush as the President of America should read \\"Bush at War.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"NO REAL INSIGHT to the BUSH PROPAGANDA","review":"No real insight because this book duplicates all the propaganda we read in the papers everyday. Woodward never questions any of the war staff's actions or verbage. What happened to Woodward the investigative reporter? His work in BUSH AT WAR is like a cheerleader for the Bush administration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woodward Hits a Homerun with BUSH AT WAR","review":"Just finished Bob Woodward's great book BUSH AT WAR. Woodward, a WASHINGTON POST reporter and no great admirer of things Republican, was given unprecedented access to the White House and the inner workings of our government at the highest levels during the days following Setember 11. This is the story of that period with major emphasis on Bush, Cheney, Powell, Rumsfeld, Tenant and Rice, their roles, thoughts and comments as they struggled through the situation. The whole time I was reading it, the thought kept circling in the back of my mind \\"thank God the previous residents weren't still at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\\" It was also amazing to learn the political types at the White House, i.e. Rove, Hughes, etc. were kept out of the process. More importantly, there wasn't one mention in the remarks attributed to any of the principals about polls or focus groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda at Best","review":"This book was very disapppointing, especially from Woodward who has electrified us before. We are supposed to get an inside view of the President and his actions and reactions to the world stage. Instead we get a lot of discussion on the methods for obtaining journalistic information along with snippets of information that show clearly a president who is not in control, but rather surrounded by aides each running their own show. One thing it does illustrate is that Mr. Bush is determined to set a course for war regardless of what goes on around him, confirming news from the popular press. Woodward gives us very little that we have not heard before through other journalistic sources. As a previous reviewer said, maybe this will be better in the future as we look back on this presidency. But for now, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Woodward is a One of a Kind Author!","review":"This is one of the best written books I have read. It is rife with history and filled with facts. It is an enjoyable and friendly read. This belongs on my bookshelf forever!

Highly recommended if you're interested in learning about both current events or the inside life of a US president."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shameful exercise","review":"There is nothing here that an close newspaper reader did not know or surmise. What is missing is any mention of why Bush and his geniuses lost the first round of the war in Afganistan because they did not want to lose Americvan citizens' support by taking real casualities at Bora Bora. Or how about the confusion and anxiety of the American people when their leader ran and hid for a day after the attack.It was as if Roosevelt disappeared after Pearl Harbor. What Woodward skips over reveals he his a bag man for the cowards in the White House."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob Woodward sells his soul to the neo-cons","review":"Wow. A right wing view of Bush's war efforts with blinders added. Woodward's aim at terrorism is as bad as Bush's. Bush does not deserve to be on any pedestal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bush at war\`","review":"Over all this book is just repetitive claptrap, wait for it to appear in a dollar bin near you. I had a nightmare a few nights ago after reading \\"bush at war\\". Bush was giving birth to a dead Iraq child, similar to the episode on p142 with Ken Star's daugther."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bestselling rehash","review":"As a person who scarcely gets much national news, I was able during the aftermath of 9/11 to hear the national news reports on our response to that tragedy. Woodward, who has access to the most private conversations in Washington and even to the principals themselves, might have given us a book more revealing than this. From cover to cover it is little more than a compilation of tidbits reported in the media. Except for a few names, nicknames and details labels for things, and a few details of what so-and-so thought of so-and-so's inputs at meetings, the entire panorama is fairly well-known even to me, who as I said does not get enough national news. The style lacks pith and punch, whichs makes for quick, almost mindless reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political reporting 'lite'","review":"This book makes clear that Bob Woodward has become the Barbara Walters of political journalism. Facile and lightweight. Frustrating lack of critical analysis. Devoid of penetrating questions. Puff piece for the administration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woodwards Latest Effort","review":"In his latest book, BUSH AT WAR, Woodward displays his classic liberal bias towards Bush. Woodward casts him unfairly as a bit of a bumpkin. Also, there is his laughable characterization of Rumseld and Wolfowitz as reactionary and almost malevolent figures trying to influence Bush. Yet, somehow Woodward is able to treat superficially and without comment Clinton's contributions to the whole 9-11 mess and the aftermath. Finally, Woodward demonstrates remarkable ESP powers by describing what various people are actually thinking, even when their words suggest something different.I can't recommend this book as an objective or insightful anaysis of Bush at War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book","review":"Other than giving you some insider information about the White House this book does not have anything interesting to say.Woodward tries to make the President look smart.I do not recommend this book because it does not have anything to say and seems like he tries to make the President look more knowledgeable that he really is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping story and very eye opening","review":"I have never read a Bob Woodward book before. I'm going to start reading more of his work. An excellent insiders look at who's an outsider on the cabinet, who the hawks are (that's ez) and who his most trusted confidant is during this time of great national crisis.

He fails to point out the huge threat we face and how Bush is failing to protect the borders. Clinton was far worse but Bush needs to protect the borders and stop illegal aliens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bush at War","review":"I was disappointed. I had hoped for an unbiased look at the workings of the Administration. What I got was an obvious, agenda driven, manipulated story, driven by the Author's own view of the world. I was hoping for much more. I was very saddened by the Epilog. The Author used this section to \\"prove\\" everything he had put forth in his story. To bad he wrote both.The Author's view of the world is so skewed that at every instant when something profound took place, where something really affected the fabric of national life, the Author not only brushed it aside as strictly happenstance, he turned it into something ugly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking back at events ....","review":"This book is a detailed account of what was said by Bush and his inner circle. There is no real attempt to form an opinion or show happenings in any light other than that of Mr. Bush and his group. I'd give it a 4 or 5 for accuracy, but due to the lack of insight into what Mr. Bush's course of action would cause long-term, this has to go down. I wouldn't advise this book to anyone who actually wants to _understand_ the events of 9/11, Afghanistan, or now Iraq. To Bob: 4 for being a faithful tape recorder and zero for analysis. You get a 2, and I'm going to offload the book on the used market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bush made strangely vulnerable","review":"For all the conservatives who give this book one star because it's \\"filled with lies,\\" I feel compelled to point out that I am a moderate liberal who enjoys reading these Woodward books because they help me empathize with the Bush administration more, not because I want to demonize them or make fun of them.This book, like his most recent one, is one that will have you forgetting your other responsibilities. As busy as I am, I found myself finishing this near-400-page book at just under five days. It's just really interesting, really good reading; and it covers material that, like I said about the other book, every American really should know about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fly on the WaLL! I LOVE IT!!","review":"Bob Woodward is a great reporter. Though he may not be the world's biggest Bush fan, this book gives you the feeling that you are a fly on the wall in TOP SECRET government meetings. Some of the things reportedly said by Bush sound chilling. It is an interesting read and a must have for anybody interested in the inner workings of politics and the White House!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent insight into the White House post 9/11","review":"Woodward does an excellent job describing the events and activities of all the major White House players as events unfold after the attack on September 11. He gives true insight into how the players interact and their thought processes as the US response to terrorism unfolds.This is not a book just for conservatives or supporters of our President. Woodward writes in a clearly unbiased manner exposing both the strengths and weaknesses of Bush and his advisors.Educational and an eye opener, the book is very topical as it ends with the heat being ramped up on the Iraqi situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Companion to \\"Where the Right When Wrong\\"","review":"First of all I found this historical account of the daily response, thinking, and activities of the Bush cabinet from the morning of 9/11 to the height of the Afganistan campaign, an exciting and excellent account of this historical period. I later read Pat Buchanan's \\"Where the Right Went Wrong\\" and found this book corraberated many of his assertions. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chronicle of War","review":"This book, as its title suggests, is a collection of various events and decisions involving Bush and his cohorts, which lends a framework for the retaliatory strike on UBL and the Taliban.There is an apparent disconnect when the War on Iraq is being discussed. The subject is introduced abruplty, and the flow of the book is totally disrupted. This prompts the reader to question the motives behind the War on Iraq.The author does a good job on revealing Bush's emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Left Loose Ends, Like Bush","review":"I felt the book was informative, and captured many angles. It gave the reader an inside account of Bush's inner circle. On the other hand, it seemed disorganized, which may more be a function of what was really happening, rather than Woodward's style of writing. Overall, there is probably a New Yorker or New York Times article that captures the essence of the book but does not leave the reader wondering why they purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"he is a war pig!","review":"he is a war pig, he destroys all other poor countries, and he rises his imperialism with the name of America.and the journalist had who interviewed him, does not realize what he thought behind his back,...you're devil George!"},{"rating":"1","title":"imperialism story of white house","review":"this is a dirty fact what George will saying about his imperialist aims to the journalist like Woodward, Woodward believed him and wrotes this book.if you love him and Woodward, you will be pleased why he started the war with one of the poorest country in the world.

Instead of sending young soldiers to fight his dirty war!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Played like a Fiddle","review":"Rumsfeld and Cheney played our cowboy tough guy president like a fiddle.

This book was a very poor excuse at trying to make sense of \\"Down Low\\" brothers.I think my biggest beef with the book was the chapter on HIV, and trying to make it sound as if it's due to the \\"brothers on the down low\\" who sleep with other men. HIV doesn't discriminate. It affects all sexualitys, all races and all genders. Her blaming HIV infection increases strictly on gay men is unfair. Any one can get HIV+, and I'm sorry, this book bordered on hate speech."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"Information books like this one are so badly needed to help bring a stop to this GENOCIDE (a planned anniliation) against black women.

This recording as important as it may be in the birth/raising of fusion is very harsh and the grooves are too loose and heavier to the ear than metal (probably a bad comparison)but maybe that's the idear but I'm not as appreciative. Do not expect any Jimmy Smith, or Johnny 'Hammond' Smith comparisons to Larry Young on organ. Overall disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all effective.

The first, and therefore main ingredient is alcohol, which is very drying to the hair.

The music's been on downward slope since End of Silence when he canned Andrew Weis. But now that he's ditched his old band, he's completely lost it. I can't even pain myself to put the CD back in the player to find out the title of the song where they do a poor rip off of guns and roses. And Hank's lyrics went from so-so to drizzle.DO NOT BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comeback album of the year","review":"What a return to form! Rollins bounces back by teaming up with Mother Superior, who work extremely well with Rollins and he in turn seems much more inspired here than he had since \\"Lifetime\\". As inconsistant as Rollins Band recordings have been, it does one good to see the Man come back with a solid effort. Great songs, excellent playing, even a classic rant at the end that hits all the right targets, only one long snail paced dirge and a metallic sound that somehow sounds modern while at the same time being able to touch base with Thin Lizzy (whose \\"Are You Ready?\\" is covered here very nicely done).This is great stuff (although still not \\"Lifetime\\") One would do well to seek out \\"Yellow Blues\\" from the 2.13.61 website, since this was intended as a double CD (as Nice would be as well) for the rest of the story and more top notch material (3/4 of \\"Yellow\\" is great stuff).Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different band, different sound, good results","review":"Having been a fan of Henry Rollins since the Black Flag days, I look forward to each new Rollins release with anticipation. I'll admit that although GET SOME, GO AGAIN is not my favorite Rollins Band album, (THE END OF SILENCE wins that award) I like what's been done to change the band's sound. The band is more rock orientated than previous line ups. Even though I enjoyed the jazz-like meanderings of Chris Hackett, Sim Cain, and Melvin Gibbs, I also like a band that can flat-out rock. This band can do that. I saw them live on Backstage at 54 about a month and plan on seeing them in NY when they come through. The band was tight, poweful, and seemed to inspire Rollins to really put it all into his own performance. Maybe this album will disappoint some Rollins fans, but I like the new direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Hard Rock Album","review":"You can always count on some good rock and roll from Rollins. This one is a throwback to the earlier Rollins Band albums. More pure rock and roll instead of the slow-fast-slow-fast formula on the last 2 or 3 albums. If you just want to jam, this is for you. Be sure to check out Rollins when he tours this time. I saw them about six months ago when he was out to break in the new band, and they were incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duff Mackegan Probably wants his bass back","review":"If you're a serious Rollins BAND fan, not just a Henry Rollins fan, you will be hugely disappointed by this album. Where the Rollins Band was pushing the envelope of the hard rock genre with both of it's first two lineups, this new regurgitated 80's metal falls flat, HARD. Don't expect the creativity of either of the first two lineups, or any knowledge of any other kind of music that isn't driven by mindless powercords & hammer-ons. Sadly enough, the 'Rollins Band' has become completely irrevolent. On the consistent side, Rollins continues his descent into the vocal mediocrity of the past couple albums. Unfortunately for him, he no longer has the band to carry him."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Monster","review":"Damn, that's a good song! The most rock-n-roll Rollins to date and that's fine by me.

After all those years with a steller, top shelf, amazing, band behind him he comes out with this. I'll buy it because I have all of Henry's stuff, but I probably won't listen to it. Henry, if you read this, please get the old band back. I would hate to see it all end this way... P.S. the spoken word projects are 10 stars all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devoid of all creativity.","review":"This is nothing Rollins didn't do a thousand times better on \\"End of silence\\". The band are an average 70's bar band, Rollins lyrics are so weak it's embarrassing and his vocals have about as much bite as Sammy Hagars.Save your money and listen to End of silence - the last album he actually said anything on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Henry's fallen ... can he get back up?","review":"I became slightly suspicious of Mr. Rollins when I saw him hosting VH1's \\"The List\\" (Is he a musician or a celebrity? Only his hairdresser knows for sure.). Having been the Fanatico Numero Uno of his other releases in the 90's, I was also slightly suspicious when I noticed that he had a NEW BAND. Gibbs/Hasket/Cain were absolute masters of their domain. Why would anyone get rid of them? But I decided to trust Henry, who had always delivered the goods up to that point. He and his former mates set a tough, tough standard that is beyond exacting. I bought this, and was immediately disappointed by the effort. The new band sounds like generic testosterock shredders/wankers, churning out faceless boogie/grunge/hard rock. The material is hurting. We now know that the quality of Henry's sidemen make or break the effort. This one is broke. History will prove me right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your cash","review":"This recording does not even deserve 1 star. I have been a fan of Henry since the Black Flag days. I have been listening to the Rollins Band from the early days and this is the end. This is not even the same band that was known as the Rollins Band! The music on this effort is completely devoid of creativity. The guitarist has the worst vibrato I've ever heard and most of his bends are sloppy and don't hit the intended pitch. The vocals are boring and seem to have no goal other than reading the words written on the lyric sheetand the rhyming lyrics are adolescent (if that.) True Rollins Band fans will not enjoy this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rollins Band - 'Get Some Go Again' (Dreamworks)","review":"Henry Rollins returns with 'Get Some...' that features an all new band backing him,with Jim Wilson-guitar,Marcus Blake-bass and Jason Mackenroth-drums.Basically,just good underground alternative punk.A couple of guests on this CD are Thin Lizzy's guitarist Scott Gorham and former MC5 guitarist Wayne Kramer.Tunes I liked best were \\"Love's So Heavy\\",\\"I Go Day Glo\\",\\"Let Yourself Down\\" and Thin Lizzy's \\"Are You Ready\\"(featuring Gorham).Very decent piece of work here,I thought.Just might appeal to fans of Primus,Melvins,Gone,Bad Brains and Faith No More."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Henry","review":"Just picked up the cd, kept hitting the repeat button on the cd player.

But, with Glass Mask, in seconds, each window pane can be masked off and paint ready. No lining up blue tape and trimming each inside corner (that's 24 per window for me). Still want to not glob on paint as each is done...but slips of the wrist and attempts to get into every nook and cranny do not cause repeated frustration. After painting, clean up is simple. Just come back with a razor scraper when the paint is dry and quickly remove the glass mask. Vacuum up the leavings, and voila! Beautiful, professional-looking paint job. My only challenge is I currently cannot find this product locally, so I may have to buy online and pay shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Pretty Good","review":"Works pretty good.

The directions instruct you to twist the screws on both sides of the treadmill to either loosen or tighten the belt. The treadmill also comes with an electronic display that tracks speed, distance, time, and calories (battery included). The only bad thing about the electronic display was it never cuts off unless you take the battery out. When folding the treadmill you will have to unscrew a certain piece from the bottom of the treadmill, fold it up, and put the screw back in at the top.Also, the tighter the belt....the harder it is to walk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work Like I Thought","review":"For anyone thinking a small manual treadmill might be the way to go, you may want to think again.

But I soon found out that manual treadmills are a hell of a lot of work, they are much harder to use than a motor driven treadmill is.As others have stated this thing has no height adjustment on the rear, so in my experience the angle this treadmill sits at means I end up going a lot faster than I would like, and the tension adjustment seems to do next to nothing in terms of changing the speed. I ended up having to build a small wood platform on the back so I could adjust the level of the treadmill as needed.Also after only one use 3 screws holding the bottom part together were already stripped out and I had to re-secure them with wood glue, so its not exactly the best built treadmill you will ever find either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat","review":"This treadmill is a piece of junk! We followed the instructions, but could never get the belt tight enough. The monitor kept falling off and the belt kept moving to the left until it started to fold over.

It took a little while to get used to, but once I got the hang of this it is a great product. The cost was in my price range and I like the idea that you have to use your own power to make it work.

My husband picked this out, thinking he'd like it more than the electric treadmill (he doesn't like the noise, I wear headphones when I use it). But it was wobbly, he thought the wobbliness would disappear once he was walking, but instead it broke.Major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, Very Noisy....Too irritating to want to exercise on the unit","review":"I received it today and put it together myself and it's terrible. I didn't expect the world, but I did expect the noise level to not be as bad as it was. The grating noise it generates is because the belt (no matter how tight you make it) hangs just enough at the bottom to touch the 2 metal guides that keep the belt on track. The grating noise is so bad, I really have no intention of using the machine again and after putting it together I really don't have the strength to take it apart to return it. Bad buy.Update* I fixed the noise issue but the track jerks and you can't get a good walking pace because it slips and jerks as you walk on it. If I make it loose, it will move to the left or the right, If I tighten, the tread won't move..Update** I'm right now trying to figure out how to fit it into my small garbage can outside. What a waste of money...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Even tightening the belt the fullest, it was too lose to use. Don't buy if you're over 6' tall. Arrived with a broken computer circuit board. Piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delivered Friday. In trash bin Sunday.","review":"This thing was so infuriating, I trashed it within 48 hours of receiving it. It had a mind of its own. The belt kept going to the right no matter what I did. I followed the directions diligently. I loosened the belt, centered it, and it immediately went right despite my doing the adjustments given in the manual.I did get about 3 minutes of exercise before the belt folded over and I could do nothing with it. I was so infuriated, I just wanted to get rid of it, and I did. I had a Denise Austin one before and had no trouble with it for over a year. Bit this contraption had a mind of its own.According to the other reviewers, I guess I just got a lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt way too loose!! Won't adjust correctly!","review":"After reading reviews for this product, I thought I would be getting a treadmill that presented somewhat of a workout challenge and expected it to work well seeing how it seemed like a pretty simple product. I was wrong!! First, the belt is way too loose! I followed the instructions on tightening the belt, but it still is way too loose. Once I get on it, it goes so fast that I could practically fall of the back of it if I wasn't holding on. And the belt also slips, it will go a little slower and then all of a sudden go really fast which makes your walking motion way too uneven. One of the main reasons I got it is because I read it would give my legs a workout, but it moves so fast I can hardly stay on. Also the electric box does not work. What a pain!! Last thing I want to do is send this huge thing back, but guess that is what I will have to do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good treadmill, good price","review":"The Phoenix treadmill was a great price, a few dollars less that other similar ones I had researched, and this one held a higher weight capacity. It works better than I had anticipated. When you are walking on it, the belt moves very smoothly. Set-up was relatively easy. The only down side is that the wire the connects the treadmill to the monitor was missing the connector piece, so the monitor does not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good slow jogging machine.","review":"I've had this treadmill for about a month and so far it is functioning very well.

I recommend an electric treadmill, even if it costs more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be happier!","review":"I received this product much sooner than expected, delivery was excellent.The treadmill was extremely easy to assemble, all the parts were included as were tools.

The picture quality is the absolute worst. This is a major rip-off and the company that released it should refund everyone's money. Who's idea was it to over-dub the theme song? Give me a break! I will certainly make a note of the releasing agent of this disc and NOT PURCHASE anything else with their name on it!! Shame on you! Junk, junk, junk!!I want to see the entire series transferred with SUPERIOR quality and sound, with no rediculous over-dubbing or edits. Whoever owns the rights to the show needs to sell permission to a QUALIFIED DVD entertainment group. I think Mr. Haney had something to do with this fiasco.Since I wrote this review, better DVD's have been released; MPI and Paramount. Both contain the original music and much, much better video.

Thats a misleading ripoff!(and not cheap for these items)Especially for a show with such a noteable theme. Not only did they use this irritatingly cheezy, and irrelevant banjo jam, that doesn't even match. But your can hear where they spliced it over the original, and in some cases, you even hear reminents of the original underneath creating cacophony. SHAME, shame shame,on whoever decided to produce this.It ruins the whole show.They probably paid some sap $20. to sit in his living room and jam to a cassette, and then retained the copyright. Meanwhile, Curt Massey's name remains on the credits. They also abused the Beverly Hillbillies expensive Dvd sets with this same track!!I think in a perfect world, Curt Massey, and Flat & Scruggs shoult get ALL the revenues for this piracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon forgot this info...","review":"Anyone who is interested in Petticoat Junction videos may already have these particular episodes, which seem to be a couple of the easiest to obtain.

The program themselves may be public domain, but the theme song may not be. Hence, they can release the video, which is no longer copywrited (may have lapsed for whatever reason), but they cannot release a recording of the theme song, which is probably still under copywrite.Thus, they dubbed over the theme song and relesed a cheap-o version of the video.You fans of this show will just have to wait for a decent release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Petticoat Junction","review":"It arrived asap however, three of the 4 shows on this disk don't play. They were damaged. I was very disappointed. I think the seller should have watched the show before shipping. I never watch the show because I can only get one and a half of the 4 episodes to play.

After my first listen I thought it was pretty cool. Repeated listenings reveal an artist attempting to make an 'artistic statment' that falls short of anything memorable. 'Back In 1999' is the only keeper here. The less said about the 2 attempts at social commentary the better--'I Might Look White' is an embarrassment and the cliche-ridden 'Bisexual Chick' would have sounded dated in 1980 (what, no reference to Birkenstocks?).About the most original thing here is the title of the CD. And a quick search on Amazon reveals at least two other recent CDs with the same title by other artists. There's nothing here that hasn't been done better by others. This guy is a poser.When I took this CD to my local used CD store to sell it, they wouldn't even take it. It seems Oszajca's label had flooded the market with promo copies. Not a good sign.

Now everywhere in the internet is saying HP has claimed that Jornada 545 is capable of display 4096 colors (12 bits) and will not allow to return the good because HP Jornada \\"LCD itself\\" is capable to display 65k colors. I am very upset right now as I feel cheated. In the Pockec PC setting, it does indicated 16 bits but the graphics IC is processing 12 bits color to display on 16 bits color LCD screen.

A pretty major difference.From what I understand, the Casio E-115 is the only true 16-bit display PocketPC unit.This bit of product revisionism aside, the 545 is a fine piece of gadgetry. Too bad I didn't know about the display quality until too late...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharon didn't have enough lines!","review":"This is your typical empty-headed surfer dude/chick movie with Sharon Tate playing the part of a beach bunny who practically lives at the beach (along her other \\"job\\" - a skydiver). She looked absolutely fantastic (as always) but it was sad to see how few lines she had throughout the film (if she had two full pages of script, it would have been a miracle).Tony Curtis played the part of a guy who was moving to California and winds up losing all his posessions in one fell swoop on his first day there and moves in with Claudia Cardinale's character (who lives high thanks to her sugar daddy). He winds up selling pools for a living.Although the movie is cute, the plot isn't complicated at all. It seemed as though Curtis and Claudinale didn't have anything else to do at the time and Tate was contracted to perform here.I enjoyed this but, when it comes to seeing Sharon's comedic ability shine, \\"The Wrecking Crew\\" is a whole lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geeky Wi-Fi Goodness","review":"I was hoping that this book would help me boost my Wi-Fi signal around the house, since the reception downstairs is a little weak.

If you want to run a Hunter chronicle buy the Vampire or Werewolf or whatever WOD rulebook. The rules are the same and to play a mortal human isn't that different from what a player should already know.Analogue to tribes or clans hunters are distinguished in this book by their reason to hunt and their ways to do it. This is boring!On the other hand, Hunter: The Reckoning innovates the imbued, a term for special super-human abilities. Forget these rules, make up your own. It will be much more intriguing. And most of all I guess in the real world only one in a thousand humans have supernatural abilities. The book implies, that almost every hunter is imbued. That kills the spirit of the World of Darkness. Humans are by definition mortals. They are not that strong, not that fast and not that powerful. They are human. Play it like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunting for a good Hunter game","review":"Well, I met only disappointment in my purchase of this book, despite high expectations. I have come to expect only the best from White Wolf, and this product is definietly below par for them. It seems almost that they lost their touch on this one. It lacks the edge of previous releases such as Vampire and Werewolf. However, the best products to compare it too would be the other individual Hunter titles like The Inquisition, Project Twilight, etc. Granted, they set out to have a common man Hunter title, but it comes off contrived and weak in comparison to the aforementioned titles.I would refer the discerning gamer to the other Hunter titles for a good game of hunting down the monsters of the WoD, and to pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Questions and Answers on The Science of Mind","review":"A pretty good read.

If you have a wealth of patterns-related material, it may probably be a good addition, providing an extensive index (or more precisely multiple cross-indexes) to patterns and patterns-related publications and resources.

Since I have owned a Kitchenaid mixer for about 18 years with no problems, I thought I'd give this a whirl (pun intended). It's absolutely worthless, it won't even puree soup, let alone crush ice. Other reviewers have mentioned how the jar fits straight down on the base. I just wasn't comfortable with that and thought it was only a matter of time before I absentmindedly attempted to unscrew it and caused a giant mess. It's now sitting in my pantry awaiting a garage sale. I bought another Oster, the Professional series with the simple toggle on/off switch. While not totally amazing like the old one, it's much, much better than this Kitchedaid. And less expensive, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Term Power","review":"We received this blender as a wedding gift a number of years ago.

Once it's started overheating, forget about getting anything productive out of it. It will only work in short spurts and not at full power.

I figured since my experience with my KitchenAid stand mixer has been nothing but outstanding, I couldn't go wrong with their blender.Let me sum it up for you: It's big and heavy -- the base alone weighs about 10 lbs. It's clunky to use -- lifting it off of the stand is awkward. And ultra-power? Hardly. It's like buying a Ferrari and getting Yugo (you remember those, right?) horsepower when you step on the gas.This is coming from a gal whose main use is whipping up some protein shakes and frozen drinks, so it may be different for you. But unless you enjoy powerlifing in your kitchen instead of the gym, go with another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upshot: look elsewhere","review":"I could list all the things I didn't like about this blender, but I won't. You might wonder how anyone could screw up something as simple as a blender, and the only thing I can figure is that when they designed this one, they felt that they needed to do it in a way that differentiated it from other blenders that have been popular for a long time. The result is a confirmation of the wisdom in the old saying: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I didn't use mine enough to have any of the failure problems described in various reviews here because I hated using the thing. Okay, I'll tell you one things I didn't like about it. It wouldn't blend a banana into a protein shake, no matter how long I let it run. Why spend money on a blender that won't blend?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Motor - POOR design","review":"I bought this blender in 2001, thinking \\"Kitchenaid can't go wrong\\" well I was wrong.

It is made of rubber, rubber on steel need I say more? After contacting Kitchenaid direct, I have to pay $18 to have it shipped back to them, then they will let me know how much it is to fix it, then I have to pay shipping back to me. A one year warranty is fine, but rubber on steel????

I bought a waring bar blender instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This blender is not very good","review":"How this blender got an editor's choice award is beyond me. I have had this blender since I got married 7 years ago. It has never crushed ice completely. Doesn't matter how much liquid you put in the container - it just doesn't do the job. Always end up with chunks of ice. Takes an eternity to smoothly puree anything. The lid has a detachable foam piece which falls out when you clean it, and it gets discolored and unable to be fully cleaned. The motor seems pretty wimpy too. It's ok for soups and other soft foods, but if you want something that crushes ice, this is not the one. Get an Osterizer. Same price, but way better motor, chopping blades, and construction. What used to take me 10 minutes now takes 10 seconds. No joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I should have read the 10/6 review before I bought this on 10/9.

We were excited to once again bring it back out of its box and rev it up to make some drinks. After using it less then 10 times the blade froze up and I thought \\"No big deal\\" I'll just order a replacement one right.

I called Kitchenaid about it and was given some nonesense about 'planned wearing' to protect other components. In other words the failing rotor is a intended design aspect. I've had it just over 2 years, and now to replace the rotor is a 25 dollar service charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality construction, but doesn't get the job done","review":"This blender is well constructed, powerful, quiet, easy to clean, safe, and attractive. The wide opening at the bottom makes it easy to remove thicker foods.Unfortunately, I never use it. The shape of the food container is such that the food is not efficiently funneled towards the blades. The result is uneven blending, with food chunks of all sizes in the mix. The longer you blend, the smaller the variously-sized chunks get, but the results are never completely smooth and even.I get much better use from a battery-powered blender that I paid less than 20 bucks for. Its motor can't compare, and it's a pain to use, but it produces consistently even blends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad blades","review":"I too had a problem with the blades no longer working, I have gone through 2 sets of blades and KitchenAid said there are no replacement parts but offered to sell me a new machine...

The design of the coupler is weak, it seems to be a compromise for a blender that doesn't lock while blending.

However, I'm not sure if these things will tip the scale against other makers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for green smoothie","review":"My main purpose of use of this product is for making green smoothie every morning and it works great. Some reviews noted that it leaves chunks of vege/fruits, and it does if you put too much water or liquid first.

It worked perfectly, until the rubber COUPLER that was mentioned earlier got worn out. Now I find that Kitchen Aid has no replacement. It took two years to happen but eventually it has to happen. Bummer the stainless steel container, the blade and the motor have a long life expectancy, but can't get a replacement part to make it work! If I was Kitchen Aid, and I knew about this flaw I would not continue to sell this to unknowing consumers. I saw a vita mix at a local home show the other day. It is guaranteed for 7 years and the coupler is not made of rubber.It is a very sturdy metal coupler. What does that tell you?

However, if you are looking to puree fruits and vegetables look elsewhere. The blades are \\"Blunt\\" made to crush ice, look at the blades of other blenders and you will see the difference. The sharpened edge is likely to chip when crushing ice, but these blunt edged blades are not effective in cutting up, pureeing foods. My jar also leaked badly, but when this was brought to KitchenAid attention, they replaced the jar base. I asked about the pureeing, and was told to slightly freeze the fruit or vegetables, not always practicable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift From My Hubby","review":"I like this blender because it is nice to look at on the kitchen counter-top.

It literally stripped the threads and broke the bolt. Wow. Now it's out of warranty, and broke off two teeth (not suprising, since they're plastic). Sadly, a large motor and a solid blade mean nothing if the the connection can't handle the power, and it can't, even with the step start function.So if you want a powerful, solid, great looking blender that MIGHT last you a year, this is the one for you. I personally will be replacing it with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milkshakes? - not a chance","review":"I use a blender every morning to make a milkshake and after 5 years of using cheap ones which blew up every couple of years I decided to splash out and buy an expensive one.

I love it, don't understand what all the complaints are about. Mine always blends ice smoothly. I never have to stop and push anything in the container down which means the funneling works very well. Easy to clean and remove food from the wide mouth container and it pours just fine. It makes a wonderful smoothie(I make 2-3 servings at a time) as well as anything else that needs blending. I am getting ready to buy one for my daughter. It is also easy to clean with the smooth surface base, no food getting stuck around the push buttons or dial. The gears on the motor and blender base may be plastic, but they are substantial, so I anticipate no problems with breaking.

They look great together.The problem is with making smoothies. Frozen fruit is apparently hard to push around. It catches on the sides and jambs the blade.The blade is spun by this small black toothed gear attached to the top of the motor. It's made of a rubberized plastic type material which is molded over a metal piece. That connection will break as experienced by other users.I'll assume that that type of mixing may have not been anticipated by the engineers.

And careful when you remove the blender from the base -- I made the mistake of torquing the handle a bit and ended up removing the bottom plastic portion that holds the blades in place and seals the bottom. Result: more stuff on the counter. I've always ended up with ice chunks as well, no matter how long I blended (last count was 5 minutes).

I have found that this blender does just that. It is a powerful machine with a nice wide bottom to it so everything mixes up very well. It is very sturdy so you can feel comfortable with filling it up and letting it go. My only complaint is that along with the wide bottom, the blender is not made like others around the base, and it takes a few tries in getting used to how this one rests on the base of the mixer. All in all I give this one a big thumbs up if you are looking upgrade from that 30 dollar mixer that we all have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comes in Stainless also!","review":"I bought the stainless steel instead of glass It's unbreakable and I love it!

However, on about the 16th time, the blade assembly broke and the blade wouldn't spin. When I called KitchenAid, they sold me another one for $20 plus s&h. Then, I started using it more, mainly to puree soup and make fruit smoothies. Both came out okay, but often a little lumpy, plus the lid always leaked if it was half full or more. Within two years, the same thing happened to the blade! When I called KitchenAid again, they offered to sell me a reconditioned one for $30--as if I would give them anymore money for shoddy products! I'm doing more research to buy a new one--not a KitchenAid this time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low price, but comes with serious flaw.","review":"This blender is just ok for the money.I gave it one star because there is a serious problem with the blade assembly. After light use for about 6months, I have found that liquid leaks out the blade shaft underneath. This is evident as a build-up of a thin ring of mould on the casing around the shaft, as liquid is thrown off the spinning shaft (I didn't think one needed to scrub out the underneath - its supposed to be water-tight!).It now runs roughly, in contrast to the smooth operation when I first purchased it.I am not sure whether others have noted this problem. Perhaps it is a quality control issue and I had the misfortune to get a dud.I do not recommend this blender. Overall, I wish I had saved my money for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It cannot puree","review":"I got this as a christmas present so I felt bad selling it, but I had to. It seemed like such a bummer that such a well constructed and powerful blender can't liquify anything (even though it's got a button for that). The blender has a deliberately DULL blade and I could never can a reasonably smooth puree. There's a lot of nice things to say about this blender and it's very easy to take apart and clean. Which is why I was hoping KitchenAid would have a SHARP replacement blade somehow available (think of their mixers and how much attachment stuff they make for that). That would make all the difference in the world to just swap a sharp blade in for soups, and putting the dull one back in for crushing ice or whatever. As far as I know, they don't make a sharp blade for this. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"It will break","review":"The black coupler will break and you'll need to get that part replaced.

Don't crush ice with it!","review":"Several reviewers suggested that the blender can be used to crush ice. Don't do it! My primary use for blenders is making fruit juice slushies. Unfortunately, an ice cube wedged between the blade and the bottom of the jar and the plastic rotor -- not sure what you call it, but the piece that couples the base to the blender blade -- ended up in little pieces. I suspect getting the blender repaired wouldn't be worth the time and cost, so the blender will be going into the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A defective product - don't buy","review":"There is a flaw in the design of the blade. Our KitchenAid blender is now toast because the blade assembly became un-soldered so the spinning of the motor does not spin the blade.

I use mine every morning for protein shakes and I always have banana chunks left over at the bottom. The design of the plastic base that is attached to the glass is also poor. If you leave the unit assembled while in the dishwasher you get about two cups of water after it runs through the cycle.

The book is a quick read (210 short pages) and I read it in one sitting. The story centers on a shark attack while surfing but the details are not too grim for young readers.

She loved the book and wrote a book report on it. This is a true account written by Bethany Hamilton. She wrote her thoughts down, and a writer wrote the story for her. It's a great book of encouragement and faith by her whole family. Her father and mother and both her brothers are wonderful people. Bethany is a lucky girl to be alive, and have a wonderful family. She is also selling parfumes for boys and girls that are shaped like surf boards. Soon a movie is going to be made about this story. I am dying to see it, and compare it to her book. This is a wonderful story, read it, and you won't be sorry. Bethany is a very brave girl, and an encouragement to us all! I wonder though, if they were avid surfers, didn't they know that you shouldn't surf so early, when sharks come in to feed? The water was calm and glassy, not even the kind one would want to try and surf in. Only God would know....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the movie, don't bother with the book","review":"I saw the movie and loved it. I got the audio book from the library. They leave out so much of the story. There was 15 minutes of just explaining surfer terms, and then probably 30 minutes of her talking about the girl who starred for her in the movie. This part of the book must have been added later??? I assume the book came out first? Usually people say books are better than the movie, not this time! Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boringgg!!!!!","review":"Personally I would not recommend this book unless you are a full on Christian. For more than half the book all she talks about is how all she did was pray and that God got her through all of her problems, and how her church and faith helped her most. The book was very boring, and every page was like the page before. My mind would always wander when I would read, because there was nothing exiting. So this is probably not the best book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tells A Good Tale But Could Be Better","review":"This is a good inspirational story except it got slow at times and boring.

In my own personal experience, I am able to relate to her story through the struggles and hardships of sports just like she had. Bethany learned took work through her struggles trying to surf with one arm. Just like we do with are troubles with school, sports, and other activities, to help us get to our destination in life. People told Bethany that she might not be able to surf again just like we tell our selves that we cant do that sport or i cant do that homework because it's too hard.

Bethany has a rather matter of fact attitude to her predicament, taking it in stride. I read it last year on a trip to Oahu where I got a fin to the head and nine stitches, and as I lay there bleeding I thought how horrible it must have been for her and how my problem paled in comparison. While her attitude is based on her strong religious up bring, the message is not overly strong and is fine for any one's beliefs.

This scanner has issues with the CD installation. Sometimes it quits working and I have to reinstall. It never seems to install the same way twice. When I can get it to install enough that I can actually scan, the software requires many more steps to actually get a document/graphic/photo scanned than the older scanner.

I've talked to many people who had Epsons and they all had problems of various kinds.For the good: It scannes the old pictures very well. I come from a very \\"old\\" family and we have lots of pictures from 1800's. They turned out very good and easy to restore with editing software like the photoshop.For the not-so-good: The software is a bit \\"clunky\\". Seems like it has too many tools that do the same job.

The slide scans were unusable. Also, it took forever for the lamp to warm up, so even if I had just scanned a photo/slide, I would still have to wait up to 2 minutes for the lamp to warm up again so I could make another scan. I'm returning this unit and looking for another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless for slides/negatives!","review":"Despite some reviews, I took the chance that the slide and negative scanning abilities of the HP 3970 *might* be ok... they are NOT. Whatever the specs may say, you can only scan up to 2 negatives or 1 slide at a time. The lamp DOES have to warm up AGAIN after each scan session, even if your last one was just moments before. This makes just waiting for a preview excruciating! Next, the scan time to actually scan a negative at only 300 dpi is about 45-60 sec.Long and short- this scanner was set up and tested and now is going back to the store... all within about 1 hour.I didn't even bother trying the regular image scan functions, as all I'm really interested in right now is scanning negatives and slides. I'm sure the basic functions are good, as HP does have a decent rep for flatbed scans.The software installed easily though in Windows XP Pro. It did seem a bit clunky, but I didn't bother playing with it enough to let it bother me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check system compatibility FIRST","review":"I chose HP 3970 assuming it was good quality for the price, and that it would be easy to use with my HP Pavilion PC. It is a nice scanner, although a little slow, + does a decent job scanning, BUT the drivers/software is incompatible with a large number of systems. I learned this too late (after my 30 day return period), for i had only done test scans of photos and transparent materials, and a RESTART of my pc, not a cold boot. My pc will not cold boot with the scanner software installed, as there is a conflict with the NVIDIA video chipset which came with the HP pc. So, now i have a new scanner i cannot use without great pains. The next shopper should be forewarned to go to www.hp.com and search for the 3970's known incompatibilities BEFORE spending money. Good luck! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scanjet 3970","review":"After 2+ hours with a technician on the phone, we have concluded that it will not work on my PC for an unknown reason.

I have to say though that I did read all the reviews that I could and in my mind none of them realy helped. I was not expecting the HP3970 to meet my standerds of a good scanner, but at the same time I did only pay $100 for it. Well to get to the point, I am totaly amazed by this scanner. Not only did the photos turn out wonderful it scanned about 16 photos in 10 min. I am impressed to say the least. Nor did I have any problems installing the software. It walks you through the entire setup and install. The only way I can see anyone having a problem with the software was if there was something wrong with their computer be for they start. I only buy HP and will never buy anything else. If you are wanting to scan a large or even a small amount this scanner will do it for you in moteration. One more thing that I found to be a plus was you can scan your slides and 35mm negatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"F- Terrible Don't Get Worst Scanner Ever Worst Image Quality","review":"Some of the reviewers on Amazon.com are in left field looking at right.

The image quality of this scanner is so abysmal, its attrocious. If you're still stupid enough to buy this, after reading this review, then you and this scanner deserve each other. I also had alot of problems installing the software on my XP system, but I would have forgiven HP for that, if this was any good. Before that I had an HP 5200C scanner that was totally superior to this in terms of quality of the image scaned. The amount of DPI's I used made no difference in the scan- it plain stunk.

Mine always come out looking too bright, and I try to adjust it in my program but it never works quite right. I wish this worked, but I can live without it.Like I said before, I have had this scanner for a good amount of time and never had problems.

I was happy with this product until recently after not using it for months. The problem is when attempting to scan in color, I get a bright orange tone one one half of the image and a bright yellow tone on the the other half of the image. When in black and white mode, I get a black image on one half and a streaked black image on the right. Since I have two computers, I loaded the software on my second computer and connected the scanner. In this case, the problem did not go away. I contacted HP via the chat format and after 45 minutes trying this and that nothing worked. Now I have a two hundred dollar paper weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"I just wanted to warn everyone about this scanner. Now it does scan regular items like documents and large pics well, its 35mm slide and negative scans are very poor. I cleaned off the the plate and the film and still got a cloudy image. I know the image is not off because I view it with a slide viewer and the image is crystal clear. Every setting I've changed does not improve the image. Also startup sounds like a construction site. If you're looking for a simple scanner for a cheap price then by all means, but if you're a serious hobbyist then really look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad scanner","review":"I got this unit about two months ago. As other users have indicated with their units, my scanner has begun making a shrieking sound which is quite unbearable. The unit never scanned very well, and now it barely scans at all. This HP product is very attractive and well priced, but what does that mean if a piece of hardware is poor? It took me a while to figure out that the scanner was making the shrieking sound. I thought my computer was dying. I've had many scanners and never encountered anything like this before. Reading reviews here and elsewere has actually confirmed my suspicions that this is some type of design defect. I used an Agfa SnapScan 1212u for almost 8 years without a problem. I \\"upgraded\\" because I wanted a faster (USB-2 as opposed to USB-1) scanner, and a unit that had slide and film transfer capabilites. This scanner was never much faster than my Agfa and the quality is on much, much lower. Terrible. I would advise anyone reading this to buy another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap !","review":"I purchased this unit on March 15, 2005, and it has already failed.

So fair warning on this unit, or anything from HP...they sell crap...but at a good price?! You get what you pay for...and sometimes less.

I have the HP Scanjet 6200 (at work and home). It uses HP's Precision Scan Pro software, which works great and gives me the functionality I need for scanning images in various file formats for desktop publishing. When I needed to purchase a second scanner for a colleague at work, I bought the Scanjet 3970. I was disappointed. I agree with many of the reviewers here that the software is extremely poor. My biggest complaint is that you can't scan images in vector format with this software (for use in Illustrator or other vector programs). The HP Precision Scan Pro software does this beautifully but it is not available for this scanner. [I hear the newer versions of Illustrator have a tracing feature that converts bitmap images to vector, so that might be a solution.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get software to work","review":"I bought this scanner to replace a piece of crap UMAX scanner that I got free with a Dell PC purchase. This scanner was not much better. The only way I could get it to scan is by using XP scanning. First of all, the box was missing all software and instructions. I tried to download the appropriate software online and it would not install properly. I called customer support and they sent me a CD in the mail 5 days later that was supposed to have the correct software on it. It was the same crappy software that I downloaded a week before on the internet. Calling customer support again, I became frustrated when the individual, barely speaking English could not help me. I am returning the scanner and buying a better quality product. For all you people who had flawless installs, I don't know what you did but I don't have the patience to put up with this piece of crap anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"An HP Miss","review":"I found the software cumbersome, and always used software that came with my Samsung. Scans turned out fine, but speed was slow.After six months of use I started getting error messages. After corresponding with the e-mail tech support, I determined that it is a problem with the TMA lamp. Even though the TMA is in the lid, it involves a problem in the base that disables the entire scanner. I had just assembled some negatives and slides to use with the TMA, but never got to use it before the unit died.The tech support system worked well to pinpoint the problem, but it was some time, a lot of emails, and a phone call before someone told me that it was out of warrantee. (I am sorry, I don't remember all the warrantee periods for everything I buy.) This went on after I had already given my date of purchase early in the process. You would think that HP would train its support staff to notice this earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor software, poor copies, great photos with patience","review":"With some effort, I was amazed at the great photo copying ability of the scanner although the software makes you want to smash it immediately. Very difficult to use and resets itself at every opportunity. As a copier for text documents it is HORRIBLE!!! Using the print mode on a text document yields pixelated, grainy unreadable prints. This is TOTALLY unacceptable! Isn't that what a scanner is supposed to do first and then for the additional money be a good photo copier? Like one other reviewer, my HP scanner now also has a greasy fog on the inside of the glass plate. Wonderful. I wasted weeks trying to untangle the software difficulties and now am ready to leave this junk on the doorstep of the seller and buy a Canon Scanner like I should have done in the first place. Do not waste your money. HP needs to do a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The software is terrible, look for something else","review":"I decided to buy this scanner so i could scan slides in since my canoscan N670U cant do slides or negatives. First it took forever to warm and scan. then the scan would come out in totally wrong colors, i had to use auto level in adobe to fix it, then it still looked blue tinted.The software is a joke. you can save your seting but not make it load it each time it starts up. so you have to re load it everytime. it gets annoying quick.then while i was looking at the scanner bed i noticed that under the glass its all cloudy in one of the corners.the picture quality froma scanned photo looks the same as my canon and that thing is fairly old. im gonna return this piece of hp junk and keep my canon.there should be a negative star option for this product"},{"rating":"1","title":"This scanner is unusable for slides/negatives","review":"I normally like HP products, so I was extremely disappointedin this scanner. The software is pretty bad (e.g., theresolution setting kept going back to 200 dpi when I selected ahigher resolution). This is the third scanner I've owned,and by far the worst. The scanner is agonizingly slow, andevery slide I scanned turned out green, regardless of thesettings I selected. I played around with the various settingsand tried for hours to get an acceptable image from thisscanner. The green images were the clincher for me - I'mreturning this scanner ASAP and plan to purchase anEpson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! 3 Am Madness!","review":"I am going to burn this thing!

God, the black hole, loves dogs who fight bulls and England needs to rule the world but needs dogs in order to dominate the globe. WTF? I couldn't get past to page 50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: NOT alt history","review":"Amazon recommended this book to me and having read the description of the content and the praise in some of the comments about it this seemed justified. Even if I had some doubts its basic idea, namely that the Boer War was an event that defined the beginning of the decline of the British Empire, is one I share. Being also a fan of alt history I ordered the book and started to read. I got as far as page 132 before I decided to quit.Since I neither own a bulldog nor ever aspire to do so I guess I was disqualified from enjoying it. Because this book is NOT alt history but should rather be qualified as fantasy. God makes an appearance and tells us that a) the Jews are His chosen people and b) that bulldogs are his chosen dogs.Sometimes amazon lures you into buying trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"I have been remiss in not getting a review of this book done sooner. The novel is extradorinaly well written and weaves a complex, yet engaging tale. Of special note is the use of dogs throuhout the book as both a symbol and metaphor. However, this is not a book just for dog lovers--I have had several friends read the book who are CAT LOVERS-- and they loved the book too! Fans of history will find special enjoyment in the novel.

This CD just makes me want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Parents of Celiac Kids!!!","review":"Like most parents, we were pretty shell-shocked by my 5 yr old son's diagnosis. I spent hours on the Internet researching Celiac Disease. Problem was, most of the information was geared towards adults. My initial response was less concerned with what he could eat and more concerned with how am I going to make sure he feels \\"normal\\"? What will I pack for lunch at school? How can I send him to school without something happening? How will I deal with the 5 birthday parties he has in the next month? Danna Korn's book answered all of those questions and the other 1000 I forgot to think of. This book is a life saver. My son started Kindergarten 3 days ago and I feel like all is well. I read it cover to cover in one night. As parents of celiac kids, we are not alone. Danna Korn helps you see that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"This books is a must read for parents of children with Celiac Disease. Danna Korn helps you realize that with a little change and advance planning, you and your family can live a normal life. Danna explains the hurdles you'll encounter and the challenges you will face, but she also reassuringly provides you with ways to overcome them. I bought multiples copies of this book to give to family, friends, school officials and anyone else who is regularly involved with my child. After reading this book, you will understand this is not a rare disease and you won't feel so isolated. Additionally, you will be well informed and well on your way to living a long and healthy life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for families!","review":"I bought this book to educate myself on celiac disease. We have discovered that our toddler has a wheat allergy, but are waiting to test her for celiac until she is older. In the meantime, we have eliminated gluten from her diet.I learned so much about the disease from this book and am more prepared in the event that our daughter is diagnosed. I was extremely stressed about about the possibility, but this book has eased my fears.I would recommend this book to anyone with children suffering from celiac disease. In fact, I'm considering buying if for other family members as well. It's great information for anyone dealing with celiac disease in their family or extended family!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I'm a big W.R. Burnett fan. I love his great crime novels: Little Caesar, High Sierra, Asphalt Jungle. When I stumbled upon this title, I thought, oh, this is going to be good. Unfortunately, it's not. It chronicles the game from the perspective of an anonymous, contrarian, supposedly wise ex-ballplayer. But the wisdom here seems very ill-considered, at times downright wrongheaded 40 years down the road. The whole take seems dated and tired. It's just no good -- and a real disappointment coming from Burnett."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun album!","review":"I love this album. Knew a few of the songs, like Let it Whip, but not much more than that. Was shocked that there is some really good stuff on here. Expected more filler. Everything from good party songs to ballads. Great harmony and rhythm.If you're a fan of bands like the Ohio Players or Dazz, you'll like this one. If you're looking for classic Motown, this isn't it. It's more like Lakeside or pop/funk stuff from the 80s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memories","review":"I remember when \\"Let it Whip\\" was a hit. Even though it is a good song, I didn't find much else on the CD that I liked; therefore, 2 stars is all I'm able to give it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves to be better-known","review":"This, the second in Bergman's \\"Faith\\" trilogy, is a dark, brooding tale of a clergyman who has lost his faith in God. Indeed, it is doubtful at all if he ever had it, for his vision of God is quite selfish. The action takes place on a single Sunday in November, where the town pastor (Gunnar Bjornstrand in an excellent performance) is finishing a service in front of a tiny congregation. During this day, the pastor will be forced to examine himself and to try to reach out for some human contact to replace the spiritual depletion within him. Also starring Max von Sydow, Gunnel Lindblom, and Ingrid Thulin as the schoolteacher who unselfishly offers herself to the pastor but is rejected in favor of the memory of his dead wife. This film has a subtle, deeply wrought poetry to it and should be seen by all lovers of intelligent cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"obscured by the darkness","review":"Winter Light was striking in its sordid irony...not just the title with the content, but the content with reality. A man \\"of the cloth\\", presumably one who knows and loves the God he represents to his flock, and in whose Name he works and speaks, is in fact an atheist wolf in sheep's clothing. The \\"pastor's\\" hypocrisy and vilification of Christianity reaped precisely what it sowed; the wretched distribution of despair. The moral of the movie; unbelief = hell. For that I give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real punch film!","review":"This is a heavy weight film in every little detail. A disillusioned priest in a small village will inquire himself for a lot of issues concerned with the free will, the faith and the eloquent silence of God, the coldness of living doing without about God's belief.This film is specially recommended for Bergman's buffs, but I would like to remind in a film of Robert Bresson : Dairy of a country priest. Watch first this last one film and please go for Winter light. You will find more similarities that you ever know.A challenging artwork that will dare you due its punching feature. This is the second film of the celebrate Trylogy initiated with through a glass darkly and eventually would culminate with The Silence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Australian rock and roll","review":"If you've seen this movie, you'll love the soundtrack. If you've not seen the movie, the music is great all by itself. Discover groups you've never heard of and songs that catch your ear on your first listen.

The footnotes and bibliography alone are worth the price. I would dare say that this is one of the most intensely researched works I have read in many years, and much of it sparked many \\"mind-maps\\" into correlative research (my highlighter went dry on this one!).

The overall organization of the book through an analogy with physical structure (exo-, endo-, etc.) puts an interesting spin on the collections of writing and architects' quotations that make up each chapter. Overall, I'd highly recommend Single-Family Housing, especially if you're interested in the connections between domestic architecture and the changing forms of today's society."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Libretto","review":"Regardless of the merits of the performance, there is no libretto included. I was able to find it all on the net, in french, without translation. I read french, so that's not a hardship, but having 70 pages of printout to deal with when I wantto listen to 2 CDs is a problem. I wouldn't have bought it had I known. And this is EMI!!! Even Erato includes a libretto. [...]That being said, Gretry is BRILLIANT. The songs are catchy, beautiful, tender, memorable.

This book is well researched and clearly proves that their was a thriving gay culture in San Francisco well before the Stonewall uprising in New York. The idea that San Francisco was able to sustain a gay community based upon its \\"wide open\\" ideology and its status as a shipping port and military base also helped further cement this position as a gay bulwark in America.

Two weeks ago I gave a copy to my brother-in-law, who just went through a divorce and was left with a mountain of bills and three children. He thinks there is no light at the end. I gave him the book and said \\"When you are ready to start getting things back on track, read this it will help\\" I did not lecture him, did not say read it now. When he is ready the book will guide him to a level of understanding that you can't reach until you are ready to reach it.

It is not the principles of this book that is genius but the reason for the principles. This book is a old book, but its content is protected by the writer ability to allow wisedom to flow within him on to paper. It is hard to believe that this book is fictional. It is! However the contents of this book are all real. This book can be the second best book to read to an open and insightful reader or the worst book. Its power is based on the the mindset of the reader. Once again, it is not the principles you read that makes it special it is the reasons for the principles.

The focus on paying off debt, making smart investments and \\"paying\\" yourself first was reiterated numerous times in various ways. I like the use of short stories to illustrate these points and, because it was repetitive, you couldn't miss the message. This is probably too simplistic for experienced investors but I bought it with the idea of sharing it with my younger friends and family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple, smart and straightforward","review":"The Richest Man in Babylon is a series of stories set in the ancient city of Babylon, where people of extreme wealth and extreme poverty existed side by side. The reader is a \\"fly on the wall\\" as those who seek wealth ask the advice of those who have learned how to generate it.George S. Clason has taken several simple money management principles and wrapped them in colorful stories of an ancient culture, which reminds us that financial struggles and the principles of how to escape them are timeless. This book has travelled the years well because the dialogue is already that of another time. The author has cleverly devised a way to show how these principles also apply today.This book will give you a solid foundation for how to handle your money and get it working for you.Larry Hehn, Author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Rich and Powerful Stories","review":"The book is just 144 pages long - I read it in 2 hours.

The other 9 stories are also interesting but the second story alone is worth more than the entire book.The cover of the book which I have says \\"more than two million copies sold,\\" and I am sure this small book has made those two million people - smart and rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for those who want to learn the most basic laws of money","review":"Great book!

It's not always smart unless you have a large down payment, at least 20%, and unless you get a great deal.Otherwise better to rent, live in your car/RV/van, live out in the country, or find free rent or negative rent opportunities. Or a combination of those.Free rent would be something like house sitting and negative rent would be a situation in which you are paid money to be a resident.With the money saved you could buy real estate at a time when it makes more sense than it does in current days.Jerry Katz"},{"rating":"2","title":"Richest Man In Babylon Review","review":"Interesting read!

Mind you Clason's book came before the two mentioned so he gets more credit.What he has over the others is the simplicity of the concepts and their digestable telling. He gives very basic but essential advice that would guide the reading of other more technical books.

It was published in 2011 by Myriad World Publishers. (The original book was published in 1926.)I bought this one to replace the copy I lent to a friend. The typography is TERRIBLE!!!! It's so small I'd need a strong magnifying glass for every page, and it's laid out quite strangely and unattractivly. I agree with what another reviewer said, it looks as if it were just cut-and-paste from somewhere else and never reviewed by a human eye before going to press.Bottom line: DON'T GET THIS VERSION, buy another one that you can actually read.

A slew of business books have published since the original release of \\"The Richest Man in Babylon,\\" but few can match the simple and effective words of advice the reader receives; only a handful exceed it. The fundamental premise of Babylon is living below one's means (by saving at least a minimum of 10% of earnings) and having money work for you (passive income.) Clason solidifies these concepts by an engaging narrative readers can quickly identify with even today. I thought the emphasis placed on asset protection first, and selection of knowledgeable advisors to invest saved money with as particularly valuable. All too often the focus is on rapid returns without adequate investment of time with the potential pitfalls of an investment. A solid 4 star rating, worth revisiting often as a reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one book everyone on earth should read...","review":"This book should be mandatory reading for everyone on earth...it teaches such simple, basic, effective personal finance strategies through an easy-to-read, easy-to-understand story.

Never had any problems with the handle falling over and \\"melting\\" on contact with the pot - mine is flexible, certainly, but holds in place after I adjust it. It's also easy for someone like me who is always running all over the place - if I forget to empty the pot, it's okay, b/c the enamel prevents rusting.

We put water on to boil, and left the handle too close to the 'down' position, and the handle MELTED.

My first reaction was to remind him that it will take some practice to get better. His response to me was \\"It's just a fighting game.\\" He even had his own ideas of how it could have been better, (ie. more puzzle levels, jumping, ala Mario). I take blame for this one.

The game itself is good, but all you get to do, is play as many different characters and fight best of three rounds. It has special moves to learn, and is a decent fighting game, but nothing more. You just need to take this into account, and if you like that idea, then buy it, if not....it might be good for a rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This game was awful.

Most students would rate required reading very low just because it is required reading. Wieland has a low rating because it deserves it, not only because it was required. As an English major I love to read but Wieland tests any readers ability and patience. Brown's writing style is comparable to James Fenimore Cooper's Deerslayer - extremely descriptive and at times, without a difinitive end. The many themes that are found in the novel are outdated to today's readers and will have little if any effect on the interest of the novel. The grotesque theme of familial murder mimicks the writing of Edgar Allan Poe. If you are a Poe fan, Wieland may interest you. For those that are not Poe or Cooper fans, I would suggest looking for reading elsewhere.

Material does not mix properly always leaving lumpy solids in the bottom, even when the 'chop' button is used for 3 or 4 minutes preceding high speed blending.My second complaint is that the black hard rubber impeller on the base that engages the metal ring attached to the blades seems to be disintegrating leaving increasing amounts of black rubber residue on the bottom of the blender.

When I made smoothies the KA left chunks of fruit and ice under the blades, even when I tried pulsing, all speeds, prayer...the problem seems to be that the blades sit up higher than the bottom of the glass jar, and are made of thick metal, the better to pulverize ice, but my sister-in-law's cheapie blender made a silkier puree..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wide jar can handle anything!!","review":"I have had this blender for three years and absolutely love it. It is especially useful for cold drinks since the stainless steel keeps everything even colder. As I have said before, you just can't go wrong with a KitchenAid and their products are worth every penny. With the jar being so wide and a full 40 ounces, stuck ice cubes are a thing of the past. It can handle anything you can think of blending. Smoothies are always a problem with other mixers since you need to use a lot of fruit. This baby seems to say \\"Let me at 'em\\" and purees without hesitation. I just love this mixer and I love KitchenAid products. They are worth every penny you spend and won't disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"This book was so-so. It didn't provide me with any meaningful information.

They are humorous and the characters are rich and there is not a better storyteller than Pratchett."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"We listen to many many audiobooks in our family; this is definitely in the top 10. Kids (7 & 9) loved the silly Fegals (sp?) and parents were enchanted by the layers of storytelling and the character of Tiffany -- witches take care of things. Great messages!Briggs takes a wonderful story and makes it absolutely absorbing. This isn't \\"reading\\" - its enchanting acting, and such a pleasure to hear a great storyteller bringing all these characters to life.We just finished the 3rd book tonight - the kids are NOT happy that there are no more Tiffany Aching stories... and I'm sad too!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST what I wanted!","review":"It took me a little to find the right cover, but it was just what I wanted, and came in good time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only for young adults","review":"I think I have read most of Terry Pratchett's books, and enjoyed them all. However, all little girls (and older ones too) should read about Tiffany Aching. Pratchett gets his heroine perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hat Full Of Sky - Pratchett does it again","review":"Yes, Terry Pratchett does it again, with another feather in the cap of the Discworld many and varied population. This spin off works on many levels, Discworld fans get a different slant on their favorite witch characters and new or young fans get a well written novel that is populated with full 3 dimensional characters. Although offered as a \\"young adult\\" book, this story satisfys the adult reader aswell. He is a superb observer of human nature and never fails to shine a light on the emotions, thoughts and actions of his characters. An enjoyable and well written story to be enjoyed by fans of any age, with the usual mix of worry and fun that reflects real life in a fantasy world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Wee Free Men","review":"I've read every single one of Terry Pratchett's books. Wee Free Men was rather dull but A Hat Full of Sky is not only more interesting, it's also much funnier. I'd give it 4.5 stars. You should read Wee Free Men first, but it's definitely inferior to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My daughter was disappointed in this cookbook due to its lack of enticing recipes as well as its constant use of dairy products in many of the recipes. In fairness, some children may love its simplicity as well as its kids friendly style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookbook \\"Holy War\\"","review":"I had originally bought this book a year or so ago for my granddaughter (age 7) who had decided to become vegetarian. She went through her phase and was back on meat before I got the book to her. However, when I found myself working in a deli at a coop grocery, I needed something that had great simple recipes, and this filled the bill. Two of my coworkers also fell in love with the book and both talked about walking off with it. Since I didn't want any holy wars fought over a cookbook, I ordered one for each of them. We have all three moved on from the coop deli, but we all still love the simple goodness in this cookbook. Some particular favorites: scrambled tofu sandwiches, hummus, guacamole, salsa, tomato and feta cheese salad, tabbouli (especially tabbouli!), chili con elote, and African stew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too little","review":"The Comendium contains introducing desciptions of Hunter's antagonists.

As I read some sentimental stories, and some down right boring stories I questioned how more than half of these stories got into the \`Country1 edition of the Chicken Soup series. I loved about three stories, liked about ten, and was puzzled by all the other entries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks, we know the illness -- how about the cure?","review":"I don't want to sound critical, but it looks like this book is written for a blue-collar Michael Moore-style person who cannot understand why in the world his town is in shambles, and, well, I don't think this book would convince Michael Moore that this is how it is supposed to be. Marina first tells the evident -- that corporations are not that benevolent now as they used to be (well, if you consider their old state as 'benevolence', which is a completely separate discussion, of course) and then tries to prove that this is how it is supposed to be. Well, let see, if somebody has an illness and it is not cured, the person dies. That's natural. But you can try to cure it, right? Not just state that dying is natural? So, where is the cure? Marina does not have it. Suggestions of portable life insurance and more tax dollars for retraining may be a pain killer at some time -- albeit not very powerful -- but hardly a cure."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN VIDEO FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY","review":"WE SAW THIS AT A FRIENDS AND HAD TO HAVE IT FOR OUR CABIN VIDEO LIBRARY.

Very dated graphics and load times absolutely cripple this game. This is 2002? Well this title looks as if it is right out of 1992! I have been playing for about 4 hours, totally bored. I swear half that time was waiting for load times. Mind you I am playing on a P4 with 64MB Nvidia card. Utter [junk]! Wait and buy Dungeon Seige and Warcraft3. My rating of one star is being kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"After playing MM from the beginning (still have MM1 on sega gensis), MMIX was a huge disappointment from the start. If you love the previous intro's, dont get your hopes up with MMIX...they pan down a banner with stick figures scribbled on it. Also, the character selection was sad with only two options....fighter or magic user. Once started, you will see that inventory screens and equiping items leave a lot to be desired. I will admit that the 3d can be interesting at first but it gets old real quick. As for this new dialogue, it's a pain in the behind and the only thing I can think of to describe it is....cheesy!After eagerly awaiting this newest version, I would of preferred to save my money and re-play a previous version. Call me old fashion but I hope that they return to the old version style and quit trying to fix something that was not broken. I gave it 2 stars just because I am a die-hard M&M; fan and couldn't pull myself to give it only 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE DEATH OF MIGHT AND MAGIC!!","review":"Why Jon Van Caneghem would put his name to this is anybody's guess. The graphics were created by 3rd graders... I'm not kidding! What can you say about a game that even screws up the fonts? How about the black ocean with clipping errors... The characters are just plain ugly. It is obivious that the graphics, level design, and that incredible opening cinematic couldn't have been created by any real game company. I was struck dumb by how incredibly BAD this product is. Even the install program glitches. The ONLY thing New World Computing did right on this game was the box cover. Very nice box cover.Now for the other reviews on this site that gave this title a 5 star rating: they were certainly planted hoping some fools would like the box cover and remember the quality of gameplay in years past and buy this title... my advice, wait for more real reviews before you waste your money. What a [bad] effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"might and magic IX","review":"Might & Magic IX will be built of areas connected by an overland map. Lang compares overland travel to Sea Dogs or Fallout.The new dialogue system will take a page from RPGs like Baldur's Gate with branching conversations. A new class system will stress flexibility throughout your characters' careers. There are might classes (paladins, rangers, crusaders, mercenaries) and magic classes (mages, druids, liches, priests) and you'll be able to change your class as you play. The spell system will be more flexible by opening spellcasting to more classes. Skills will have specific and unique functions for each class to differentiate characters as they get more powerful. The combat system won't change much, offering real time or turn-based modes depending on the player preference. Lang says the LithTech engine will allow combat to be a little more \\"action oriented\\" this time around. I think this game is amazing and definitatly reccomend it to RPG gamers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"As a long time fan of Might and Magic all I can say is what a disappointment! Bad graphics, terrible game introduction, weak character class choices, poor fighting system, weak NPC interaction, blurry fonts that hurt the eyes, can't see hits against monsters, out-dated paper doll style character inventory, poor monster animation particularly during fighting, too few sound cues...The game plays like an early beta or alpha version. It feels clunky and unfinished, even the introduction to the game is uninspiring making you want to uninstall rather then play! One star is too many."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an Amazing Game!","review":"Unlike most people on this site I think that MM9 is the best RPG I have ever played. The reason I think there are a lot of bad reviews is because it is very different from the other versions of Might and Magic and the long time players of might and magic are too lazy to get use to the new game. I admit, at first I didn't like this game very much, but then after a month a played it again and kept playing until I beat it. The graphics are not the best, but they're not bad. What makes the game great though is the quests. They are so fun to do, much funner than other RPGs (i.e. Morrowind). So, in conclusion, I would strongly recommend this game to anyone with enough patience to really get into this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might and Magic 9","review":"The game is buggy, and locks up. 3 DO said on the box that it would run on windows xp, and on their web site said that it wouldn't.

I've played every might and magic game, but this will be my last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate the new game engine","review":"This game literally made me feel sick.

Well, it does load, i can hear the game music, and footfalls if i walk around. But there's nothing to see here... so... the company is out of business, and i don't know if it's my computer or the game... the patches don't help... in summary, if you can stand to not save the game once, and beat it in one sitting... maybe worth buying, otherwise if you have vista, based on my experience.. theres a strong chance it won't run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry guys... this game crashes and burns!","review":"I've played the last 4 M&M; games and have loved them all. I have also played all the Heroes of M&M; games and think they are excellent. Basically, up until last night, I was a New World Computing fanatic.That is until I played M&M9...; I won't go into the details but the graphocs are the least of the problems. It's lost all sense of immersion and is extremely flat, buggy and boring. I honestly can't believe it. This probably spells the end for this otherwise fantastic series. NWC should really reevaluate the team that produced this product.However, Hereoes of Might and Magic 4 is excellent!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelieveable","review":"After all the innovations over the past 15 years, Might and Magic still looks the SAME! If you like the game play of Might and Magic, you will enjoy this game, however, I can't seem to get past the fact that the graphics look as though they were created on a Commadore 64.

I loved MM6 and 7, the inventory was great and the graphics while not the flashest were enjoyable, and the layout easy to use, like mixing potions and using the maps. This game is seriously limited - it's like everything you could do has been taken away. On top of that it glitches out left right and center. I'm bummed, I was looking forward to getting stuck into a new game and I've been landed with this budget junk. You'd be better off to drag out the old MM games and play them than put time and moneyt into this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a \\"professional\\" model instead!","review":"Rather than buying a $110 clipper that is not what the professionals use, why not buy an Oster A-5 1 speed for about $95? You don't have to unscrew the blade every time you have to change it, and they can be sharpened many, many times. Ask your local groomer or veterinarian what type of clipper they use. You'll find that none of them use one of these crappy(but costly)clippers.

Yes, it sounds like all synth's and a drum kit... real drums would have sounded better on some tracks.If the rhythm doesn't get to you, the lead singer's (Tina Savoie) talented and sweet voice will.A few of the tracks, such as Heart's \\"What About Love,\\" really should have been left alone.Overall, an excellent must-hear album! Hopefully, she will come out with a second - remixes or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple text and gorgeous illustrations capture preschoolers.","review":"This book captured my almost 3 year old at the local library. A hundred or so readings later, he had completely memorized the text, complete with play acting and characterizations of the various opposites presented. The book is beautifully and colorfully illustrated, with a simple rhytmic text pairing opposites (such as ROAR and Squeek, clean and slimy, etc.).

My almost 3 year old son loved this one so much that after repeated (and I mean many many many) check outs from the library, we've finally added it to our permanent collection.

His glowing review of the book seems to rate 5 stars, not one.I am a novice in this area, but still found the book to provide a sound and insightful treatment of the role of society (with its various religious beliefs) as it deals with criminal behavior. The book provides an excellent intellectual basis for Restorative Justice as well as offering numerous practical examples of how societies have dealt constructively with those who have gone astray.The book's message is elegantly presented with the readability needed by the lay person.

You will receive a bag of pipes with lots and lots of nuts, bolts and screws. It will take at least an hour to assemble.The stability of the bed rail relies on 2 little screws to hold it up and keep your child from falling between the rail and the bed. No matter what we did, we could not tighten the rail so that there wasn't a gap between it and the bed. Because of this we never used the product.Also, there are long straps that are used to adjust the \\"hook\\" that attaches to the under side of the mattress. These straps hang down at least 2 feet and would easily wrap around a young child's neck.I would not recommend this product to anyone. We threw ours in the garbage least someone use it and injure their child. A terrible product. I would give it no stars if that was an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy","review":"I purchased two of these rails 8 months ago for my two year old son. the second one just broke tonight.

I bought it so he could not fall of the bed and yes its long enough but not long enough to protect him from falling. Prior to buying this one I had bought the normal regular hide away bed rail and its just got bent. The quality of the metal is not good. when installing them the metals got bent and the pins that make the bed rail come down don't work to great. It does protect the baby from not falling, but the quality of the metal is not that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD IDEA","review":"I really like this for my grandson- was pretty easy to put together- its good for kids who are prone to falling out of bed but too big to sleep in a crib- It seems safe to me also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hide Away that doesn't hide away","review":"Good design idea but product materials too cheap to work. The metal discs that allows this rail to slide/hide away easily become dislodged, slide unevenly and eventually bends which makes it impossible to slip between under the mattress.As a Gramma I wanted to use 2 (one on each side of the bed) on my one guest bed that is used by both adults and grandchildren. Without it sliding under the bed and just hanging down, it was impossible for adults to access the bed because the gate hangs down at a large angle.It was worth the money I lost in shipping charges, both receiving and returning, this product because it rendered the bed useless by both toddlers and adults.I will look locally before buying another bed rail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hassle, and a bit unsafe","review":"So, this item serves a good purpose. However, it's a little rickety in the design. It doesn't fold in smoothly...both ends get stuck. The entire thing is metal on metal, so you can imagine the maneuvering and manipulating that goes on. It's wide, so you can't align both ends at the same time, you have to do one, then the other, but by the time you get back to the first side, it's out of alignment. That's not the worst of it. Once folded in (so the child can get on and off the bed comfortably), these two huge metal things stick out. If the child were to slide down the bed, or hop down, the metal hooks could definitely injur the back or front of the child. I had to wrap old socks and t-shirts around them so the wouldn't harm my child (an eye sore of course). So, I don't know...if there is a better guard rail out on the market buy it. I'm so fed up with it, I'm thinking about just putting the mattress on the floor...if he does fall he hasn't far to go :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"Unfortunately, my son has gotten into the habit of sleeping with mommy. This bedrail is superior in quality. It was very simple to put together and get it fixed to the bed. It easily rolls down and slides under the mattress to hide it. I highly recommend this product for those that have little ones sleeping in the bed or for their big beds. It is not reccommended for toddler beds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars!!","review":"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter. She is not overly rambunctious or anything and is very gentle with her bed. The pieces started to bend and break and then it fell on top of her one day while she was playing on the floor of her room. We were lucky she was not seriously hurt. It is JUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"15 month old broke it in one night","review":"It took me an hour to put this product together. After it was all put together, it felt and looked flimsy. I affixed it to my 15 month's old twin bed and he managed to push the rail down and take it apart in one night.It doesn't fit flushly with the mattress and I couldn't figure out how to make it bed to tuck it between his mattress. I threw it away. Very disappointed in the product. I hardly write reviews, but I had to write about how cheaply made this product was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the newest model","review":"I bought this and the additional side rail, both from Amazon, both the extra-long version. The additional side rail is regalo model number 5020AX and the hide away bed rail is regalo model number 5010HD. These are not compatable. The problem is that the hideaway bed rail is the old model and the additional side rail is the new model. Despite the instructions on 5010HD indicating an anchoring tube with removable black caps (so the additional side rail can be added), there are no black caps and there is no compatability. I recommend paying a bit more and just ordering from One Step Ahead. I am stuck with these two products that I don't feel like taking apart and shipping back, and will probably spend two additional hours attaching them. To do this you need metal drill bits, nuts, bolts, and a retired father in law. Two stars only because the actual product seems pretty good. Regalo customer service is useless and not helpful, dont bother with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return","review":"We bought this rail to help our son transition to his new big boy bed. Sadly it did not list in the description that it is not recommended and should not be used on platform beds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regalo Extra Long Bed Rail","review":"I ordered two. The problem I experienced is attaching the netting part to the rail. It is way too tight. The zippers broke when we tried to zip up the panel. It needs to be wider (by at least 1\\"). I understand the manufacturer needs the netting to be tight, but when you literally cannot zip it up (two people trying) because it is too tight a fit, there is something wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to use","review":"This was easy to put together, but horrible to use. It doesn't fit well in our bed, one of the clips came broken and one of the pins is jammed. Big mess and I just put it in today. Look for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great!","review":"My 4 year old son fell out of his bed, hit his head and needed stitches one night. I never dreamt that could happen! He had fallen out of bed before, but never had any injuries from it. So I purchased this bed rail and love it! It was very easy to assemble and to attach to the bed. For the most part I leave it up, but it is nice that it can fold down and out of the way for making the bed. My son hasn't been able to fall out of bed and I can sleep easy knowing that he can't get hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Just a few issues","review":"This product does exactly as expected, but there are a few issues. One issue is that it is a little tricky to install, although not really that bad. Once in place, it does exactly as expected and gives us peace of mind that or son will not fall off the bed while sleeping. On the other hand, a big concern is that, as many children do, our son loves to walk and jump around on the bed. When the child is doing that, they could easily fall over this device, causing them to fall from a much higher height then if they just fell off the bed itself. This is a concern that I had not thought of, and while it has not happened to us yet, I can imagine that it must have happened to other children, and it is something that concerns us and is something that you might want to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Older Kids--Adults and Fits Tall Twin Mattress","review":"I bought this to go on a bed for my grandson. He is 8 but still tends to roll about a lot in his sleep. The bed we have for him is a deep nice twin mattress which sits high upon the drawer set and storage base. This worked fine for that bed outfit. It fits real tight on the side and length is good too. I think it would hold back his 70lbs if he rolls into it at night. Putting it together wasn't happening to quick for grandpa but the grandson got the puzzle of it right of the bat and assisted. It folds down and placement works good for under the mattress storage but it does take some thought to get it placed well considering the metal type arms to it. Overall, perfect for an older child or adult even I think. Good price. Wish they sold it in colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bed Rail","review":"My granddaughter is a wiggler when she sleeps and this extra long bed rail keeps her from falling off of the bed. I had tried others and she always managed to wiggle to the end of the bed. Because this rail is longer than others, she stays put. It's also very safe as it has no bars, slats or rails. Very satisfied buyer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"This bed rail took an hour to put together, directions were ambiguous, and when we finally got it assembled, we discovered one of the sliding rails was bent and the side came out everytime we tried to put the rail up or down. Will not be buying one of these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap junk","review":"Cheap china made garbage. Pinch points; hide away feature damages mattress, and box spring. It did inspire me to make my own out of wood and metal, which turned out to look a heck of a lot better, is safer, and a lot sturdier than this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"extra long bed rails","review":"The rails are very long but, that is a good thing. They slide, with a little effort, between the mattress and the box springs. As rails go, these are very good in keeping my grand children from falling out of the bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction","review":"The bedrails were nice until the last steps of trying to strap them together and both of the bed rails snapped. The plastic went flying across the room. It is very hard finding good bed rails. Good Luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good. Invest more money","review":"It fits into our 18months baby bed but after 30 days the structure bend and never work again. Very disappointing. I have one from other brand and had almost 02 years and works perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big, Bulky, does not work with any frame","review":"Bought two of these as our daughters bed comes out from the wall not against it. Forget using two as the way the rails are you can not put two of these on a bed. The rails below are very bulky and angle the bed/put large lumps. The idea of the rails being hidden is great however if your kids bed sits in any frame that covers even the tiniest part of the mattress forget this function. Incredibly disappointed, it gets two stars as it is made in a bombproof manner but that is the only reason it even gets 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain","review":"This bed rail slides under matress so it make the matress un-even and my child rolls into the wall. It is also a VERY big pain to un-latch it and slide it under the matress and then pull it back out. Wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"From the moment I assembled and installed this bed rail, it felt flimsy. I'd purchased a foldaway rail thinking it would make it easier to make my daughter's bed, but was wrong. The rail was so difficult to fold under that it wasn't worth folding it away; I'd just pull the bed away from the wall instead. Any attempt at folding it down would result in the cheap metal \\"wheels\\" that guide the rail popping off the cheap metal track. In less than six months, my two year old daughter had the rail bent and finally snapped the cheap \\"wheel\\" right off the rail itself. Despite installing it correctly, my daughter would still manage to push it away from the bed enough that she could have fallen through. This thing just ended up in the trash, what a waste of money.Save yourself the headache. If you have to have a safety rail, just get a rail that is solid and doesn't fold away or purchase a less expensive bolster that fits under the sheets. This one is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!","review":"The metal is so flimsy and cheap. It's a NIGHTMARE to put together. It doesn't line up correctly and the metal pieces bend!
