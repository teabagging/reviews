I have always been curious about Mary Magdalen and this book does her tremendous justice!I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you get by the religion?","review":"George takes a leap with this project and almost certainly opened herself up for criticism from both the believers and the non believers. As you might expect with any project such as this there is lots of room for an agenda by the author. I however found none or at least minimal. I found the book to be a delightful view of the time of Christ through the eyes of a woman. There is of course a huge amount of artistic license taken since we have such minimal information about Mary. If you can read the book objectively and not try to overlay it with your own \\"doctrine\\" I think you will find it well written and very enjoyable. It does cover much ground that most people already know from the story of Jesus, but for me it was a wonderful, personal view of the lifestyle that might have been experienced by a Jewish woman who lived in the time of Christ. As a bonus we got to see the story of Jesus and his apostles through her eyes. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls way short","review":"Since I loved George's other books, I made the false assumption that this one would be as interesting and well written. No such luck. The dialogue was stilted and boring. None of the characters were likeable. I would not have followed anyone of them based on the what George has written. As egalitarian as Jesus supposedly was, this character of the Magalene would have never existed in that time and place. Projecting modern values left this book practically void of history.Of course, this \\"story\\" is based for the most part on faith rather than historical fact unlike George's other books and apparently George's faith interpretation is uniquely her own. She might as well have called it Mary Magdalene the Superhero. Totally unbelieveable and void of feeling. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"woefully western","review":"The author takes he words of Jesus, some of the historic facts of scripture and totally misapplies them in this novel. She completely misses the cultural context of the first century, but rather imports what she has read into a very western, rather twenty-first century mindset. She completely ignores the honor-shame implications of the first century, totally misappropriates the role of a woman in those days into what she might imagine it being, and does very little to advance the plot of her novel beyond her living room. We never are brought to an understanding of Jesus within the world in which he lived nor an appreciation of the eastern, non-linear, mindset. She does use some easily known facts regarding the 1st c. Judaism, but never explores or applies these to her novel.I was terribly disappointed in the verbosity, the lack of realism, and the cultural inadequacy of this novel. I would never recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful way to travel in time","review":"M.George sweeps you back in time as only she can. This book was wonderful, thoughtful and thought provoking. Mary Magdaline comes to life and is transformed from a ordinary (albeit 'demon possessed') Jewish girl to a woman converted by her internal experinces and the words and actions of Jesus. For any one interested in what life may have been like at the time of Christ, this is a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather do laundry than read this book","review":"I made it 3/4 of the way through this book before I realized I would rather be mopping floors or doing laundry rather than continue reading it. I kept feeling obligated to slog through it after spending the money to buy it. I finally threw it away and felt immediately better! Dry, dry, dry, too bad, I am actually a fan and enjoyed all George's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh....not impressed.","review":"This was my first time reading a book by Margaret George. I found the writing to be on roughly a seventh or eight grade level. What I'm looking for in a book like this is to be transported back in time, and it didn't even come close.I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment--boring and corny","review":"I liked Margaret George's other books for the way they made history come alive. This time, though, she gets all bogged down in clichés. As the New York Times pointed out, \\"It's not easy to write a love scene for Jesus.\\" I wish Ms. George hadn't tried; she seems totally earnest, but the book is embarrassingly trite and obvious, like a bad old movie. Please go back to history, ma'am--just give us the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly uninspired...","review":"If you were hoping for a juicy tale about the repentent sinner who washed Jesus's feet with her hair, you'll be disappointed by this dull story of poor put-upon Mary of Magdala. And if you want real spiritual insight, stick to the Bible--it's much more profound and to the point than the paint-by-the-numbers portrait here. Miss George did OK with human characters like Cleopatra and she's obviously trying really hard with Our Lord and His Disciples. But it takes more than mundane details and melodramatic dialog to capture the true essence of the Divine."},{"rating":"1","title":"For true believers only","review":"Was Mary M. a prostitute? Apparently not, or at least not in this earnest, PG-rated version of her life. Ms. George spends most of her time trying to prove that Mary was not only a good girl but the best disciple Jesus ever had. The question is whether you care.If the answer is \\"yes\\", you might like this long rather boring book. Unfortunately, if you want to see the people of the Bible brought to life as believable human beings, you won't find that here, where everyone talks in sermons. There's too much preaching and not enough storytelling; the whole thing reads like a Sunday School lesson that goes on forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Respectful Telling of Mary's Story","review":"As we've seen that, in many books telling the story of Mary Magdelene, artistic license can take many turns. I found this book very respectful and wonderfully imaginative in the telling of Mary's story, her marriage, family life, her life as a deciple of Jesus and her relationship with the other deciples. She was a strong woman of intelligence and curiosity. She was not lead blindly into following Jesus, but chose to follow.I have to say \\"Memoirs of Cleopatra\\" is still my favorite George novel, but I would love to have her continue to write about all the amazing women in history. I've read everything she's written thus far, and have enjoyed each journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I am a huge Margaret George fan. I loved Henry VIII, Cleopatra and Helen of Troy, but this is just boring. They walk around Roman Palestine and talk about Jesus. She doesn't develop the characters. Why do these people follow Jesus? They're bored? Are you supposed to really believe (or even pretend to believe) that Mary was possessed by a bunch a Canaanite demons??? I'd call this book painful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring","review":"I found this book very dull. It has taken me two weeks to read this book (I have a tendency to skim also and it still took two weeks) and I am still not finished and I dont think I will finish it to be honest. I can read a book in a day or two if I am kept interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing \\"Mary Magdalene Superstar\\"","review":"I was a big fan of Margaret George's other books, but they were about truly central figures in history like Henry the Eighth and Cleopatra. By choosing to write about the relatively obscure Mary of Magdala, Ms. George paints herself into a corner--she has to make her subject seem more important than it really is. So Mary, implausibly, becomes the center of every single important event, while -- most regrettably -- Our Lord Jesus Christ fades into the background as little more than a cheesy faith healer who changes Mary's life. This book is a sad disservice to the devout as well as to students of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Yawn","review":"I am very grateful for all the reviews of this book which I have read. I struggled with this book and have to admit I couldn't finish it. I was expecting a really good read but what I found was that it was a very effective sleeping pill. Your other reviewers have saved me from thinking I HAD to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant followup to Stella Marni","review":"This book is hard to review without giving out the secrets of Assignment:Stella Marni. It's a direct followup to that book when a Communist hitman is sent after Sam Durell in revenge for the Marni case. He also has a second target and Sam is forced into a race to Hungary when it's found target #2 has flown home.To make matters worse, Sam's boss has also disappeared behind the Iron Curtain.Good Cold War espionage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read - Novel Idea!","review":"The most impressive part about this book is the continuity created in the plot when it was written by four different people...The biggest drawback to the book is the fact that it was written by four different people...I did enjoy this book (see rating), however I got a headache not from plot holes, but from character holes. It seemed like each author had their own idea of what each character is like, showing glimpses of personality at different points of the book, but the resulting psychological gestalts are confusing to say the least.The effect was disturbing, but did make for an interesting read. The insight into life on an elite Ivy League campus is intriguing, and there are sufficient twists and turns to keep you turning the pages.If nothing else, you should read this for its pure creative value. It's amazing what a group of people can get together and do... for a grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Harvard Education Is A Terrible Thing To Waste","review":"Erich Segal once wrote that going to Harvard doesn't guarantee that you will be happy. Nor does a Harvard education guarantee that you will become a brilliant novelist. Case in point: The Student Body. Given the impressive biographies of the novel's four authors, I thought the book would be polished and well-written. Instead, I found it to be poorly plotted and poorly written. The characters, while comically rainbow coalition-esque, are fairly one-dimensional. The suspense scenes were predictable and not at all suspenseful. It was like a Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys mystery with sex, and boring sex at that. I wanted to really like this book because the marketing and press surrounding it have been so positive. But frankly, The Student Body was a huge, huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was an incredible amp, at first","review":"Thought going with crown would be a great investment for our PA system.

The entire Think Tank arc was boring, and the art was bland at best. The best part was Mark Millar's annual that introduces the Ultimate Inhumans. This book is very thin, only holding 2 issues and an annual that's only slightly longer then an issue. Sadly you have to read this to have completely read UFF, but at least it's a short nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty bad...","review":"i love the ultimate fantastic four, i think it's the best ultimate book out there (ok tied with ultimate spider-man). the vols. 1-3, and 5-6 are great. but this one sucks. you really don't need to read it at all, i think maybe they were in between writers/artists at the time and just got someone to fill in on issues 19-20. the annual isn't that great either, it just introduces the inhumans (basically johnny meets crystal)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Ultimate lines of X-Men, Spiderman, Ultimate(Avengers), and of course the Fantastic Four. For that reason, I am deeply upset with how UFF Vol. 4: Inhuman turned out. First off, this cover is way too decieving. Jae Lee, while an obviously talented artist, is definitely not the write person to be drawing for the Ultimate series. It completely veered away from the amazing artwork done in the first 3 volumes, which is pretty much the uniform look for the entire Ultimate universe.The stories definitely could have been better written and needed to be spanned out more. 2 issues is definitely not enough to fully tell the story with the Thinker. Then you have that UFF Annuals #1 which was even worse than the Thinker story. TOO SHORT, plus the artwork was just wrong. It was all a rare miss in the Ultimate line and having seen the upcoming Vol. 5: Crossover, it doesn't appear to be one that's going to be repeated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to read with your child!","review":"My son and I don't get the chance to read together as often as we did when he was younger. He is now 9 and likes to read on his own, and I have younger ones to tend to also. But when we do read together, it is really special and this one was a favorite. It is the second in the series (first is Journey to the Mushroom Planet, I think). We loved them both. Very creative and some suspense. Long descriptions and some more complex words make it ideal for a parent to read aloud, unless the child is older and a truly avid reader. We will try the third book, though we've heard the first two are the best. Definitely read the first two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summer reading from Anne George","review":"A good friend got me started on Anne George books, and I can't quit.

They are well written for light reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sisters in Wonderland","review":"Like stepping through a rabbit hole, this sassy series of southern sisters is simply inspired fun, through and through. The character development and unusual situations make this book light hearted and fun. Improbable? Certainly. Entertaining? You bet! Anne George comes up with some fantastic names for her characters, and etches family and marital dynamics that really aren't too far fetched. The reader will also learn some Birmingham trivia (mostly about the Vulcan), where to buy fried chicken (the Piggly Wiggly) as well as the universal sign for a possum. Share this one with friends or even your sister!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne George is right on target.","review":"Anne George fans, get ready! She has done it again with this fast paced, well plotted, fun filled new sisters mystery. Those of you who are already familiar with this series will enjoy thoroughly the sisters' latest escapades as they try to help neighbors, Arthur and Mitzi.

Sister Mary Alice is along to provide her usual unflappable asides. Besides that, the sisters are involved in a group starting a stock market investment club and marriage trouble pops up in Patricia Annes' family. Throw in a little of Mary Alices' romantic hijinks and you have quite a brew. Y'all give this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"This series keeps you laughing!!!","review":"The latest in the Southern Sisters series doesn't disappoint. The lively conversation between Patricia Anne and Mary Alice steal the show. The line, \\"Mary Alice used to be five years older than I am,\\" is a wonderful example of Mary Alice's eccentric look on getting older and Patricia Anne's more practical side.

For instance, I know that 'criteria' can be used to filter information, but I do not have a very clear idea of what to actually put in the 'criteria' section in order to get what I want.

The Sample quality manual is helpful, I would not go as far as using it as a template and customizing it, because it will effectively translate into tricking your own self (The standard was envisioned to help give companies a tool to work better, and is very flexible/generic to help tailor it to ones own needs). But it is an excellent starting point for novice implementers of any QMS, to understand what a QMS looks like when its ready.

I purchased this text to help my research about comics and teaching. I was quite satisfied.Gornick mainly uses the illustrations for 2 purposes: to 'show' various experiments and metaphors, or to toss in a gag every couple pages. It's not a very visionary use of sequential art, but basically it works. The text explanations and visual explanations integrate well, and some of the gags are actually funny.So, for what it's trying to do, the text is successful, I'd say.

I went out and bought every other book that was written by Katzenbach after the first few chapters. It was nice to read a book that was not the same story told with the not so different twists. This was a roller coaster ride that I was eager to ride every day. The only dissappointment in this book was the somewhat weak ending and I was also left wondering about a few connections that were not made clear. The ending just didn't pack the punch that the rest of the book had.If you are looking for a book that will make you think and you will love - give this book a try.

Who stronger to compete in a high-stakes game of mental tug-of-war? This book delivers. Katzenbach does an excellent job of revealing a plot with layer upon layer of complexity. When you think there is nowhere to go, the plot shifts and burns ahead for another hundred and fifty pages. I thoroughly enjoyed the complexity of the story. I was lukewarm to the hero at first, but he grew (believably) during the story and ended up as not only an endearing character, but also a heroic one.In the interest of full disclosure, I am an author myself and so don't review books that I can't wholeheartedly support.

Or at least, you want to believe it is.It's a good story, and the weak main character actually shows some growth toward the end of the book.

I look forward to every episode (including her quirky gorgeous outfits), often crying for unknown reasons, but always left with a renewed outlook. It is a series I proudly support, no misogyny, no violence, yet powerful.

I've read that the band went into the studio without any written material.

How else to explain such favorable reviews? Right from the start this CD is a snoozer. The first track takes about 1 1/2 minutes to actually get started, (I didn't time it exactly). Usually a band will put something to get you into the mood of the album for the first track. Apparently the purpose of the album is to be a non-prescription sleep-aid. From here the CD doesn't get any better. I expect A LOT MORE from the band that released such classics as Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby. There was nothing on this release that is memorable, or worth shelling out more than a buck to experience. Listen to you friends copy, and I dare you to stay awake. U2 should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY LAME","review":"UNLIKE THE JOSHUA TREE&ACTUNG BABY This Disc Never RIses Or CHallenges the Depth OF Lyrics&Music that has Made U2 very Important in the first place.Lemon was good for a Laugh Like Much Of The Music here.This Disc is Like an Inside joke or Something.it Never Matches The Highs this Band has ENjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best U2 album","review":"Zooropa reminds me of the Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour in that both albums are simultaneously each band's best album and also most underrated.While Zoo has 3 weak songs, 7 songs are very good.

Likewise, when talking to U2 fans I am amazed at how many dismised this album.Like Magical Mystery Tour, there is a level of depth with respect to both the songwriting and the various background noises which gives this album incredible depth.

The former stellar guitar work disappears into the mix, the songwriting is dull, and then we come to the vocals. Bono seems to feel this sludge is inventive and original, but all the listener gets is a little boy playing with his new tape machine. I hope drugs were involved, at least then he'd have an excuse. For a singer with a voice that could cause goosebumps in the past, this exercise was a waste of talent and other people's money.It has become popular in some circles now to say this album is an inventive work whose merits are only recognized by the truly insightful. Don't believe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worth follow up to Achtung Baby","review":"U2 wrote and recorded ACHTUNG BABY and then blew out onto the road with a massive show making fun of it all called ZooTV. It was literally the greatest show on Earth. After touring the U.S., Europe, and then another round of shows in the U.S., U2 had a few months of break time before bringing ZooTV around Europe, Australia, and Japan. Most bands would take a vacation. U2 locked themselves in the studio and came up with ZOOROPA. The album stands alone, and also works as a sequel to ACHTUNG BABY. Musically, it's a bold and experimental statement that won't appeal to all, but will excite many. Lyrically, it is a field day for Bono to finally get out emotions on the state of the world, touring, and life. Amazing that they were albe to make this in only a couple months. (Note: Zooropa is the second part to an unofficial trilogy that began with ACHTUNG BABY and would end with POP four years later.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"More daring than Achtung Baby","review":"This album may not deal with the emotional themes of Achtung Baby, but there is an incredible creative spirit to this album. It was done very quickly, which makes me wonder if this album was closer to the heart of what the band really is. A beautiful mix of songs that will have you laughing crying, and screaming all within an hours time. But for an album which can do this, it still possesses a very dark heart, which makes this album of contradictions a bit more uncomfortable after 200 listens than when when you sat back saying \\"I can't believe this is U2....I can't believe this is U2\\".

The album is utterly hollow and gimmicky with no artistic merit. I was hoping it was simply a brief diversion from their usual work, but Pop proved me wrong. Hopefully U2 will realize that they've hit rock bottom with these last two and take some time to write some quality music like we all know they can."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst U2 album of all","review":"This is certianly the worst of all the U2 albums.

I say, forget that. My appreciation of music is limited to that which sounds pleasing to my ear; I don't feel an inherent need to add money to a supergroup's coffers, just because they've decided to get experimental on me. U2 created catchy and beautiful music with Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. Zooropa is trash. Hence, in the winter of 1993, my roommate and I flung it from our apartment window...good riddance. Who cares if they wanted to make a statement about consumerism; make a statement yourself about consumerism by not buying this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zoo sad!","review":"Easily the worst piece of work U2 have ever done.

It is not terrible with songs like the title track and \\"Dirty Day\\" as my stand outs, but the rest of the album just doesn't stand out. U2 was moving toward more electronic music and away from some of the passion that makes this band great. I think that this is this CD's downfall. I was glad to see the follow up discs take a new direction. I admire the band's willingness to try new things, but this just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not their best","review":"This is definitely not U2's best album. This was recorded in a matter of a few weeks, and it shows. Only a couple songs: the title track, \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay for your Crashed Car\\" and \\"Babyface\\" can be classified as good -- \\"Daddy's...\\" being the only one out of those that can be called excellent. The rest of the songs are pretty mediocre.U2 displays here that they are at their best when they take their time in the studio and make us wait awhile before their next album. Their next two albums, Pop and All You Can Leave Behind are much better, and both were about four years apart in time from each other and Pop released nearly four years after this album. U2 should stick to that formula; it works better for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faraway, So Close!","review":"This CD does not stand alone, but, at least in my mind, goes along with Wim Wenders film \\"Faraway, So Close!\\" The subtitle of \\"Stay\\" is the name of the film!

The overlooked ... son of \\"Achtung Baby!\\", this album is very experimental, and thus extremely rewarding. Each of these songs is a little pocket symphony (well, not really) with its own flavor that stands together as a well-moulded work. The joke is that it took only a few months to make, right in the middle of the band's busy tour schedule. Overlooked by many, but it's a fantastic album, very unlike U2. The highlights are the rumbling \\"Dirty Day\\", the epic title track, the amazing \\"Babyface\\" and the sparkling \\"Lemon\\". To be fair, they're all highlights, except the tiring \\"Numb\\". Too overplayed, not the greatest.

This is the tidemark left by the wave of great music from their career in the 80s that finally broke on this desolate shore. Compared to the scaffold-climbing, flag-waving, rabble-rousing U2 of the 80s, here we have tired old men slouching down the corridors of studios, more worried what the critics will think than the fans. The lyrics are quite good but Johnny Cash sounds like the youngest guy on the record.

The installations were relatively easy however I suspected that the gauge was not reading correctly so I tested the sender and the gauge. My results indicated that the gauge reads approx 20% low on the low end of the scale and 20% high on the high end of the scale. It is fairly accurate at mid-scale (160-180 degrees). I think that this amount of variation is unacceptable and wrote 2 letters to B&M asking for their assistance in correcting this issue. They have not responded to either of my letters. Because of B&M's failure to respond I would not recommend this product and I would be hesitant to purchase any of their products.

I love regency fiction and Christmas stories are private little comfort reads. However this one was so drab, so dull and so ill-written with a silly plot, one dimensional characters and boring dialogue that I tossed it into the bin after the first 75 pages or so. The most attractive feature was the cover.

How often do earl's fondly reminisce with their valets, in dialog like: (Lord) \\"How long have we known each other?\\" (valet) \\"We first met when you threw me in the river for interrupting your fishing. Of course, when I came down with the influenza from the dunking you did come and read to me each day for the week,\\" he said while gazing fondly at his master.........

Instead, he starts with Jesus' resurrection, then moves to the exodus from Egypt, and then finally goes to the beginning in Genesis. Of course, there are reasons for preparing us for Genesis, but it seems like he jumps around too much. At the end of the book he builds a strange theory of mostly-physical bodily resurrection, using Jesus' resurrection (before His ascension to a *glorified* body) as the springboard. That's why he begins at the resurrection of Christ rather than at creation. This causes the need for lots of flash-backs and flash-forwards, making the book much more confusing than a history of redemption ought to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"Ms Jenkins capitivated me from the very beginning.

After that, it came a period of well deserved commercial sucess with guitar player Matthias Jabs and the lousy drummer Hermann Rarebell on board, a phase which lasted until \\"LOVE AT FIRST STING\\". After that, the band lost their touch, simply that. In \\"Face the Heat\\" there are a few good moments, like \\"Allien Nation\\" and \\"Hate to Be Nice\\". Anyway, it's better for us that bands like Scorpions to keep on going than to listen to nowadays horrible new bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"FACE THE TRUTH..","review":"FAce the truth: for anyone who have ever heard the old Scoprions from the seventies and the beginning of the eighties (even when Matthias Jabs replaced Ulrich ROth), to hear this FACE THE HEAT must be a terrible suffering.

A tremendous insight into the world of a travelling pro, the author let us see his world through his eyes.One must admire Vince Spadea's determination and self belief after all he went through in 15 years on the international tennis circuit. In that time he went on a roller coaster ride from being in the top 20 to plummeting down the rankings and enduring a record losing sequence before climbing his way back up the ladder."},{"rating":"2","title":"an easy read, not much dirt, but interesting look into the circuit","review":"The Vince Spadea book was very enjoyable, an easy read and interesting look into the mens pro tennis circuit. Those looking for some dirt will be disappointed as very little juicy stories here. It shows how life passes for a tennis pro and how many do their own laundry and shopping like the hackers. enjoyable, not remarkable. more scintalting tales wouyld have helped, but since he did not mingle with the elite, trhere was little to be said. but a fun book for tennis playing readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD BOOK ABOUT TENNIS","review":"This is not a good book about tennis. It doesn't give any fresh insight about being a professional tennis player. Basically, Vince Spadea just wants to trash the really great tennis players because he feels they don't give him enough respect. That gets really tedious very fast. Although being ranked 39 in the tennis world is a very good accomplishment, Spadea alienates the reader by his complaints and doesn't put himself in a better light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for tennis fans! Average JOE tennis player!","review":"I always enjoyed Vince's style of play because he seemed like a player with average skills yet he played with a whole lot of heart. I could always relate to his game with his big forehand and the classic 1990's two hander from the baseline. If you love tennis and a pespective of what its like to train, deal with managers/agents, and be on the ATP tour then this is a fantastic read. Vince doesn't hold anything back about other players and coaches. He loses me what he starts acting like a rapper but he has always been entertaining. I hope he stays involved in the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic drivel","review":"I'm sorry, but Vince Spadea should have kept his secret diary to himself. I did find some of his comments to be interesting, but for the most part the thoughts he expresses in this book are pure drivel and mind chatter. Unfortunately, Vince comes across as a very self-absorbed and superficial human being. Vince paints a picture of himeself as someone who is insecure and way too dependent on what others think about him. He wants the reader to think he is cool because of who he knows and associates with. Sad! I sincerely hope he doesn't represent the whole breed of professional tennis players in today's world. In the end I think Vince was just making another buck for himself with this pathetic account of his tennis touring life. One last thought, Spadea mentions he has only read one book in its entirety. Well this really shows! If he had read a few good books, I'm sure he wouldn't have wanted to publish such self-indulgent crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read on pro tennis","review":"I read a lot about tennis and found this book to be one of the best I've read. It is not a book for the fan who wants to glean more about how to hit his forehand better or doesn't have a sense of humor. A lot of the material might be deemed questionable in tact, but if you approach it with the mindset that this is a single, 30-ish, pro tennis player who is writing about traveling the world with his racket to make his living, then Spadea's sometimes randy and outrageous voice is appealing. This is not a book by Arthur Ashe or Roger Federer, where image is carefully minded, the writing is unplugged and revealingly honest whether Spadea's talking about other players' games, the despair in seeing his ranking dropping, or losing a German model to James Blake at a player's party.I would recommend it for anyone who is intrigued by the pro tennis life, and wants to hear about it first-hand from a guy who's been out there almost as long as Agassi."},{"rating":"1","title":"white men should not rap","review":"Especially tennis players.Has some interesting stories/dirt on other tour players, but for the most part this book ping pongs back and forth between \\"I'm really a spoiled brat / No, I'm not / Well, maybe I am.\\" Spadea's intermittent \\"rap\\" paragraphs are enough to produce douche chills in even the most ardent Vanilla Ice fans.As for Vince's tips on how to pick up women....

I even went to a big tournament in St. Louis which lasted most of the night with John McEnroe finally declared the winner. I hoped to find this book a winner, with perhaps good gossip about the top men players. Instead it was a whiner: why can't I play better tennis and win more games; why can't I score with the girls (a predominant teaser every few pages); and why didn't Coach Patrick McEnroe pick me to play on the Davis Cup Team? I don't seem to get close to any of the players and just like to travel with my dad. No juicy gossip either.

Brilliant stuff. Then what? Disco sell out mess. If you like roots reggae DO NOT buy this CD. Buy 96 degrees and maybe some early stuff. If you like Abba's Dancing Queen a lot, then go ahead and purchase the collection. Make sure you own some Abba first.I imagine their agent or label suggested recording mainstream disco crossover songs with a Jamaican feel. Most of their songs are what you would expect from a band at a Montego Bay hotel.

This one escaped me. Having finally discovered it, even at an advanced age, I can say it is one of the jewels of ERB's work. While I am partial to his series works, there are times when a single volume story is all you want to read. This is a prime candidate.Written in 1914 and published serially, ERB makes a departure from his plot formula (at least a little) in order to write this tale of ultimate vengeance. The main character, Norman of Torn, aka Prince Richard of England, becomes the prime tool for the revenge of another. There are the usual elements of romance, but in effect this is a novel about knights and sword fights, outlaws versus nobility, chivalry versus lusts. Life was never this black and white, but it makes for good reading. I found the story to be reminiscent of both Ivanhoe and Robin Hood, and well worth the read.

In this time I have learned that the proper equipment makes a huge difference in a player's development. I purchased this t-ball set for my 5 year-old daughter. I was extremely disappointed in this product. The tee is very cheaply-made and difficult to assemble. The bases are paper-thin. The worst and most inexcusable fault with this product is in the height of the tee itself. For a product that is suppopsedly designed to teach younger children, the design is awful.

I particularly liked the Sun Salutations series, as these are practised by all professional Bharatanatyam dancers, who have to produce rather complex postures. I know I will never be as flexible and as agile as the young professional dancers, and I will hardly ever dance as effortlessly and gracefully as Medha Hari in her DVD, but Peggy Cappy's excercises will make you stay fit and healthy, if this is what really matters for an amateur dancer like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga for real people","review":"I purchased this DVD and another Yoga video by Allen Finger. Peggy Cappy's version is definitely inspiring. Ms. Cappy demonstrates the poses along with 4 other real people ranging in age from 40-something to 70-something.The idea that she encourages the use of a chair for the poses is wonderful and made me feel like this was something I could do. I felt really great about myself as she moved slowly through the breathing, stretching and beginning poses.However, it seemed that 15 minutes into the second 20-minute session that I had jumped into an intermediate class. She moved very quickly into combining moves without demonstrating each. I know I will get the hang of it, but it's going to take a while---like putting individual dance steps into a complete routine.I recommend the video for people who might be afraid of failing at Yoga --- as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent intro to yoga","review":"The primary value of this DVD for me is the modified Sun Salutation using a chair. This series of poses had always been a challenge and now it's much easier. Hardcore yoga wonks won't like this, but it is a very good introduction and has helped me start and continue my practice.

There are more introductions and interviews about yoga than excercise. Dont waste your money on this. I sent it back and lost 8.00 between refund and shipping. I should of just kept it and sold it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Learn Yoga","review":"I had never done yoga before and I'm really enjoying learning how with this DVD. I recommend it for any person new to yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga for the Rest of Us","review":"Alternated with \\"More Yoga for the Rest of Us,\\" it's a wonderful, calming and very effective strengthening, stretching and relaxing workout for all ages, and allows for physical limitations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very user friendly.","review":"I was hoping this DVD was one I could work out with. Unfortunately, it's more of an instructional DVD than one you can work out along with. Didn't at all inspire me to do Yoga. As another reviewer said it should have been sectioned off allowing you to work out without the instructions. Once you've learned the routine the instructions are just annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the middle aged and out of shape","review":"My husband and I both love all of Peggy Cappy's DVD's. They are perfect for middle aged out of shape people who wish to regain their balance and flexibility. Peggy Cappy also has a very good yoga DVD for back care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I watched the PBS special and thought that looked too easy for me, so I tried Yoga for the Rest of Us. Well at 74 and stiff, this was still too easy and not enough yoga stretch.My school sessions on Yoga much better. I also had a Physical Therapy teacher that did an one hour Stretch and Fit tape before she quit the classes she was giving. She does from head to toe and and really makes each area feel good and stretched.This was boring. I cannot do some yoga, but I do like more Downward Dog, Warrior and Triangle poise, also chair pose. I will not get anymore of her tapes. I did not like the sound of her voice either. I do not know if she was trying to sound sexy or calming in the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"yoga","review":"i thought it was a DVD,but it was a cassette (my mistake) anyway it was a very,very short cassette"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow for me","review":"Guess I'm a lot more flexible than I thought. This wasn't challenging to me at all. Not to criticize but I think it should've been called Yoga for Oldies. I think I'll stick to Pilates in future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I thought this one would be slow and boring as soon as I saw a bunch of Senior Citizens in the class! I was surprised to find that I enjoy this one the most. I can feel my body strengthening as well as feeling toned, in just 3 weeks. I have arthritis in my knee and had surgery on both my feet, so I struggled with balance with regular Yoga. This class has actually alleviated my knee pain. Also, gives me energy.It's a little boring because there is no background music. But I have learned to live with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly for all of us","review":"This yoga video is as it is described Yoga for the Rest of Us. It is ideal for anyone starting out and also great for anyone who wants to follow a basic practice. It is designed to accomodate those with physical limitations, lack of experience as well as those with a knowledge and ability with yoga. As a yoga teacher I frequently recommend this video as one that is accessable to many and very safe to do alone. Peggy Cappy's style is open and clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs less narration","review":"Once Peggy goes through the introduction of Yoga and the positions, etc, I wish the DVD would be sectionalized so you can proceed through a routine WITHOUT all the interview clips, participant's comments and Peggy's \\"selling\\" you on yoga. It takes the attention off of concentrating on your movements, breathing and body awareness. In other words, once you have been introduced to the positions and their benefits (which only needs to be viewed once), it would be nice to be able to go through the routine with Peggy's timing and calming voice guiding you through the movements. Please redo this and other DVD's so we may truly use your gift of teaching yoga to the fullest benefit. It is hard to recommend this DVD since I feel like a light switch is being turned off and on by the disruption of interviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, even if you're already \\"physically fit\\"","review":"I initially purchased this for my 85 yr old mother. She's having trouble with flexibility and balance, and I thought this might help her. Before I sent it to her, I thought I'd better try it!I typically work out with weights and on a treadmill. I've done jazzercise, pilates and tae bo over the last few years. I consider myself pretty physically fit. HOWEVER, I've only tried yoga once or twice, so I would definitely consider myself a beginner there. I liked how Peggy led the exercises, and I was relaxed at times and very challenged at other times (e.g. keeping up with the sun salutations). I'm on line right now because I'm going to KEEP the copy I have, so I need to buy another for my mom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yoga DVD for the limited!","review":"After seeing the PBS special a few weeks ago, I couldn't wait to order the DVD but Amazon was sold out of the one advertised.I love Peggy Cappy's style of teaching. She gave different alternatives to yoga exercises and no \\"chit chat\\" with students that I have found annoying with other exercise DVDs.It is certainly not a video for the \\"professional\\" yoga student but perfect for those with limited capabilities or those who want good stretching routines.The 3 different, about 20 minute segments, are perfect. The viewer can do as much or as little as they want. The first segment is perfect for viewing before bedtime. It is relaxing and soothing.My only suggestion would be, and it may be difficult to still hear her, is to add soft background music."},{"rating":"1","title":"sterile yoga","review":"Peggy does show how to modify yoga poses for anyone with physical challenges; however, it is presented in a sterile, uninviting format. She seems embarrassed to even smile and the participants work hard at looking straight ahead rather than looking relaxed or enjoying the yoga experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"This DVD is a great introduction into yoga. It goes through many stretches and balance poses, constantly grading them for where ever you are physically. I appreciate the modifications she uses with a chair as quickly dropping and rising to the floor is not something I do well. As i continue to use the video i can feel my ability increasing. This is not for people who have good flexibility or some yoga experience. This video is truly for the beginner, the unfit, the elderly and the plus-size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plus size? You can do this!","review":"I'm large and want to increase flexibility, balance, stamina. Every other yoga DVD I've tried has started at a place that's too difficult for me given my size. Yoga for the Rest of Us really is adapted for those with physical limitations. I was able to do 40 minutes out of the 60 the first time through and I feel truly stretched, but definitely some muscles were challenged too. Great for out-of-shape beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is good for you IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A LOWER BACK PROBLEM.....","review":"This DVD is a nice stretch for the whole body, the standing poses could be a little trickie on the lower back, my lower back is very sensitive and I pulled it while doing this DVD, so be careful again if you do have a back problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect starter DVD!","review":"This is the perfect way to ease into yoga without any shame. Many options are given for all levels of fitness to participate without injury. The hour just flies by.

Just as thrilling as the first this will keep you guessing what's going to happen. If you want your teenage daughter to read give her this book and the one before. She'll love it and feel the same feelings as Hannah. Seeing as i'm a teenager i know what i'm talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely princess","review":"The doll is beautifull. My 4 years old daugther loves it, now she has the \\"Princess of the Portuguese Empire's friend\\". My only complaint is that the dress is sewed at the back, so if you get the dress off, then you will need to button up it in I don't know which way. My daugther loves to change the dolls dresses, so I guess I will have to think a good way to do it soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful doll","review":"This is truly a wonderful doll. Her body type is exactly like Princess of Portugal's and similar to that of Princess of Ireland. The first thing I noticed when I removed her from the box was that her dress was not removable like the other princesses. But still, it's a great doll and dress. Her hair is upswept into a bun which is behind a wonderful tiara w/ little aquamarine jewels that match her Cinderella like dress and eyes. Princess of the Danish Court also comes w/ earring that are the same ones that came w/ Princess of China. Also, unlike her pictures on the internet, she comes w/ a choker, the same material as the ribbon that's on top of the torso part of her dress. Her sleeves are puffy on the bottom half, and she comes w/ beautiful heeled shoes that are from her time. This doll is wonderful, her dress alone is worth the [cost]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not-quite-fabulous","review":"I've loved Barbies since they first came out, and I still believe dolls are to be PLAYED with, which is why I don't completely love this doll. She has awful hair, and what would it have cost them to throw a few snaps or some velcro on the back of her dress?On the other hand, the dress IS gorgeous, and the shoes are fabulous.

The answer to this question is in the book. What is the transitor? The answer is in the book. Understanding the answer is another, more personal, matter. Why was the transitor invented in the US, when it was? This facinating question is well explored in the book. One may be surprised to see the names of Hitler, Einstein, Salvador Dali and Picasso mentioned in the same breath with the inventors. Which co-inventor of the transistor went on to win a second Noble prize for superconductivity? The book does not play favorites among the three co-inventors but the work of John Bardine on the transistor and superconductivity is reason enough for the biography fan to read this book instead of watching the biography of the \\"Hamburger Barrons\\" on TV. The story is not an \\"easy read.\\" But cheer up, there are great pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating History","review":"The legend of Silicon Valley has long lived in the lore of techies everywhere.

Why did William Shockley (late of Bell Labs in New Jersey) choose Palo Alto as the site of his semiconductor venture?2. What were the names of the traitorous eight?3. What is the genealogy of spin-off's from Shockley Semiconductor?4.

Otherwise, you might find it interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book sets whets your appetite for more.","review":"Myself, like thousands of others in the electronics field, had of course known about Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain; and had thought that their contributions to the transistor's invention followed that order. This book sets the record straight, and this fact alone makes it worthwhile reading.As mentioned by other poster, the book does contain some technical mistakes, but one is not buying this book for the exact science; rather, it is the fascinating story of the people and events that led to the discovery and growth of one of the XX century's greatest inventions.There are of course, many contributors and events to the art and science of semiconductors who are barely mentioned, but I feel that would cause the book to become unwieldy and tedious. Rather, it whets your appetite for follow-up reading on related subjects, like T.R.Reid's \\"the Chip\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"Reading this book from the perspective of a retired history teacher and an amateur radio hobbyist might explain a bit of the 5 star rating.

Without its development I would not have been able to leave this review today. This is a look at how it developed and how it led to the start of the modern computer. My one complaint about this book is that it becomes far too bogged down in scientific jargon and lost the social history as it did so. The business discussion is mediocre at best especially given the delicate relations that occurred to fight over this chip.

The songs have the great synth melodies that we come to expect from Ganymede, along with their unique brand of intelligent lyrics. The vocal effects and backing vocals are top class and Euromantique improves (if that's possible) on the debut album After The Fall. There is plenty to get you up on the dancefloor with tracks like Are You Falling In Love Again and It's Not Enough while at the same time the mellow relective side is there with Kinder Days. Then there are the outstanding The Final Year and Legacy, both fantastic tracks looking at the end of the world along with its earliest beginnings.

Ganymede is up there in my top 5 artists right now, and for good reason.

I don't like writing in my books and sitting and wading throgh question after question to find out what kind of person I am was just stupid.

Not only is the text riddled with typos, but it presents an overly-simplistic and at times distorting view of Dolley. Zall continually refers to Dolley as a \\"mother\\" to those around her, attributing her actions to her gender rather than to her individual choices in unique circumstances. This book clearly aims at elementary school students, but it should be used with caution, as its focus on Dolley mothering both to her son Payne and to those around her distracts from her other activities."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disaster","review":"This little flash drive worked well out of the box. But by the end of the first week, the metal ring clip tore away from the rubber casing. No big deal, I suppose, but it was nice to be able to hang it from the key chain. The second week, neither my desktop nor my laptop recognized the device, and when I disconnected it from the latter, it had overheated and clearly no longer functional. I don't know if there's a relationship here, but after it failed on the desktop, so did my wireless network, which had to be reinstalled from scratch.

And she does it incredibly well. She is a great composer, pianist, and vocalist. And she's cute too! Really, the only thing I don't like about her is that she only has this one album out. So hurry up and buy it, so she'll make more! As both a fantasy fan, and a jazz fan, I can honestly say this will appeal to jazz fans just as much as fantasy and science fiction fans.

And, at the same time, realize that, if this is all true, then life is something far beyond what we have ever imagined.Since reading this book, I've found myself sitting and contemplating my existence, who I am, and what my purpose in life is more than I ever have before. I have to tell you it's an uncomfortable feeling at times.And I will say after having read the book, it might take some courage to read this and get through it.

The button you press down just stopped working. The directions were useless and I even went through the expense of getting new batteries (although the camera mechanics seem manual).

His teacher allowed him to use it on his birthday at school to capture some of his birthday memories. When we took the 3 rolls of film to be developed, not one picture came out. My son was devistated. He has since given it to his baby brother so he can \\"push the bottons\\".

Now I'm finding it difficult to load and advance the film... thought I figured it out, then realized the film didn't thread at all even though the number indicator advances each time you press the button. Forwarding wheel seems to be losing its action, too.Please don't waste your money; even disposable cameras would be more reliable and economical than this piece of junk.

The only problem, it doesn't work at all. It doesn't advance the film and if you can get it to advance it certainly doesn't rewind to take the film out. What a heartbreak. It's got such a great outside design and is so child friendly. Chicco should work over the camera part and this would sell big. The Fisher Price child camera works well, it's just too hard for a young child to use and has no fun features.

I have used 35mm film cameras for over 25 years, and I thought this would be fun for my son. The film does not advance properly, hence you don't get any pictures! My son clicked away, using the advance knob after each shot, only to have me open the back to get the film out and not a single shot had been taken! I ruined several rolls of film trying to use this piece of junk. I thought it would be good coming from a reputable company like Chicco, but it is definitely not.

What I didn't expect was the amount of risk-taking that James Farrell took in writing this book! He experiments wildly, but so successfully, that the reader accepts the creative writing as normal. One chapter starts with the diagram of a football play. In another chapter, a missionary preaches to a full church -- could be boring, but Farrell makes it work (with the liberal use of parentheses.) A Socialist Parade, popular songs, radio programs, a dance marathon, and the backdrop of the changing Chicago cityscape James Farrell uses to tell Studs' life. So, sure the story is compelling, harrowing and grounded in truth -- but the chances Farrell took in his writing can be used as a model for current writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book that takes you through many emotions!","review":"A great book that I keep reading about once a year.

Even if this were true - and for the record I wasn't convinced - he has precious little in his book that a lay reader can take away and use. I found his writing style to be pedantic and touchy-feely at the same time (not an easy thing to pull off), and sprinkled with long stretches of incomprehensible gibberish.

As far as I could see, every single analysis he gives and every single solution he proposes is anti-male. I get the impression he thinks the way to save a marriage is to remove the husband's spine.His thesis, that there is some sort of \\"psychological patriarchy\\" operating in our society, is simply asinine. I mean, come on, that's just nonsensical.He seems to use the word \\"Patriarchy\\" on every page, and the main portion of the book's content are anecdotes aimed at painting men in a bad light.

Since the original text in ancient Greek is provided on the facing page, the editors assume that anyone with a little knowledge of Greek can supplement the looseness of the translation by referring to the original. And in general, the compromises made in this way are good ones throughout the series. Bury's translation is one of the better ones in the series, achieving readability without sacrificing fidelity. There are also some fine notes to help with some of the more obscure mathematical arguments. It is also very useful to have the Timaeus and the Critias presented together.

You can see it on UTUBE, but for some reason you won't find it here in this DVD version.I liked this film very much, but I must reluctantly give it one star -- I can't recommend a film that has a major song sequence cut from it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Product!!","review":"I originally ordered this product from ritz.com to take advantage of the military discount and I had to cancel because it took them over two weeks to ship something that was supposedly in stock. I ordered this product through Amazon on the 12th and had it on the 14th eventhough I paid for 3 day shipping. So now I finally have the product and I am loving it! Amazon Rocks!! This model is sold as an academic model, it is identical to the PTZ631W as far as I could tell. I am a student but there wasn't any type of confirmation process, you just get the same product at a cheaper price!!It is easier for me to use the pen in mouse mode than it is the default mode.

According to the reviews I read, they are very comfortable; however, I didn't anticipate that they would be so thin that one could see through them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The first reviewer really does sum up this book. This the usual very thorough scholarly and very unenlightening look at Mary Magdalene...no new questions asked, no myths consulted, no real ideas entertained. Why did he bother? With the wealth of the gnostic codices now before us, Mr. Chilton still talks about demons in the Magdalene? He still talks about demons at all? He airily assumes that Mary is from the city of Magdala when quite a few of his fellow scholars question whether the town that exported salted fish was actually called Magdala at the time of Mary? He pays no attention to the ancient documentation that calls her a \\"priest.\\" He assumes it was she who annointed Jesus with her hair? The book is tiresome. It could have been written fifty years ago. For all I know, it was. Bruce just dragged it out now to catch a little star dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"It sure beats the DaVinci Code!","review":"Chilton provides an excellent review of the church's response to the faith of Mary Magdalene. I appreciated his commentary on gnostic thought and, as always, his scholarship is impeccible. This book doesn't read as easily as did his almost-novelesque Rabbi Jesus. Chilton takes much more liberty in drawing conclusions about the Magdalen than the research should allow. Still, the book is well written and provides plenty of food for thought. If your church book club read the DaVinci Code, they should follow it up with Mary Magdalen: A Biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rabbi Jesus?","review":"Throughout this entire book, the author referred to Jesus as Rabbi Jesus.

She likes watching Barney deal with the elements--rain, snow, wind, etc. There is one page where Barney is drinking from a cup. The text goes: On very hot days, Barney drinks from a cup.\\" We've used this phrase to help our daughter grasp the concept of drinking form a cup herself. She picked up on this very early."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun, great message","review":"I have not been keeping up with the newer Veggie Tales and had the idea that the series had lost its magic touch, but this one had me laughing right away, from the moment when the opening menu and music began.You should definitely see at least the first two Lord of the Rings films before viewing this, as half the fun is that connection. If you haven't seen LotR, don't skip this film, just consider this Veggie Tales one more reason to go out and see LotR.A lot of creativity and thought went into the film and it can be enjoyed on several levels: the story itself; the parody; the use-your-gifts-wisely message; and a deeper spiritual message. The dry well at the end of the story is all four: a dry well, Mount Doom, a symbol of overwhelming physical suffering and poverty, and potentially a well of living water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the other Veggie Tales movies","review":"Our family typically likes Veggie Tales movies, but this one is our least favorite. Unlike \\"Josh and the Big Wall\\" or \\"Dave and the Giant Pickle,\\" LOTB has little if any Bible message. And unless you've watched \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" movies, you won't understand the plot or the humor. Furthermore, the music and several of the scenes were a bit too scary and dark for my 3 year old. It seemed as though the makers of this movie just threw in a Bible verse in the last scene, when in fact the verse didn't apply to the movie much at all. I think Veggie Tales should go back to the old days when their movies were uniquely Biblical and humorous, instead of trying to make children's videos that are parodies of adult movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right audience","review":"We watched about 15 minutes of this movie before packing it in. The parody was of no interest to a 7-year-old who hasn't any knowledge of LOTR. The beginning was slow and boring, and the ensuing darker scenes frightened our son to the point of tears. Our child does love the Veggie Tales that are takeoffs of Bible stories, because he knows the stories and can make the connections. I'll gladly continue to support those Big Idea creations. I just wanted to back up those few reviewers who did not enjoy this particular story and found it inappropriate for young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average Children's Entertainment","review":"My family use to love watching Veggie Tales. The original episodes were hilarious, filled with silly songs that would make the whole family giggle and laugh. But since Veggie Tales sale in 2003 to Classic Media, Veggie Tales have been bland and filled with songs that seem devised by someone with no musical ear at all. Lord of the Beans is no exception. It falls flat, and is reduced to just another below average episode of a once great franchise. Check out the earliest Veggie Tales, but pass on the episodes in the Classic Media era."},{"rating":"2","title":"VeggieTales","review":"VeggieTales - LORD OF THE BEANS, My kids love the veggies.

It is not they put a nice lite fun touch to every situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Beans","review":"My grandson is 6 yrs old ADHD/Artistic, He loves it and can watch it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Veggie Tales at its best!","review":"Though it seems cliche, this movie can be enjoyed by both young and old. The movie teaches a great lesson on using your gifts in a meaningful and educational way. In addition, anyone who is at all familiar with the Lord of the Rings movies will laugh at the repeated jokes made at its expense. And better yet, unlike the original LOTR, Lord of the Beans is always interesting and never lags for a second.The movie, of course, keeps the Veggie Tales magic alive with its beautiful computer animation and flawless character casting. Children will be able to easily understand the concepts presented and may take a few lessons with them.This would be a great movie to show to your children or Sunday school class, or for yourself just to point and laugh at the constant LOTR connections. This is a must for any Veggie Tales collection. And anyone who has yet to start one, may want to begin with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Movie Whether You Like Lord Of The Rings Or Not","review":"This Veggie Tales movie is loosely based upon the first book of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy (Fellowship Of The Ring). In it are many funny take-offs of the names from the book and even better extremely funny scenes lampooning parts of the recent Peter Jackson movie. Really a great little video."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE the Sporks! :-)","review":"My children and I love this movie. My boys really get a kick out of the sporks!

Okay, I bought this for my children, and we were so excited to have a new VT to watch. I fell asleep 1/4 of the way through it. It literally lulled me to sleep. Yes, I am familiar with LOTR, etc. My children are not allowed to watch these movies. I was bothered by the fact that elves, 'magic' beans, and middle earth were even mentioned in a VT. Those are not Christian virtues to teach my babies. Needless to say, this was a sad amount of money to waste, and LOTB now sits discarded, where it belongs. I hope and pray that the Big Idea people come back to talking more about God, and less about Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Veggies have sold out!","review":"I have been a huge Veggie Tales fan for seven years. I have always appreciated the Biblical message, and the creative way it was presented to my children. The Veggies don't do this anymore. No more Bible stories. How tragic that they have to resort to a pagan/grail story to present their message. The message isn't even Christian anymore. It teaches a message laced with Liberation Theology and salvation by works. We have to be vigilant in guarding our children against Gramscian (Third Way) Socialism. This kind of message has been crammed down our throats in the secular arena. That is OK. I expect that from the secular world. It is tragic that this \\"paradigm shift\\" has entered into our evangelical churches. The Lord said \\"My people are destroyed from lack of knowledge\\" Hosea 4:6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done!","review":"VeggieTales never lets you down and this is no exception. The story is about sharing a gift and how to use it to help others and I am always happy to show such positive cartoons to my kids. The characters are funny, the story easy to follow, and all the colors and jokes make it entertaining for the whole family. I highly recommend it, and if you are a LOTR fan to begin with, the humor will be extra fun for you to enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than some of their recent efforts","review":"You really need to be familiar with the 'Lord of the Rings' movies to see the parodies for what they are. The Billboy (Bilbo) speech at his birthday party cracked us up, but it wouldn't have if he wadn't seen the movie. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments. Overall, these just aren't quite the same, it seems they're trying to fit the message to the story when it used to be the other way around. Still, its better than most of the entertainment that's available, and this is worth watching. I'd rate it in my top 10:1.Lyle the Kindly Viking2.Little Joe3.King George4.Dave and the Giant Pickle5.Madame Blueberry6.Josh and the Big Wall7.Lord of the Beans8.Are You My Neighbor?9.Rack, Shack and Benny10.A Snoodle's Tale"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOTR fan turned VeggieTales fan!","review":"I have never seen a Veggie Tales movie prior to this one, nor have I even been interested until now. My young children and I are huge LOTR fans and couldn't wait to try this one out. It is hilarious!! Many of the lines are taken directly from the movies, and the parodies of the characters were great. We especially loved the SPORKS! The story kept moving, the message was clear, the humor was intelligent. I could have done without the seemingly impromptu songs, but we will most certainly check out other Veggie Tales movies now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!","review":"Being a Veggietales and Lord of the Rings fan, I couldn't wait for the release of Lord of the Beans. It was well worth the wait! My 3 year old son loves it and so do we! All of our friends who watched it - those familiar with Veggietales and those not - thought this was hilarious! This has been my favorite Veggietales.

This book follows the story closely and has great photos. Since it is a board book the pages won't get ripped and it will last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't make them like this anymore.","review":"Why wasn't this the best-selling album of 1993? I've listened to this CD countless times over the years, and I'm still astounded that it in withered in obscurity while similar-sounding but inferior products (Hootie & the Blowfish, anyone?) topped the charts.The songs are first-rate, and the arrangements are fresh and interesting, balancing sophisticated percussion and orchestration with earthier elements, like mandolin and dobro. I especially love the textural contrasts between Steve Moos's raggedy lead vocals and David Starns's gorgeous, overdubbed harmonies. If Bob Dylan and Brian Wilson had met as teens, they might have made an album together like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printing problem","review":"I have no quarrel with the content of the book because it was too difficult to read in the format from Digireads.

The reason why that is, is because I had almost all of the Sonic Genesis Games and because when you have all the new generation games most people are going to play those....I am not saying old games stink, I am a HUGE Sonic Fan. The fact that is the only thing I asked for my birthday was Sonic Stuff and I bought this by selling my broken PS2 and all of the games I got three games this was one and I still do play it but I have SA2B, SADX & SSBM to keep my time and yet this still has a BIG place in my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game...","review":"Sonic Mega Collection: To sum it up in 1 word brilliant.

This game has all the genesis games made. The basic run-to-the-end-of-the-stage gameplay is what rules here. The bosses are simple, just time your jumps just right, hitting Robotnik 8 times to beat him. There is also the chaos emerald collecting, which is different in every game. After collecting 7 chaos emeralds, you can transform to supersonic, after collecting either 50 or 100 rings(I can't remember, its been so long.) Trust me, this is a must have for anyone who claims to be a sonic fan. Its just old school 2D Sonic, but what do you expect from games made from a system 10 years old? Graphics are 16-bit quality, but what do you expect from Sega Genesis games?My only objection is the exclusion of Sonic CD and the inclusion of Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.(Wasn't this game a Kirby game on SNES?) If Sonic CD was included, this would be perfect.Well worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is pretty good.","review":"Especially if you play it with friends because a couple of the games are multiplayer. I got this for Christmas and it brings back memories. Sonic 3 is my favorite game but the hidden game Flicky, and Dr. Robotnik's Mean bean machine also come close. Overall, this game is cool because it has around 10 or so games on it. However, don't expect the graphics to be topnotch or anything. They're pretty good and all, but then again, they were directly ported from the Sega games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality classics back to life","review":"This game consists of 7 sega classics, and 5 unlockable games. I have unlocked all the games, which is an unbeleivably long process, because you must access all the games about 50 times to do it. On the plus side, you don't have to be able to beat any of the games to do it. I would've spent the 40 bucks for sonic 1,2, and 3, but it also comes with sonic and knuckles, sonic spinball, and the mean bean machine, a dr. mario type puzzle game. Also 3D blast, almost forgot. You get to play as knuckles in the unlockable games, the blue sphere mini-game from sonic 3, and two lovable non-sonic titles, very hard by the way. I am 20, been around, and this is the best deal I've seen on one game ever. Besides, what's 40 bucks, if you wanted a used sega with these titles, you'd be payin around 100 by the end of it. I've never regretted buying it, and still haven't conquered everything. Plenty of gameplay, and good for all ages, definately a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who could rate this anything less than 5 stars?","review":"An exquisite collection of Sonic hits.

He moves to a cottage on his brother's property near Ben's widow, Kate Frobisher, a sculptor and begins his book.

A quietly riveting tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start, then a crash","review":"This subtly written, beautiful book loses its bearings on page 204. Up until then it is written in alternating points of view: Stephen and Kate each have a story to tell and a historical connection through Kate's dead husband.On page 204, the reader is suddenly given Justine's point of view (she is Stephen's much younger lover). Her thoughts are ordinary and banal. Then we are admitted to the view of Justine's father, Alec, for just a few pages. All this in the service of explaining a story that would be better left subtly unexplained.Why was the author so determined to explain everything? To make everything come out even, so to speak?The book is neatly tied up in the last fifty pages and the reader is left believing everyone will live happily ever after, at least for the near future.

If \\"Please, Please Me\\" (\\"Meet the Beatles\\", in the US) represented childhood, \\"Abbey Road\\" marked their passage into maturity. Simply put, \\"Abbey Road\\" is a work of art.\\"Abbey Road\\" demonstrated that Lennon and McCartney could still write, that Harrison was underrated, that Ringo could drum with the best, that George Martin was a genius, and that the Beatles could literally bring you into their music.If you do not have \\"Abbey Road\\", buy it. If you are really lucky, you may find it on vinyl. No matter how you find it, keep the volume at mid range, and allow the genius of George Martin to work the volume, and take you from Come Together, to The End."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best recording ever?","review":"The Beatles knew they were about to part ways, you can see such in the \\"Let It Be\\" film. But at some point, they got together and made the best album ever. The guitar work is tremendous throughout. Is Ringo a \\"real\\" rock and roll drummer? It is proved here. Harrison's \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" are, in my opinion, 2 of the most beautiful ever written. The opera-like \\"You Never Give Your Money\\" medly is quite a musical work. Who else but The Beatles could write a song about a killer (Maxwell's Silver Hammer) and make it hummable and humorous. Younger hard rock fans will enjoy the guitar licks. This was the last from The Beatles and they made sure it was the best. I love the close, \\"and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make\\". This is indeed a masterpiece"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Abbey Road copy is better than most but not flawless !","review":"The sound quality of this remaster is great ! Sad to say it does have a few pressing issues! Not sure if I will keep or send back to try and get a flawless copy of my favorite Beatles album. My copy sounds great except for song 5 on 1st side \\"Octopus's Garden\\" Has a scratching noise in 3 or 4 places. On side 2 song 3 \\" You Never Give Me Your Money\\" also has a fair amount of surface noise and scratching while the song plays but not as noticeable as on \\"Octopus's Garden \\" . I really wanted this one to be perfect. It sad that Rainbow Records let these leave the factory. They landed the Holy Grail of the vinyl record pressing business and dropped the ball. I hope they review the issues and fix them and I hope they at least step up and make things right with retailers and customers. I will probably try to get a perfect copy ! Hope I'm not searching for my own Holy Grail !!!! The music is awesome none the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Album But Poor Reproduction in CD","review":"This is probably the best album of the Beatles. I've had this album in vinyl. Unfortunately, the CD reproduction has lost the beauty of the sound of this album. I use audiophile grade stereo system and to no avail. I've also tried it in my Discman and my other mini components but still the poor sound. Other Beatles albums have been reproduced better in CD. It's a pity the record company does not plan to remaster it to make it sound better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my niece who has recently discovered vinyl.

The songs on this record are up-beat and fun so if you listen to it a few times you'll know all the words. Then you'll be singing along with one of the '60-'70's greatest bands.In my opinion,wow! Good album! The songs are great and so is the band, what else do you need?I reccommend this album to any one who likes rock/pop music. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, andStar did a good job! Listen and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have in any serious music lover's collection","review":"Not that this album needs any introduction... It's a timeless classic and listening to it allows you to discover new things in these songs every time you play it. It's hard to believe this music came out when it did, it sounds way ahead of its time. This issue is excellent sonically, with all the details there, good dynamics and relatively free of \\"digititis\\" (although of course if you are lucky enough to have this on good vinyl that remains the standard). Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 More Stars","review":"I'll add my 5. This page is already plenty heavy with the well-deserved praise for this classic album. I'll just lend a couple more comments. Abbey Road gave the world a confirming insight into a still not-so-acknowledged fact: that the real talent in the Beatles was George Harrison. As a good friend of mine said after Harrison died, \\"Paul McCartney is now in a two-way tie for most talented living Beatle.\\" (Thinking man's joke). I am not trying to invite the wrath of a classic rock dj somewhere or some know it all college freshman (born 20 years after this record was cut), but Abbey Road always struck me as the first great comprehensive rock album, where each individual song connected to its neighbors on the songlist. Nice flow. Anyway, a great piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you \\"enhance\\" THE classic Beatles album?","review":"\\"Abbey Road (Remastered) [Enhanced, Limited Edition, Original recording remastered]\\"This is almost unrecognizable with the original in sound reproduction.

The Beatles proved they could rock both early (Hard Day's Night) and late (Back in the USSR) in their career. So, I've never really understood this band's attraction to silly, non-rock songs like Maxwell's Silver Hammer or Octopuses' Garden (or Yellow Submarine from Revolver for that matter). Additionally, this album has a lot of incompleted songs (Mr. Mustard, Polythene Pam, Bathroom Window, The End, Her Majesty) that have nice sounding phrases or hooks, but no verses around them. Also, what is the deal with I Want You? It has only one lyric.If you are expecting the dynamic combination of the Lennon/McCartney duo present in the earlier years, it seems to be missing. There are John's songs like Come Together and Paul's songs, like Oh Darling.Why give it 2 stars? I'll give you 2 words - George Harrison. Something and Here Comes the Sun save Abbey Road."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic product....great service!","review":"exactly what I expected to receive and the shipment was handled promptly and efficiently.Thank You!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate, Saved by George.","review":"George Harrison saves this otherwise mediocre effort of Lennon/McCartney by writing the two best songs on the album, Something and Here Comes the Sun. Without these we are left with the mediocre (Come Together, Oh Darling, I Want You), the silly (Octopuses Garden, Maxwell's Silver Hammer), and the incomplete but pasted together fare of Polythene Pam, Bathroom Window, Mr. Mustard.Interesting to note that George not only had the two best songs on Abbey Road, but the best song on the White Album (While My Guitar Gently Weeps), Revolver (Taxman), Rubber Soul (If I Needed Someone) and With The Beatles (Don't Bother Me).No surprise that George's first solo effort \\"All Things Must Pass\\" was so much better than Paul's \\"McCartney\\" or John's \\"Plastic Ono Band\\".As for Abbey Road, I've framed the cover, but no longer play the CD. Too dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, not bad at all......","review":"Got a chance to do a side by side with an earlier import version of the record. Remastered version is more open. Sound field stretches beyond the confines of the the speakers, instead of being suspended between. Sound is a bit peaky, as seems to b typical of most remasters these days. I'm not really sure why this is, but I leave that for bigger minds. Overall I give it a B+, compared to C for the import version.DJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"Está fuera de cualquier clasificación","review":"Este es, en mi opinión, el mejor disco de la historia y no sólo por las imágenes y recuerdos que tengo asociados a él.

Lo compré por primera vez en el año 1973 (conocí a los Beatles el año anterior) y al día siguiente ya tenía el vinilo rayado de la cantidad de veces que había escuchado la cara segunda. Lo he recomprado cinco veces más y cuando inicié el paso de los vinilos a los CDs, fue el primero que adquirí.No soy capaz de imaginar, en caso de que JPG&R; no se hubieran separado, si hubieran podido superar un tabajo como éste.

Lennon shines (and I mean shines even by Lennon's high standards) on \\"Come Together\\", \\"Because\\", \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\", and \\"Polythene Pam\\", which are probably my favorite parts of the album. Harrison's two numbers are great - I usually tend to dislkie them but here he tones down the guitar-driven mysticism a bit. \\"Octupus's Garden\\" is not a deep song, but it is a fun song. And even though McCartney does give us the album's low point (the corny \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\"), he does contribute \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" and \\"The End\\" to the medley, which are both highlights of the album. Overall, this may or may not be the best Beatles album, but it is probably in the top three or so. Which makes it essential listening in the catalog of rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reviewer Below Is reviewing a classic 30 years late","review":"\\"Abbey Road\\" is a fitting conclusion to the Beatles reign.

But a few months ago, i was in my brother's room, and I said, what the hey, let's give the great Abbey Road a chance. I listened to it, twice, and honestly, I don't get it. \\"Come Together\\" is a pretty good song, but the rest is slow, soulful balladiering slush. It's just plain BORING. I can only listen to Paul sing like choir boy so long before I ache to hear George just pick up his guitar and give us a blues lick. This is the greatest rock n'roll album of all time?

They were not a \\"true\\" band because they rarely played live. It is sad that albums like \\"Abbey Road\\" are considered great. The Beatles were simply products of a studio. Listen to Lennon play with Yoko at Madison Square Garden- they sound like a band I knew in high school- \\"Nobody Goes to Sweden\\"! Listen to the Stones.

Yes they were big back in the day but now they just sound very dated but the older generation still keeps pushing them on us. Yes they do have some good songs but not on this album. Most of them are kindda childish sounding like this cd was aimed at children. Towards the end the songs are very very short like they came up with a little tune that couldn't become a whole song so they just stuck those unfinished songs on the album. I think the song Maxwell's hammer is funny because the lyrics are about Maxwell killing people with his hammer while the music to the song is very happy.

This aspect of the Beatles' myth is responsible for \\"Abbey Road\\" being the most overrated album in the Beatles' catalog. Songs like \\"Octopus's Garden\\" and \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" are beneath the attention of an adult intellect; the latter is a perfect example of what Lennon derisively called McCartney's \\"granny songs\\". And the highly touted medley is, as Lennon pointed out, just a bunch of abandoned, half-baked ideas strung together. Of the albums actually recorded as albums (i.e., setting aside \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\"), this is the Beatles' poorest effort -- the work of people who were becoming more interested in solo projects and who would soon call it quits as a group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abbey Road - Unbiased Review","review":"It is understandable how fans of the Beatles continually rate this album so highly, and I would agree if I were ranking solely versus the rest of the Beatles limited catalogue.Evaluating Abbey Road on its own yields great songs by George (Here Comes the Sun, Something) but they are toally offset by childish songs by Paul (Maxwell's Silver Hammer), self indulgent songs by John (I Want You - gee, don't go overboard on the lyrics, John) and goofiness by Ringo (Octopuses Garden).Evaluating the album versus others of its time (Cream, Hendrix, Led Zep) sadly exposes just how far the Beatles were behind the times. 1 star. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatles are pretty boring.","review":"I never could understand why the Beatles are so popular? They are pretty boring too just like Pink Floyd. Each and every song on this album can put me to sleep in about 55 seconds. I just dont like it because it sucks! Dont listen to the moronic 5 star reviewers below. The Beatles only made one good album and that's the one which contains Ballad Of John And Yoko, Hey Jude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Short","review":"I wish this album was as good as it's built up to be. It's not.Here Comes the Sun is good, but there are a few slow, boring songs (Sun King, Because) and a lot of unfinished songs (I Want You, Mr. Mustard, Polythene Pam, Bathroom Window, Her Majesty, The End).If it weren't for George Martin splicing these things together this would have been a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatness achieved","review":"the best band that ever recorded on this planet has achieved musical genius on Abbey Road. there will never be a better band!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh!","review":"I have been a die hard Beatles fan for over 40 years. I purchased the Remastered Mono box set and was so pleased with the great sound improvement, even on average to low quality equipment. I purchased the Stereo Abbey Road because it was originally mixed in stereo, unlike all the other Beatles albums.The mono remastered CDs are clearly superior to the old fake stereo. But this remastered CD has very little improvement. Yeah, the drums on Come Together are stronger, but it just has no extra oomph like the Mono CDs.To sum up my feelings on this stereo remaster: meh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dead tells no lies","review":"hey this is the band with the dead guy right?What would you say if the title had been 'Everest' as some claim.

The way the second half is like on big song is great! What a way for the greatest band ever to make their exit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How can anyone rag on this album?","review":"\\"Abbey Road\\" is one of the best albums the Beatles ever released (right behind \\"Revolver\\" and \\"The White Album\\"). Finally, George Harrison comes into his own as a songwriter (\\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" are two of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard). The second side medley shows the genius of McCartney and Lennon; bringing various songs which could stand on their own, and combining them into one theme. It's too bad there weren't more songs on this album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say they're the greatest rock group ever...","review":"Abbey Road is my pick for the greatest album of all time- and if you don't believe me then you've never heard the musical nirvana that is her B-Side. Arranged by Paul McCartney, is composed of several song fragments that somehow blend together into what has to be the most perfect piece of songwriting in the history of rock music. The A-side isn't shabby either- \\"Come Together\\" and \\"Something\\" are great songs that would make any album stand out and there's a simple joy to \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and Ringo's \\"Octopus's Garden.\\" Indeed either half of the album would be legendary- but the combined effect is an achievement in rock music that has never been equaled, and is all the explanation anyone will ever need as to why the Beatles are still worshipped by millions of fans. Absolutely an assential for any music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles' Abbey Road is a triumphant masterpiece of music","review":"The Beatles' last album Abbey Road is the bestselling Beatles album ever and for good reason. Although it is not as creative as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, it does have a number of memorable tracks on it. From the first song Come Together (this song has been covered by a number of artists including Michael Jackson) to my personal favorite the George Harrison song Here Comes the Sun. This is an upbeat album with some fun songs like Octopus' Garden and Mean Mr. Mustard. One of my favorite Beatles lines, the love you take is equal to the love you make, is in The End a track on this album. This album is better than The White Album and Revolver and comes close to topping Sgt. Pepper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential to any music collection.","review":"Hard to believe mine is the first review to be recoreded here. I remember the night I first heard this album in 1969. There's a reason this ended up the Beatles best-selling album...The Music. Powerful,sweet, melodic, silly, masterful, incomparable. No band ever had a more monumental and lasting swan song. Listen and appreciate the genius that four of them together (with George Martin's wonderful assistance) created."},{"rating":"2","title":"surely is one of the best albums of all time","review":"I've always liked the Beatles but I had never really heard their albums properly.When I put the CD and sat back, I was astounded, not because it wasn't any good, but because I knew I was listening to something really special.I had heard several of the songs on the Anthology 3 collection, and I was delighted with how the songs, in particular Polythene Pam and Mean Mr Mustard, had transformed themselves from accoustic ear bashers into absolute magic.It is hard to fault the songs on this album, the lyrics, the music, the vocals - its all pure genius.Now for the one minor criticism - Sun King - I think it is a cracking piece of music, but it feels out of place.The \\"side 2\\" suite is fantastically done, again as I had heard beforehand the songs demo-ed individually and they link together perfectly.I can say for certain that when I die, I want all of Abbey Road played at my funeral service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Because the World is Round","review":"Listen to Because and tell me if there were ever three guys who sang better harmony. What a beautiful song.George shines on this album, contributing Something and Here Comes the Sun, probably his two best.Lennon was coasting/obsessing on Yoko. He has only one real song, Come Together, a rocker with a Walrus-like lyric. I Want You is a borderline experimental track from a suffering man.The medley is great but probably overrated in that they were unfinished songs. One thing that's overlooked with this album is that many of the songs -- the snippets at least -- were leftovers deemed unfinished or not good enough for the White Album. It's obvious that the Beatles' bag was nearly empty. It's like they picked up all the crumbs for a tapestry.Still, the album sounds great, very polished. Ringo is excellent throughout. Lots of Beatle harmonies.Bottom line: Great but not their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"beatles best","review":"i wanted to give this 5 stars but octopus\`s garden and maxwells silver hammer are the only negative tracks.\\"something\\" is incredible (john lennon at his best).but i have to take my hat off to paul macartney for what is on side b.\\"golden slumbers\\" and \\"carry that weight\\" are class...\\"mean mr mustard and polythene pam\\" are brilliant,but \\"you never give me your money\\" is in my opinion the best beatle track.it was the first time i had heard a song go in so many different directions but just come together so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Side is the Best","review":"The second side of Abbey Road is my all time favorite record.

This is because the songs aren't really songs, but short samples of unfinished works that can't stand on their own.Pink Floyd got this concept right with Dark Side of the Moon, with full length songs.Overall OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Although, many fans consider the legendary Beatles' final album their best, try as I may, I just can not see Abbey Road as anything great. \\"Oh! Darling,\\" \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and \\"Octopus' Garden\\" are just silly, the song suite on the second side is well constructed but utterly confused and jumbled and \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" becomes very tedious. Only \\"Come Together,\\" \\"Something,\\" \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and the cool cover image reflect the band's past greatness. You may enjoy it. Many do. But I would recommend Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's, the white album and even lesser acclaimed Beatles albums such as Magical Mystery Tour and Let It Be before the weak silliness of Abbey Road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abbey Road","review":"For me, Abbey Road is the Beatles' masterpiece. The Beatles were the Beatles because, while they embraced rock, they also transcended it...attaining a kind of lyrical quality that few, if any, from the Rock era achieved...and Abbey Road is the ultimate manisfestation of that. In a sense it is a bitter-sweet experience for me to listen to it: sweet because it is so impressive; bitter because it signifies what they could achieve...yet this was their last album before they split. Ah! the what-could-have-beens...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles, Abby Road and songs about serial killers.","review":"For those of us who grew up listening to the Beatles, Abby Road is, for me, some of their most fondly remembered music. It is at the same time a sampling of some of the variety of styles represented by their music while being some of the most fun and \\"singable\\" songs that they created. From introspective to whimsical, the songs of Abby Road are well recorded and deliver a \\"close and casual\\" feeling that is a rare combination of studio quality and \\"live\\" spontaneity. I heartily recommend this CD to anyone interested in the Beatles. It is important to note that none of the Beatles music is available online (legally) from iTunes or the other music download services. So... buy the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"the greatest","review":"Abbey Road is the greatest albun in the history of rock n'roll.

Moving away from their psychedelic roots, they recorded an album that was heavy, gentle, sweeping, and fitting.Many people will know it for songs like \\"Something\\" or \\"Come Together\\" which stand as monumental singles. However, people tend to forget the two sweeping medleys that take up the second half of the album. Unlike things they had done previously, The Beatles once again took their artform to another level by placing multiple song medleys to end off their career.Also, don't forget the heavy rock displayed by Lennon's \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy).\\" Add the playful songs such as \\"Octopus' Garden\\" and \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and you have a complete Beatles' album fitting enough to finish their career and dazzling enough to influence new ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the Best","review":"This is among the Beatles' best albums, coming at the end of their career. \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" is a masterpiece that still sounds good today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatles and Abbey Road","review":"The Beatles are famous not for making great music, but for being popular (there IS a difference). They may have made some great songs, even on this album (Here Comes the Sun and Come Together) but their filler was less than bearable. Rock and roll was all about the evolution of blues to a faster beat. I hear little blues in the Beatles' songs, in fact most of it (especially Sgt. Pepper's) was experimental and a type of music that never caught on. If one wants some good rock and roll, try the Rolling Stones or Jimi Hendrix, who made the best blues rock and roll ever. Abbey Road has some timeless classics, and it is an injustice to say that the Beatles were not a good band, but they were popular, which in some people's minds made them great, which they were not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been SO Much Better","review":"Given that \\"Let It Be\\" had not been released by the time \\"Abbey Road\\" was recorded, it's unfortunate that the unfinished songs on side two of Abbey Road as well as the stupid Maxwell's Silver Hammer and Octopuses Garden weren't replaced by some of the better songs on Let It Be. As a result, the Beatles finished with yet another sub-par album in typical post-1965 fashion; a few good songs, with lots of silliness and filler interspersed among them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medicore at best","review":"This is the beatles most overrated album. I never understood why it's often praised so often. I mean sone songs on Side 1 are meaningless and silly.

Side one of Abbey Road doesn't flow at all, especially with the goofy Maxwell and Octopuses Garden. Hypnotic is Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon. This doesn't come close.Here Comes the Sun very good, but can't save the album. 2-stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEATLES WORST ALBUM","review":"That being said, this is still better than most other albums. But this is shockingly mediocre, especially from a band who, two years earlier, were writing epics like \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and \\"A Day in the Life.\\" Most songs here feature weak, annoying melodies and drugged-out, throw-away lyrics, and uninspired vocals. Their heart wasn't into this at all, and it shows. \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" is pleasant, at best, \\"I Want You\\" is inexcusably long, and the medley is excruciating slop. If you can sit through all that though, you will hear two of Harrison's finest compositions. It was those two that earned the album its 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still not seeing it","review":"I know I am probably wrong about this- the numbers after all do not lie: 294 five-star reviews vs. mine, but I still do not see what all of the fuss is about. The Beatles wrote some good, catchy songs and they were obviously quite influential in modern music. Nevertheless, after twenty-six years of hearing these jingles, they really have not grown on me at all. All the kings horses have failed to explain to me what exactly about the Beatles is that ingenious. It seems that the rest of music (here: rock n' roll) had pretty much lapped the Beatles by the time this came around. I have an image of hell as the constant replaying of Penny Lane over and over and over again. Funny thing is hell sounds a bit like commercial radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped boy band with no musical talent, Stick with Jonas Brothers.","review":"I Love rock n roll to the fullest, my favorite bands are Nickelback, Staind, Creed, and Kid Rock. One thing I absolutely hate is when boy bands try to disguise themselves as rock n roll groups. First of all, Mic Jagger can't sing at all on this album and why does he change his voice up so much!!! Second, just because a song is named \\"Octopus's Garden\\" doesn't make it good! lastly, if the Beatles want to have any success they should try to sing about better things like talented groups N Sync and Backstreet Boys. Mic Jagger and his band the Beatles have no place in Rock n roll and should take their garbage back to Australia!For good rock n roll stick with:1. Jonas Brothers2. Simple Plan3.

While every song on this album is nothing short of great, I've been in the habit lately of starting with track 6 \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" and letting it play all the way to \\"The End\\" and rolling into the final 26 seconds of \\"Her Majesty\\" Knowing the history of this album (it was the last recorded material The Beatles did, not the last album released - that honor belongs to \\"Let It Be\\"), it's amazing that during the time of a breakup, they have created a masterpiece.

Remarkable performances captured for all of time. Its joyful and melancholy, gritty and polished, and a lasting masterpiece. The Beatles were the hardest working band since their inception. There are legions of pretenders whose whole career wouldn't even add up to side 1 of this album. The Beatles musical palette is still the envy of the industry. There was always something for everybody and everyone was invited to join in. The Beatles were the original big tent and tell me how many other groups does anyone ever ask \\" who was your favorite member\\"? Since they never got to follow up this album, \\"its been a long cold lonely winter\\"...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Voice of God.","review":"This Cd is the last together recorded by The Beatles. \\"Come Together\\", \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" are here.

This album is just like the God's Voice, speaking with us."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles' finest work","review":"Pop Kulcher Review: However indisputably great and important the Beatles were, the fact is I just don't listen to 'em all that much -- the sad result of radio overkill, I suppose. The lone exception is Abbey Road, and particularly side two (or, for the digital age, the latter 2/3 of the cd). McCartney managed to take a bunch of so-so tunes and weave them into one of the most memorable musical suites in rock history. From the melodic silliness of \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" through the blistering (well, by John & George standards) guitar duel in \\"The End,\\" the last 20 minutes of this are enough to demonstrate to newcomers what it was that made the Beatles so incredible. Not to mention John's sparse but entrancing \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy),\\" and Paul's throat-shredding \\"Oh, Darling.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but sad","review":"Unless you lived through it, the intensity of Beatlemania is hard to imagine. With all the hype, the sheer excellence of their musicianship is often overlooked. On 'Abbey Road', the quality of the work is stupendous. It's a sad album because one can sense that the dream is starting to unravel. But any time you play it, you'll be reminded that the Beatles were truly great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reason music was created","review":"It seems pretty stupid praising an album that is already considered one the greatest rock albums of all time, but it is. O.k, maybe a few songs from the first half of the album could be given a miss, but the second half is absoulutely breathtaking. Don't listen to the 'Stones'fans on here that dismiss this album, this is a masterpiece, and if songs like 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer and 'I Want You' are your only reasons for hating it, then thats a pretty lame excuse. How could anyone possibly give this album one star when it has long been considered one of the greatest albums of all time? All I am saying is, if you're new to the Beatles, or would like to get interested in them, then I would highly recommend it. Don't listen to all those goons on here that slag it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Crowning Achievement","review":"After the depressing Get Back sessions, the Beatles approached George Martin and asked him to produce their swan song masterpiece album, Abbey Road. Side one ranges from the scat/rap \\"Come Together\\", held together by an hypnotic bass and drum line, and \\"Something\\", the beautiful George Harrison ballad, to \\"Oh Darling\\", with Paul singing his throat raw to capture just the right sound, and \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\", which builds to a crescendo and ends in a vortex of white noise. Then you have the second side, starting with another Harrison gem, \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", continuing with a classic Lennon composition, \\"Because\\", and the the magnificent medley, which touches on everything from bickering over money to some odd Liverpudlians (Mean Mr. Mustard, Polythene Pam). A tour de force from the best band of the sixties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still ahead of its time after 30 years.","review":"It's probably pointless to argue which album is the greatest in the history of rock and roll -- that's largely a matter of subjective opinion. But \\"Abbey Road\\" is a true masterpiece, an album on which the Beatles managed the almost-impossible feat of being both experimental and accessible. Many albums from the late 60s, even great ones, sound dated today. But after 30 years, \\"Abbey Road\\" still sounds fresh and innovative. Indeed, to my ears it's more sophisticated, more mature and more complex than almost anything on today's Top 40 radio. Although \\"Let It Be\\" was the last official Beatles release (not counting the \\"Anthology\\" CDs in the 90s), \\"Abbey Road\\" was the last one the group recorded, and it was a beautiful, dignified note upon which to end their brilliant career."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best(and last recording)by the Beatles","review":"This album belongs in every rock collection. Paul's song, You Never Give Me Your Money is excellent. John's Mean Mr. Mustard and Poly Pam and Paul again on She Came In Through The Bathroom Window.

The remastering favors the bass to the detriment of the entire experience. The original sound had a wonderful balance of bass, voice, rhythm.This mix suxI bought this to replace my lost CD, and decided to pay extra bucks and go for what these clowns consider an excellent mix.I'm going back and buying the older version.How long are these remasters going to continue being horrifically botched versions of imbalance.I'm giving 2 stars because after all, this IS the Beatles.Don't record producers know that George Martin LIVES and might still be available for consultation???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I like the beatles, but I'm not a fan of this album, their is too much hype about it.

Pepper's) is considered both as a break from the past Beatles (Yeah,Yeah,Yeah) and as the first album in what will later be termed Progressive (Prog) Rock. Prog/Art-Rock/Sympho-Rock has complex patterns borrowed from the Structure of Classical Music.Not all songs on this album are Prog. But \\"Because\\"'s ending is certainly one of them. Follow this with Moody Blues \\"Day of Future Past\\" to King Crimson to Yes to ... and you can see the progression of Progression.For the Prog enthusiast there are about 4-5 songs that can be termed Prog and like most Prog hold up well with time (Yeah, Yeah , Yeah doesn't)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entirely brilliant","review":"I love The Beatles, let's just get that straight right from the start, but...Who ever is doing all the stereo remastering is off their rocker. If you're gonna take the tracks and re-do the mixes in stereo, please, do them in stereo. Not drums over here, bass over there, lead vocal in the center, piano on the left. Geeze.

This was a great disappointment to me - I was so looking forward to hearing these songs in sonic splendour."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Beatles' Best","review":"This is one of the Beatles best Albums. Every song has depth, emotion, and simple, but still good lyrics. As their final album, the beatles definetly made a great effort with this. I only give it four stars because after the tenth track (Here Comes The Sun King) it falls a bit flat. The rest of the songs are short, more rock oriented, and unsatisfying. Other than that your money is being well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy crap how could you not like the boys?","review":"Man, I love the beatles and I say this is their best along with Sgt.

It was a compromise between the inclinations of Lennon, who wanted to make singles, and McCartney, who wanted to make a huge statement. Lennon controlled the album up to and including \\"Come Together\\", while McCartney got his wish with two medleys that make up the majority of side two of my cassette. The piece \\"Carry That Weight\\" serves to me as a reminder that even though I've chosen not to attend certain functions at my old school in order to look good for my favorite female celebrities, the memories, as well as everything I learned, will always remain in my heart. Overall, a masterful work by the originators of modern pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have, Harrison's finest moment","review":"Back to front, this is a must have. This could be George Harrison's greatest contribution, also. The songs blend into one another and seem to bring out the finest song writing which includes all four Beatles. Sinatra referred to \\"Something\\" as being the greatest love song ever written by Lennon/McCartney, when all along, it was Harrison who wrote it. Another rumor was that Harrison wrote \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" while sitting in Clapton's garden.

This album will always be a masterpeiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles' concerto","review":"The reviews here have already said much about how wonderful this album is. I just want to point out that the second side (on the original record) was a complete unit -- a densely packed, integrated, continuous musical form. I'm not aware of any group having done this. \\"Tommy\\" and other rock operas are in the same ballpark, but those have a much looser construction. The Beatles opened the door here, as they did so often in other aspects of their work, but no one else seems to have walked through it. A pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest album ever!!!!","review":"Abbey Road is the greatest rock album ever. Almost every song is a true masterpiece. Harrison shines with Something and Here Comes the Sun. Ringo dazzles with his drum solo in The End. Lennon and McCartney show their brillance with the side-two medley(which is the greatest twenty minutes of music you'll ever hear.) Never before has an album created a mood quite like Abbey Road. It envelopes you and puts you in an almost trance-like state. It rolls and grooves and then, with The End, reaches an awesome climax. Abbey Road is essential to any music lovers collection, and a must for any Beatles fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last album by The Greatest Musical Act of The Century","review":"Along with sprawling \\"White Album,\\" \\"Abbey Road\\" is the pinnacle of The Beatles' career. It is so much better than virtually anything that came before it and it is definitely greater than everything after. No single artist or band will ever replace The Beatles. They were the ultimate gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible.","review":"It's difficult to explain in words how Abbey Road affects you. This album creates feelings of uplifting joy, heart-wrenching sorrow, and of shocking power. Corny, perhaps, but it's so true. The Beatles are incredible, and this album is one of their best. Do yourself a favor and buy this; you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE GENIUS!!","review":"I would have to rank this right up there with Sgt.Pepper as their masterpiece.

Their music will live on forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crap with some gems hiding in it","review":"The A side was good to average. Come Together, Because, Octopus's Garden and I Want You are great. The End is average...the rest is crap. No decent tune...half-assed lyrics, and no inspripation. The songs(minus the afore mentioned) arent finished by anyones standards. Hell \\"Her Magesty\\" is twenty seconds lond and is basicaly Paul talking fast. The album is in desperate need of completion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abbey Road","review":"George Harrison's album...period.George's two tracks lifted an otherwise mediocre effort laden with self indulgent tracks by John (I Want You) and Paul's usual silliness (Maxwell's Silver Hammer) that dates back to the mid 60s. Here Comes the Sun and Something save the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"I guess I understand how many Beatle fans automatically rate every Beatle album 5 stars, but to the unbiased reviewers, albums like Abbey Road just don't hold up. There are so many other artists out there who have released consistently better rock music than what is contained here.My recommendation is to focus on the early Beatle albums when the group was leading the pack, not the later albums where they had fallen seriously behind the times.Checkout A Hard Day's Night, or Beatles 1962-1966."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abbey Road","review":"A nice try to capture some of the former magic, but only George gives us anything close with Something and Here Comes the Sun. Actually, \\"Let It Be\\" is the better of the final two albums, but either of the two is much more enjoyable than the White Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"way WAY too much compression","review":"I believe this \\"remaster\\" will be considered one of the great sonic blunders of the CD age. There is too much compression on this thing-- it doesn't breathe, it doesn't feel in any way like a true performance. They were tempted by the sirens of compression, and they could not resist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging","review":"Okay- do I have to rate the actual album? I mean, it's the Beatles so of course the music is wonderful. What infuriated me is the packaging. I ordered three Beatles CDs that I could have gotten anywhere for the same price, and they were to be gifts. They came in crappy cardboard packaging and look like they were pulled from a box set. They were to be gifts but they look cheesy and awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality vinyl - great album","review":"For one of the best albums the Beatles made, the vinyl was below quality of an original vinyl album. I would have preferred a better quality product and would have been happy to pay more for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete rock album","review":"From start to finish, \\"Abbey Road\\" excels as one of the most complete, best albums in rock.

Even now, you can hear \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" do-do-do, can't you?\\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" I love the song, but have no idea what it is about.\\"Golden Slumbers\\" gains its breath from old English poem, and it still enjoys the melodic charm of a simple bit of verse.I fully recommend \\"Abbey Road\\" by the Beatles.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing remastered about it","review":"I was thinking I was going to get something that was missing from the first remaster of some years ago, but what I hear is the same old sound that sounds no different from the first cd remaster of 1987 and then again in the box set from 2006.

An album that will stand the test of time. From the opening track \\"Come Together\\" to the ending track \\"Her Majesty\\" it is a masterpiece.

It is absolutely perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"the quality still shines through","review":"This is the album that really showed that these four individuals had stopped collaborating seamlessly and had become four separate creative artists, ( well, maybe that should be three although Ringo does his best on Octopus' garden).George in particular emerges as a serious writer with \\"something\\" while lennon and mccartney clearly go their separate ways at times, some of which works like \\"come together\\" and some of it doesn't quite make it, like \\"Oh Daring\\"The work is a lot rawer and uneven than the earlier albums but still shows the unique enduring quality of this band and every now and then the old formula emergesA must for any serious Beatle collection, buy it, you wont be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service!","review":"Service was fantastic.

I knew this album since my early childhood my dad had bought the cassette of it. It contained best effort of the Fab-Four's musicality and artistry, especially George Harrison's 'Something'. This is the main reason why I bought this album. This music of this album are were very advanced to its released date, and its influence is still remaining until now to the world's pop and rock music. So be it, this recording is very highly recommended to be purchased. Thanks also to amazon.com for quickly shipment to Indonesia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have","review":"This is an album that everyone MUST own. If you don't then you are missing so much. It is the great music that is almost impossible to find these days. It is the best Beatles album in mnay people's opinion. If you enjoy this album as much as I assume you will then you would also enjoy Super Deluxe's Via Satellite as well as Braden Blake's A Year In Pajamas. If you own only those 3 albums you are well on your way to a perfect music library. Purchase and Enjoy. You can't go wrong with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!!!!!","review":"This is THE BEST rock album of all time. It never falls short to please the entire way through. To quote one of my peers on here, this album seems like it had to come \\"from another planet\\". It is so tight melodically that you can hardly believe your ears. From the first bass lines of \\"Come Together\\" to McCartney's yearning, soulfull \\"Oh, Darling\\" to Harrisons \\"Something\\", and finally to the very fitting \\"The End\\" the album becomes something more than just music...it becomes an experience that everyone should know of, with a message found in every religion. \\"And in the end, The love you take is equal to the love you make\\". What you put into the world is what you will get out of it. The Beatles gave something wonderful to the world here. It is almost a sin to not have heard something so beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends On Your Perspective","review":"I guess what some people see as a \\"suite\\" (where did THAT come from) I see as a group that could write a riff but couldn't complete any verses to go with it.

Maybe Rob Thomas could help finish up these songs. 2-stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately dissatisfied","review":"As with the White Album, Abbey Road does not play with total clarity of sound as it is meant to.

It is cute to see, but not what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there anything better?","review":"Arguably, \\"Something\\" is the best Beatles song ever recorded. \\"Come Together\\" is funky John Lennon with The Beatles most toe tapping beat, very funky. \\"Her Majesty\\" is a cute little ditty, just a little something extra to add on top of perfection. \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" is a melodic wonder. \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" is a piano driven blues number. The suite of last several songs is like the second act of some masterpieceof a stage production. \\"She Came In Through The Bathroom Window\\" is just plain solid Rock 'n' Roll. This is a phenomenal album, masterpiece is a more apt word for me to use, and I find it hard for anyone to say that this is not perhaps the second most monumental album ever recorded, behind only Sgt. Peppers in over all effect and long lasting appeal. Just damn good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal Album!","review":"I bought this album as a \\"why not get it to add to my collection of my other beatles CD's\\" kinda things. I got home and started to listen to it - it completely blew me away! There is nothing like it; nothing as clever, as smart, as meaningful, or as beautiful will ever be writen. I absolutly love how the B side segue's into each other. polythene pam I want you (she's so heavy), come togethee, and The End are real rockers! Something is Georges finest peice of work.You never give me your money, and she came in through the bathroom window are great songs with catchy lyrics.

Give 'em this","review":"This is the first Beatles album I ever heard. I had been familiar with Here Comes the Sun from the dinosaur rock radio station, but I never new that there was an underlying genius under those tape racks.... At the time I didn't like Something that much--It reminded me too much of The Long and Winding Road--but now, I realize now how beautiful it is. Obviously Harrison's best, and one of the top 10 Beatles numbers, but more importantly I dont think Ive ever heard a bass guitar like that since I first heard it. I think Revolver is the Beatles best album, but Abbey Road will always be the one that made me go buy every one of thiers within 10 weeks. If you have any kids who are only beginning to understand or get into music, be sure you slip this in to their experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Masterpiece","review":"I bought this record the week it came out in 1969 and have listened to it perhaps two thousand times. It is, without a doubt, the greatest rock album ever made. There comes a point toward the end of Side Two where The Beatles' melodies, musicianship and astounding confidence intersect with their obvious awareness that Abbey Road is their swan song and combine to make the single most impressive artistic statement in rock and roll history. Not only their final words (\\"The love you make...\\") but the preceding finale is singular in its beauty. There will never be greater music than Side 2 of Abbey Road!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential Classic","review":"Every song on this album is perfect and familiar. There really isn't much else I can say about this essential classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another masterpiece.","review":"Anyone who doesnt love this album is off their rocker. Come Together and Something are brilliant songs and you can't reject Maxwell's Sivler Hammer and Oh Darling. In my opinion, the second side is not quite as good, but Here Comes The Sun is a masterpiece and I feel that You Never Give Me Your Money is one of the greatest Beatles songs of all time. The Beatles broke more ground by connecting each song into a \\"rock opera\\" kind of format, and face it, this group was infallible. Any way you wanna look at it, this album is a one of the greatest of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect everyday comfortable shoes!","review":"These are great shoes!

It was released in 2010, so the financial crisis featured in the film's coverage, along with other historical market bubbles. Numerous interview clips of some of the most prominent proponents of each side are included (Eugene Fama and Robert Shiller being two of the highest profile).Overall, the documentary leans toward favoring the behavioral argument. The film provides a lot of evidence that we humans do not act rationally, especially where money is concerned. One of the more interesting experiments shown was how bubbles are created in the lab with experiment participants trading a depreciating asset. The video, though, does a good job of including contrary arguments as well.Definitely worth viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Interesting","review":"I am taking multiple international economy classes right now and I find them interesting so I watched this documentary. i found it very interesting. I agree with its assertions for the most part. I talked with my professors about this documentary and they said the guys from Chicago are looney and are infamous for it. I can't say, but the documentary does seem to provide ample evidence of that imo. I wish some of the experiments were presented differently. I wish it was a little more in depth. But, I have been talking with my buddies about this for a couple of weeks and if I trust a documentary enough to bring it up with friends, it deserves a 4.5 star for me. (P.S. The guy who said this is like the Koch brothers is trolling.

After the first two novels being so good, I just found Brother Wind had too many minor characters now given major roles and a plot which was stretched thin. Too much time was also spent describing the actions of the villain. Surely, in a land where daily sustenance was a struggle villains would have less time to plot and plan?

He also makes fun of the revival meetings in which people go into trances and contortions after having \\"demons\\" expelled from them.

BUT....This is one of my favorite CDs ever. They play tight hardcore but with a mad, positive message: they're not rocking like juvenile frat boys (Limp Bizkit), self-parody (Kid Rock), or in seeming confusion (Rage...).

Ok, this probably isn't so bad if you're really into rap-rock. It's sort of half way between biohazard and RATM. It's definitely better than Limp Bizkit, POD, Kid Rock, or anything like that. Not as good as Rage though. It definitely has some hardcore elements, but is more polished and produced.This definitely has \\"I take myself way too seriously\\" vocals, but they somehow still sound less dumb than biohazard. Probably the biggest drawback here is that you'll only want to listen to the album 5 times or so, before you don't feel like hearing it again for another couple years.I'd rather listen to shelter's mantra.

How can such a famous group be so ill served by a record company? Beware record buyers, keep playing your old 45s or stick to the bootleg CDs of these tracks, at least some of them are taken from tapes and not from your father's old singles straight from that old box in your basement.PS: the lonely one star is for the packaging: it's the only reward the customer gets from this double disappointment"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic collection... if you don't intend to buy the new remasters.","review":"Normally I don't write these reviews, but when I saw this only had one review and that it was rated one star I had to fix that.

Despite My love for this cd, I however do not recomend this if you own or intend to buy the new remasters for the rest of Slade's albums.

The transitions are poor between travelogue and discoveries. If everything that is filler was left out there might be two chapters worth of legitimate material. For someone who wants to find out what the authors know about Butch Cassidy FOR SURE, it is a hard read.Contrary to what one review here said, the authors do make the definite assertion that Butch and Sundance died in South America, but the lack of evidence does not back this assertion.If one likes travelogues of South America with some digging around for papers and unearthing graves that produce negative results you will like this book...but you have to concentrate to dig up what is hidden in the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"While I appreciated all the work that must have gone into her travel and research, Anne Meadows is in desperate need of an editor.

We learn of the crucial players and ideas that brought America to world-class status. Unfortunately, the presentation is chaotic, and reveals few coherent themes. The level of detail is quite uneven. For instance, the author describes the emerging philosophy of conservationism in three pages, but he details the Spanish-American war down to the level of what the men ate for breakfast each morning. We learn, for no identifiable reason, of an adulterous affair of one of the siblings of President McKinnley. While nice gossip, such tangents do not contribute to the theme the author is trying to establish, which is America's transition to prominence."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the threshold of the American Century","review":"This book provides an enjoyable snapshot of America on the eve of the 20th century and unlike a lot of history books, it focuses, not on politics, but rather on social and cultural history. Consequently the reader gets interesting digressions on things like the story of L. Frank Baum, the creator of the WIZARD OF OZ, a detailed history of American department stores and the background of the World's Fair event in Nebraska. But Troxel also includes more standard fare and has a lively discussion of William Randolph Hearst, Theodore Roosevelt and the Spanish-American War. The book is pitched to the average reader and, as a professional historian, I would recommend 1898 to anyone who enjoys reading about our nation's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"JUVENILE HELL\\" IS NOT THE BEST BUT MOS DEFINATLY BANGIN.","review":"WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE SINGLE \\"SHOOK ONES PT. 2 I HAD TO GO PICK UP \\"THE INFAMOUS\\" ALBUM.

Also the tunes Two Steps Behind & Miss You In A Heartbeat solidified their ballad capabilities. With From The Inside, this is an off the wall totally different tune that I have ever heard from these guys. Basically, this album had a better feel to me and looked like they were headed in the right direction to make another Pyromania (if that is really possible). But, whatever these guys put out, one things for sure. I will be in,line to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible collection of B-sides and unreleased tracks","review":"Retroactive is a great collection of B-sides and previously unreleased tracks. Def Leppard has always held back some of their strongest tunes as B-sides. Here, these songs get their chance to shine. \\"Desert Song\\" and \\"Fractured Love\\" are two dreamlike, mystical rockers that flow together like one song. \\"Action\\" is a high-speed shot of adrenaline. \\"Ring of Fire\\", \\"She's Too Tough\\" and \\"Ride Into The Sun\\" are straight-ahead rockers. \\"From The Inside\\" is a dark, acoustic piece with powerful lyrics. And \\"Miss You In A Heartbeat\\" is a beautiful song, which sounds great in all 3 versions on this CD. The only disappointment is the electric version of \\"Two Steps Behind\\", which sounds like an intentional parody of the song. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes the music of Def Leppard, whether it be their old stuff or more recent releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended Brit Hair Metal","review":"One of the 90s British glam metal bands that cross over from the 80s!

One word for this album - AWESOME!I just recently bought all the post-Hysteria CD's so I could play catch-up with this old favorite band of mine, and this release is really a shining star. Def Leppard showed with X and Slang that they can blaze forward with the changing trends, but Retroactive is more of a return to their pre-Pyromania sound - but BETTER! The very first track alone - Desert Song - makes the purchase worth it, and there are numerous tracks in addition to that that just blow me away: Ring of Fire, I Wanna Be Your Hero, and the acoustic and electric versions of Two Steps Behind and I Miss You in a Heartbeat.HIGHLY recommended.

The premise is a fascinating one, one which I think I'd better keep to myself rather than spoil the flowering of the idea as you read the story. The frame leaps from century to century which can get fairly confusing at times, but it of course all makes sense in the end. I love the way Zelazny doesn't *quite* tell you everything you need (or rather, want) to know right off the bat, but lets you put it all together near the end. This one took me longer than most of his books to finish, but I thoroughly enjoyed it; Zelazny is like a dense baklava compared to most fantasy-writer's yellow cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"After considerations- a good one.","review":"The book is about a french knight who is reborn over and over again and an arabian immortal sorcerer thet opposes him.

While treading onto controversial ground with some of his claims (especially those regarding Paul), he eloquently encourages the student of history to think in a different mindset.

It is not even good fiction. There is no pretense of any scientific research or reliance on 'hard fact'. The author simply weaves a story from imagined facts and childlike observations. These banalities are stated forcefully, though, as 'facts'. As you might imagine, some of it resonates with lonely persons who may have self-esteem issues and need some fantasy of this sort to identify with. Many parts of it are ludricous to an uncommon degree. Imagine your own school-aged child writing any chapter and if you would not be moved to at least consider counseling, your child is in some peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"blech :(","review":"not a good soundtrack at all.

And if you've heard those sick puppies, you can still only begin to understand what a insane album this is. In a dark mixture of grindcore, avant-garde and math metal, Orthrelm have thrown away any pre-concieved convention of making music and have instead created something quite bizarre. Devoid of any melody or structure, the music is guitar and drums only, the guitars being a mish-mash of atonal shredding and the drums being pure chaos with the occasional blastbeat. I'm not going to say that this is the greatest music on the planet. I'm not going to say that this is an album everyone should hear. All I'm going to say is that if you want pure chaos, this album is what you're looking for.

Brother Hagin is so gifted at communicating complex concepts in a straight forward way. This book gave me further knowledge, wisdom and understanding of my identity through Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plaguerism at its worst","review":"Kenneth Hagin says its a problem that weve preached a cross religion and not a throne religion. He goes so far as to call the cross a place of defeat. How far this is from Jesus' teachings, unless we take up our cross and follw Him we are not worthy of Him, thats all Jesus preached was the cross, it was central to his teachings and His life, as well as the apostle Paul. Its already a proven fact anyway that Kenneth Hagin plaguerized this entire book from The Authority of the Believer by John A. MacMillan. One need only read both books and realize he changed little else but the title. The places in the book where the plageurism is not word for word its thought for thought. The only thing thats original about his version are his made up dreams and visitations he claims to have had from his gnostic Jesus. I wish I had more hands, Id give this book 4 thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wonder How Much Of This Is Original?","review":"Before I am attacked by other reviewers, it is worth noting that I have an uncle who is on staff at Hagin's church.This book is typical Word of Faith theology, nothing more. The real problem, however, it is that it is STOLEN from its rightful author, a Christian Missionary Alliance minister named John MacMillan. This was exposed in 1983 by Oral Roberts student, Dale Simmons. Hagin then republished the book with its current title and paid \\"lip service\\" to MacMillan in the preface.I can't help but wonder how many conversations with God that Mr. Hagin has made up.

God gave us authority in the earth, because what Jesus did at Calvary-and after, won the keys of death and hell back.

His proof of this is that he asks some unqualified and unknown friends to give their opinions in little interviews.

The author has the strangest attitude considering he has no credentials and worse - he has NO facts to backup his claim about the death of Java. i.e. If you drop in on surveys such as tiobe.com it seems that Java and C and C++ are actually the top languages currently.This is a book written by script kiddies to promote scripting and unstable programming platforms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to O'Reilly standards","review":"Bruce Tate's Beyond Java is not up to O'Reilly standards. It's poorly organized, repetitive, and error-ridden. As of the present writing (Jan. 2, 2006), the online example code promised in the front of the book is not available on the O'Reilly web site. A long list of errata is available there, however, but it's incomplete.Expect much frustration in trying to type in the main Ruby on Rails example and getting it to run successfully. And expect much hair-tearing at all the repetition and the author's attempt to be artsy by beginning each chapter by comparing white-water kayaking to the perils of picking a new programming language.This would have made a good book or special journal issue at one-quarter it's present size, with better editing, and with better testing of the example code -- and deep-sixing the tedious kayak stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on how to get started with Asterisk","review":"This book was get help to get me started with Asterisk.

I keep coming back to it and finding things to try and use. There is a lot of really good content and the Author does a good job of citing his sources too.This book could do more for introducing the beginner to Asterisk - the concept of extensions in the dial plan is key to understanding Asterisk and it is a strange paradigm until you understand it. I wish this book had introduced it a little better.Additionally, more dial plan and configuration file examples would have been a very helpful resource.This book has been invaluable to me starting out with Asterisk. I would welcome updates and revisions as Asterisk expands."},{"rating":"2","title":"No one book can cover the entirety of Asterisk","review":"VoIP Telephony with Asterisk is apparently aimed at newcomers to Asterisk who value their time and want to avoid weeks of wading through the mass of disorganized material available on the web. It provides a grounding in telephony concepts that were new to me, coming as I did at Asterisk from the Linux world, and enough information on PBX configuration so that I was able to assemble a two line, three extension system of my own with goodies likevoicemail in a couple of days.No one book can cover the entirety of Asterisk, and I don't think three books would be enough. Cisco needs a lot more than that for its less functional PBX offering. I'd have like more examples in this one, but it was well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Editing","review":"This book contains little that is not already on the Asterisk Wiki and that which it does contain is poorly edited (many, many typos), badly spelled and expressed in sometimes eccentric grammar. Here's one example (page 175): \\"....try recording 8 Khz, 16 bit wav files which will are likely to work better than 8 bit files\\". Apart from two misprints in kHz (k for kilo is lower-case, Hertz is the name of a scientist and units named after people are capitalised), what happened to the proof-reading of the rest of the sentence? This is one of very many such examples.A good book on this subject is sorely needed but this is not it.The descriptions of SIP, H323, etc give the (surely unfounded) feeling that the author has skimmed the RFCs, gained a superficial knowledge and dumped some keywords into the book. Large portions of the book are simply listings of the various configuration files which are better described on the Asterisk Wiki."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this","review":"This has to be one of the best things developed for console gaming.

I am sure people will pay high amount of money just to pay for high speed net connection to use xbox live. Then only to find out that their desire of high speed net connection isn't compatibale with xbox live. Then comes this whole mess of xbox promising no lag and etc cause they don't have modem adapter for people to use. I don't care if playstation 2 network adapter was broadband only as well xbox live will have lags. Why? because no matter the connection if the server is laggin the gamers themselves will feel it.

It was easy to see the woman's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played.I didn't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven. I also found myself not caring about any of the characters. So-and-so gets shot, la la loo goes to jail. Whatever!As an aside, though, the evil neighborhood druglord was called Ernesto.

I use a utility knife constantly at work and have for years. I also use them a lot at home. I've used most types of utility knives and owned lots.This knife was based on a great idea. The blade comes out quickly and easily, and retracts automatically. Unfortunately, it suffers from a fatal, but common flaw, namely cheap construction. It's made primarily of plastic with a bit of aluminum and steel worked in. The plastic is durable enough, but the steel catch for the door where spare blades are stored in the handle is flimsy. In regular use, the catch sometimes opens when you don't want it to. This jams up the knife, so that it won't open or close. It's easy to un-jam it, but it will happen again.Bottom line: There are better utility knives for less money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought to my wife","review":"She, my mom and my sisters love it.

Yes, you can move things around in the kitchen, pour milk in a glass but what fun is that?? And Mickey & Minnie won't come and eat (only if you make a cake or breakfast they show anything else you cook just sit on the table) my son got really upset when he set the table, bake a chicken and Mickey & minnie didin't show. Plus after you pour milk in a glass, pop some pop corn there nothing left to do, my son played the game for maybe 10 minutes and did everything and now he doesn't care to play it anymore.

Just that it got away from the semi-gloomy theme of the first matrix and that turned me off a bit.Nice allusion to some human fantasy characters and their purpose for existence in the 'matrix-world'. Which is anachronistic being the the machines took over in the 21st century.Put a dent in my expectations of Neo's possible rising omnipotence and his place as the singular 'hero' figure.Gave Morpheus and Trinity a good test run of their skills against the agents.In itself a great movie, not as good IMHO as the original but a great movie for Matrix fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing but still worth watching","review":"\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\", the 2nd movie in the trilogy: I was disappointed and confused but I still think it's worth watching just for the action and special effects.

I would not have bought the DVDs: \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" or \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" if I had watched them BEFORE I bought them - (I wish I had just rented them instead).

So much for quality control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Great Sequel","review":"People, I am convinced, are idiots. Anybody who saw the first film should know that it is not merely a dumb action movie. It has a lot of themes and important dialogue that delve deep into the universe created by the Wachowski bros. What I am saying is that anybody who gives this movie a bad review because they can't understand it and don't have the time to, really needs to find something more suited to their brains... Watch Teletubbies or something.Otherwise, this is a good film that continues the story of the Matrix. This is not as good as the first film, only because it is not nearly as innovative. People are dissapointed because of this. Does that make ANY sense?

Let's be honest here, people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie blows","review":"Liked the original, both story and effects. The effects have been copied since by many movies and were good in this one.

It got worse!","review":"The Matrix is already a very simple movie, built on an interesting idea, which is the question of perception x reality. The rest of it is pretty bad: machines dominating the world, a messianic approach to freedom; \\"the one\\", all these platitudes ruin the idea and the rythm of the movie, which was good untill neo wakes up. Anyway, the Matrix Reloaded goes beyond the platitudes and enters the dangerous ground of confusion. The story spirals and gets quite complicated. You don't understand who is who anymore and all of it comes, from time to time, wrapped in some sort of philosophical weird meditation.Anyway: nobody explains why all these guys dress in rags, and why, if there is an Oracle, there is no Microsoft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, too many unnecessary complaints","review":"First off, the movie was great. Second of all, I personally think a lot of people were disappointed with the movie because they already saw what was coming from the early trailers. Sure trailers give pretty many of the key scenes away, but come on. If you wanted to be surprised or taken off guard, couldn't you have waited a few more months. Third, what's with all these customer complaints? If you didn't like the movie then simply don't watch it again. Is it that hard to figure out? Don't go rent it, and most certainly don't buy it if you were disappointed. I personally can't wait for this DVD to come out October 14. Plus it's a 2 disc set. And from what I've seen from the Revolutions trailer after the Reloaded credits, I think Revolutions will be a fantastic ending.

It might be good if I had never seen the first one, but this was just a bad movie. I just don't get how it sucked so much. It wasn't even worth watching. This movie was overrated. Same with the videogame \\"Enter the Matrix\\". Enter the Matrix exits the Matrix and Reloaded is unloaded. Both were horrible. I'm anxiously awaiting the third one hoping it will make this one better, but I kind of doubt it. I think it was the abrupt ending that ruined it most.

I thought the keymaker was a weak character. I did not like the way Trinity was made to seem weak when in the first Matrix she was a really strong character.

Unfortunately, it seems like the whole Lord of the Rings or Star Wars all over again. The first one(s), outstanding, the sequel financially successful on hype or anticipation alone, but falling flat as a story.

I didn't expect to like the original but I really did. I did expect to like this sequel and I really didn't. Matrix had a message. It was inventive and captured the imagination.

To everyone who has written a bad thing about the movie saying it is predictable and should not have been concluded.....it is just a movie....and better the Lord of the Rings.

The highway seen was great and by the way Neo showed the \\"superman\\" characteristics at the end of the first movie, which the most people loved.

First of all almost all of the dialog in it was pointless rambling, which had nothing to do with anything. the relationship between Neo (who now is seemingly \\"superman\\") and Trinity (the ugly man-woman) is extremely corny. The world of men- Zion, which I had pictured in my mind to be a sophisticated and futuristic haven, turned out to be nothing more then a hole in the ground filled dancing cavemen, it was horrible. It's was not at all like the original Matrix, which broke boundaries of what is real and what is not. the whole point of this movie, the only goal was to get through a stupid door."},{"rating":"1","title":"sunglasses anyone?","review":"What is with all the sunglasses?

This kind of movie (like the most recent so called blockbuster movies including Star War movies) the special effects or CGI generated effects are the real stars. I just wonder why the movie stars keep getting bigger and bigger paychecks when the special effects do all the work for them?

The storyline is so pathetic it made me want to fly down to hollywood and smack the wasowski brothers. And the Agent Smith fight scene everyone was so excited about? It went on about ten minutes to long! This has got to be one of the worst sci-fi movies I've ever seen.

Its groundbreaking special effects were awesome and proved that there is no way you can do thoes (ahem) moves.then this sequel totally sucked. first of all, he just does a couple of favours thd that's about it. First ,when he fights the upgrades it lookes like he's doing yoga in the air. Now he stops bullets with his hands, flies in the air all day and yet even worse,makes cars fly around.When he picks up the pole (or wahtever it is) and and spin around it looks like he's a hamster in a little excersise ball.And in the end, Trinity's death scene is pathetic. plus, what the (...) was with the 30 minute car chase?!Totally bad.

First of all the movie fails in poorly directed fight scenes and in a complicated plot or poorly done script, In fact i was finding the movie boring to watch except the big chase scene which was probably the most exciting part of the movie, besides this the movie is just a filler between the first and third movies.And its sad but true if the movie did not have special effects i'd give it 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto","review":"Ditto comments.

All these people saying they didn't like the movie are obviously watching it for the wrong reasons. The Matrix is not just an action movie to get cheap thrills out of, its much more than that. The Matrix is about opening your mind to the possiblities that may be. I can't wait for the DVD to come out, I'm sure its going to have some amazing extras for us interested in watching a movie that has a meaning. Let's just hope all the people who said bad stuff about the Matrix are watching it to be enlightened, not just to see things blow up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dam this film rules","review":"I absolutly love this film. Everything is masterfully excuted from the fight scenes to the plot to the freeway scene(which is utterly mental). The freeway scene surpasses every other car chase past and furture.

I will be buying this the second it is released and seeing revelutions the second that is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Sequel","review":"Most people that have reviewed this film so far make valid comments on what there is \\"not to like\\" about this latest installment of the Matrix trilogy. Going into this film I was expecting a whole lot and the film delivered...mostly. This is a more action oriented film that may confuse people for a little while (questions will be answered soon, so hold on 'till November). While the fight sequences take center stage and impressive set pieces dominate the landscape. I agree that somethings are silly and stupid (already mentioned by others) but there is a lot to like. \\"Reloaded\\" had some big shoes to fill since part 1 had a crazy huge and unexpected plot turn in the first half. So far the Wachowski's have made an intriguing two films with the third looking to tidy up all the loose ends.

To me it was the best movie of the summer. It might have left the audience wanting more or asking questions but that's what it was supposed to do. The actions scenes were absolutely fantastic although the fight scene with Agent Smith did continue for just a tad too long. However with that said I came away awe-struck. The chase scene had my heart pounding every step of the way. I love action movies and this far surpassed my expectations unlike Tomb Raider 2 which was a waste of an afternoon. I can't wait for the finale..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matrix-Beyond","review":"This movie is not given the credit it deserves. Yes maybe there are problems with the plotlines and some of the character development isn't that good, but overall I think this movie is an amazing visual experience. I think the Wachowski Brothers propelled action and visual effects to a new level. The directors were not afraid to push boundaries even if it alienated audiences, which is something I respect. I also loved the symbolic references to comicbooks and anime. Even if people were not happy with the movie they should still respect the amount of work that went into it, because all of the action scenes and visual effects put into the movie required alot of elaborate and technical work to pull off."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you naysayers.....","review":"First off, let's get this out of the way: The Matrix Reloaded is only half of one HUGE movie. Keep that in mind when you watch it, because it doesn't end...it just stops. As for people saying that the story is pure gibberish, you might want to watch this movie a few more times...it is truly an incredible script (of the first half of a movie). It makes many many multiple connections with itself and the first movie, that ultimately weave an intricate web of storytelling.

The fight and chase scenes were excessive and got boring after a while (the highway chase might be an exception). Orpheus'--er, I mean Morpheus'--\\"prophesizing\\" was dull. I skipped over the Zion Orgy/Keanu's Butt scene--ick. The plot (as other reviewers have mentioned) was nonexistent.

If only there had been maybe 20 more Mr Smiths.... it would have been blatantly farcical. I'd compare having to sit through this movie to having to sit through Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, but this experience might have been worse.

Producers and director tried to fill in this void by exposing the audience to never-ending shots of overwhelming special FX. The result is a dull movie that has no traces of the creativity displayed on the original Matrix where plot and visual FX were wisely combined. This time characters are flat and unbelieveble so we don't care for what happens to them.Let's hope that Matrix Revolutions will leave a better taste in our mouths.Don't waste your money in this DVD, buy a \\"real movie\\" instead for this is nothing but a 2-hour long trailer for the videogame (which by the way I'm sure will be much more interesting)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not more than 2","review":"I loved the first 1, but this 1?

Are you serious? Were you people drugged when you watched these movies, or are you just incrediabily simple? If you like flashy lights and no sense then I could see how you would like this movie, but if you have half a brain you would realize that this movie blows. It's just as bad as Revolutions, which made the undertones of Neo being Jesus so blanted that they were basically overtones. Anyway, this movie has nothing on the original Star Wars triliogy and it really isn't better than any of the new crappy Star Wars either.

Blah! Blah!","review":"Have the standards of Hollywood filmmaking dropped so far as to allow a movie this poorly made to crack the $100 million mark? Apparently. There is entirely too much dialogue in this installment, and most of the visual effects \\"look\\" computer generated. What was so fresh in the first film comes across stagnant here. There are a few CGI moments of note, but most look like I'm watching some kid playing a video game. The acting is sub-par as well. Compared to \\"The Matrix,\\" \\"The Matrix:Reloaded\\" simply reeks. The ending is like a cheesy Sci-fi original movie teaser to try and get the viewers to return for the finale. I, for one, will not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Disappointing","review":"I am a huge fan, I saw the Matrix 3 times in the movies and bought the DVD the day it came out. I have been waiting 3 years for the sequel as many of you have. Here is the sad fact: If this was the first movie, there would be no sequel. The only reason for this movie is so that the studio can make this a Trilogy (so we can buy a boxed set), it is a franchise just like a Disney movie, complete with action figures and video games. I hope part 3 ties this all together but my expectations are low. I think the W brothers are great but this movie was 2.5 hours without any memorable dialogue and ridiculous psychobabble as the script. This is not a \\"well its just not as good as the original\\", this is a matter of; it is simply not that good a movie, great action, great cinematography but bad dialogue and plot, that we hope ties together in part 3. Yes it made $280 million dollars, I wish I could much better things about it but I am highly dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"138 minutes of cat and mouse chases","review":"The Matrix Reloaded was 138 minutes of pure senseless, noisy cat and mouse chases. The fight scenes and the freeway car chase was too long. The slow methodical way the characters talked was boring and nerve wrecking. What was the point of everybody wearing sunglasses? The movie's action scenes were just too fantastic to believe i.e flying through the air on motorcycles, fighting over a 100 men at a time etc... Maybe I am just not a sci-fi fan. The only good thing about the movie to me was looking at Keanu Reeves."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the most thrilling movie I have seen since Star Wars","review":"the Matrix Reloaded is more than 2 howers of trick photography and live action! The story it's self is not as strong as Matrix 1, but all the action makes up for that. The ending is kind of a puzzle, I hope it is explained better in the next movie.One of my favorite events in the movie takes place on a crowded Sanfrancisco freeway when Trinity, amd Morphius are trying to rescue The Keymaker and escape agents. You have agents jumping from car to car, Trinity hijacks a motorcycle from a movimg 18 weeler and pilots it through the crowded fast moving trafic!Morphius fights an agent ontop of a moving 18 weeler!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring and Bold, Flawed but Fun","review":"\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" tries to be a lot of things. It tries to be more visually mind-blowing than \\"The Matrix\\". It also tries to ask more philosophical questions, show more of humanity in the world of the machines, and to introduce us to numerous entities in the real world and the Matrix. In some ways, the film succeeds (the highway chase is an amazing set piece!) and in others it fails (the \\"Burly Brawl\\" ends up looking unreal because they went farther than the effects were really capable of).Many people have dissected the plot, the effects, etc. What it boils down to is this: \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" is a kick-arse sci-fi kung-fu flick with gobs of philosophy. If you're expecting anything more than that, you've got the wrong DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basicly garbage","review":"Let's face it, people. The Matrix Reloaded sucked. What was it besides a bunch of good special effects? The confusing plot made it seem deep and thoughtful, but when you really get down to it, it was just ridiculous. (You'll notice that most people who review this and think it was good can't spell and have no reason that it's good except \\"The special effects were good!\\")The Matrix Reloaded was just one big trailer for Matrix Conclusions. All it did was add onto the first and make people more confused. \\"To be concluded\\"??? Why not just conclude it right now? We all know what's going to happen. It's so predictable. Save yourself the trouble and just skip to the third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, but needs more bonus material","review":"While this movie is hit and miss for many people, I did enjoy it more once I saw it a second time and was told to pay attention to particular scenes. Where this movie falls short is it's subtle dialogue and million-dollar words, that go over the heads of most people. How many times did you need to rewind to just understand the Architect?Anyhow, this movie is very good upon second viewings. Where I am dissapointed is it's lack of bonus material. DVD is supposed to be about the supliments, yet this set falls short. I really wonder why it was 2 discs when only one was needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sequel to the original","review":"I stopped this download rental and deleted it after about 35 minutes.

No story line, pointless sex scenes. It's like they all of a sudden realized they didn't have any sex in the first one and decided to make up for it in the second! Stupid! The fight scenes were terrible. It was nothing compared to the first one. Plus it kept freezing over and over again. We haven't finished it. I'm not sure we will. Netflix is better than Amazon in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of extras baffling","review":"Considering that \\"The Matrix\\" was and still is the gold-standard of DVD features (multiple audio tracks, commentary, several documentaries and featurettes, alternate viewing options ('follow the white rabbit'), cast and crew bio information, and MORE all on a single disc!), the absence of any such features on the 'Reloaded' DVD is disheartening. I can only speculate that Warner Bros. Home Video is planning another 'Matrix Revisited'-type DVD to sell separately and make more money off of. 'The Matrix Reloaded' itself is a rare work of art. The DVD edition is about as pathetic as a Paramount DVD release. It is the quintesential waste of the DVD format, offering little over a VHS tape edition or a bootleg. Rent it or watch it off cable. Don't buy this version.

By the time you understood the story, the movie was over.By the second movie, THE MATRIX RELOADED, the filmmakers got caught up in their own pretentious premise. The dialogue just plays flat and weird. Keanu Reeves looks either deep or...blank. Couldn't tell which most of the time. The truly-odd \\"Rave Scene\\" was so primitive and even bestial that I wondered why humans needed to survive at all. Maybe the machines were on to something to exterminate such rampant barbarism and partying.The action scenes were very cool and the special effects extremely interesting.

It's incredibly deep and although most won't admit it, they had no idea what was actually going on. If you don't understand some of the philosophies behind it, and complex ideas such as Predesination, you're simply watching an empty futuristic action thriller. But the deep philosophy behind it, is what makes it great. The reason that many were dissapointed is that the movie was hyped to be the \\"Best Action Movie Ever\\", and it delivered, but not as much as it did intellectually. It's also just the 1st half of what should be one movie, so you're sort of left in the dark. Now, the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is for the absolutely tasteless scene in Zion with Neo and Trinity. I was with some friends, and it was one of those moments that makes you embarrassed to watch. Completely unnecessary.

Looking at the trailers, we thought it might be very good but instead it wasn't. I noticed that there is too much dialogue, worth of trash. Just too much dialogue, too long dialogue, too boring dialogue, there's more dialogue then action sequences and it's boring. Reloaded isn't as good as it looks.

Watch for Revolutions which looks pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of a budget","review":"When I first watched this movie after it came out, I was awe struck by the special effects. This movie has some of the best special effects ever created in a movie. The fight scenes were truely extroardinary, though the highway scene was over rated. When the fighting wasn't going on the story sequences left me wandering what they were even talking about. Just about everything in the movie besides the fight scenes is complete gibberish with no point in the movie. The whole dance rave, dirty scene, all the way through the meeting with the Architect, it's all a bunch of gibberish.I left the theatre feeling confused because nothing was really solved or explained worth a flip. The biggest mistake in the movie is that it feels like it was based around fight scenes, instead of story. It should have been the other way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly disappointing DVD features","review":"Unlike most people, I actually liked the movie. The low rating is for the pathetic \\"features\\" on the DVD.

The few extras are utterly sucktacular puff-pieces. They consist of endless gushing about how cool and exciting the movie and everyone involved in it are. Oh yeah, and LOTS of thinly-veiled attempts to get viewers to buy all the ancillary merchandise.The ONLY reason I bought this instead of renting it was that I assumed it would have lots of features which I would want to spend a long time perusing. Stupid me. Even if you DID sit through this crapulous pile of advertainment, it would only amount to an hour or two.If you'll be watching the movie enough times to make it cost-effective to buy instead of rent, then by all means do.

The CGI looked like something you'd expect to see in Gumby, the fights looked like something out of 'Darrin's Dance Grooves', and the plot was stupid at best. I expect that the only people who 'enjoyed' this movie were the die-hard Matrix fans who would give it 5 stars even if it was B&W with Arabic audio and Greek subtitles.

And I've gotten used to all the exposition scenes. But the Zion party scene where Neo and Trinity go off and do the wild thing for 5 whole minutes of screen time just stopped the movie for a bit. It was totally unnecessary. It served no purpose whatsoever.But it picks back up later on with a great fight scene between Neo and a hundred Agent Smiths. This scene was great.

Sure there are some scenes which drag a little bit, but ask yourselves the question: why have the directors left this bit in & this long: what exactly are they trying to convey to me, beyond the obvious. Overall, just sit back and enjoy the ride. After all, you're living in a Matrix right now. What is real and what is not?

The characters are more interested in hearing themselves talk than taking action - Morpheus becomes a bore, and Neo becomes Steve Reeves as Superman - only the music is different.You'll want to see this because the first movie was truly an act of genius, but the directors cut of this movie should be about 35 minutes long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reloaded Succeds.","review":"Despite all the negative reviews I think the movie was quite amazing.

The love scenes between Neo and his girlfriend was cheesy. Once they played up the romance angle it degraded the quality of the movie.So now Neo is a superhero. What's so great about that? How boring!'The Matrix' was definitely original in its concept and special effects. It played a big part in its popularity at the time. There was nothing original about 'Matrix Reloaded'. It was just more of the same and the scenes were too long.

Do not enter the Matrix","review":"This movie is a perfect example of the product of the greed of movie producers.

I consider the first movie to be the best action/sci-fi movie ever, but wouldn't even think of buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matrix reloaded: much better than the original","review":"I think is amazing how this movie managed to survive the hype created by the first movie (The Matrix). It has some weak points, but i think it is much bigger and better than the first one in terms of action and plot.The producers really took care of the technical details, like how Trinity uses a well known SSH1 bug to enter in a computer system.In short, enjoy the movie and judge yourself if is good or not (ignore the geek trolls than seek religion on a action movie :))."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST WHAT IS IT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT ????","review":"It is hard to like a movie in which the characters go on and on with incomprehensible (I hope that's how you spell it) dialogue.

It's hard to like to a movie in which the hero suddenly discovers he can (inexplicably) fly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the Matrix?","review":"Okay, so this movie answers some questions that were not answered in the first one, but that is all. That is the only reason this movie is watched. It is completely abysmal, totally unnecessary and the special effects cold have been ten times better. Too much of Neo's \\"Superman Thing\\" with a digital Neo rather than the actor, and too much...amend that - a waste of time with the whole Zion thing. I hope that the next matrix is a lot better, but from what I have seen here, I seriously doubt it.

Another problem is Reloaded attempts to seem profound with nonsense dialogue:\\"Why are you fighting the machines?\\"\\"Because I choose to.\\"(Deep silence.)So many unanswered questions: Why did people within the Matrix look exactly like themselves outside of it when they never saw themselves to begin with?Why didn't Smith download himself a million times into human hosts like the first guy and rage on?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Visualy stuning, but what the hell is going on here?","review":"I loved the first flim.

This movie is best played with the volume turned off. Decent action segments here and there make it watchable but any and all dialogue should just be ignored...it makes little if any sense. This series really lost direction and seemed to become aimless, which is unfortunate because it seemed this could be a trilogy that could have stood alongside series like Star Wars and Indiana Jones, but instead the second two need to be written off to still enjoy the original.

There is this one scene when Neo is fighting about 50 agents at a time, SOUNDS COOL, RIGHT! WRONG! For one thing, when Neo gets that pipe (or whatever it is) he jumps in the air and does this stupid twisting motion while in the typical Matrix slo-mo. It looks so stupid.Now, the sound. The sound is okay, but that one scene when Neo is fighting the Agents (as mentioned above) Neo pushes them on top of each other, but it creates a bowling sound. It sounds exactly like a ball coliding with bowling pins. Who could say laziness?You know what, there are so many bad things in the matrix reloaded that I can not put it in words.

The original Matrix is phenomenal. It has plot, substance, action, romance; something for everyone.I went into the theatre hoping for the same from the new Matrix film. I have never been so disappointed in a movie. I was actually sad. Instead of vital characters, we get the albino twins, Jada Pinkett Smith, and that Italian woman. None really have any purpose. The plot? Try to save the city from the machines.The action is too much, too often. One of the best things about the original is that it knew when to quit. The worst and most useless scene is when alternating shots of Neo and Trinity having sex and half-naked writhing dancers are shown. Pointless. Tasteless. Useless. The only decent scene is with the architect.If you are willing to forgoe the plot, intelligence, and quality of the original, then this movie is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure why soo many hated it","review":"I'll admit that my expectations were extremely high and I was let down just a little, but I thought this movie was very good. I like The Matrix a little better but I thought Reloaded had enough drama and action to appeal to all Matrix fans. On the eve of their fight with the sentinels, the people of Zion celebrate the only thing they have left, their humanity. To keep their humanity, Neo, Trinity and Morpheus must somehow defeat the controller of the matrix. The movie ends with a cliff-hanger that had everyone wondering what's going to happen next.

The special effects in this movie are mind boggling, but after watching the movie a second or third time it is excruciatingly boring. The story, which spins a complicated, moronic web of choppy, incoherent dialogue, absolutely SUCKS and pales in comparison to that of the original Matrix movie. To top it all off, Keanu Reeves, who was tolerable in the original film, really shows his talent for crappy acting.

The Matrix DVD at the time set the standard for DVDs in the way of extras and quality. A real 5 star release. The DVD had a nice set of extras such as a feature on bullet time and a good commentary track. Sadly Reloaded is a huge step backwards from that wonderful first film's DVD.The extras on Reloaded are minimal to say the least. There is no commentary track at all. I've heard that there will be a boxed set deluxe edition somewhere down the line for all 3 Matrix films and that is why there is almost nothing on this release. If that is the case then shame on the makers of this film for putting nothing on this disc simply to try and force us to buy all 3 films on DVD a second time. Yeah, LOTR did it as well to some extent but at least folks who bought the first release of those got some good extras included on the first release."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would rather...","review":"... have my eyes explode in a horrifying halo of blood than subject them to the utter travesty that is \\"Matrix: Reloaded\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complex Mix","review":"Overall, I really enjoyed The Matrix: Reloaded. It felt like watching a movie version of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. While the movie itself failed to live up to expectations in some places (the tribal dance scene and Keanu's \\"I just love you too damn much,\\" are good examples), the complex mix of cultures and mythology comes off pretty well.I don't think that it is as obvious to most movie watchers, though. Most of the people I went with left confused and/or disappointed. Only in talking about the movie in context to the greater body of art out there did they begin to find it enjoyable. It's definitely a different kind of movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie, but not as good as the first Matrix","review":"I agree with many people that this movie was not as good as the first film.

However, if you are among the elite who knows whats going on, this is a must have. Granted the Wachowski's went a little bit heavy on the german philosophy, however, the movie had a mind blowing last 1/3 of the film. The fight scenes were incredibly tight, even with some of the noticable cgi charachters that appear from time to time (especially when neo fights the 100+ agent smiths.) It also has a cliff hanger ending that rivals that of The Empire Strikes Back, or any episode of 24 if thats your cup of tea.

I like the story line and yes there were some holes but it is still a movie. The Matrix series is one of those movies where it's basis was more about life and reality as we know (or maybe don't know it)but they used the ides of computers and technology to explain it. Hence the coming of the chosen one to save the human race, the architect, and this reality not being our real home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zion rave scene -- why it was there","review":"Given the philosophical bent of the Matrix movies, the whole point of the zion rave scene (and interlaced the Neo/Trinity scene) was to highlight what makes humans different from machines. What we were seeing is everything that machines are incapable of doing: reproduction, passion, losing control, pure enjoyment.You can see more exploration of the human-machine dichotomy when Neo and the Councillor go down the depths of zion and discuss the humans-need-machines and machines-need-humans relationship. The main difference is that during that sequence, the point is spelled out for the slow viewers, whereas the point of the rave/sex scenes is more emotional (which again, is the point)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven Forbid A Movie That Makes You Think!","review":"Look Out! Be Afraid! Run For It! Its a movie that actually has a plot involving personal reflection. The entire point of this trilogy is to show the struggle between the choices we make every day of our lives and the consequences. Its not another mindless action flick with subpar acting and a plot so full of meaningless holes. The holes left within the Matrix \\"Reloaded\\" are called plotlines and red herrings. It is a movie designed for two things:1 - To awe you with its amazing special effects2 - To Make you think, make you question the motives of the movie and the motives of yourselves.Its true that some scenes were done with the specific reference to kill time.

The first matrix was a fun, extremely cool-looking sci-fi film. This movie is a bloated mess that spends half of its time pretending it's the work of some brilliant philosopher and trying to be cool. I'm sorry, but I am sick of Neo, Morpheus and Trinity walking in formation, wearing sunglasses, making jerky head movements and looking pissed off. This movie was awful - Morpheus' address to the croud was predictable, lame, and somehow the catalyst for a twenty minute \\"Club Zion\\" dance scene which was crap in every sense of the word. All the business with the \\"architect\\" was perfectly satirized by Will Ferrrel on some awards show - he just kept yelling \\"vis-a-vis\\" and \\"ergo\\" over and over again.

It had a beginning, middle, and end, and spent most of that time kicking you in the head courtesy of wild beat-downs and gun fu. And although it had its logical flaws (entropy, anyone?) it was a clever premise well executed.It is sadly apparent that The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revollutions did not \\"need\\" to be made, except insofar as folks wanted to make it a franchise to print more money. Reloaded is an aimless, sterilized mess of a movie, with unexpectedly *bad* CGI in places and none of the raw punch of The Matrix. It takes too long to go nowhere, and is only saved by its hinting at Something Really Cool to come later. Unfortunately, the possibilities it hints at never come to pass... Revolutions winds up so straightforwardly dumb that even the watered-down Reloaded only sets you up for a letdown at the end of this exercise in cashing in impersonating a \\"deep\\" Sci-Fi experience.

The second one was almost no better then the first one. One would have to watch it at LEAST 2 times before one get's the story. It had A LOT of talking and not enough action The only three scenes I thought was good enough to mention was the fight against 100 agents and the motorcycle sceen and the last battle other then that the whole movie was on mush(love), dreams, and more TALKING. Overall it was a an okay move.

There are a lot of interesting scenes, but Neo aka up up and away, just brought a giggle out in me. The LONG action sequences make you want to go okay, enough! Less is More is NOT the banner of this movie! After Neo b**** slap's Elrond and his brother Elrond and his other brother Elrond 100 times it just redefines redundant. Then Neo reaching in to pull out the magic bullet...oh, please...sigh...and the religious overtones are so pretensious.It was good to see Anthony Zerbe a long under rated talent get a nice spot.

Oh well, there is also Smith, the agent that Neo destroyed in the first Matrix. Now, not only does Smith manage to come back to life, but he clones itself a thousand times by sticking his hand into people--I kid you not.What else?

The philosophies, that some claim make this movie incredible, are the most useless, and cryptic ideas ever....the whole point of this movie is to trick you into believing you have seen some miracle of modern cinema but really it is nothing more than a pseudo-intelletual attempt science-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most confusing of the trilogy","review":"There are two things I must point out before my review:one,don't expect this film to explain the events in the first film because this films starts off right into the action and two:pay attention to the dialogue. You will be lost in this film if you don't.Now on to the film:this film was good but,in my opinion,it just is not as good as the first or third films and is a tad too confusing. Still,it features some incredible visual effects and some amazing action scenes(the Burly Bawl is one such scene).I recommend it,but only if you liked the first one.Great film overall!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange things are afoot in the review section....","review":"For those of you who hated this movie because you thought it confusing or devoid of plot, let me state something that is painfully, painfully obvious. The Matrix movies are a retelling of the story of the Buddha. If the line \\"No one can tell you what the Matrix is; you have to find out for yourself\\" from the first movie or the tagline on the Matrix Revolutions posters, \\"Everything with a beginning has an ending\\" doesn't convince you, you've missed the point that the movies make. I'm sure that this film was not as badly misunderstood in, say, Japan, as it was here. Here's a big hint: Buy yourself a copy of the movie Little Buddha (Chris Isaak, Bridget Fonda, 1993), and wait for the scene where Siddhartha becomes the Buddha. There's a bit of cheesiness to wade through, I must admit, but believe me, that scene under the Bodhi tree is worth it. Watch that, and you will understand Matrix Reloaded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent People Can Enjoy The Matrix","review":"The first time I saw this movie I was left wondering about some things that didn't add up. So I saw it a second time and really paid attention so as not to miss anything. After that I understood the entire movie and knew why everything was happening. So I saw it a third time just to enjoy it the ground-breaking visuals and genius of the whole thing. If you gave this less than 4 stars you obviously saw it once, were too thick to understand any of it and then told all your 'pals' how 'dumb' it was and that it 'didn't make sense'.

The fight sequence with Neo and the mutiplied agents became irritating after 15 minutes or so. This film failed for me. I can't recall any scene that gave me a feeling of enlightenment here. The original matrix had a mystery behind it with less intense acting, but a realization of a larger reality.

I've heard complaints that people were confused, but it's all right there. You just have to look past the smoke & mirrors plot distractions and the contrived/forced action sequences. Unlike the Matrix were the story flowed organically, this and Revolutions feel laboured. The Wachowski Bros. must have gone \\"OH CRAP!!!

I have not been more disappointed in a sequel well,ever. The story, plot, drama, and tension have been so far removed, as to give a three hour demonstration of martial arts to put bruce lee movies to shame. The story that is there is so far from being the human tale that is the first matrix, as to put it too abstract to care what happened to the characters, by the end i was cheering the machines. and come on, raves underground, you couldnt find anything more popular, why not just get Britney Spears to fight in the third movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"computers crashed","review":"if u take out the first hour and you leave the car chase scene, that would have cut 1 hour of pure crap.

Is good movie Sci-fi defined by too many computer generated special effects and Kung-Fu fightin'? This is just an awful movie, with an awful story line, based on an awful premise. You have the directors recreation of some kind of Dante's Inferno. Keanu Reaves delivering his lines like some bad robot in the Hall of Presidents or some dime wax museum. Add to that his wearing that cassock. And the cheap Superman pose as he flys throught the air is hilarious. Laurence Fishburne delivers his lines in speech mode. Did I tell you there is Kung-Gu fightin? And more Kung-Fu fightin' and so on and so on, well you get it. Add to this the pseudo Eastern philosophy peppered with Christian terminology and the dialogue is just too taxing.

So I was highly anticipating the sequels, which were delayed numerous times and just kept getting stalled. When i finally started watching The Matrix Reloaded after the first 15 minutes i new something was different. For some reason everything was more asian influenced. Instead of numbers, asian symbols, instead of leather jackets on Neo, asian robe/jacket, and instead of hard gritty fighting, it was more of a soft and slow style. I didnt really care for the changes but as long as the movie was decent i wouldnt mind. It was around the what seemed long an hour long dance scene i realized that this movie was nothing like its predecessor and i was extremely dissapointed.

It's story is about as convoluted. I suppose one could see 1-3 over and over and over and then finally make some sense of the story but the story isn't worth that much effort. The effects are good here, the best of all of them, but it shows once again that effects cannot carry a movie.

It seems that the film crew got a big head from the success of the previous installment. The dance/sex scene was too long and irrelevant to the story. It would have OK if it were to add some amusment to the movie, but it didn't. The special effects were OK. I thought the first one did a better job. There, they'd slow something down in mid sequence, but here they'd slow down the whole scene. I think they should have paid more attention to writing story than trying to out do the previous movies fashion and special effects statements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matrix Rebloated","review":"Matrix Reloaded is a movie without a real purpose, as Neo's character arc was complete in the first movie. Fans like to compare the Matrix and Star Wars trilogies, but this is incorrect, as Star Wars took 3 movies to have Luke become a Jedi and defeat Vader, while the Matrix took only 1 for Neo to become The One and defeat Agent Smith.For that reason, Reloaded and Revolutions have a lot more in common with Menace and Clones.Sadly, Reloaded continues an already complete story with the expected results. The plot is virtually non-existent, the action scenes are meaningless and tacked-on, and the talking-head exposition is among the most boring and amateurish ever put to film.

But you should also remember that the creators of this phenomenon are two youngsters, who like comics, kung-fu movies, anime and videogames. It's logical to me that they included a sex-scene. And that doesn't demerit the philosophical values of the movie. A friend of mine even tried to convince me that this movies are based on Gurdjieff's philosophical system.I don't know about most people, but those of my friends who didn't like \\"Reloaded\\" didn't like it because they didn't understand the Architect's explanation.

I like paying less and being able to get a different set in a few years and justifying it. Years ago, I bought towels that were supposed to last 10 years and got very tired of them. These are not the best made, but they are definitely better than many I have seen for a lot more money.

Maybe I expected too much of these towels, I am a little disappointed. They are soft, but the red color of the washcloth fades quickly as I use it, especially in warm water. They definitely not worth more than $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"First it's not soft, it seems 5 years old cottonsecond i got one with several holes on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"short-lived amazing band","review":"these guys were only around for a few years and that's a shame because they were great. this is undoubtedly THE heaviest rock record i've ever heard. i remember hearing this back in my senior year (1997 damn it)and not really knowing what to think. hardcore with rock vocals probably shouldn't work this well. sounds kind of like every time i die's last few albums or really that should be reversed considering that cast iron hike had already lived and died before every time i die was even born. except for michael gallagher, who is in isis now, i don't know what ever happened to any of these guys. you need this. there is a self titled ep that is available from time to time on here and another ep called \\"salmon drive\\" that i have yet to track down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you order","review":"Thankfully my daughter loves LPS.

Nothing seems to happen for a reason other than trying to make it weird and mysterious. While it attempts to appear intellectual and deep, it is quite the opposite. Don't bother seeing this, especially if you loved Donnie Darko."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful movie!","review":"This movie is nothing, and I mean NOTHING, like Donnie Darko....It makes no sense whatsoever. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage not worthy of the Darko name","review":"Basically, this entire film was an attempt to recapture the thrill of Donnie Darko. It failed in every way imaginable. I honestly couldn't watch the thing straight through but just kind of skipped to get the jist of the plot, which tanked. Don't waste your time to give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst film I've ever seen.","review":"S. Darko is awful. It has way too many sub-plots for the length of the film, and none of them are done enough justice to be included. Even the \\"point\\" of Sam's time traveling isn't given enough attention, and loose ends are left all over the place. The acting is horrible; really, truly terrible. Maybe that was the director's fault. I can't get into everything that is wrong with this movie without spoiling it, but just know that it is awful, and I have a guilty pleasure for semi-bad movies.This film is a disaster of epic proportions, and I'm not saying that because I liked the first Darko film. This movie is bad enough without being compared to its predecessor."},{"rating":"1","title":"just awful...","review":"I tried to go into this one with no bias.. especially since the first one was so good, I didn't want to ruin it either way. but man this was a major fail. this movie was the equivalent to an encore of your favorite band but done by badgers dropping acid, just really long and drawn out-- and maybe with a few falling rocks from the sky. ouch, not worth the watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad...but it sure is pretty!","review":"Surprised nobody has commentd on the cinematography. I think that is all that is worth seeing. Big sky and lots of color.The story was like David Lynch movies: weird for weirdness' sakes. Donnie darko had a point and the weirdness was explanable. S Darko was just a hodgepodge of randomness.To quote Shakespeare:A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just what I expected, and that was awful","review":"Did you like Donnie Darko? Are you curious about this sequal? Well please don't buy this awful movie. It should have never been made. As you know, sequals are almost always worse than the original, and so is this one. Even with low expectations, the low quality of this movie managed to surprise me. First off, the overall tone of the movie is unbearable. The characters are generic and their lines are predictably art filmy. It is long, boring, has unlikable characters, and worse of all destroys the meaning behind the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried...","review":"I really did. I am die hard Donnie Darko. I have the movie poster in my house and \\"Cellar Door\\" on my car. So when I saw they were making this i cringed a little.But... I was gonna give it a fair shake.I love everyone in this movie... That's all I can say. It messed with the entire mythology and, well, it just sucked. It maybe could've been a stand alone sci-fi at some point, but calling it a Donnie Darko tale was the kiss of death.And by the way... Why is no one flinching when those meteors are falling all around them? Its odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame attempt to capitalize on a modern cult classic","review":"If you loved, and I mean loved, the film Donnie Darko then this film might hold some appeal for you. However, if you've never seen the aforementioned \\"D. Darko\\" or were just a mild to moderate fan of the original film then you can easily skip this sad attempt to continue the \\"Darko Mythos\\" that picks 7 years after the last film with the mind numbingly lame escapades of Donnie's youngest sister. Do yourself a favor and watch the director's cut of Donnie Darko instead of this hackey sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a fan","review":"I just got through watching S.Darko and I must say I was completly lost. and after reading the reviews here I can tell my mistake was not wathing the first film. and I didnt read any of the book's if their was any. Hey look i'm not a book worm or film analist, i just a normal person looking for a good movies to watch and this wasnt it. I was lost from the beginning and never found my way in this movie. it was very boring, and very slow. the movie made no since to me what so ever. I guess if I had seen the first one I would be able to understand this movie and would be able to follow it. So if anyone reading this review and are thinking about buying it or renting It, I just have to tell you to stop and wathc the first one or read the first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily one of the worst movies made !","review":"I have to honestly say this was one of the worst ideas I ever seen. First of all \\"Donnie Darko\\" was not sequel material. It was done about as good as it could have been done. This movie made very little since and there was no character development what so ever. I cared nothing about the characters they weren't memorable at all. Everyone in the movie was grade C at best with no headliners. Watch this only out of curiosity nothing more. Boring Boring Boring Boring ! Donnie Darko was a slow mover but it still kept interest. Then they tried to tie in Donnie as her brother when you saw no signs of this ? No family , no characters that connected to her ? I am warning everyone save yourself the pain and mental torture! If you want to watch something good that is a mind movie Watch \\"Inland Empire\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!!","review":"I'm a huge Donnie Darko fan and was excited to see this....I couldn't even make it past 20 minutes of this. It seems to be a pointless, boring teen film. I would give it 0 stars if that was an option. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Pretty much everything that can be said about this movie is already said elsewhere. this is the cheapest, dumbest, sequel ever. The only good part of the movie was getting to see Donnie's sister Sam after she's grown up to be immersivelly hot. She is gorgeous. But what they put her through, essentially turning her into another Donnie.. is terrible.. I hope she gets in some other role, but they did her a disservice with this script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not see this film if you're a DD fan.","review":"Just don't. None of the original cast except Samantha, and she can't act. This is an insult to the genius of Donnie Darko."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Would have Sucked","review":"Although the director of S. Darko has stated he's a huge fan of the original \\"Darko\\", how could this be the case when the sequel is nothing but a cookie cutter, formulaic hodgepodge follow up which adds nothing new to the franchise while managing to screw it up royally? Did we really need infectious extraterrestrial hypercubes falling from the sky??? This isn't mysterious--it's just dumb. All of the characters were lame to boot. I realize that viewers, including myself, had high expectations for a sequel to \\"Donnie\\" that probably could never be met. So maybe I'm being a little overcritical. In fact, if S. Darko hadn't been the sequel of a masterpiece...actually it still would have sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"Even looking at this movie as its own separate entity from its predecessor, it really lacks substance. The plot goes round and round in circles, seemingly never going anywhere. I see the parallels between the pinwheel and the windmill and in the way Sam waves goodbye to Randy and the rabbit ears/mask, but so many events are not clearly explained that the movie becomes disappointing by the end. At one point, we leave the main character Sam entirely and focus through the eyes of her best friend, which totally throws off the perspective. We journey back in time a few times, when once would have sufficed, to correct any wrong past occurences. It seems we never save the little boy, and he is the reason we begin this adventure into another realm/parallel universe. Maybe there is more meaning beneath the surface that I just do not observe; so perhaps others would enjoy this trippy, nonsensical movie(???)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steaming pile","review":"This is one of the biggest movie sequel let downs I've ever had the displeasure of. Most movies I'm upset with the way they are. I just think to myself not going to watch this again. This movie actually had me pissed off. I wanted to destroy it to ensure no other person had to torture themselves with this horrid piece of trash. Please stay away no matter how much you loved Donnie Darko."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile fan-fiction with a budget.","review":"Uninspired garbage - captures none of the magic of the original film, and instead focuses on rehashing visual cues. It's not clever, it's not mysterious, it's not fun. It's hard to imagine a worse way to disgrace a director you love than to make an unwelcome sequel to his signature film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth watching","review":"I am a huge fan of Donnie Darko so I decided get this movie thinking it would be good. This is probably the worst movie ever made. It made no sense at all and it was hard to follow. This movie isn't worth watching even if it was free or the last movie on the planet. I only gave it 2 stars because Matthew Davis is in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"S. Darko","review":"Nothing like Donnie Darko except a few references, so people who enjoyed the original will probably not like this movie.

Darko is a really good film. Being a big fan of Donnie Darko, I was weary when I heard of a sequel being made. But you must remember it is just that A SEQUEL NOT A REMAKE!!! There is easily too many people put off by the film without even watching it or giving it a fair chance. This movie had the same imagery and story line that reeled me in with DD. It made me feel that same sadness and closeness to the characters once again. This movie is easily put on my shelf next to DD without any reserve. watch this movie with an open mind and remember its A SEQUEL NOT A REMAKE!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film,..For Christophobic Humanists","review":"To be brief,..so as to not waste your time like I did on this movie.Yet another in a very long list of films that portray Christians in an intolerant disrespectful and judgmental way.

Simple as that - it is crap. It is a complete farce to call it \\"Darko\\" as it is only very loosely related to the film, Donnie Darko, which was an incredible movie.I do not have a lot to write about it because I already wasted near two hours of my life watching it and I do not wish to waste much more because of it. The entire first hour was dreadful and boring, the second hour did not make sense. Do not see it - even for free. Simply wonderfail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow this movie is terrible!","review":"Even if the original cast and crew attempted to provide a sequel it would have been hard enough to work, however this was simply a very bad,bad,bad idea! The only thing I can relate this to is Halloween III which had no business in the franchise as this shouldn't have either! I'ts like the backstreet boys trying to cover the Beatles! For ethical reasons the producers and anyone else involved should pull this movie and refund the money to to those unfortunate enough to buy it like the tainted peanut butter!

Then remember they were going to make a sequel? Then remember how the sequel was horrible?Me and my buddy sat down to watch this last week and about an hour into it I was saying, \\"Is this almost over?\\" \\"Seems like it has been on for two hours!\\" So boring.... The only thing that saved it was the hot chick from Step Up 2 was in there........ A matter of fact she is the only thing that made step up 2 worth seeing.

So after work me and my homie decided we would see this movie at a local theatre since it was \\"free\\" BIG MISTAKE.

The main things that make no since to me...\\"Everything\\" Myself and everyone who left the movie were confused. I said aloud \\"Did ANYONE understand this?\\" I recieved severial staggered \\"NO\\" responces. From there I went straight to google for possible insight on a grand scheme for the movie that I maybe missed... Thanks to the other reviews I see I am not quite alone. I want to see the 1st movie now and bask in its greatness. I am very open-minded to new things and views, but this movie was horrible.

This sequel is the worst thing I have ever seen. They took random things and loose ideas from the first one and threw them into a random town with very thin personality characters and are portrayed through horrible acting. None of the problems are resolved and nothing happens to any antagonist. And wtf was up with the rash?? Sorry this is more venting than a review.I even tried looking at this movie from the stand point of it not being a sequel and no it still fails.

The main characters aren't all that interesting, with only a few of the supporting characters making an impression. Although the movie seemed to know what it was doing with it's own convoluted time travel logic it didn't seem to know what it had to say about the human condition, if anything. Which is a shame. I don't regret watching it -- if you're a curious Darko fan, you might as well rent it.

When I tried to get the problem resolved, Northern Tool asked that I just order another one--I did and got the same 50-250-inch pound wrench that I didn't want in the first place.

They were ruined, in our opinion, as we remembered the \\"broken English\\" Charlie very fondly. If I'd been able to do so, I would have returned them promptly.

Well, I guess that's the main reason for customer reviews--to pass on info to other customers that isn't in the buy-it biased blurb paragraph provided on the page. And it sure tipped me off. I've just bought \\"Magoo's Christmas Carol\\" from Marketplace--it's in the pipeline--after losing track of my tape of it, and I'm fairly sure that hasn't gotten the post-Soviet revisionist \\"surgery\\". As I recall from my VHS of the feature, Charlie isn't in it, and I guess Gerald Mc Boing Boing's protrayal of Tiny Tim with slight babytalk accent wasn't worth the trouble of dubbing out.

The DVD combines many hours of fun & enjoyment onto a single source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlie's voice overdubbed","review":"In every episode that Charlie has more than one line in, his voice is overdubbed in a ridiculous, intrusive voice that makes the episodes unwatchable. It's not just that they gave in to political correctness and changed his voice, but they didn't even do a good job. Most of the first disc soundtrack is intact (probably so those of us who were watching to see if they would change the voice would put in the first disc, hear the original voice and declare the box set O.K. I think that is what happened to some of the reviewers on this page). Just put in some of the later discs and be prepared for a big shock. These cartoons are great and my rating would be five stars if they were not tampered with. As it is though I cannot recommend this unless of course you really don't mind or, God forbid, you agree that hearing an exaggerated Japanese accent is going to corrupt the world as we know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER LOST SALE!!!!!!!","review":"As the alien in PLAN 9 said, \\"...Idiots, you're all idiots!\\"...Hoping not to lose a few sales to PC consumers the manufacturer dubbed Charlie's oriental voice into proper english thereby losing thousands of sales to customers like me who want the real thing.

I always start my day with a protein shake, and have tried tons of them. Generally, if its gross, I'll just add more fruit and deal with it.I bought this one because I wanted to try maca (didn't give much of a boost, but maybe that's just me), and the health stats were great.No amount of fruit makes this bearable.

Believe me, this album is mega overrated. Even the most memorable song I know you got Soul falls short compared to late 80s standards.This classic album has grown old in a very bad way, which is a shame when you consider that even 1st generation classics generally end up sounding way better by today's standards.I regret buying this for $7 on sale...do yourself a favor, listen to it before you make the same mistake I did..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs but overkill on all of the remixes","review":"Rakim rolls and Eric B keeps the beat and these tunes show the lyrical power of this duo and the times they represented...a bit too many remixes though"},{"rating":"2","title":"A History Lesson in Hip Hop","review":"Any person who is a fan of Hip Hop needs to have this masterpiece in their collection.

This CD is one of the biggest influences for the majority of hip-hop, and it shows. The beats are vintage late 80's style. Call it a bit dated, but it blends perfectly on this CD. Rakim's rhymes are pure genius, with his word play and his perfect flow to blend in with the production. The instrumentals play an important part for Eric B., and while you don't hear Rakim's smooth rhymes, it's still really nice.Believe the hype, this is a classic with groundbreaking beats for its time, perfect flow, and a perfect balance to top it all off."},{"rating":"2","title":"It reminded me of what rapp once was.","review":"Eric b. and rakim arem pioneers in the rap industry.

That's how your people will become my people (a reverse of the text in Ruth), by them converting their Judaism into a Christian version. He has the typical Messianic longing for unity into \\"one new man\\" a stock phrase indicating conversion as the route it will happen. Where is the part where Christians honor current Jewish and Israeli heritage? (Not simply from the time of Jesus).I suggest getting an out of print book by A. Roy Eckhardt \\"My People Your People\\" for a clear description of all the hidden assumptions that Christians carry around on this topic. Conversionist routes are akin to replacement theology since they still hold to the need for Jews to change their hearts and minds. Unless I missed it he doesn't appear to allow for Jewish salvation outside of accepting Christ. Mary C Boys is a good author on an alternate approach to this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your People Shall Be My People","review":"This is a great book to read and use as a study for anyone wanting to learn about Israel, how the Jewish people are still God's chosen ones and how Gentiles are grafted in to receive the covenant blessings through Yeshua.

Jews are a people of great heritage, who continue to contribute much to the modern world, but Christianity, for better or worse, is a religion with its own integrity and independence from its historic parent. Dr. Finto does not understand the agony of the Palestinians deprived of their home in the holy land. Nor does he seem to realize how Christianity itself is struggling for its very survival in the place of its origin. Christians, Jews, and Moslems must work together for common goals and respect one another, but they are unlikely to be converting each other in mass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching the '08 Bubble","review":"I use Inside Job and then follow it up with Too Big to Fail for teaching enhancements.

It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera version showing the personalities of the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened.Even that would not have been so bad but the movie tries to portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the right thing.The portrayal of Paulsen as this beleaguered, care-worn Treasury chief struggling to save the country is total garbage. He was the biggest cause in creating these conditions when he was at Goldman.It's a decent if shallow exposition of the timeline and it's indirect disclosure of just how many of these Wall Street schmucks run our government.But as journalism or an expose of real facts, as Bill Hicks would say, \\"Piece of S...\\"Rent \\"inside Job\\" is you really want to understand what happened.

My daughter dropped her violin and broke off the scroll and we needed a replacement that wouldn't be too expensive since her last violin ended up 'dead'. SO after going through the process of setting up the bridge, I was pleased to hear the sound quality of the Breton. Seriously, I was hoping that the instrument would sound better than a box for my 10 year old and to my suprise it had a large and rounded tone - very pleased. Plus the case is also super light- a definite plus for a girl who carries a heavy backpack to school. So here's the negatives, the pegs are awful and I ended up replacing the pegs from the previous violin. Also, the bow is very cheap and not a good quality but with lots of rosin, plays okay. Overall, considering the price, I feel like I really got my money's worth. A nice sounding instrument for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"One of my students recently brought an Anton Breton violin that he had just gotten to school. The hair was coming out of the tip of the bow, and the violin won't stay in tune. Even if repairs were made, they would exceed the purchase price and would not correct the poor tone quality. My advice would be to save the money you would spend on this violin and use it for a down-payment toward a decent instrument. Check with a string teacher if you don't know where to get a reasonably priced instrument.

A true disappointment- Buffett could have cut and pasted the same tunes into a collection of his music, instead of the kiddie muzac version offered here.

This title was orignially published back in 1995 and the storyline is really a spy/suspense/romance tale that is fast paced and demonstrates that Ms. Gerritsen was well on her way to becoming the author that she is now.This read will take the reader from England to Paris, then on to Greece, and finally Berlin. The chemistry between Richard Wolf and ex-CIA agent and Beryl the young woman that is trying to figure out who killed her parents and why is really believable but at the same time this relationship did not detract from the spy storyline.

There hasn't been any problems with loose lint or anymore loose threads since the first or second wash/dry.The handtowels had crooked corners/bad stitching and four or five long loose threads that unravelled a bit when pulled.

The list of suspects includes Alison, who stands to inherit Maggie's fortune, and four of Maggie's suitors from the past from which Maggie intended to pick one as her husband.

The size was nice, and the sling was comfortable and good support for my preemie newborn. After about a month of use, though, there was a horrible odor emitting from the mesh sling. This was after \\"squeezing\\" it out as best I could and propping it up to dry after every use. The sling is not machine washable and therefore unusable after it gets ruined by mold.I stopped using the sprayer after the first couple days. It was just too much of a pain to fill it up everytime, especially since it doesn't even spray well. The other reviewers are correct in saying that the button on the sprayer is difficult to press. Especially when your hands are wet and slippery.It's a good thing BRU will take back anything! I am off to return it and purchase the old faithful cheapie tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay product","review":"I thought this product would be good, but the whirlpool and shower spray is not what I expected. The buttons don't work well, so you have to push hard on it. Also, the whirlpool and the shower spray do not work at the same time. I guess I expected too much from this product. The tub and baby sling is great, but not worth $40. I think the company should sell the tub and baby sling seperately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth all the hype.....","review":"I registered for this tub wanting it very bad for my newborn. I thought what a great idea for fussy babies to have a spa and not to mention the shower rinse. Well, the first time I used this it took more time to set it up than I did using it. Also, the button on the shower head IS hard to press, and the sprayer needs to remain upside down or it will leak water allover your bathroom(found that out the hard way). When you use the spa bubbles it makes the water cold very quick. My daughter does love the spa effect, but I think she prefers warm water throughout her bath. The one thing that has really annoyed me is the baby sling has a moldy smell to it. I have washed and dried it many times and cannot get this smell out. Needless to say I had to purchase another insert for the tub, which doesn't fit very well, so Im a bit irritated. Overall this is a good idea, it needs some kinks worked out of it....Just not worth $40. So now Im off to target to purchase a new tub :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"UNSAFE","review":"Length:: 0:20 MinsReceived this as a gift. I was brave/stupid enough to put batteries in it and try it out.On its third run, the pump shorted and exploded the waterproof battery case out of the top of the unit while our son was in the bath. No shock, but extremely loud bang and brown residue all over the battery housing now. It clearly leaks into the pump area. Worse, it kept running even after the lid blew off. Thankfully it didn't catch my face on the way into the ceiling.I haven't opened the watertight seal since about 3 wks ago when I put the batteries in. It was dry then. The bang when it blew the battery compartment lid off was loud enough that my ear's still ringing.

The shower function worked twice and now it does not work. The whirlpool still cuts on but doesn't provide much water movement.There is definitely a design issue with the shower/spa unit. First, you have to turn the spa off to use the shower and the button is hard to push. Second, the unit is located directly at the baby's feet. When you turn it on your baby will probably jump because of the blast of water on his/her feet. Hopefully your child will not cry and be afraid of baths after that unpleasant experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as useful as I thought it would be.","review":"I thought that this bathtub would be the best thing, because of the shower and spa feature. But the shower is so hard to use, it's so hard to push the button and hold the shower head at the same time. You also have to worry about your baby falling off or sliding down off the sling, beacause it's just not positiioned right, it sits too high up, and she just looks uncomfortable on it. You also have to worry about your baby hurting their toes on the shower and spa unit. It wasn't worth $40, the sling, and the spa and shower unit isn't useful or helpfula t all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty useless...","review":"In theory this sounds awesome, but in reality is comes really close to being useless.1) The \\"spa\\" is nothing more than a light flow of water which isn't even enough to create bubbles, it comes out of the corner of the pump unit so hardly any of the stream will reach your baby2) The shower head has a button that is nearly impossible to keep pressed in for longer than 10 seconds, the flow of water is very weak so is not powerful enough to rinse out hair. A cup does a better job than this.3) The tub itself is pretty decent, the plateau used to lay your baby on seems nice and comfy and the temperature indicator is a nice bonus.All in all I wish we had saved our money and just gone with a normal tub, I advise anyone else to do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this tub because I was really excited about the rinse/spa sprayer. But it really is a terrible product. The cover on the incline is impossible to get off and clean, it's ridiculous. And the sprayer got water in the battery case and it stopped working. We never took the top off once we put the batteries in; water just worked down into it and ruined it. The sprayer hose is so hard to uncoil you can't use the sprayer and hold onto your baby at the same time.I would never buy this product again. Just go with a basic tub you'll be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Features Not Always Better","review":"When I saw this tub, I thought WoW this is great. It had everything.Well after receiving the tub as a gift for my shower I decided to try it before the baby came. I am so glad that I did. The pump for the spa and shower was super loud and had a leak. The shower was very difficult to operate, I had to press really hard.The only thing that I loved about the tub was the sling. It is very nice. I think when it comes to buying a tub for a baby simple is better... in the beginning speed is key, the baby gets to cold to really enjoy the features of this tub. In my opinion get a simple tub and splurge on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure it is worth the money","review":"We don't have our baby yet -but have tried the tub to see if it works. The first one we bought did not work at all so we exchanged it. this second one the spa works but the shower doesn't. The company is sending me a new motor saying that is must be the motor. Will try it again with the new motor of if the third one doesn't work we will return it and get a different tub - and probably something else for that money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky & Stinky","review":"I think the concept is great and all, but the pad that it comes with is hard to clean (maybe I'm doing it wrong) - it's not that easy to pull off of the frame and then since there are foam beads inside, I wouldn't think that it's safe to put through the washer? Let me know if anyone's found an easier way. Also, the tub pretty big, although my big boy is actually filling it. I guess I was hoping for something that will sit on my counter. The one I had for my eldest was more simple in design but also convenient since it was smaller. The shower is a little hard to push - I mean it's not super-tough to push but when your hands are slippery and you're trying to be really careful, it takes a little bit of force to push that button. I think that once this is developed a bit better, it will eventually be a really good product.

At the time, Free seemed like just another blues band, but hindsight shows their no-frills approach to have stood the test of time better than many of their more overblown contemporaries. Paul Rogers has one of the great voices, and he sounds far more \\"at one\\" with the material here than with Bad Company.

The abundance of research put into the story is obvious throughout the film and because of this, \\"The Conspirator\\" stands out among other comparable films. If this is a preview of what The American Film Company will bring in the future, we have a lot to look forward to ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for history buffs!","review":"Historically, this movie is very accurate and explains the plight and feelings of both sides during and after the assassination. The caliber of actors in this film is fantastic, and the portrayals convincing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Conspirator","review":"This movie was so well done. This movie tells a complex story with amazing insight and is a good lesson for what happens when the government decides revenge is more important than the law, loved the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy.","review":"Excellent packaging and prompt shipping. The product arrived as described almost immediately after placing my order. Because of the low price I was worried that I was possibly going to receive something other than what I expected (a documentary, or 'making of' disc with the same name), but the movie arrived in its original packaging. Definitely very satisfied and would purchase from again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!","review":"An excellent courtroom drama with all actors and actresses performing above and beyond what any director could even ask for. The writing, directing, and sets for this movie are superb. I truly felt like I was watching the events as they happened. This is one of those films that really makes you think about how great our Constitution is and how much we must respect the judicial system we have in place. This is a must-see or must-own movie if ever there was one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Conspirator","review":"This was a well put together movie. I enjoyed it so much. I felt the facts were well presented. If you are interested in what government was like after the Civil War, this is the movie for you. Robert Redford did a really good job on this one. I would definitely recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and moving story from our past","review":"I knew almost nothing of the other people involved in the plot to kill Lincoln until I saw this film. Mary Surratt was railroaded and made to stand trial with no jury because the Civil War was still raging on.The actors give very credible and moving performances, especially Robin Wright as Mary and the fellow playing her lawyer.The period design is also excellent, and what happened during this trial should be reminder to all that you cannot chuck the rules out just because it's expedient or because people want someone to blame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Historical Drama and very relevant to current events.","review":"Mark Twain once said that \\"history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme.\\" I suppose that's why we make the same mistakes over and over. Even in the Information Age we can't seem to learn from history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar Worthy","review":"This film depicts a frightening and confused time in our history. The characters played their parts with a passion one does not see in all period pieces. Someone told me the studios did not want this film made; if this is true then I applaud Mr. Robert Redford and a cast outstanding thespians for taking up the veil. Robin Wright and James Mcavoy are absolutely deserving of Oscars for their performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Wow. Sorely disappointed and yet such high expectations from James McAvoy & Robert Redford. The pace, especially in the beginning, is s l o w, and some of the dialog was wince-inducing.

And luckily after this incredible mess, civilians were no longer tried in a military court.I really enjoyed this movie, and learned a lot. The acting was well done, and although the character at the center of the movie is considered a traitor, you can't help but feel sorry for her. Robin Wright did an excellent job. I highly recommend this film. If you're a history buff you will truly enjoy it. I took the time after watching the film to read up about this incident and found the film to be very true to history (what a concept).Let freedom ring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow I hated this movie","review":"Get prepared to be bored out of your skull while you watch Robert Redford's incredible attempt to stretch the Lincoln assassination into a Bush/War on Terrorism basing film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceived","review":"Said it was a the 2 disc collectors version but only had one disc and the sender gave us a free movie of something we did not ask for. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"a shallow boring experience","review":"So take an interesting moment in American history, a group of colorful characters, pasteurize them, then make them 2 dimensional, dress them in period outfits, try to inappropriately squeeze in a reference to contemporary political events, add an awkward script and actors who can't maintain a consistent accent, spend $15,000,000, and you have this Robbie Redford movie. Just read Wikipedia about this moment in time and the key people involved in it and then see how they missed the boat.

DON\\"T EVER EVER GIVE UP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty or Not","review":"I think Maru Surrat's actual innocence was irrelevant to me by the end of this film. What was relevant is why the attourney fought so hard for her. As humans, we have the ultimate control over our own emotions and prejudices. We can choose to react or to think. This film gives deep respect to the founders of the Constitution as well as shows the need we have for it. Excellent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic, childish","review":"Terrible treatment of fascinating story. Simplistic, clearly made for an American audience. If you want the a realistic and detailed treatment read \\"American Brutus.\\" This film is cliche ridden. For instance, in yard of fort, soldier noises: \\"Left, right, left.\\" And on and on.

It was initially played up because of its historical accuracy, but then you never heard another word. After watching the movie I understood why.

Sooner or later it will be on the History Channel and you will understand my comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Conspirator","review":"I don't like movies that have the commentary going at the same time as I find it distracting. However, as I am a history buff and also consider Abraham Lincoln to be the best president we have had, did find this an interesting take on who was responsible for his assassination. My opinion is, all the parties who were convicted were guilty and punished. The cast and director all did well in their bringing this story to the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeper","review":"The conspirator is a good movie.

Give it a chance, it will make you think about some of the laws that we live by."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't even realize I was in school....","review":"The movie is well written, well performed, and well produced. About half way through I wondered if my history teacher had skipped a chapter, so I looked it up and read about it and discovered that this film is pretty accurate. It was a great film and only goes on to demonstrate that in national crisis, it is American cultural to throw out all notions of law and order and civility and allow tyrants to rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Conspirator","review":"It is a shame this movie was not given the praise it deserves. Robert Redford did an excellent job, while the actors in this movie wer not household names they all gave a wonderful and believable performance. I would suggest all history buffs view this masterpiece. We took my then 12 year old granddaughter to the theatre to see this and she just loved it. Wonderful movie well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"A RE-WRITTEN HISTORY?","review":"In a court of law, Redford wouldn't be convicted of exactly rewriting history, but he is guilty of a more refined crime... re-proportioning events to change the perception of history - thus rewriting history, in effect. The conspirators were, in fact, all guilty. A great place to start learning about the conspirators is James L. Swanson's illustrated history,Lincoln's Assassins: Their Trial and Execution.Mary Surratt WAS, in fact, accorded due process... the due process of 1865!I'm constantly amazed that people of today fail to see the simple fact that the due process, or ANY thinking, for that matter was different 147 years ago than that of today. We've come a long way since then, and it is a huge mistake to overlay 21st century morality on people of another time. They were product of their world and experiences, just as we are product of ours.It is just that simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This was a movie I would recommend !

If you are a history buff it's worth a look on Netflix. The subject matter is very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A view inside a twisted view of what happened","review":"This movie was created with an ulterior motive in mind, and I would argue that the motive rested in trying to reflect how military tribunals are never worthy of the American values Redford supports. The way in which the trial was presented reflected too much of today's procedures, but not as much of what actually happened in the past. This does not make it fatally flawed, rather too ambitious. However, that was not what made this a bad experience for me. Rather what was the problem rested in the fact that the dialogue was far too slow, as well as the entire movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent portrayal of a lesser known fact","review":"I watched documentaries in the past about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the conspirators and the aftermath. It was mentioned in the documentary that the one female hung was never truly found guilty of conspiracy. This is a brilliant telling of that story, and how it changed American justice and the actual future of her son when he was finally brought to justice. It also helped launch the viability of the Washington Post, as a lawyer of complete integrity found this his only remaining avenue to effect change in the young nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"We loved it","review":"I had never heard this story before. It was fascinating. We enjoyed it very much. The fact that we could watch it without waiting to get a dvd, was even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"This is one of the most poorly manufactured products I have ever purchased from Amazon. At two different points in the film, I lost both picture and sound. Robert Redford should be ashamed to have his fine work (the parts I saw were excellent) displayed so abysmally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent characterization, timely satire","review":"This is the first James novel I've read, so my high ranking doesn't take into account the relative merits of his novels. That having been said, this novel impressed me with its excellent character development, amusing satire, and spot-on portraits of certain types of oh-so-serious New England crusaders for whom an ironic outlook is alien. The development of the southerner Basil seemed a little weak to me, but James knows his Bostonians and his sketches remain fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I stumbled on to this one","review":"I picked this one up out of the bin because it sounded somewhat familiar. I would have never picked out a story that revolved around the women's' rights movement during the 19th century unless it was nonfiction.This book is a treat through and through. The characters are deep, the language interesting and the prose witty. It has a very simple plot, but the journey is great. This was my first Henry James book, but after reading this one, will not hesitate to read another. James takes pride in his craftsmanship and we the readers benefit. Do yourself a favor and take a step back in time and read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I Wanted!","review":"I searched in my local stores for something to put inside the kitchen cabinet under the sink. I was so pleased to find this online. It was very easy to install and holds two towels perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I usually love Anne Tyler's books, but could not get into this one. Few of the characters are well developed. The daughters all coalesce into a single being who is very selfcentered and completely unsympathetic. The main character is more sympathetic, but not much better developed.The book is a mish-mash of characters and situations that are reminiscent of other Anne Tyler books. It feels like she is copying herself, and doing a bad job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless, nasty, stupid people","review":"Am I supposed to like these people, or find their lives even remotely interesting? Because if so, the author has failed miserably. No No and Min Foo and Wa Wa and Poo Poo were simply the most boring, obnoxious, wastes of space ever created. If this is women's literature, I would like to opt out of womenhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic family","review":"Anne Tyler is the queen when it comes to creating and developing quirky characters. Unfortunately, this family is so pathetic and so miserable, the reader may find it impossible to sympathize or relate to them.I wanted to reach through the pages and strangle everyone, especially her good for nothing stepdaughters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happily, I will never get this superb book out of my mind.","review":"I read a great deal, as a member of a book club, and privately and in the last many years have found only two current books that will ring in my heart forever: One is this book and the other is Corellie's Mandolin. Beck, the lead character is happy and doesn't know it. Interesting concept. Surprised a reviewer would think the book sad. Since we cannot control many circumstances in our lives, what is interesting and challenging is how good people find deep contentment and happiness in circumstances less than favorable. The author teases us a bit about a romance with Zeb and touches just enough on that possibility. Nice control. I think I laughed more reading that book than I ever have in any other, and it wasn't a comedy, or was it? The rich family life was fascinating. And yes, I agree, Poppy should have his 100th birthday party even if he can't remember it. And he did. How do I write the author to praise praise her?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the 15!","review":"I've read all 15 of Tyler's books and this one is by far the best. Maybe it's because I am 53 years old like Beck and now that my children are out on their own I wonder if this is the person I thought I'd become. This was the most believable of all of her writings and I can hardly wait for more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO-so storyline","review":"This was one of the most boring books I've bought to read. I like books with more bite and awe to the story. I can't get interested in a story of a 50something woman who's wondering what happened to the girl of her youth; and also wondering what her life would be like if she chose the other road in her journey through life. She's not unhappy, she's just curious. She loves her family, she lives in a house that belonged to her in-laws and she works at a career that makes her be a person that she really isn't deep down inside................Well, heck....................That book's main character sounds like me......and my enjoyment of reading is the escape from reality it affords me while sitting in my Broyhill with my 2 chihuahuas curled up on my lap, my favorite CD playing.The book has excellent writing and cute storylines, but not for me. Give me some kind of wierdness or dysfunction laced through my reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big dissappointment - and - boring","review":"What I thought was going to be a whimsical look at a woman's life, turned out to be nothing but a series of boring statements. The names of the characters were ridiculous and the story seemed to have no plot. I TRIED to get through the first chapter, but I could not even do that. Don't waste your time. There are plenty of other good books this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly family","review":"If I hadn't had to read this book for a bookclub I would have stopped at page 6. It is one of the worst books I've ever read and I read constantly.And over many years. The ridiculous names, the endless family get togethers of people who disliked each other and appeared to have no other friends/life, the tedious details. The best line for me was when Rebecca says \\"I'm superficial\\" but meant to say superfluous! She was pathetic. All the characters were one dimensional and why did she persevere with the hopeless Will who had no will at all. All that hypocritical chirpiness. I wanted to shake her. And the ungrateful, whinging, whining adults and their offspring. Uggg!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired reading.","review":"The book started off well enough. A confused 53 year old questioning her choices in life. I wanted to read on and did. But, the characters were so annoying and their personalities so irritating that I found I couldn't empathize with any of them.Perhaps the most underwhelming was the \\"Non-character\\", Will Allenby. Such an unsympathetic \\"wuss\\" and hardly a love interest in the making. The whole relationship was left so unresolved and left me wondering why.The book ended abruptly in my eyes and I was left disppointed. It seemed to me that there was no closure to any of the plot lines, with the exception of Poppy making it to his 100th birthday. Overall, a real yawn for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very promising beginning, but then...","review":"I really enjoyed the first 90 pages or so of this novel. Then I thought the situations became contrived, and I felt that Tyler began to make the characters quirky as an alternative to actually developing them. The dialogue between Rebecca and her mother, especially, was excruciating. I also found the plotline involving Rebecca and Will to be simply implausible. Tyler seemd to be altering her characters just to get the story where she wanted it to go. The end result was tedious and relentlessly manipulative. I didn't buy any of it, and there ended up being little or no insight or resolution to Rebecca's dilemma."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read!","review":"This axiously awaited tome nearly found me dropping it like a hot potato - the first page had me nervous. For shame on me, how could I doubt the extrodinary storytelling of Anne Tyler? I was soon consumed by the funky characters and intrigues of the Davitch family history and on-goings.I love these stories, as much for the superb writing as for the locations in Baltimore, a city I have learned to enjoy.I trully empathsized with the main charachter, Rebecca, who wondered what her life would have been like had she taken a different path. I too, have tried looking up old acqaintences, only to never reach out. Sometimes it is better not to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you expect, good prermis but boring story & uninteresting characters.","review":"After spending the first 2 chapters going over an entire family reunion of the most bizarre names and to make it even worse they are nicknames so you have to learn both for each person. The story sounded like it could be an interesting one but I don't feel that there was ever really a split in the road. Not a great divide that would have ultimately changed her life significantly. All 5 of us in our bookclub were bored by this one and had to struggle to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, but an honest view of adulthood.","review":"This was my first Anne Tyler novel and it was disappointing. The theme held such promise (we are not who we intended to be) but was never developed. It just hung there in the background, occassionally coming to light and just as quickly pushed back again. As I read the book I kept hoping the main character would spend more time exploring what her life should have been. The only clue here is that she thought she would marry another but again, she never reveals what she thought her life should have been; only that \\"this\\" wasn't it.The best parts of the novel quite accurately depict a matron's role in family life--selfless and unappreciated. Every eldest daughter of a family should be able to identify with this character.Lastly, we are able to glimpse the truth that others see us in a different way than we see ourselves...whether we like it or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"a gentle read with real wit and wisdom about families...","review":"I just finished reading this book...It was a lovely and easy read filled with gentle humor and knowing observations about individuals and the way they exist in and around (and in relation with) their family. The main character Rebecca discovers some truths about the choices that she has made, the choices that have been made for her, and finally, she learns to take responsibility, a certain degree of acceptance, and even some pleasure in the person that she has become.In the end, in a quiet way, this story snuck up on me emotionally... It is filled with so much humor, wit, detailed observation and subtle wisdom about the constant disappointments, sadness, boredom and joys of family, relationships and life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Gem","review":"I wasn't expecting to laugh out loud as I read this endearing story of Rebecca Davitch, who was widowed early in her marriage and was left to carry on her late husband's family business of hosting parties in the family's aging, once-elegant-now-rather-shabby, money pit of an old house. As she goes through the throes of midlife's \\"what ifs\\", she begins to question the constant demands of her colorful and fractious extended family whose members constantly barge in on her life, as well as her \\"bubbly, let's-all-have-fun\\" personality that she seems to have developed as a result of people's expectations of her after her many years of party-hosting. Her ongoing critical self-appraisal of the metamorphosis of her hair, body and clothes is humorous and identifiable to readers of a certain age! Her decision to seek out her old boyfriend is both funny and poignant. Loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"If the manuscript of \\"Back When We Were Grownups\\" was sent under an unknown author's pen name, it would not have been published. This was my first Tyler book and will be my last. The book was trite, tiresome, boring and unrealistic. The book appears to be written about the 50's rather than present day. The characters are shallow and not fully developed. I would not waste my time reading another Tyler novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never really grew to love the Davtich's...","review":"As much as I tried, I never could make myself feel anything more for Rebecca Davitch than a passing nod of \\"Oh well...\\" There wasn't much \\"substance\\" to this novel and the point was lost somewhere along the way. I finished it, but only when there was absolutely nothing else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written and boring","review":"Rebecca, 53, looks back at her life and wonders over the course it has taken. She has 4 wonderful daughters, 7 grandchildren, a mother, an aunt, and an elderly person she lives with and takes care of.

I want to live life to the max, have big expectations and huge dissapointments.Maybe I have to try this book again in twenty years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone has to be in the minority","review":"I found this book boring, convoluted, and very easy to put down. The book did not keep my interest, and I only finished it, because I finish all books. I am in the correct age group, but seem to not like the type of self-absorbed characters in this book. The make-up of the family is changing and this book does not fit in with my life, or the lives of the people and families in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I WANT TO BE A GROWN-UP","review":"THIS WAS MY FIRST BOOK THAT I HAVE READ BY ANNE TYLER AND I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN AND I REALLY ENJOYED THE STORY LINE.THERE WERE QUITE A FEW CHARACTERS TO KEEP UP WITH SO I HAD TO WRITE DOWN SOME OFTHE NAMES AND OUTSTANDING POINTS ABOUT SOME OF THEM.I ESPECIALLY LIKED THE UNCLE AND THE THINS THAT WOULD COME OUT OF HIS MOUTH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat Characters and Poor Conflict Resolution","review":"I'm a Tyler fan who was truly disappointed with this book. It was one of those \\"Please, just let me get through it\\" reads. The supporting/secondary characters -- the main character's family -- weren't fleshed out. Tyler sets up different life situations for the four daughters -- but they all read like the same person. The heroine never truly goes through any kind of change as a character -- which made me wonder: \\"What, exactly was the point?\\" A slow read, weak characters and a thin plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Women as caretakers, again.","review":"I am a big Anne Tyler fan but I have to admit that I almost put this book down. The matronly main character never, ever changes. She realizes that she made a wrong turn somewhere in her past, but she continues on with her same old routine of throwing parties and taking care of an annoying extended family. Why didn't she just get in her car and drive away? Or go back to school, or get a real job? Anything to get her out of her rut. Her clothes are consistently bad, her meals (the endless meals) are pedestrian, and the conversations put you to sleep. Talk about making middle-aged women look cliched and dull. This woman has no sex life and no hope for one without a major external and internal overhaul. I thought this book would document that journey but, instead, she just kept running in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back When We Were Grownups","review":"I was intrigued by the first paragraph of the book and found myself anxious to find out what Rebecca would discover as to who she really was. After the first paragraph, however, I struggled through the first couple of chapters trying to keep everyone straight. Several times I had to turn back in the book to figure out who a particular character was. Once I was somewhat familiar with all the characters, I really enjoyed the book and found it warm, funny and entertaining. I did find the ending a bit unsatisfying, though. It was like the author just ran out of time and needed to quickly end the book. Overall, an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why in the world does she stay?","review":"I finished the book, only because of its initial promise. Also, as a 'woman of a certain age' I was interested in the idea of reclaiming one's lost sense of self. But alas, the characters who surround Beck are miserable, silly, pathetic, self-absorbed parasites. Beck should flee the Open Arms, and never look back. I kept waiting for some sort of flash of insight, but Beck just plods along, putting up with rude and borish family and friends. The dialogue is so stilted, it aches. Also, the book just flat ran out of steam. I read the final pages twice, thinking I must have missed something. If you are a major fan of Ms. Tyler's -- wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"back when we were grownups","review":"Excellent first paragraph....promises so much, but never delivers. The development and ending is quite predictable that one feels cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"a rather annoying book","review":"I'm not sure where to start in describing how annoying this book was. The plot was tedious. There was no momentum to carry you through the book (I only read the whole thing out of desperation -- hoping the plot had to improve). There were far too many quirky characters in this book, it was if the author was really trying to make the book interesting. It didn't work by a long shot. Plus it was really overkill that all the daughters had off beat nicknames. I found most of the behavior of the characters to be so annoying. I really hated the way Rebecca strung Will along until she could finally make up her mind that she really didn't want/need him. I suppose I didn't care for this book because it isn't my typical genre. But I wanted to try something different and the other reviews made it sound pretty good. So if you normally read this type of book, you may actually like this one. If you, you may find this one hard to bear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back When We Were GrownUps","review":"Fantastic, well-written page turner that I'd highly recommend. If I had a criticism, it's that the main love story in this book remains unresolved -- and the writing is weak around that one area. Yet it's a terrific story that stays with you long after you've finished the book. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As a Short Story, It Would Have Been Great","review":"Ever been a guest at the home of a friend who is a terrific cook, and you're really hungry for protein, and bloated yourself on a starchy casserole meal to get to the meat because you felt too polite to just pick through to the meat? I kept reading and reading and reading ad nauseum to get to the juicy bits of wisdom, to the point I started to skim (not a good sign). I was starving for more of her lines like: \\"Once upon a time, there was a woman who discovered she had turned into the wrong person\\". Isn't that fabulous? That line alone got me thinking hard about my own life. I'm not a avid reader anymore so perhaps the fault lies with me that the story seemed too detailed. It was a good story, though, and if you like Anne Tyler's style, by all means get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"When I told my father I had just finished reading an Anne Tyler novel, he described exactly the plot without even knowing which title I had read: It was set in Baltimore, about a large, dysfunctional family with some eccentric quirks, and not very much happens. I realized that this was not only an apt summary of BWWWG but also every Tyler novel I have ever read. There are those writers who write one book and know they are done, and then there are those who write the same book over and over but never realize it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"a review of what it was like to be alive\\"","review":"Back When We Were Grownups is a wonderful book, as good as Tyler's Breathing Lessons, which won a Pulitzer Prize! As always, her characters are real people. They are foolish, insecure, thin-skinned, fearful of what life throws their way...and sometimes wonderfully wise and always truly human. Poppy's speech on his 100th birthday, a speech generally ignored by most of the attendees at his party, is the answer to the question, What is the secret of life?! Tyler has the three qualities I prize most in my favorite authors: the ability to see what makes people tick, an eye for the perfect revealing detail, and a grand sense of humor. As always, I eagerly await Tyler's next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happened to Anne Tyler?","review":"Doesn't anyone remember the Anne Tyler of years past? She wrote books in which things actually happened, things that were funny, meaningful, and poignant all at the same time.That quality is sadly lacking in \\"Before We Were Grownups.\\"Worse yet, the characters are so poorly defined. Perhaps three of them have a distinct identity, but no more. For instance, I never was able to distinguish the lead character's four daughters from each other (apart from a few superficial gimmicky traits: this is the one that gets married a lot, that's the cranky one, etc.).And just try to compare the stock-issue shy little misfit boy in this book to the richly-drawn timid child in \\"The Accidental Tourist\\" and you'll see what I mean.Such a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebecca thinks she's lost","review":"Everyone at some time or another has or will wonder what their life would be like if they'd taken another path. Tyler's main character is in the throes of a midlife reinspection of who she is and where she's going. Her predicament should resonate with anyone old enough to have made choices that aren't easily reversed. You do not have to be 53, the age of the main character. Tyler leads the reader through Rebecca's experiences while she lives out the search for her 'real self,' which she suspects was left behind when she jilted her college boyfriend for an older man she'd known only weeks. The supporting character names have the charm and eccentricities of intimate family nicknames. The supporting cast is not fully developed, but this isn't the story of the supporting cast. This is Rebecca's journey through midlife's questions. It is a good read that just might make you consider your life decisions. Who is your real self?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book and a missed opportunity.","review":"This is one of Tyler's better books. Once again it celebrates human relationships with humor, nuance, objectivity. No one can make simple plot lines more interesting than Tyler. A woman's life takes a sudden and drastic turn when she is 20 and in college, as she marries an older man with 3 children. Now she is a grandmother, and wondering if she has led the wrong life. The book is marred by Tyler's treatment of the woman's childhood boyfriend, who as an adult is more caricature than character. This was a great opportunity wasted, and it almost seems deliberate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"Based on several reviews and, I must admit, a great first line (\\"Once upon a time, a woman woke up...\\") I purchased this book. Unfortunately, I found this book to be very disappointing. The story line itself seemed like it would be interesting, but I never developed a real sense of compassion or interest in Rebecca Davitich (the lead character). To be honest, I didn't really care what happened to her, or her funky family. A lot of reviews mentioned how Anne Tyler characters often resemble people they know in real life. I'm sure I know some \\"Anne Tyler characters\\", too, but I wouldn't care to read a novel about them. To be fair, the prose is beautiful. It is a beautifully written book, but not that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"I'm almost 53 (the age of the main character in this book; and I, too, sometimes wonder how I ended up in the life I have, instead of a \\"better\\" one). But I couldn't connect at all with Rebecca, or anyone else in the book, for that matter. Tyler's characters are caricatures, some of them with impossibly cutesy names and others with improbable personalities. The Davitch family is like no family I've ever come across (and I'm glad I haven't!). And the idea that the hippie-esque Rebecca would actually seriously consider getting together with her extremely anal and boring ex-beau is unbelievable.All in all, a disappointing read. Tyler has a way with comedy, but it's wasted in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I tried three times to finish this book, but it was so boring and shallow that I finally gave up. I agree with some of the other reviewers-- the main character is not interesting, and not the kind of person that you would spend much time with. I was very disappointed in this novel,and do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is too short to waste on such books.","review":"I decided to read this book because of the very favourable review from The Economist. To quote The Economist: \\"Back When We Were Grownups is as perceptive, as full of gentle comedy and human warmth, as any of Ms Tyler's previous novels.\\"But I found that it is just one of the so many books written every year. Don't waste your time if you have not read or liked Anne Tyler before. The title suggests that the story is about Rebecca Davitch who at the age of 53 is wondering what her life might have been if she had married her college sweetheart (Will Allenby). But the novel is filled with pages describing the countless parties that Rebecca hosts in her house for her living. I did not count, but Rebecaa-Will covers not more than 15 pages.So now you know what the novel is worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Get Into It","review":"I checked this one out of the library and read about 50 pages in 3 weeks. It didn't seem to be going anywhere, so I didn't finish it. It's not one of Anne Tyler's better books. If anyone wants to read a good book by Anne Tyler, try Accidental Tourist or the Ladder of Years or a Patchwork Planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to death ...","review":"Very boring writing, absolutely not interesting. It has really nothing to say, not even to its supposed target group of middle-aged women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Tyler Let-Down","review":"I have always liked Anne Tyler (my favorite Tyler book: Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant). But this book was a huge LET-DOWN. The middle-aged woman in the book is not the least bit interesting. We don't care about her or all of her family members (and believe me, there are alot of family members. All of them have weird names, and none of the characters are developed enough that we can remember which is the daughter, which the daughter-in-law, etc.). Quite simply, the characters fail in this book. Nothing much happens except an old boyfriend from decades before her marriage shows up. The middle-aged woman spends some boring evenings with him and then decides she doesn't want to be with him anymore. And I guess she comes to some kind of quiet realization that she's content with the life she leads with this eccentric family. That's it in a nutshell. NOT worth the $... I spent... on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing","review":"While it was a quick read, I found that my mind was being merely occupied instead of stunned or challenged. The mopey main \\"Beck\\" makes only one stab at reclaiming her life - a half-hearted \\"I never asked anyone to call me Beck!\\" that is quickly overlooked by all around. Her children are all annoying and out there, and loose ends merely fly in the wind at the conclusion. Was there a climax in this novel because I missed it. More concretely - was there a point? What did Tyler SAY about life, humanity, love?? What greater comment did this novel make? Whatever she said, it could have been condensed to a chapter and then moved on to a story that went somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trudging through family get togethers","review":"If submitting yourself to incessant family get-togethers with irritating and self-centered family members sounds good to you, then this is the book for you! Let me add also the pleasure of listening to the whining of an obsessive people pleaser who never gets the guts to tell these people off and get on with her life. To be fair, it is not poorly written (have read some of her other books and enjoyed them) and there are some cute moments. But most definitely not worth the labour of having to read through."},{"rating":"1","title":"No AMATEUR MARRIAGE...","review":"I loved the last novel I read by Anne Tyler and came to this one with high hopes. Rebecca is such a dreary character. It's hard to believe that she started life as someone introspective, shy, serious and intellectually engaged. Someone like that couldn't possibly be turned into the hectoringly cheerful, incurious and silly person she became in this book. Even her inner life, when she finally allows herself one, is flat and banal. I am going to finish this novel in a few pages, but spending time with Beck has been a drag. (And Poppy doesn't help one bit.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I found this book to be a very slow read. It was very difficult to identify with the \\"issues\\" of the lead character. I could not summon sympathy for her.... I felt frustrated with the way she handled the chaos around her. Even the brief romantic possibility was boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is boring.","review":"This is a story that starts nowhere and goes nowhere. Lots of characters, but no one that really plays any kind of an important role. I kept reading and reading thinking that any time now, things would pick up. Well, there's a short half-gasp, then things go back into the nauseating tedium of the life of Rebecca Davitch. Pretty much a waste of 9 hours.Want to read a really good book?

I wish teachers would find another book to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking work makes critical theory accessible to all.","review":"Lois Tyson's \\"Critical Theory Today, A User-Friendly Guide\\" has profoundly changed the way I understand and experience literature. All the various lenses of current theories are lucidly and brilliantly brought into focus in a personable yet scholarly manner. An exciting must read for all those who love to read. It gives voice and consciousness to all the disparate sensibilities one has while reading. Important issues of psychology, class, gender, race, orientation among others are presented. The chapter on deconstruction made me laugh out loud with enjoyment while the feminist and African-American chapters brought into chilling focus the distance yet needed to be traveled for balance and equality. I will never be quite finished with Ms.Tyson's book for I will be referring to it for years to come as a truly user -friendly guide through literature, theater, cinema and all the cultural constructs I encounter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lit theory guide like no other","review":"I bought this book for a lit theory class I was taking. I loved it. I have come across many anthologies promising the same succinct and comprehensive explanation of major theories. The theories explained, albeit from an irregular order (starting from psychoanalysis, not new historicism), give newcomers a great intro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking media seriously","review":"Prof. Tyson's text is a worthy companion to Mcluhan, Chomsky and even Joseph Campbell. The idea that one can find a \\"skeleton key\\" for literature is certainly not a new one, but forging your own key has become deliciously less difficult now that Lois Tyson's book is available. Don't like The Great Gatsby, that's okay, apply lit. theory to any available piece of writing, music, art...anything. That's the beauty of the whole process of critical discernment. The question of \\"what makes good art?\\" is always relevant, and now a substantial answer may be esier to come by. I return to this book every time I encounter a new concept in psych., sociology, philosophy...it applies to everything. Literature is only the begining."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Yello beat goes on","review":"Yello has become a bit more modern in this latest album, but that's not a bad thing. They have now incorporated a great deal of techno in this album. This is a great piece of work for fans of dance and Yello. Every track just makes you want to move. Especially the track \\" Move, Dance, Be Born\\", which is argueably the best track on the album. Both \\"Tremendous Pain\\" and \\"DO IT\\" have their own singles. This is a great album and definitely shows the versatility of Boris Blank and Dieter Meyer. They continue to astound and impress.

BBC's Wish me luck is another much better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Santana's worst album?","review":"I find this album unlistenable, due to the cheesy synth sound prevalent in every track. Carlos' guitar playing is quite good, but the overall sound is one of synthetic 80's blandness, more appropriate to a New Age radio playlist. Vocals lack any of the soul of earlier Santana recordings. I'm selling my copy of this CD, and couldn't find a single track that I really wanted to extract and keep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Rip Fest","review":"With the exception of Angles All Around Us and Make Somebody Happy this CD is Top notch all the way. The musicianship is first rate From the guitars,drums and keyborads it does not get much better than this,absolute perfection. The sound is excellent and Carlos shows that he is the man. Shreeding everyone in his path. For a prompt lesson in guitar playing try Toussaint L'overture and Guajra on for size. These licks are hands down the best around in Rock, Jazz or Classical. The bass playing while not monstorous is worthy of mentioning also, solid imaginative and dynamic. This CD is better than Supernatural, so if you enjoy that one listen to this, the best Live recording to come out in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best spy/mystery book I ever read","review":"Since other reviewers described very accurately the plot and the tone of the novel, I skip that part. I also consider this novel a very scary novel because anyone person can be in place of Graham [the main character]. The difference between this novel and the others where an innocent man is accused or chased by the criminals or the police is that the people who are trying to kill him have a legitimate and convincing [from their point of view] reason to kill him. And this is where the suspense comes from. I consider this and the and a few of Le Carre's novels to be the best spy novels of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story but a bit shallow","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author. It deals with a little known (to American audiences) period of WW2, during a sort of \\"lull\\" in the fighting, before the Germans really cranked into action with the Blitzkrieg. The protagonist is a naval armaments engineer who because of his expertise becomes a target for assassination. The basic plot is fine, but the twists and turns seem a bit contrived. The characters and story line aren't developed enough to suit me which probably explains the shortness of the book (only 243 pages). Another 100 pages would probably have made it a better book if they were done right. Some of the characters add little to the movement (Josette for example) and just become side dalliances.Having said all this, I certainly intend to read more works by this author.

His back digs intot he plastic piece in the middle and when i release the bottom part of them hammock he slips into water.

And only their little tushes were in the water, leaving me to constantly try to keep the rest of their body warm. The pillow also would get very cold. Without the hammock they keep slipping off that seat and can't seem to get comfortable at all. Then, we they are old enough to sit well, the dang seat is too small. At every stage, this tub has been a disappointment.

Fisher Price really put thought into how the tub looks. When my son was an infant it was great. Perfect in fact, but he reached 25 inches at 2& 1/2 months. Too big for the sling & not old enough to have total head control. I took out the sling & wow what a horrible time. I had to hold him the WHOLE time. It was horrible. Half his body stuck out of the back of the tub. Keep in mind you can't lay them down cause there is that hump there. I did call Fisher Price & they had me send it back & gave me a voucher for anything else I'd like to get. so in all it wasn't that bad. I got another tub the Safety First & so far so good.

I was very impressed when I was able to put him in the sling and he could lay there very comfortably. The support of the sling allows babies back side to stay warm in the water, but he is not going to slip down in it. It is also much easier to use than trying to bathe a slippery newborn while holding them.Now that he is about 3 months old, the bump in the middle of the tub was hitting his back. So we have taken the sling down on one end. He sits in the seat portion with the head rest of the sling and loves that he can splash and play.

The sling gets really cold which of course is not good for the baby, the pillow is slippery and awkward, and the bump in the middle of the tub underneath the sling can dig into the babies back. My daughter did not look or act comfortable in this tub. I agree with an earlier review that it is \\"not very functional\\". The only thing I liked about it was the cute wash cups...thats it. Since I can't take it back, maybe it will be better once my daughter can sit up on her own. I would definitely not use this for infants again!

So the whole time I was bathing him he was cold. Also my son is a pretty big baby and the sling sunk and his back was resting on the edge of the plastic that holds a sitting baby from slipping down so it was very uncomfortable for him. I tried to take the sling off and the seat position would only work for a baby who could sit upright."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Thought I would Be Able To Use This Longer.","review":"I bought this for my baby and thought it was awesome until she outgrew the sling which didn't take long at all. She cannot sit up on her own yet which means the tub is absolutely useless. I am throwing this out and buying something else. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in the beginning","review":"This product was great with our daughter being a newborn and worked well when she was not at the point of sitting up. Now it is difficult to have her in the tub since she is just becoming able to sit up on her own. When she lays back she starts to slip down and the tub is not supportive enough for her to sit up by herself. I definately think its is great for newborns and younger infants but around the time my daughter turned 5 months the tub was not what she needed and we had to buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Poor Design","review":"This tub is the worst infant tub I have ever used. When my daughter was a newborn the sling would keep her out of the water to where she would get cold easily. She also wasn't able to stay in the sling for more than a couple months because the tub has a plastic bar that would dig into her back. When I attempted to put her in the tub without the sling, leaning against the back of the tub, she would flop all over the place and the height of the lip of the tub came to just the right level for my three month old daughter to hit her head when she would try to sit up and then lay back again. I would not recommend this tub to anyone. It should be taken off the market. Don't waist your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bathtub for babies up to 9 months...","review":"I was given this bathtub for a baby shower gift, and I loved it. The sling worked great for the first couple months until my daughter was too heavy for it, and by then she was ready to move to the reclining slope. Later when she was able to sit unsupported on her own, I could turn her around to the larger side. She is now 10 months old, and although I am still using this tub (it's been so convenient and easy on my back when place in our shower stall), it's not really deep enough and she wants to climb out of it now that she's discovered she can do that. She doesn't seem ready to be in the regular bathtub just yet, so I'm now looking for something bigger and deeper that would be a good transition tub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tub!","review":"Our daughter has used this tub since her first day home at 4 pounds and the tub has made bathing her very easy even that small! Now that she is bigger, (5 months old, 11 pounds) she still uses the sling and we love that the pillow moves up to cushion her head and the plastic divider below supports her tushie. I suggest always drying out the tub/sling after each bath by squeezing out excess water from the pillow and turning tub over to air dry. We have never had any problem with mildew (like some users) because we always dry out the tub between baths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aquarium Bath for tiny babies only...","review":"I am just writing to say that I LOVED this tub until my baby was 2 months, and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere. Also, the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out...wet Mommy and Daddy! So it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we'll use it when she can sit up, but I'm thinking we'll just use the big tub when she can sit up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I bought this item before the baby was born, not knowing how big it actually was. It is too big and awkward to bathe our baby in the bathroom with this tub, so we have to do it in the kitchen. She hates it and therefore I hate it and have decided not to even use it any more! Invest in something a little more comfortable for your baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tub!","review":"I have used this tub from the time my grandchild was first born through to her first birthday, so far. It is absolutely excellent in growing with your child. It took me awhile to understand what it already said in the instructions - not to put too much water in when they are little. If you do, the baby easily slips. But there is still enough water to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Waste of Money!!","review":"This tub may be okay for the first two weeks of baths but don't waste your money. The back of the tub is raised...or has a ledge. Your baby is suppose to sit on it once they get a tab bit bigger. Then once you try to put your baby in the water you have this akward ledge in their back...because you baby can't sit up at that point. I would have to hold my arm behind my baby so it wouldn't be in his back. After using this tub four months I had it! I bought another tub. If I had it to do over again, Safety 1st made a great newborn tub and I would have went with that one. TRUST ME! DON'T BUY IT, YOU WILL REGRET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work well for us","review":"We bought the whole rainforest line which is so cute but this just didn't work out for us. From the get go the hammock part never supported our son. His back would hit ackwardly on the hard plastic bump below meant for use with older babies. No matter how tight we got the straps he still sunk too far down. He was 7lbs 9 oz. when he was born and we've been using this since his cord fell off. He is just now at 2 months 10 lbs. so weight was not the issue. We've now tried a couple of times without the hammock attachment. It's better but still not great. He seems to slip side to side and it does seem pretty short, water spills over the back when we try to rinse his head. I wouldn't reccommend this tub. There may be better options but I say save your money for other things and do like we do, my husband takes him in the shower with him and he loves it :). We won't be trying any others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be","review":"I got this for my first baby thinking it looked so cute and came with extra toys and accessories. As some other reviewers have said, it was fine for the newborn stage. When it was time to use it without the hammock, the tub became fairly useless. It's very shallow and my son could almost roll out the side when he leaned over. Additionally, there is some assembly required. The piece that holds it onto the side of the sink has to be screwed on and it was always a little wobbly because of the way the screws went into the plastic.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better tubs out there.","review":"This is my second tub I have tried... first off, its only $30 at wal-mart, so if you're still interested, buy it there.There are a few problems with this tub:First, the pillow is useless- you can't wash the baby's hair when the pillow is there, and if you flip it up, it falls back down in the baby's face. I had to cut it off.Second, as the baby gets bigger and you still need to use the sling, her back hits the seat below and hurts her. I had to hold her up with one hand and bathe her with the other.So, I tried using the tub without the sling. She is only 2 months, but can lay it the tub/seat just fine. The only problem is that it doesnt seem comfortable for her, and her head rests higher than the seat, which means when I wash her hair, the water doesn't flow into the tub, but onto the counter instead.This tub only worked well for the first few weeks. Now I am off to find another!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like it!","review":"I just got this tub and our 2 month old loves it! Whenever he's crabby at night I just fill this up and he stops crying as soon as he lays in it. He looks so comfy and he could just fall asleep in it. He doesn't slip around either so I don't have to worry so much. The only problem I have is that when it drains the soap builds up on the sling part, but I just spray it off with the faucet sprayer and wash it after every few baths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother of two","review":"The main problem with this tub is exactly as the previous review describes... the protruding bump. I owned the tub that preceded this model but it was designed to include that bump. The purpose of the bump is to hold the baby in place when the baby outgrows the baby sling. When the baby is in the sling, they slide down and that hard plastic bump is right in the middle of the baby's back. You will have to keep picking the baby up and sliding her up to get that uncomfortable plastic out of their back. When I used this tub in the toddler position, the part of the tub where my son's back sits isn't rounded and began to leave a red mark on his back after every bath, which eventually grew into a bruise-like mark. The tub only gets points for looking good but find another tub!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"This tub might be ok for newborns and older children but for the infant stage which is the longest it is terrble. The sling only gets secured to the top and when the whole thing gets wet it gets big and stretches out- causing baby to slide, causing their back to rest on the pertruding \\"bump\\" in the middle of the tub.Its going back- tried it twice and it was not a positive bathing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new bathtub!","review":"We had a first years tub for our two older sons, but when Fisher Price came out with the Aquarium tub, we just had to get it. It cost $30, which is more than the other tubs, but well worth the money. This tub can go from birth to 2 yrs old. A good stretch of time for baby growing into different stages of life. Love the fish design and the hammock. The attached cups are good too for rinsing the soap off or just letting your baby play and have some fun. It is not a compact tub, but smaller than some of the other huge 4 in 1 tubs. Overall another great product made by Fisher Price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!!!","review":"Everyone knows how awkward it is to bathe an infant, so the sling on this tub is what had me sold. Boy was I wrong! My son screamed in this tub. The sling got very cold once it was wet(not to mention there was a \\"bump\\" in the middle of the tub that dug into my son's back). It took us using it only once to determine that this tub will not work out...what a waste of money! I have learned that the items with all the bells and whistles are usually not worth the money spent. We are now using a very basic sponge-type bather that sits in the tub and stays very warm. Now I get nothing but sweet smiles during bath time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, infant through toddler","review":"I used the sling for a tiny bit, but found that the seat holds the baby in place quite well. When he could sit up on his own, I just let him sit in the bottom portion of the tub, where he could splash and play. We didn't really use the toys, but the tub itself is perfect. Later we got a tub from IKEA, which he loved until we let him go free in the big tub, but we loved this one while we used it. We had a cheaper tub for the first month or so, and he was constantly sliding down the seat into the water, and freaking out. As soon as we got this, he loved taking a bath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but could be better.","review":"The removable insert is great for the newborn but I'm finding with using it in the bathtub it is difficult to drain the water out without having to lift the entire tub. Maybe drain should be on the side or inset just a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It","review":"So Verry Good Product From Fisher Price,I Love It.So Verry Good Product From Fisher Price,I Love It."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst bath ever.","review":"When my son was newborn, it was really awkward to bathe him in this... bathing him in just the tub or sink was way easier. Now that he's six months, the bump just marks up his back and I still prefer just putting him in the tub or sink. I'm donating this tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"F-Price I give you an F+ for this horrible tub design!","review":"Just like everyone stated, I will state again...My baby kept sliding down on the soft sling and I would have to continuously keep moving my baby up so that the plastic bump wouldn't be on his back. I only put up with the tub because I received it as a baby shower gift and I live in Tahoe where there aren't many options for shopping. When my baby turned 5mons I took out the sling part and let him sit in the tub while I held him. He's now 6mons and can totally sit on his own. The tub color is the only nice feature about this tub. Look for something better. I hear IKEA has a whale tub that's fabulous.Fisher-Price what the hell where you thinking on this design? Thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tub so far!","review":"I started using this tub as soon as my son's umbilical cord fell off. The sling worked perfectly to lay him deep enough in the water to be warm, but not be totally submerged. I realize what other reviewers are referring to when they talk about a \\"bump\\", however my baby has never seemed to feel discomfort from it. He loves his baths and is perfectly content to hang out in the sling as long as the water is warm. He is now three months old and I still put him in the sling, although I will probably transition him out of it soon. I use this tub inside my bathtub so to drain it I just turn it over and dump the water, I don't mess with the plug. This tub does come with several toys, but I haven't used them yet. Overall this tub serves its purpose and keeps my baby safe and cozy while he's in the bath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for big babies","review":"My almost 5 month old is in the 100% for height and weight - so she is a big girl. I bought this tub because she is too big to fit in the bathroom sink. She cannot yet sit up on her on, so I needed something with support. I thought this would be perfect...but its not. She is too big for the Level 2 side - where she can sit on the little shelf and recline. And she can't totally sit up on her own in the tub side. This tub also slides all over the bathtub, so now I have to hang on to the baby and to the tub just to try to get her clean. Its gotten to the point where the baby will just scream bloody murder when she is on the shelf side. Last night was better because I tried to prop her up on the other side, but it didn't work that well either. If you have a small baby, I'm sure this tub is fine. But, with a larger sized baby, it does not work at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy Nor My Son !!! whats with the bump","review":"My Newborn baby(who came long and about 8 pounds) dropped in the sling to the bottom hitting the stupid bump and when we remove the sling the stupid bump made it 'again' hard for us to adjust our son in the tub , this tub is not right for you if ur baby isn't small or tiny !We are not pleased with this tub Surely because of the BUMP!! it might be a good tub if the remove the bump and change the quality of the sling to make tighter so it will be much safer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great....for a couple of weeks!","review":"This tub worked fine when my baby could sit in the sling, but the sling only holds up to 10 pounds! Once he got too heavy, he was sinking down and his back was on the hard ledge and he was extremely uncomfortable. Now I have to try to balance him on this shallow ledge, which he is constantly sliding off of-I have to catch him slipping into the water and re-position him over and over. It makes bathtime very frustrating for both of us; I'm going to have to buy another tub because I can't deal with this until he starts sitting up.Common sense dictates that you should never turn your back on a baby in the bath, but with this tub, your baby could kick or squirm and be in the water in a fraction of a second. I feel this tub is downright dangerous to use with an infant over 10 pounds who can't sit up on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small and weird bump","review":"I got this tub for our newborn. He came out long and big so the sling just drops to the bottom. we remove the sling and he looks so uncomfortable with the bump right in the middle. His head was above the tub lying down as well. This is probably great for a smaller baby. We used it twice and ordered the whale tub which has a removable bump so he can use it longer. He is now 8 months and we are still using it with the bump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for newborn and sitting infant...not for inbetween!","review":"Loved this at first using the sling with my newborn. Up until he weighed too much for the sling(10 1/2 lbs). The \\"bump\\" in the bottom of the tub proved to be a huge problem. It is supposed to support them after they outgrow the sling but it sits them too high up and his head would bob back & forth. We soon retired the tub soon after we bought it. Very unsatisfied with this purchase. He now happily takes his bath on a big towel in regular tub with couple inches of water. Splashes and kicks to his delight. Wish I could have saved the money buying this fisher price tub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tub","review":"I love this tub. Our little boy is a \\"water baby\\" and loves bath time. The sling comes in handy for the newborn stage, but after that I took it out. The little \\"seat\\" in the middle is great for giving him a little indepedance in the tub without me having to hold him up. (Always keep a hand on baby though!

The ledge that the baby sits on only fit him when he was very young (only a few weeks), after that, he was sitting too high up in the tub and wasn't down in the water enough, or he would kick around so that the ledge was in the middle of his back. I ended up giving this away and buying another tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next time I would not buy it","review":"Fisher-Price Aquarium Bath CenterI used it but I must agree when baby was getting older (4-5 months) it became very clear that it was not the best choice.

Brainless stupid creator!","review":"Whoever created this item needs their head examined. I am a grandmother 64 yrs old, and have given lots of infants a bath in my lifetime. There is a plastic hump in the middle of this aquarium tub. So even if you put the infant on top of the hammock, the infant's back HITS this hard plastic hump underneath it. Another thing: having an infant high up away from warm water is going to make the infant cry from being so cold! So if you are going to wash your infant using this hammock, be prepared to support the infant's back with one hand while washing it with the other hand with a screaming baby! Even if you take the hammock off, where do you put an older infant 3 months old? The whole contraption is a pile of junk. Just buy a regular infant body sponge and a regular oval plastic tub to wash your infant in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I agree with the earlier reviews.

Buyers beware of this tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for 1 month, terrible after that","review":"This was great for baths for the first month when he would fit in the sling. Starting at 2 months old he was too big for the sling but the \\"seat\\" or whatever the bump is under the sling was completely useless for him. If we had the sling attached at the bottom his feet would get caught on the edge and his back sunk down into the bump. If we detached the bottom two straps of the sling then first of all it just got in the way and either he would lie with the bump in his back or he would be 90% out of the water with his head above the headrest."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift","review":"I bought this tub for my friend for her new born baby and she really liked it.

My daught is 5 months now and we have been usung it without the hammock part for about 2 months now but she is too big for it.

I DO however like the Fisher Price whale of a tub, THAT one does have a removable bummp that sits lower inside the tub, so the baby is in warm water and is much happier.

However, out of all the single releases carrying the Halo label to be released, none has ever been as much as a rip-off as \\"Survivalism, Part 1\\". Featuring the \\"Year Zero\\" album version as well as the Tardusted Remix (which actually may be better than the normal track), \\"Survivalism\\" as a whole isn't a bad song one bit, and this rating does not reflect the song itself. Besides the two versions of the song, there is nothing else included on this disc at all. That's right, and remember, there is also a \\"Survivalism, Part 2\\" that features all of the above plus more, so if you haven't gotten the drift yet, you are getting ripped off. As a previous reviewer already mentioned, no matter how much of a die hard Nine Inch Nails fan or Halo collector you might be, do not pick this disc up.

The music is jazzy and mellow, but I tend to prefer downtempo that is more layered, either with electronic sounds (Royksopp, Bent) or world-influenced elements (Thievery Corp.). Like much of the downtempo music currently available, the tracks on this album blend together in a way that is ultimately very forgettable.So I'm wondering, why is this album RECOMMENDED on almost every other downtempo-related album's site on Amazon? Do yourself a favor and DO NOT purchase this album unless you have had the chance to pre-listen to several of the tracks first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you like Thievery and K&D","review":"I've been listening to a lot of downtempo electronic music for years and this one is my new favorite. It's jazzier than either K&D or Thievery Corporation but in a really good way. It has just enough of a be-bop flavor especially \\"14 Carat\\" Songs like \\"Creeper\\" actually remind me a little of Peace Orchestra and all of them seem to have one or two elements that are irresistable. Great beats, a lot of acoustic bass and trippy sound effects makes for great listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great","review":"This mailbox looks great and was easy to install.

Everything, and I mean everything about this band is exeptio-nal; from the art-work, the produktion, the lyrics to the music, this is genious! Those who claim that black metal is nothing but frantic noise, should listen to this album; Hellhammer's ultra-fast, yet complex drumming lays down the heavy foundation, Carl August Tidemann's hypnotic, dizzying guitar-outbursts creates the melodic element, Steinar Sverd's keyboard-wizardry shrouds the music in a mist of mystique, and as icing on the cake, Garm goes over the top with a vocal performance that treads a fine line between genious and insanity, which fit the lyrical content perfectly. They even get away with incorporating flute, violin, cornet, viola, cello and double-bass flawlessly, without sounding cheesy! Okay, the music is extremely pretentious, theatrical, symphonic and larger than life, but when it's done this consistent all is forgiven!"},{"rating":"2","title":"..........","review":"Am I listening to music or getting a glimpse of the whiter side of oblivion? Ambience at its most beautiful. Vanity given a soundtrack. That's what this is. Never since Tool has a band conjured up such intriguing imagery in my subconscious. This is real talent. Forget Yngwie Malmsteen, master of parlor tricks. Buy this....Your soul will thank you. And try to ignore the fact they got pigeonholed as black metal, that's just a term a certain magazine that's very high in popularity which shall remain nameless likes to use to poke fun at genres they don't understand. Arcturus are truly an inspiring thing. Listen with an opened mind. And, in the words of Timothy Leary \\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\\". Also check out Spock's Beard and Tiamat. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Metal with technical differences","review":"Even though Arcturus is a black metal band, in this record they mix their music with techno and progressive.

Their previous album was hailed as an amazing black metal album. With \\"La Masquerade Infernale\\", the fans were expecting something along the similar vein of Aspeira....ohhh were they wrong. This is music for a carnival in Satan's playground. If you are open minded about metal music, and enjoy a challenging listen, this is the record for you. It goes from insane carnival esque (\\"The Chaos Path\\") to Edgar allan Poe (\\"Alone\\")Listen with open ears and an open mind"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, magnificent and immaginatve","review":"It's the fourth time I have listened to this album and it get's better every time. I would not dare describe it as \\"Black Metal\\", but it is metal, in a very refined form. There's a bluring, a contact with so many different styles, and yet, it all remains full of energy and technical mastery. Way better than Hellhammer's Mayhem in the musical context, more variety than in any of Garm's Ulver albums, yet very accesible and with the same patos. I think it could be called a classic, much in the context of works by Celtic Frost and Therion. Buy it and enjoy it in awe. If you don't like, maybe there's something wrong with your stereo, or even worse, your brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Ordered...","review":"I just established an aquarium and wasn't sure what I wanted description wise-however picture wise this was EXACTLY what I needed to fix the problem I was having with a troublesome fish-it was also a cue I was taking from other tank owners when it came to aggressive fish. However when the product arrived it was not at all what was in the picture. Now I have this useless item that will not fit on my uniquely designed tank-however my problem is still not fixed-hopefully this company plans on making things right as I see a lot of products I wouldn't mind purchasing-but will DEFINITELY forgo if my money isn't refunded and/or a new \\"SPECIMEN CONTAINER\\" for a 15-20 gallon tank arrives at my address.

This divider is easy enough to put together, slide the mesh into the two long side bars. Unfortunately, it comes out just as easily letting the fish you are trying to separate co-mingle again. I put this thing together 3 times and re-inserted it into the tank and finally gave up. Instead of sliding it into place on the side bars, the side bars need teeth and need to fold over to clamp onto the mesh so that it cannot slide out of place. Or some other solution needs to be developed, but this is not working for my tank. I feel like super-gluing the mesh into place but I don't know what that would do to the fish or if it would hold under prolonged underwater exposure. I am so frustrated and disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth what you get","review":"I had a lot of problems with this product and I ended up returning it anyway. Other than the poor service I received the main problem with the product I had was that the metal hooks forced the frame to stick up out of the aquarium too far that I couldn't put the hood back on. So really this product was useless for me anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Most Interesting Hit's Package","review":"I heard something about this band somewhere, so I picked this up around a year or so ago. While this hit's package is not terrible, it's not that good either. Most of the songs are forgettable and don't leave a big impression.

This is the fourth in the series, and in it we see Sarah's and Frank's relationship is progressing a bit further. We also have them trying to find out who killed an opportunistic woman. Sarah's neighbour, Mrs. Ellsworth's son looks like he's been set up to take the fall for the murder, and Sarah knows that he didn't do it. She enlists Frank's help to try to uncover who the real killer is. The plot is a bit predictable, but the characters are very likeable.

But I was hooked. I read the story almost straight through. While the prose wasn't perfect at first, the story was so good I honestly didn't notice once I got into it. The tension between the hero and heroine was fabulous and honestly one of the best portrayals of romantic tension I've read in awhile. The kisses were delicious and probably my favorite scenes. But there was so much more depth to the story than that. Truly! Plus, the suspense was awesome and very well done. The people felt like my friends long before the book ended. I truly cared about them and I think I fell in love with Slade, too. His characterization and growth was perfectly done! I loved this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves romantic suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good thing......","review":"I can honestly say the best thing about this album is that it's only 4 songs.

It sounded a lot better when I only listened to it only once. I think I'd rather listen to a beached whale. The singer is very \\"wanna be British\\". I wish the sound quality on this CD was better, it sounds like it was recorded in my basement. This band would be great for the backdrop in Britney Spears next movie.

Despite the fact I usually agreed with her political views, her soapbox-ranting style left me wanting a more eloquent spokesperson for her position. Much of the time, she simply comes off as a less thoughtful Dennis Miller.All of this would be bearable if she had some tiny shred of humility, but about the fourth time she assured me that she is, in fact, \\"a funny person,\\" I was ready to toss the tape out the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yech!","review":"It's too bad that a woman as smart as Whoopi Golberg has to use profanity just like it's used by street thugs and hoodies.

There is really no good reason for this band to exist. The amalgamation of noise I witnessed first hand on the Gigantour stop in Minneapolis had no sense of rhythm, melody, harmony or tempo, all key elements in any kind of music.

There are no hooks and every song almost sounds the same. Its pretty bland. I've already lost hope in them and think that this band is going to get raped by the scene.

Boring guitar riffs, hardly any pinch harmonics. No squealing, all just low boring guttural growls. This is definitely less talented than their Doom EP. They seem to scared to stray to far from just the Death Metal Genre.

Sometimes if you move the monitors around the room, the signal will briefly pick up, only to die again (the baby's room is right next to ours, so distance is not the issue).I am not one to complain about products much, but Graco is really selling a bill of goods on this one. The bottom line is, you might get lucky and it will work or work for awhile, but there is clearly a problem with battery life, range, and reception with this inferior product. If you spend $100 on a monitor, you deserve better quality and reliability. Don't make this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beep...Beep...Beep","review":"I usually don't take the time to write reviews, but I was so frustrated with this product that I felt obligated to save others from the same experience. The parent units constantly lose contact with the base unit resulting in a very annoying beep. I have tried everything to resolve (switching channels, moving other wireless electronics in the house, etc.) with no luck. Also, even when the parent unit indicates that it is working properly, there have been a couple of occasions when I did not hear the baby crying despite having the volume all the way up. I have another less expensive Graco monitor from my first child and had no problems, so this was a huge disappointment. I am returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than perfect","review":"At first we loved this monitor.1 It is small which is great!2 you can strap it to your arm and it vibrates.3 it lights up so you can \\"see\\" the soundDownsides1 it is so quite you almost have to wear it so it can vibrate.2 the reception is poor, even in our apt. which is small and good cell reception. In our inlaws trailer forget about the monitor!3the battery is not lasting as long as it did when we first bought it I would go for a monitor with two parent sets so we could swich without having to travel the charging base around.All in all we would have gotten something different we have been using this now for 7 months and are less than happy with it. We also picked it up at a baby store in Kelowna BC and paid way too much it was priced at nearly 200 dollars! So I am very upset to see it listed on amazon for way less! Lesson learned: shop online!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it until it broke!","review":"We bought this monitor because it is digital, which means no one else can pick up the signal and see and hear your baby. It worked great for a few months. One day the parent unit just quit working. I called Graco and they are going to give us a full refund. I am very disappointed because I love Graco products. I also love the idea of a digital video monitor. I guess I'm going to have to go in search of a new one from another manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this monitor","review":"This monitor has so much static and loses its connection so frequently (and then beeps loudly) that we sometimes just turn it off and have no monitor at all! So frustrating. It charges ALL DAY and still only gives us about an hour of time before it shuts off - insane! It has never worked properly and I wish I could return it but it was a gift. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great.","review":"This was not the first monitor that I purchased, and also wasn't the last. The sound was ok, but definitely not loud enough. I want to know that my baby is awake before she is in a full blown hysterical scream. The range was no better than a Sony that I tried which was rated up to 900 feet. Unfortunately, there are a lot of walls between the nursery and our bedroom, so we aren't getting anything even close to the ratings. We have an old model from Philips that we bought for my now 5 year old son, and we are borrowing it for our new baby until I can find a new one that works as well. No luck so far. I'm going to try the new model Philips/Avent monitor. Hopefully, it's as good a product as our old one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great monitor","review":"Very quiet monitor without the static. Also very lightweight and easy to carry around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Range is minimal","review":"I bought this monitor for my second child, after moving to a new house with a very large yard. I wanted to be able to be outside with my 3 year old and still hear the baby. The range is virtually non-existent. No where near 2000 feet. If you bought this monitor for that reason - return it. Otherwise, it works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't find link!","review":"This monitor worked ok at the beginning but after 1 month of use, the monitor keeps beeping saying the \\"link\\" has been dropped. we have tried changing the \\"channel\\" over and over and it still beeps trying to find a link. its very frustrating. we are going to try the sony model as our neighbors swear by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snap, CRACKLE & Pop","review":"When they were new 2 & 1/2 years ago they worked great with no issues noted. Eventually they started to develop this crackling sound which annoys the heck out of my wife and I. I have no idea why it does this. There is no interference that I can tell of.As for battery life, as others have said, over time the battery life has shortened. Go figure, we haven't used them off the charger extensively, which is weird.All said, if I was given the chance to purchase them again I would definitely steer clear. If you decide to purchase them, think about getting a warranty so you can exchange them with no problems down the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it stays connected but....","review":"Like several others have said- this was a great monitor with all the features we needed & it worked very well for several months after we bought it. However, it suddenly began to pop and click once in a while and other times it will disconnect for a few seconds and then reconnect *but not always.The size, weight, portablility and the recharging bases as well as the fact it can be turned down to hear no static - nothing but if the baby makes noises- are everything we wanted but my husband finally said tonight, \\"go find a better monitor before I throw this one out the window!\\"We have a tri-level, two cordless phones, wireless internet & live 30 feet from our neighbors. Our old FP Lights and Sounds worked well but was worn out after 12 years!Guess we are back to searching for a monitor that works in our house!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simpler is better","review":"We have the Graco Ultra Clear monitor and it has worked really well for us for over 3 years. With a new baby on the way, we thought we'd upgrade to the new technology. Oops. It turns out that the range on the new monitor was about half that of the Ultra Clear (couldn't even make it to the other side of the house), and the reception was quite poor. And the annoying beeping was the clincher. I sent it back today and bought another $40 Ultra Clear. Oh, and I tried the Fisher Price Private Connection also, and had the same issues..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't throw away your direction booklet!!!","review":"I understood that this was to be the best product becuase it was digital and crystal clear. When mine worked it was clear, but the problem I had was that the partent unit and the base unit would constantly loose connection with one another. This would happen nearly everday. I would reset the units just as the directions said, it would work for awhile and then loose connection again. The combination to reset the units was also confusing. Try reseting at 3am. I went back to the cheaper monitors because I hear everything just as good and I don't have to worry about loosing connection at 3am and not hearing my baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity at its finest.","review":"We purchased this when our daughter was born in October 2010. we keep the base and both receivers on 24/7, and have since she was born. We have one parent unit on the nightstand and one parent unit in the kitchen, both sit in their cradle charging in order to stay constantly on. We are able to take the kitchen unit outside with us when needed and the battery seems to last at least a few hours at minimum, we rarely ever get the battery low warning.The best part about this product is ZERO static and great range. We have lots of wireless devices in the house and there is absolutely zero static coming through the receivers, crystal clear.The units can vibrate if you want, they have a visual (LED) warning system and obviously audio. Not much to it, but it does what it is supposed to, and it does it well.No issues here after almost a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graco Digital Deluxe Baby Monitor $65","review":"I purchased this monitor so that I could monitor someone at night time. The baby unit was placed near the bed of the elderly person and I had the parent unit in a stationary spot next to my bed. The unit is supposed to work up to 2000 feet away. The units were only about 100 feet away in two separate bedrooms. The parent unit kept switching between green(working) and red(not working). When it wasn't working it would occasionally make three loud beeping noises. I tried moving the parent unit all over the room and it only worked if I had it near the door but too far away for me to hear if I was in a deep sleep. I am returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible static and handheld batteries die after 1 hour.","review":"We purchased this for our first baby and have been using it for 18 months now. It has horrible static and the handheld receiver batteries die after 1 hour off of their charging base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great AT FIRST...","review":"We bought this for our first-born last February. It worked great at first, although the distance that it could \\"travel\\" never impressed us. After less than a year of using this, the cord that plugs into the base started not staying plugged in, it would fall out constantly. So multiple times a night we would have to go in to our sons room and re-adjust the machine in order to get the cord to stay plugged in. Would not recommend this monitor... especially for how expensive it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to agree, do not buy","review":"We bought this monitor when our daughter was born - it had very good range and the battary stayed charged for a couple of hours when off the cradle. WIthin a few months, the batteries did not stay charged for more than 10 minutes and the range was worse. Now (2 yrs later) it has terrible range (off or on the cradle) and will not stay charged for more than 3 minutes. I loathe it and will have to buy a new one for our new baby - silver lining. And, it was consumer reports top rated at the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well until used for 11 months","review":"We used this monitor nearly every day since we had our son 11 months ago. It had great range and no interference. However, the last few weeks, the battery began to die earlier and earlier (It usually lasted a couple of hours before needing charged.) Now, it sits on it's charging base and still will not charge, rendering it useless. I gave this two stars because, for the price that we paid, it was not worth the money - even though it has lasted us 11 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hated this monitor!","review":"registered for this, and it was great for the first couple of months that i used it. the range was good and the sound quality was excellent.however, by the time my daughter was 1, i had gotten rid of it. it just go worse and worse as time went on. there was a crackling sound that had to with the monitor plug that would wake me up multiple times a night, it was almost always 'out of range' (even from just 1 room away), and the vibe thing wasn't all it was cracked up to be (for me anyway). an absolute waste of money, especially since it was NOT cheap! i had hoped to be albe to use it for several years, but it didn't even make it through one. would loved to have been able to return it, but it'd been too long. i'm looking for another monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Withstandt the Test of Time","review":"Was good for the first few months and then started losing battery power. Then at about a year, stopped working completely. With a new baby coming we are having to buy a brand new monitor. We will probably be forking out a little extra money this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, bad range and battery life","review":"Because we live in a town house in the city, I thought a digital review would be the way to go. It works fine in our 1,200 SF home, with no interference. However, the monitor has two major drawbacks. First, the battery life does not last 8 hours, which is a problem if the monitor is off the base, you're sleeping, and it starts to beep LOUDLY. The second major problem is that the monitor has terrible range. Visiting family in their larger country homes, the monitor would lose its signal with the base if there were more than a couple of walls that it had to travel through. I am now shopping for a new monitor that will give us the range that we need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and your sanity","review":"this item as come very close to being thrown out the window in our house! The range is quite poor and is constantly beeping when it loses a signal, range varies due to walls and/or doors and not neccessarily distance. Battery life poor which leads to more incessant beeping....beep, beep, beep. I've heard more beeping from this unit than I've heard my baby making noise. The belt clip is useless also, constantly falling off. Very irritating device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! Buy Something Else!","review":"This is the 2nd set of monitors we had because our original Fisher Price Lights n Sounds died after about 18 months. We thought we'd try something new so we bought these. I really regret it. They never keep a charge, they never pick up the sounds from my 2 year olds room and they are always staticy and beeping!. I'm just grateful I bought these for an older child instead of an infant, because I would have never heard a baby on these things- they are constantly turning themselves off. We are expecting our 2nd baby and are on our 3rd monitor system, having bought the Fisher Price Private Connection monitors a month ago. I would hightly recommend them, they even have a battery back up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEEP, BEEP, BEEP","review":"I was so excited about this monitor and it has been a disappointment - I can't figure out if it is the range or the battery but it beeps all the time. I am going to call today to see how amazon can help to get us either a replacement or a different monitor. Very disappointed so far based on the cost - but hopefully amazon will offer resolution - TBD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Reception/Horrible Battery","review":"The reception is great and crystal clear but the lifespan of the battery after overnight recharge is absolutely horrible....I get maybe three hours before the unit starts beeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad battery or bad monitor?","review":"Never holds a charge, even when plugged in. If it would run on AC power, I wouldn't even care, but it only uses the AC power to charge the battery off of which it operates. Look at the other monitors before you choose this one. I'm throwing mine away and getting the Uniden phone system which come with a room/baby monitor feature instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries in BOTH parental units were DOA?!?","review":"I'm a big fan of Graco products, but this was my first purchase of an electronic Graco product, and I am thoroughly disappointed.Following the instructions provided, I plugged the bases for both parental units into functional wall outlets. I was immediately concerned that neither unit's charging light came on, and tried several other outlets (all verified as working properly). However, the charging lights never came on. I left the bases plugged in for the 16 hours recommended for the initial charge but... long story short, neither rechageable battery pack was capable of carrying a charge. So, the monitor works if I am willing to operate off of AC power OR use dispoable batteries.I find it hard to believe that a quality company like Graco would ship a product without better QA. Anyway, I plan to try to my luck with ANOTHER company's monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I must have gotten a lemon","review":"I think this is the worst monitor in the history of monitors. I wake up several times every night because it starts beep, beep, beeping.... because it has lost it's signal. If I type at my computer ( I guess because I am in the way of the monitor or something), it goes off again, losing its signal. It drives me nuts! It works about 70% of the time, and I have been hesitant to go and buy another one because consumer reports says this is as good as it gets... so I don't want to go and spend even more money on a monitor that works even less than the one I already have. I give this product two HUGE thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I looked at many different products for monitoring the noises on the inside of my barn from my house. I am extremely pleased with this monitor. I keep one upstairs and one downstairs. My barn is approximately 400 feet from my house. The monitors go through the barn door the multiple doors and walls with clarity. If I turn the volume all the way up my family complains. I have to turn it down on low. We can still hear the horses chewing hay, buckets banging and even the cat meowing. When I'm in the barn working, I can even call to one of my children to come out and finish a chore they forgot to do. The monitors come with chargers and back up batteries. It gives me piece of mind should something go wrong. I have a smoke detector installed in the barn and now I will hear it if it ever goes off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible beeping!!!!!","review":"This is such a terrible product. I bought because of the GRACO brand and was very dissapointed. The range is not good, lots of static and although my baby sleeps at night we cannot because of the constant beeping, it seems it looses signal or something and it wakes us up. The batteries did not last very long of the base unit and now they will not resist more than 30' off the base. BUY SOMETHING ELSE, WE WILL!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some serious flaws","review":"The sound quality is very good. That being said we have 2 problems. 1) it seems the parent units have to have almost a direct line of sight with minimal walls and doors between to get good signal. 2) if power is lost in the home the child unit does not turn back on automatically so both parent units will be beeping because they can't find the base. HUGE problem at 3am. For a tiny infant you can sneak in and turn the base back on, but as my son got older this was not practical. Very disappointing. We ended up just getting rid of the monitor. I could not even bring myself to sell it because the problems with loss of power were so bad I did not want to put another parent though that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"I love this monitor. It is nice to have the dual set and not have to replace the batteries all of the time since it has chargers. I have not had any problems picking up my neighbor's phone/monitor conversations like I have with other products in the past. Great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Range is more like 200 feet not 2000 feet","review":"The range is not close to 2000 feet.Our toddler was sleeping and we took the receivers outside so that we could visit our next door neighbor's backyard and it lost reception about 200 feet. We even put the monitor in the window and it still didn't get the reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money, not reliable","review":"This monitor is supposed to give you a warning of when it needs to be back on the charger. This warning never happened, and it just shut itself off automatically. I did not hear my 7 month old crying. I will have to live with seeing his beat red face hysterical with tears when I went to check on him. THIS IS NOT A RELIABLE PRODUCT IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money, don't bother","review":"We bought this monitor and are only able to use it inside of our house, it looses the signal once we step outside of the house to get the mail or work in the yard. We live in a new residential area with no known interferences. Our cheaper monitors work better and have better range. We purchased this monitor for the range and quality purposes and it is basically useless and we are out of our 30 day return policy so we are now stuck with it. We DO NOT recommend this monitor at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This works wonderfully for us. We can keep one parent unit in the kitchen and one in the bedroom so we can always hear the baby. It's also nice that I can talk to my husband in the kitchen while I'm feeding the baby in the nursery in case I need something. We have a wireless network in our house and we have had no interference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible range, annoying beeps","review":"I will chime in with those commenting on the annoying beeps. It definately does not have the range it claims to have. It loses connection to the base all night long and beeps when it does. You have to set it just so to keep it from beeping. And we cannot keep it next to the bed because of the static. I hate this thing. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"At first this monitor seemed great. But the battery died after about a year and no one sells replacement batteries. Graco advertises the battery as being rechargable but it really isn't. I cant even use the monitor on its base. The monitor is completely useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Range, Clear Strong Signal, Great Monitor","review":"We have had this for about a year and we love it. Like any rechargable item, the batteries don't last as long anymore but that can be expected.We brought this on an extended family vacation and stayed in cottages which were spread out. We went from our cottage with the monitor to my parent's cottage which was about a football field away and in the woods. We were surprised that it worked even though it would only work by the front window of thier cottage. It worked is the point.We live in a good size, two-story house and can't complain about it ever not working. There are times when it looses signal and beeps but it usually reconnects pretty quickly.If you are looking for a constant perfect connection with your sleeping baby you better sit within five feet of him/her and don't move. If you are looking for the best monitor on the market (all of which have known limitations) then this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I hoped","review":"We bought this at the suggestion of a friend, and we liked it from the beginning. It is very easy to use, and it picked up every sound from the nursery. After a few days of use, this proved to be more of a bad thing than good. Every time our baby even rolls over in the crib, we can hear the rustling of the sheets. And even at the lowest volume setting, the bright lights flash and wake us up.After 8 months, both parent units are crackling with interference on a constant basis. And they both lose their signal from the transmitter and start beeping incessantly even when they are only one room away.We are looking to buy a new monitor now. This one is now unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy - This Thing Will BEEP BEEP You To Death!","review":"If you want to sleep through the night or during the night do NOT buy this Graco imonitor Digital Baby Monitor.

With different BEEPS....one tone for adjusting the volume and a different LOUDER tone (consisting of FOUR beeps) when it temporarily loses contact after adjusting the volume. What the HECK!!??!!

Let me just say that I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy and I had been waiting for this for a while. Wow, was I disappointed. I only made it through the first half an hour and that was unbearable. This movie is just like every other new movie out there. With fart jokes, kids getting high, and the odd kid out being picked on. The death scenes I saw were awful. Everything seemed rushed and the sets looked terrible. I couldn't take anymore and turned it off. I'm glad I rented it and didn't buy it. Really glad. I wouldn't even make my worst enemy watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keepaway Camp","review":"I own the Sleepaway trilogy and love the first film more than the two follow-ups.This entry in the series is a bit of a letdown, even considering the novelty of using some of the original actors from the first installment. Everything about this \`sequel' is obnoxious. It's loud; the characters/actors are all abrasive (there's no balance in that regard, what are the odds of everyone being thoroughly repellant?). The pacing is slow. The \\"villain\\" of this piece is obvious from the outset so trying to hide the identity was a wasted effort. The \\"kills\\" were few and far between and what passed as filler in the meantime were endless scenes of cruelty/bullying (meant to be funny?).The original concept worked, this trip down memory lane didn't. It's even more apparent when you watch all the films in one sitting. Not a keeper, not worth seeing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I own the first three installments of the film genre, with the first movie being the best, the other two not as good. Return to Sleepaway Camp disappoints in regards to the quality of acting, plot and a very poorly conceived finale with a very brief cameo appearance by the killer, Angela. To put it bluntly, the writers made a very low budget film and it showed considerably. Though some of the original cast from the first movie was brought back in, it wasn't enough to bring great reviews to the actors reading from a terrible script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepare for disappointment","review":"I found the original movies this was based on campy, funny, shocking, and Exploitative. Unfortunately, Return to summer camp contains none of these elements. OK.. maybe campy.. but not in the spirit of the originals. my message to the producers... become more familiar with you genre. This was a watchable movie, but hardly holds a candle to the originals. If you are going to remake an 80's horror exploitation film... then do that! Don't nerf a cult classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why God why!?!?!?!","review":"First off, let me say that I love a good cheesy horror movie. But this movie is a complete waste of time. First, Issac Hayes is only in the movie for about 2 minutes. Complete let down in that regard. Secondly, the \\"Alan\\" character is so over the top and annoying that you begin to cheer for the bullies and hope that he dies soon. And when he doesn't the auidence is left very unfullfilled. The other problem with this movie is that there is absoliutely no nudity in it. It is a horror movie that takes place at a camp and no one gets naked, I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggghhh,What a Waste of Money","review":"This movie sucked,Seriously I was very disappointed in this movie in all areas.It ruins the classic sleepaway camp movies.It followed the same story of Angela ,who use to be a man killing people at camp,but it was done in such a horrible way.I own all three slepaway camp movies,and I thought that this would be just as good or better,boy was I wrong.Please don't even waste your time or money on this movie!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Something....Anything But This","review":"\\"Return to Sleepaway Camp\\" has one and only one worthwhile moment. A guy makes reference to the \\"Cropsy\\" maniac from \\"The Burning\\". That takes up about two seconds of screen time. Other than that, be prepared for the most obnoxious and grating acting performances in recent history. Couple this with a totally obvious killer, shamefully inept editing, poor gore effects, idiotic attempts at humor, and you end up with one of the worst films of any year. If you choose to watch this anyway, do not watch the making of supplement first as it contains spoilers. I did find it amusing that in the making of extra, everyone is having a great time and talks up the film and the people involved. My question is; did any of you actually watch the finished product?

I was excited to see the original Angela, nothing against Pamela Springsteen, but I couldn't wait to see Felissa reprise her role. This is what I was most disappointed about. We only get to see her, without her \\"diguise\\", for the last minute of the movie! I feel ripped off!This movie revolved way too much around Alan. Kids are cruel, this is true, but he practically begged for it. I felt no simpathy for him, he was a bully himself.The only reason I give this movie two stars is because we get to see some of the original cast members, and my oh my, Ricky sure got hot!I would recommend this movie for a rental only, don't waste your money to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie Is Great!","review":"This movie is a perfect sequel in the series. i loved the first 3! and this one fits very well in the series! this movie had great deaths,scenes,and story! i loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty horrible sequel","review":"The only good thing I have to say about this sequel is that it follows the 1st one.

Pretty bad move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good death scenes, but stupid dialogue","review":"There is nothing like the original, and this movie doesn't nearly live up to it. Only worth buying to see the death scenes. (My favorite is when the killer makes a guy drink gasoline, puts a lit cigarette in his mouth, and he explodes.)The acting an dialogue is pretty bad even for a B-movie. I didn't dig it.

Anyone who reads it will come away with a better understanding of what makes China tick. The introduction by Ms. Liu is very helpful, and the text makes clear just how important words are to this ancient culture. Our Western vocabulary is solid as a rock by comparison with China's \\"pictograms,\\" or \\"characters,\\" which are a combination of abstractions. When we \\"apologized\\" for our spy plane and the loss of a Chinese pilot, it was seen by Americans as an expedient. But to the Chinese the concept of \\"apology\\" has many levels of meaning, one of which includes a complex view of justice. \\"Ancient Wisdom\\" distills words as spirits and calligraphy as the noblest form communication. Best of all, the book is fun to read, and the art is presented as a story within a story--a double treat. I'd recommend it for Sinophiles and ordinary readers curious to know more about the psyche of world's most populous nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look further for authentic Eastern wisdom","review":"Trupp must certainly have enjoyed the creative outlet of this project, and he has obviously worked hard to attempt the calligraphy.

I called Lexmark and they accused me of adding options, which I have not. Finally, they referred me to a service technician, who was familiar with the printer and the problem. To fix the printer - the whole system board would have to be replaced, apparently they fail often. Cost for the system board $699 plus at least $200 for labor (i.e., you could simply buy a new printer for less). What a rip-off. I've previously used HP printers, and my other printer is an HP Color 3700 - which is going on it's 4th full year of use with little or no problems, unfortunately, it didn't have a duplex option when I purchased it (or I wasn't willing to pay that much extra)...

I'm feeling strangely out of place at this moment in time as I look around my civilian world, which though I've known it for half my life now, suddenly seems foreign all over again. I suddenly have an urge to go down to a military base and surround myself with the familiar.It is this effect I find most powerful about Sarah's story. She includes lots of the details of life on Okinawa, something else with which I identify. Around that she weaves all the stuff that is familiar to anyone who has grown up in or married into the military. The social circles and wearing of the husband's rank, the frequent moves into all too familiar housing, and the fear that maybe dad wouldn't come home this time are all in the book.The story has a bit of a bittersweet ending. This is entirely appropriate though. That's what the military life is like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly How it Was","review":"Just finished the wonderful book \\"Yokota Officer's Club\\" - WOW! As a 50 year old Air Force brat this is the first book I have ever read about \\"us!\\" It brought back so many memories - both bad and good. I can remember my dad (an Air Force pilot) reminding me over and over that if I had even an overdue library book it would go on his record!!! YIKES! I have always maintained that the US Government should provide lifetime psychiatric care for all military brats!Sarah Bird has written a funny and poignant book.

A friend passed it on after having read it in her book club. Beside Sara Bird's excellent portrayal of life on \\"The Rock\\" and military life, the story itself is what kept me hooked. Having taught school on Kadena AFB from 70-72 made this a special book for me, however my friend confirmed how much her non-military group of book club members throughly enjoyed the book too. This book is for anyone who enjoys a great story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate outsiders Coming-ofAge","review":"I looooved this book. Though not a military brat, I am a huge fan of a poignant, beautifully written coming of age. And what makes this one so special, is that besides being a funny, fierce observer of human behavior, Bird manages to provide an understanding of how the ties that bind us to our family, our country, our culture, are the kind of ties that torture, tickle and torment us in ways we never imagined. Besides being sensitively told, this book made me laugh out loud.

The author has done something unique and deeply memorable in the way she spins a story and the messages in it from the unique perspective of a young girl raised in Japan by a U.S. Air Force family during the Cold War. I was reminded of Chaim Potok's \\"The Chosen\\" in how she describes the corrosive but strengthening impact of children being raised in silence and in closed worlds, and the craziness and humor of the Cold War with characters more vivid than even those in \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" and \\"The Manchurian Candidate.\\" I hope to see this book on high school book lists and a movie very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks For The Memories","review":"This book first caught my attention when I noticed it was written about Okinawa, 1968. We served with the Army Civilian Personnel Office on Okinawa from 3/67 through 3/69. Experiencing first hand almost every aspect of Okinawa that Sarah Bird describes so eloquently, her book made me feel as though I was there once again.

Martindale does a good job connecting or contrasting the many different theorists by their phylosophical view points and schools of thought. The section on classical theorists was better reading than that of contemporary theorists. Contemporary theorists, and their theories, seem to ramble on and on incoherently as if the theorists were either insane or just on a bad acid trip. It's at this point that they appear to try too hard to out do each other with their complex ramblings over minor issues that have already been clearly explained by earlier classical theorists. I also enjoyed the book because it contained photos of the theorists.

The perfect soundtrack for floating in shallow, warm water. Besides, this CD is even more unfocused and less memorable than \\"Orbus terrarum\\". \\"We're pastie..\\", based on looped vocal samples, is very childish. \\"Alles ist schoen\\" (German phrase for \\"Eevrything is beautiful\\") is a bit better, coming up with some ambient sounds typical for the Orb's earlier output.

He hopes that one day she will receive these letters.As the novel progresses, he encounters several affairs; increasingly scandalous events that will change the way you view life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book to avoid","review":"It is beyond me why so many people thinks this book is so inventive and entertaining. To me it is nothing but a literary trick, and the trick is on the reader. The style is precious. The story (or what loose fragments there are) is hard to follow, and the subject is not sufficiently interesting to make it worth the considerable effort Rios demands from the reader.If you are interested in contemporary Spanish fiction, forget Rios and read Javier Marias who, before long, will surely win -- and deserve -- the Nobel Prize. Julian Rios is a pretender. Javier Marias is the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but could be fantastic!","review":"You really can't beat Rick Steves for travel expertise presented in a \\"down home\\" fashion where the reader (or viewer, in this case) feels like he or she is there and that everything Rick does is replicatable. I liked this DVD so much that I bought several copies for friends who are meeting me in Tuscany this fall. Ideally, this DVD would have included coverage of more Tuscany and Umbria towns. The Amalfi Coast should have its own DVD, as should Sicily (with Sardinia and Corsica). But, all in all, if you're interested in Tuscany, the Amalfi Coast, or Cinque Terre and want something more visual than guidebooks, this DVD is what you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Information!

If you are reading this, then you already know this book can be purchased used for $0.01 In my opinion, it is an outrageous price. Should be at least 50% less. So why am I even doing this? I need to offset the first review which is obviously intended for another product altogether. Aside from the extremely loose interpretation of the laws of physics, there was not one character who had any redeeming qualities. The book would have been much better had everyone in the plane died, and the flaming wreckage fallen directly on the building housing the other main characters, thus putting themselves out of their collective misery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cd Ive purchased all year","review":"i thought that this cd was real inspirational and i believe they should keep doing this and making such great cd's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"I learned about the hairdryer from a hairdresser, and it turned out my family needed a new hairdryer and the product in the marketplace wasn't that great so I thought I'd try it.

So many things have changed in the funeral industry since the sixties, why did Mrs. Mitford fail to recognize this in her revisited edition? Do not believe everything you read, the funeral industry is not evil. Also, when Mrs. Mitford expired she ironically had an enormus funeral! I would not suggest reading this book, it was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I needed this information","review":"After experiencing two recent funerals about 4 years apart and reading a little about the American way of funerals versus the rest of the world I felt compelled to know what happens to you and your body when you die. It is a horrifying description that will happen to your body unless you leave very specific instructions of what is to be done to your remains immediately upon your demise. Three hours later is too late. You will be embalmed (not an easy read for the squeamish) and your family subjected to extreme price gouging at a time when all they think they want to do is \\"the right thing\\". Annual profits are 41% at some of the larger Funeral Home holding corporations. There is no law to embalm, except when the body cross's state lines. You will learn a lot and I instructed my family what to do and how to do it with what I learned in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way of Death Well Worth Revisiting","review":"I was thrilled when I found that Jessica Mitford's seminal work The American Way of Death was available once more. It is wonderful, even if a little alarming, to find that it is just as relevant in 2007 as it was when first published in 1963.Ms Mitford, or Decca to her friends, is inspirational. She combines wit, intelligence and thorough investigation with humour to make this book informative and a joy to read. One cannot help wondering however how we as consumers have been seduced by the promise of 'eternal slumber' for so long.It is my hope that other works such as The Trial of Dr Spock, Kind and Usual Punishment: The Prison Business and Hons and Rebels will also be revisted.The American Way of Death should be compulsory reading for all because we will all face the death of a loved one and will have to make decisions in a vulnerable state and because her actuity will ensure you never look at anything the same way again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Cheap Plastic Gimmick","review":"I saw what I THOUGHT was the same set and Wms&Sonoma and then found these online.

There are too many spelling and punctuation errors to count, errors with font changes (things set italic that should be roman and vice versa) and just a lot of sloppiness that should be really embarrassing to the author and publisher. I was embarrassed for them! This stuff detracts so much from the actual text of the book that it makes it virtually unusable. I hope that if it ever comes out in a second edition, they spring for a professional edit to eliminate all these problems. What should be a fun, useful book ends up being a pile of crap because of the poor (or lack of) editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, horrible editing","review":"It's always nice to see a new book on Atheism on the shelves. I'm one of those who believe that human beings will never become intellectually mature unless they dump their belief in the supernatural. Beach Blanket Atheism would be a decent primer for the budding atheist, or a refresher-type reference for the more hard core IF it were edited by someone other than what looks to be a third grader with a spelling and reading problem. I mean, c'mon, it's ASIMOV, not AZIMOV (p. 62). And I lost track of all the times I read lists of names in this book (such as atheist/agnostic name lists) that contained name repetitions. In sum, there's way too many repeats, misspellings, and other howler-type errors in this book to make it anything other than embarassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book","review":"I am an avid reader, and this book is probably the worst I've ever seen. It is NOT 'thoughtfully written', as stated by one reviewer who clearly did not read the book - it's a pile of poorly-edited (or more likely unedited), repetitious, unreadable crap. And the quotes are not used to 'flesh out' concepts, as the same reviewer said. The concepts are almost entirely captured and explained by the quotes - and that very badly. This book adds nothing new or interesting to the topic, and is a breathtakingly annoying waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"These copies are Lightning Source specials - a crappy print on demand publisher that is all into profit and not into quality.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, you'll be glad.

Don't bother with this if you are a lifelong Burroughs reader. You will be very disappointed.

I didn't realize it was erotica when I bought it so I was kinda turned off by the graphic language and descriptions. It would have been forgivable if there was more substance to this story, but there isn't. It was predictable and there was no climax (no pun intended) to speak of. Also the dialogue was crass and just didn't ring true, especially between Jennifer and her friend. There was a scene where two characters discussed the difference between porno literature and erotica, and ironically I'm inclined to think that this is more porn than erotica. I'm disappointed that I wasted my time reading it and even worse that I spent money on it. If you can borrow it from a library, go for it, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. For higher quality romances featuring BBWs try Bet Me, The Next Big Thing, or He Loves Lucy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only place for this book is the trash can","review":"I have never thrown a book away before, but this doesn't deserve to be saved.

'07 while visiting my sis-n-law. Well below half the retail price. I snapped it up in an instant. Found all the tip accessories on an on-line retailer at clearance prices too. What a neat stick! I used it in Eureka Springs, Arkansas that has streets like some areas of San Francisco, only steeper! I don't even require a cane on a regular basis, but this was sure a great help on the steep streets there as I am getting a little more unstable. It was better in the extended mode in the Springs. Flat ground around home when walking for exercise just provides a modicum of comfort of having a potential \\"weapon\\" at hand.

It discusses dozens of welding problems and their solutions, talks about common welding tools, marking and measuring methods, bending and straightening steel. There's material on adding rigidity, resisting torsion, welding truck frames and adding roll bars to unibodies. Many ways to use welding in fabrication are shown like adding threads, making leveling jacks, lots of ideas on how to weld up brackets, machine legs, bearing supports, and deck tie-downs. Subjects from weld distortion to metal fatigue are discussed in an easy-to-read format. Whether you're new to welding or an old hand, it will get you thinking about welding in new ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money.","review":"This book is a handfull of badly written questions with answers that are so specific, unless you are doing the exact project/task they mention, the answers are totally useless.

Currently, its the longest running show in Broadway history ... thankfully, though, Mr. Webber's masterpiece, \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" will take the crown in early 2006.Despite a talented Company (esp. Betty Buckley, Ken Page & Terrence Mann), the score has generally not aged well and seems rather trite by today's standards. However, the production's best moments are showcased nicely in this \\"selections\\" version of the classic show:Jellicle Songs For Jellicle CatsRum Tum TuggerMr. MistoffeleesMemory (THE classic!)While the full two-cd score may be more complete, the \\"selections\\" cd (fortunately) eliminates most of the show's filler.

The version I have is a two CD set with all of the tunes in it, and I'm thinking just having selections would be much better, so that you don't have to wade through all of the also-rans to get to the tunes that really work. Of course \\"Memory\\" is a stunning tune, though I've heard it 3 or 4 thousand times too often, and \\"Mr. Mistoffolees\\" is very catchy, though repetitive.

I realize some viewers like it in these reality shows when there are abusive people on top castigating the contenders. Project Catwalk UK also had an extremely abusive judge whom viewers loved or hated. I am rather surprised to discover that I don't like it when these people in charge are abusive, insulting, sarcastic and demeaning to the contestants. I expected to like that because it puts more drama and tension into the show. However, I didn't count on that I would be repulsed by that behavior and thus stop watching. I suspect I am in the minority here. This show is a big hit. I should say that although I can cook, I am by no means a chef. Perhaps this is what real chefs behave like which is what ups the reality factor for viewers who move in this real chef's world.

You can too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Making Prayer Kid-Size","review":"How Did Bible Heroes Pray? by Mona Hodgson is a fun and easy-to-read book that shows children how God hears their prayers anywhere and any time. It can assist parents and teachers in emphasizing how Bible heroes were every day people and that children can have the same kind of relationship with God as they did. The book demonstrates how today's children can pray just as great men and women of God have in the past, with a whole range of individual needs and emotions. It reinforces the parents' example of daily prayer.Hallie Gillett's delightful illustrations show children of all colors in many places, adding to the reader's satisfaction. The message is clear throughout and the catchy poem at the end strengthens the book as a teaching tool. There are also Bible verse references on each page for deeper study in the Scriptures. Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a let down","review":"After listening to the song \\"lost in doubt\\" Irushed into buying the album.A mistake, because \\"lost in doubt\\" is the only really good song and it appears in a victory compilation.

It's already been done: and quite well!The final tale had as silly an ending as any Holmes story I have read.The unifying theme of these three stories is that Holmes is battling against his nemesis, Professor James Moriarty.

Though it did not have the mainstream appeal of todays corporate rap machine, it enjoyed huge popularity. And was very important in terms of guiding hip hop into its concious activist, and spiritual movement. However, the album is by no means preachy. Brother J is one of the most gifted lyricist of all time. He paints beautiful images with his metaphors and analogies which allow the listener to be immersed in a world of intellect and spirituality outside the eurocentric philosophies.Beyond that- the beats are just banging. X clan ignited the use of old school(70's/80's)samples. But they go a step further and incorporate tribal rhythms which connect the modern urbanite to a time past when the wisdom of the ages was not lost.

Imagine if a white rapper came out and said, \\"I'll slap you with my white nazi hand!\\" Would America be outraged? Of course. So why is it that everyone who has reviewed this album (and I'm willing to bet it is mostly blacks), are okay with what they say? I dare to say that this album is on the verge of pro-taliban talk. I mean it! There is so much I'm better than you are and God is telling me to prove it on this album that I see that direct corelation between the Taliban and the Xclan.

The beats are good as Stoupe lays it down, but Vinnie's rhymes seem a bit hanging and repetative after a while. Of course there is even more pro-Islam, anti-gay attitudes discussed, which get old after the first song. However Jedi Mind puts together a great ensemble with guest appearences. The visciousness of Vinnie's voice is exciting and powerful, and definately beats any pop-hop bullish youll hear on the radio.

This is not the same Lily Bard in the earlier installments -- she's overly occupied with her clothing (and ye gods, the descriptions are awful).

Not having read any of the previous titles in this series, it was hard to decipher some of the references to things that had gone on before (where exactly are those scars, and how were they inflicted??). My main beef with this book is that the writing is full of nonsequiturs, very choppy, and generally in need of a good editor. It was hard for me to continue reading sometimes because I was thinking how some of the sentences and even paragraphs could have been reconstructed to read more smoothly and make more sense. Am I the only reader who feels this way? Sorry, Charlaine, but St. Martin's Press should assign you a good editor in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lily Bard is no Sookie Stackhouse","review":"I've only read the first three Lily Bard novels, and the third, Shakespeare's Christmas, is by far the best. It's probably unfair to compare this series to the Sookie Stackhouse books, but reading that series was the whole reason I sought more Charlaine Harris. The Shakespeare stories are entertaining, just not as fun as the Sookie books. I liked the fact that this story had less, yet more believable, violence and a better mystery than the first two. I recommend the Shakespear series if you are interested in reading all of Charlaine Harris's works, but would probably recommend you read Harris's Harper Connelly series before Shakespeare if you've already read the Sookie Stackhouse series and want more of Harris's excellently crafted and imaginative writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicer and nicer","review":"This fourth book in the Lily Bard/Shakespeare series continues the trend and is better than the third book. This is the first, and only book, to take place outside Shakespeare, Arkansas. This visit home was a nice way to fill out Lily Bard's character and the action/mystery at home is compelling. A very nicely written story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare's Christmas","review":"Truly enjoy this series. Lily, the protagonist, deals with her horrid past, yet is able to help investigate local crimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking and Addicting","review":"As a mother it was very hard reading a mystery about a kidnapped child. It broke my heart, but it goes to show how well writte this book is to pull at my heart strings like that! The mystery was very well written and I also enjoyed meeting Lily's family, as well as Jack meeting them! I loved the deepening of their relationship in this latest addition, Harris writes their complicated, broken and hurt relationship very well. Not many could pull off a romance with such tragic characters. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Shakespears Xmas","review":"Although I enjoyed this book, it wasn't about Shakespeare and only a little bit about Christmas. Lilly has to return to her family home for her sister's wedding. The story is more about her reconciling with her family and former life while, of course, solving a crime. This story also sees Lilly and Jack commit to one another. Overall this is good read - a great lazy day read."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved this forgotten book","review":"I am a fan of anything Charlaine Harris writes, so when I saw that this had been brought out again...I was tickled. I already finished the Lily Bard series, so it was like going back in time to read this one which is I believe is #3 in that series. She is not writing anymore on this character, so I am glad to have that series complete. It was as good as all the others. Sorry she won't be adding anymore to Lily's storyline.. I have to wait until 2009 for another Sookie book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully written and charactered series.","review":"If you haven't met Lily Bard of Shakespeare, Ak, you are in for a rare treat in the mystery genre. A victim of gang rape, coupled with a vicious knifing, Lily has reinvented herself, left home and become a cleaning lady in a small town. Now, however, she must go home for her sister's wedding and the family from whom she's become almost estranged. On her first morning home, she and her sister discover the bludgeoned bodies of a doctor and his nurse. Also in town on the case of a child abducted years before is the new love of Lily's life, Jack. One of the suspects in the kidnapping is her sister's widowed fiance. A taut, well-told tale of suspense with three dimensional characters. I would suggest that before reading this, one should read \\"Shakepeare's Landlord\\" and \\"Shakespeare's Champion.\\" This different and much darker series by the author of the Aurora Teagarden books should not be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for a book like the Sookie Stackhouse novels, this isn't it..","review":"I purchased this series after burning through the Sookie Stackhouse novels, hoping that it would be as good. While the plot lines were interesting, the character development is minimal and the characters themselves are not as likeable. The books themselves seemed to short - the story line could have been expanded on and given more detail and the characters could have been more depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda gross but that's just CH.","review":"This book is a good mystery. However, the conclusion of truth revealed is gross. I know CH likes to push the envelope, as the last book was about racism, and she has written about rape, abuse, racism, incest, and pedophilia in the past. However, there was a moment toward the end where I decided it was just too much. Otherwise, the book was good minus the pedophilia/incest moment in the end. I know that sounds like an oxymoron, but she is portraying bad guys doing bad things, so the book is good even though I hated the bad acts of the fictional characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This stuff sucks.

It does not go into depth with its explanations and it does not have a useful vocabulary. I am a professional interpreter and translator in a law firm, and I wanted my correspondence in Spanish to be as correct as possible. This book is fine for an intermediate student, but is probably not what an advanced student or professional is seeking. I would return it, but it is cheap enough that it is not worth the aggravation of trying to get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A rather disappointing book, regrettably. Ligia Ochoa attempts to jump start the beginner into spanish correspondence and at the same time to guide an advanced student to perfection. In the end she achieves neither one nor the other. The vocabulary she includes is totally insufficient for a rookie, whilst the constant return to english is an annoying digression for advanced learners. The examples given are very limited in scope and don't always achieve exemplary quality.Perhaps Ochoa should have written two separate books to serve the different sections of the audience she aims to reach. As it is, with her actual book she serves neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Write in Spanish","review":"I found the work to be, in some instances, too advanced for beginning, recreational adult learners.

The fat kid from \\"Head of the Class\\" was the saving grace, but most of the characters, including Judd Nelson, were just so wooden. I don't think they had a very good script to work with either. The laughs come few and far between. And Judd Nelson talks like a normal guy, but reverts to this weird Italian thing where he struts around going \\"yo\\" whenever a good-looking girl is around.If you want to see a funny \\"1980s\\" type of movie that takes place in a school, why not go for REAL GENIUS, SIXTEEN CANDLES, BETTER OFF DEAD or SAY ANYTHING.

Even with the help of a co-writer, stylists and recipe developers, projects are strange (at best) and the recipes are poorly written.But this shouldn't come as a surprise. Katie has no background in lifestyle. She is an actress who starred in a Saturn car commercial.

The pages and pages of her personal anecdotes might be interesting to her family and friends, but come off as self-absorption, and the two FULL pages of acknowledgements speaks volumes.

The last two songs in particular show this. \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed\\" is compelling, but it ends in the wrong place and feels incomplete. Then, \\"Stable Song\\" is just a condensed version of \\"Stability\\" from an EP a few years ago. The lyrics of the song don't match those on the rest of the album, even though by itself it's a great listen, improving on the original by cutting out the mostly pointless eight-minute ending. That being said, the winning tracks here (all except \\"Crooked Teeth\\") are wonderful examples of the band evolving their sound, as they have generally done with each release. This is not a guitar-pop album, but a more electronic one. The electronic style is nothing like that of the Postal Service, however, and I think those comparisions are unfair. All in all, a great album, just a bit rushed I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Death Cab","review":"Great band...great album! Love everything they do either with the band or solo projects. You'll recognize the hits on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"sellouts?!","review":"all you boys and girls that call death cab sellouts are the same little bastards that made them \\"that\\" way.so quit your bitching and go watch the O.C."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 2005: Plan to love it!","review":"I first listened to Death Cab for Cutie as The OC featured their music. Perhaps it was the overload (they were everywhere), but I admit I was not too thrilled about them at the time, except for a handful of songs from their \\"Transatlanticism\\" album, but I did keep them in the back of my mind.In 2005, Ben Gibbard's Death Cab for Cutie won me over! Their \\"Plans\\" album lacks nothing and carries so much emotion that it is bound to become a timeless classic alongside others such as REM's \\"Automatic for the People\\" and The Cure's \\"Wish\\". I find it hard to pick a favorite track, but if pressed to do so, \\"What Sarah Said\\" and the closing track, \\"Stable Song\\" move me every time I listen to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Indie-Rock Listen","review":"Plans by Death Cab For Cutie is a strange album. It's very melodic, acoustic, and indie, and every song on this album makes a great lullaby. I bought this album last summer and was impressed with every chord, every beat, and every note they played. Ben Gibbard's vocals combined with Chris Walla, Nicholas Harmer, and Jason McGerr's skilled playing make this a must-have album for any indie-rock fan.This song has absolutely no vulgar language or profanities, or even sketchy references. As I said, you'll really enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I had heard a few of DCFC songs on XM and seen them on a few late night talk shows, but when I really fell in love with them was at Bonnaroo. They are pros. I came home and immediately bought their CD, Plans. I generally just download MP3s, but they were so impressive live that I wanted the whole CD. I plan to buy more of their CDs, but I still haven't tired of Plans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot Better","review":"Transatlacicism was really good i felt this was better. and awesome CD. worth the 12 bucks just like all that other albums were. thier best yet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally whipped...","review":"While I bought (and enjoyed) the Postal Service CD, I thought that it might serve as an outlet for some of the (more sensitive) leanings of our foo'ball hero Mr. Gibbard. Unfortunately, the more garage-band, guitar-based DCFC stuff (Hindsight, Song for Kelly Huckaby, Champagne From a Paper Cup) is completely missing from this album. It's an emo trainwreck, and while I enjoy a weepie just as much as the next self-assured heterosexual male, I gotta say, the DCFC boys have done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best, but up there!","review":"Their best has to be either \\"Photo Album\\" or \\"Transatlanticism\\" but as I said, this one is definitely Top 3 material here! I heard a bit of the album before release and knew that they definitely changed the style a bit (a little Postal Service influence is there as well as the older stuff). \\"Soul Meets Body\\" is definitely hit-material for sure, the other songs most likely will get played out and become Top 40 Material in no time, further pushing them into the limelight and they will become the next Green Day (BLEEEEEEEEEECHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!) Sorry, going off into my hate over Top 40 radio! Anyway, go out and buy every single Death Cab album you can get right now and enjoy them!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Talent","review":"I am one of those many newcomers to Death Cab, thanks to their major airplay song, \\"Soul Meets Body\\". Two comments, one for potential listeners and another for the band.Potential listeners - if you like your songs mellow and deep (Marillion comes to mind), Death Cab is for you. Within \\"Plans\\", you will hear a rarity of meaningful lyrics and stories - literal and figurative. With deep, meaningful songs and an incredible hit song, they easily earn 4 stars.Death Cab - the band clearly has the intelligence, creativity and musical talent to explore beyond their \\"mellow boundaries\\". It's no coincidence that \\"Soul Meets Body\\" struck paydirt. It's one of the best songs I've ever heard - catchy and melodic tunes coupled with great lyrics, all the while never becoming too predictable. I WANT MORE OF THIS! Sorry old time fans, but let's see Death Cab give more of it a try. (GASP!) They might even become more popular!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album I've heard in years","review":"This album has made me an enthusiastic new fan of Death Cab for Cutie. I like the mix of ballads and higher-speed tunes (even though I do wish the radio DJs would please stop playing \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\" ad nauseum... clearly they failed to learn from \\"Under the Bridge\\" in the 90s how overplaying can turn a perfectly good tune into a worn-out, trite cliche that makes you switch the station). The lyrics are excellent and the melodies mesmerizing. Also, I love how there isn't one bad track on the album. This is one CD I continually play through from start to finish, then start over and play it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock/Pop Old Enough To Have A Claim on a Tradition","review":"The best of the Beatles lives in the best of DCFC. I would add, however, DCFC takes some of its chord progressions, melodies and harmonies to a level the Lads did not reach as a group -- in particular songs, here and there, yes. Blackbird, for example."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a New Fan","review":"I just discovered these guys. Gibbard's sensitive voice and Chris Walla's guitar and keyboards are a perfect match. The single \\"Soul Meets Body\\" has a great melody quickened to an electronic cadence. Then he panders to boyish nostalgia while shedding his \\"Summer Skin.\\" \\"I Will Follow You into the Dark\\" is simply vocals and acoustic guitar in an emotional love song addressing impending death."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same. Still good.","review":"Over the span of their discography, Death cab for cutie's Musical style has not changed that much from album to album. Even having made the jump to a major label, the group manages to stay true to their original sound. Although this makes their music seem trite at times, They are still consistantly makeing good songs.As for the move to Atlantic, you wouldn't even know it were it not the first thing on a \\"Death Cab\\" fans lips concerning the new album. \\"It sounds more produced\\" some will gripe. Anyone who thinks \\"Plans\\" is the groups first album that sounds produced needs to listen to \\"The Photo Album\\" again. You don't need to have been a die hard fan to know that this was an inevitable move for the group. And whats so wrong with a band wanting their music to be heard by an audience that an Independent label cannot reach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best, but not bad at all. Recommended.","review":"Longtime fans that inevitably crucified DCFC after their jump from Barsuk Records to Atlantic will more than likely think that this album is just what they expected. But \\"Plans\\" is a more realized album than the band's earlier efforts -- it's not a case of major label-itis, but simply a band maturing and getting older. \\"Transatlanticism\\" it is not, but do we really wants retreaded songs from a band with this much talent and potential?Hopefully fans will get over themselves and accept \\"Plan\\" for what it is -- a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and overproduced!!!","review":"Let's get right to it: This cd is slow and boring and overproduced. Positivie reviewers might call it \\"melancolic and soulful\\"...but it is boring. I'm a Death Cab fan and I wanted so badly to like it...but I just can't. It makes me sleepy everytime I listen to it. If you are expecting any of the semi-upbeat sound of Transatlant...you will not find it here.My suggestion, save your money or spend it on Arcade Fire's cd called Funeral!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Word. Yikes!","review":"Im so sick of hearing the constant, \\"they were on the OC\\" mumble jummble. This isnt about anything except music. DCFC seems bored. So bored they use the same damn sounding piano in almost every song. Its so formulaic it makes me sick. Aside from \\"Different Names For The Same Thing\\" (which really isnt that good either), The Album is such a stinker. But I feel as if I can let this one slide under the radar. Maybe try and forget it was ever released or maybe it never even happened. The bottom line here really is, If you are curious to hear what all the uproar is about. Dont listen to Plans. Go with one of the bands great albums they did before this catastrophe, Because listening to Plans will ruin the whole DCFC of old."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP Death Cab RIP","review":"One of my favorite bands of all time has just gone major label and the outcome is just horrible. Anyways I shouldn't blame their major label jump entirely - I had a feeling that Transatlanticism was their first step downwards. May they rest in peace.BTW, they have ruined the song \\"Stability\\" (one of my favorite DCFC songs of all time) completely with their new version \\"Stable Song\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"music doofer","review":"This album is not as good as their last. However its got some really good songs. Standouts for me are marching bands of manhatten, your heart is an empty room. I love these too the rest is pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their worst (but that doesn't mean much)","review":"Firstly, if you heavily favor their older stuff (Something About Airplanes and We Have the Facts...) you're in for a disappointment. However, this album follows the logical progression you could tell they were taking from the Photo Album to Transatlanticism to Plans, so it's certainly not shocking.Ben's lyrics aren't as clever as previous efforts, even being outdone by Chris Walla's Brothers on a Hotel Bed, and the album would be infinitely better off if Someday You Will Be Loved and What Sarah Said never existed; but the melodies and basslines are some of their best.Overall, Plans is a solid album. Veteran fans might feel like they've sold out (because any band that signs to a major label is automatically a sell-out), bandwagoners will eat it right up."},{"rating":"2","title":"How it makes me feel...","review":"If I could use one word to describe how I feel when I listen to this album, it would be gratified. I can listen to the album from beginning to end and feel the same amount of content as I did the time before. If you like and appreciate musical talent, you shouldn't have any problem loving this album as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Plan\\" on getting this album","review":"If you have listened to DCFC for years or are just coming on board with their totally unique vision, their new album \\"PLANS\\" is an instant great catch. The lyrics grab you and the melodies spin in your brain like cotton candy on a stick. You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plans","review":"being a big fan of the band death cab for cutie, i was really looking forward to their new album, and was slightly disappointed. it's not that it isnt good, its just that its not like what death cab usually does. in this new album you'll find 11 new songs with many different types of music. for example on a few tracks, like i will follow you into the dark, you'll find gibbard by himself with an acoustic guitar. and on other tracks, many others, you'll find a lot of eletric beats and such, wich is not like what death cab would normally do. i guess that the side project of gibbard's, the postal service, really influenced this album, with it being all electric. i cant say that i dont enjoy this cd because i do listen to it from time to time, but i would rather stick with old favorites, like we have the facts and we're voting yes. so if you were really into the postal service you will enjoy this cd, and if you would rather stick with the old death cab, you might find this cd just collecting dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even more beautiful","review":"This is the third DCFC album I've owned and they keep getting better. The songwriting, arrangements and lyrical imagry is lush and beautiful. This is one of those CD's that's gets into your favorites list very quickly and I haven't stopped playing it for the past 3 weeks. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Transatlanticism","review":"Solid album all the way through. I'm sure I'll get a lot of sht for this, but it's better than Transatlanticism. It brings back the amazing melodies that were found in their earlier albums that were then lost in Trans. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look into it more..","review":"I first gave Death Cab a listen when my boyfriend at the time told me I should. He let me borrow \\"Transatlanticism\\" and at first listen, I wasn't too interested. But after a long time analyzing the lyrics and music I came to love it. I was so excited to hear they were coming out with a new cd. So I got it ASAP. And I knew they switched to a major label, but I don't think the label switch had anything to do with the different style and type of music on the cd. If you listen to The Photo Album and then listen to Transatlanticism, there is a large difference in the music style. DCFC simply matured their sound. Transatlanticism as a whole tells a better story, but Plans is an amazing cd. If you just listen to the style, you won't like it too much. But the lyrics very much fit the style of music and the soudn quality is a lot better. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful String of Words","review":"I found Death Cab For Cutie this year for the first time. After buying Plans, I fell in love with them, and bought most of their old Albums. Their lyrics in this album are just amazing. Musically, it's very quiet, and relaxing. Lyrically, it makes you smile, and tugs at your heart strings. My favorites were Brothers On A Hotel Bed, Soul Meets Body, and I Will Follow You Into The Dark. My favorite CD of all time is the Garden State SDTRK, and I feel like DCFC's music belonged on that soundtrack. This CD is definitely worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"Few albums like this have all great songs, but this one does. Very well recorded and sung. I highly recommend it to avid fans and ppl new to DC4C."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"These guys were, at best, a servicable college rock band in their early days, but as they've forged on and \\"up\\" the lyrics and music have just gotten really tired and, honestly, difficult for me not to laugh at their lame songs... And the fact that they've spawned a bunch of imitators that are just as insufferable only reinforces the notion that this lame emo-ish bandwagon is best kept off of."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"Each Death Cab release prior to this one had at least one song where the instruments were different (interesting) and the vocals were quite good. Transatlantacism had more of these than any other album by the band.This album has none. The lyrics, my favorite part, are mellow beyond excuse. Not a single song stands out.The closest thing I can compare this to is the new Coldplay album, where the lead single (Speed of Sound for Coldplay, Soul Meets Body for Death Cab) is the worst on the album.I will give credit for going against the mainstream, even when there is no innovation. However, this album refuses to do anything to budge out of solid mellow.Sorry Ben Gibbard, I think your voice is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly, not feeling it...","review":"Death Cab For Cutie, although sometimes mislabled as emo, is really the anti-emo act of today. Their music isn't layered in screaming or breakdowns, and it doesn't follow any a-typical emo trends. If i had to describe cutie, it would be pure indie. For their newest \\"plans\\", cutie takes a slightly different direction, one more generic, and because of that, \\"plans\\" is probably the band's worst effort to date. Short, but not so sweet, this record really isn't worth a 12+ dollar purchase. If you're a diehard cutie fan, you probably own this record already, so i'm not preaching to you. If you're still on the fence, download a couple tracks first and make up your mind.Music: 2 starsLyrics: 3 starsProduction: 2 starsOverall: 2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"I ate an umbrella","review":"Ok, so I bought this CD.

And I was happy to do so in quick/lightning fashion.Anyway, Plans is the kind of CD that you play when you're on a date with that emo girl from 2nd hour biology (she has a Modest Mouse hoodie and a Planes Mistaken For Stars pin on her skirt...that's emo right?)

Haven't heard much of \\"Death Cab For Cutie\\" other than this CD, but would definitely check them out more now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some brilliance, some routine music","review":"A good collection of tunes with a thematic motif running through it centering on premature death and loss.The songs are typically sad, and there is a certain resignation in the attitude of the band; however there is heroism in the quality of love offered as well.The best example is \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark,\\" a masterful song that avoids every cliche and bravely goes where few love songs would dare. This tune alone is worth the price of the CD and there are other good songs as well.Do not dismiss \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\": although bleak because of the circumstances of typical human existence, it is also profoundly moral and humanistic. It shows why love makes life, what there is of it, worth living.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic and melodic","review":"This is a melancholy but beautiful CD. If you can make it through track 9, What Sarah Said, without tearing up, you are stronger than I am. I think the best song on Plans is Brothers in a Hotel Bed but with so many to chose from, its hard to pick just one.All the other songs on Plans are just as strong, if not stronger, than the ones that have been played on the radio.

Take a look at lead singer Ben Gibbard and tell me he does not look like Corey Feldman from when he was in that movie Stand By Me. As for the actual music, they have better things than the ultimate sap song \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\", which is apparently about some fat kids girlfriend becoming an hero. Oh and they never got any MTV airplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will not follow you into the dark","review":"Perhaps the worst part of the entire album is on, \\"I will follow you into the dark.\\"In Catholic school as vicious as Roman ruleI got my knuckles bruised by a lady in blackAnd I held my tongue as she told me\\"Son fear is the heart of love\\"So I never went backEvery time I hear it I cringe. The entire album is a little too affective, even for emo rock. Marching bands of Manhattan is an ok track, and What Sarah Said is also not bad. Brothers on a hotel bed is the most immediately catchy song, but it gets old, and you realize it's really a mediocre to bad song.

These guys are a total drag, with almost no emotion to it. I have heard that the older stuff from these guys is much better, as some of the reviews have really been harsh to this album.

Okay, to be honest, there were some pretty sizable plot holes, particularly when it came to the fire... and I have to admit that I did let those things distract me a bit, and take away from the story. Otherwise it was a fun story, with some interesting (if occasionally annoying) characters. I also thought the author overdid the foreshadowing just a tad... It's not what I would classify as a mystery, really, but more of a lightly humorous suspense novel. It had some good moments, but all in all, not a book I would strongly recommend unless you read a lot and are looking for a bit of fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrivances","review":"All novels are contrivances of the writer. The trick is to write in such a way that the contrivances flow and seem real. Ms. Clark apparently cannot do that. Her plots are just plain bad. Her characters are the beautiful people, people who would never eat at McDonald's or buy even a pair of socks at WalMart. They know good food, good wine, fine apparel. The plots take place in wealthy milieus. The conversations are brittle. Add it all up and one has to wonder what reader Ms. Clark has in mind. Certainly not I.

It's sad that the other animals make fun of Percival for being just plain brown and Percival feels bad about it. Wrong message, wrong terminology and a terrible implications. Insulting to people with brown skin, brown hair and brown eyes and damaging to brown children. We received it as a gift and I'm likely to trash it."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful illustrations, poor message","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated book that catches my child's eye and is a pleasure to look at. It is unfortunate that the message of this story seems to be that it is alright to compare yourself to others and envy them if they are more beautiful. It also suggests that if you are plain you should be sad. The solution found in this book was to become beautiful/colorful (from a plain caterpillar to a beautiful butterfly)and then, since you are now more beautiful then everyone you can be happy. Not exactly the message I'd like to instill in my child. Nothing about inner worth - only surface beauty. We still look at the pictures, but I change the story. If the book is still around when my child is old enough to realize my discrepancy from the narrative then we will discuss the problems with the ideas represented in the actual story."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"Fantastic story...I read it to my 18 month olds 2x's+ a day!

A little, sure, but too much gives way to a slick product instead of a crafty undertaking. Reese has his moments, though. \\"Acid Lab\\" is a terrific number, with spy movie-like keyboards and a jumping back rythm. But \\"Candle\\" comes off like stale elevator music, as does \\"Jazz Master\\" and \\"Ibiza.\\" Reese's all-too-careful approach to the drum & bass genre results in mockery and simple boredom. Reese is what Kenny G. is for jazz: safe listening. The only danger you may encounter is scratching the disc while putting it back in its case, which may be a good thing. But some may prefer such a lifestyle, so I'll give it two stars for accessibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for...","review":"Great price, but you get what you pay for.

Through personal stories, sceintific studies, and offical policies, the myths and mystery surrounding this issue is brought out of the closet. A must read for anyone who knows a gay mormon or is dealing with the issues of homosexuality. I have personally found great peace and comfort in my own life from this book. As a gay mormon myself I know and understand the pain of not having the answers. Some of the answers are to be found in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible, heartbreaking, and ultimately inspiring.","review":"This book is must read for anyone struggling with sexual identity while still trying to maintain a love of God and church. Whether you are Mormon or belong to another faith this book is equally as powerful. Through the essays of gay people, their families, spouses, and clergy members, Peculiar People portrays the painful choices sometimes chosen by, and sometimes forced upon, those whose only sin is loving the \\"wrong\\" people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Overview","review":"This book was groundbreaking for when it was published in the early '90s. It's interesting to see how a lot of what it calls for the Church has adopted, but since the culture lags so far behind, this is a good introduction for members who may not have considered the situation of gay and lesbian Church members or the realities of homosexuality in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Stabila","review":"I purchased these levels from Amazon.com.

This movie is a heartfelt tribute to an Age that just lives in the memory of a whole generation, that were teenagers after the WW2 and grew and grew up under the magic spell of Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis, Django Reinhardt, Errol Garner and a countless list of big names of the Jazz.Obviously, Coppola remarks once more the hidden codes of the myth through the presence of the duality, expressed through the story of two brothers; one white the other black, and a fabulous interweaved connection of secondary plots.To my mind this is one of the best achievement of Coppola in the genre of chamber works of his notable career. Gregory Hines made the greatest role of his lifetime. Watch for that Goddess called Diane Ladd in her 19."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a movie","review":"I watched this movie and was like whoa pretty damn cool shizzle!

Hooray! Some of the nasty gangsters killed some other nasty gangsters! Guess what? There's still a bunch of goons floating around in a racist world. And why did all this take a whole movie to happen when they could have gunned each other down to begin with and saved us all a lot of trouble?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"While this film did not do well at the box office, it is very entertaining.

Great performances by some actors just starting their careers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying Fun","review":"There was enough tap and dance to keep my creative spirit satisfied and smiling wide. The poetic drama was wonderful and the singing was quite entertaining as well. I was surprised to see Nicolas Cage in his supporting role, although he has played other gangsters in his time. The sex and violence were not too graphic, however, not tame enough for the younger set. You can't beat it for the price, especially if you like tap and drama. Nice late 20s music and costumes...

The story is about a Lama who is reincarnated so that he will have a vigorus young body when those who would destroy Tibet arrive. But he is reincarnated into a very unexpected body, the child of white foreigners. It was an interesting book, but a bit on the short side. I wish there was a paperback version, but oh well.If you are not in the least interested in Tibetan culture and religious beliefs then stay way from this one. However if you are interested you will probably enjoy this. Just keep this in mind, this book is pretty graphic. It shows several death scenes and a woman giving birth.

I should've known better than to buy a record featuring the sort of sub-Nagel artwork usually displayed in a Fantastic Sam's haircuttery. \\"Between Us & Them\\" is a great song because it steals a fantastic bassline from Peter Hook (New Order).

They are senior musicians and Richie Buckley (saxes) and David Hayes on Bass has been playing with Van for maybe thirty years so they know the material inside out. Its great to see Van happily interpreting his own music from his youthful beginnings.I very much enjoyed this concert and highly recommend it if you want to know what Van is like these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is better then PURE?","review":"Like I started off with, \\"PURE\\".This is about as pure as music gets. This is the kind of warm feeling that you do not get the feeling with these days. Some of the INDY bands are on there way.If they only had LP's with movie film? May be they do? Do they?.....Enough.Simple is better, I know that watching a show on this level will educate anyone with a sense of music.I say this for a couple of reasons.Either it has not been found or explored.I know this is not for some who say they like Van.This is not POP.But what I know this is, is music that you will love the more you hear. All that I can say is, educate yourself here. YOU WILL BE HAPPYG"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Concert...Beautiful Movie","review":"I can't possibly understand how can anyone calling themselves a Van Morrison fan can dislike this concert film. I've read all these reviews complaining about the editing, opening sequence in black and white(a two minute interview for Pete's sake!), the fact that is was recorded outdoors, etc...all rubbish!!!

Do not hesitate to buy it...amazing performance, beautiful film...Peace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please re-issue!!!!","review":"I am obviously a little late to the game, somehow I did not hear about this DVD back in '09 when it was released.

I can't even find somewhere to pirate a copy and I never do that kind of stuff; but honestly, I'm almost physically sick that I can't purchase this for a reasonable price.I would rather buy 10 copies, at $30 a piece, and give them out as amazing gifts than give one greedy jerk $300 for a DVD they obviously don't want anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant surprise","review":"Van is not a great stage presence.

There is no music nor vocals coming out of the right front channel in Dolby Digital 5.1 mode. There is some sound coming out of that channel, but it is only ambient audience noise, similar to what you would hear on some rear channels. I am certain that this is not a problen related to my audio equipment, since I tried it on 3 different DVD/AVR setups. I am a huge Van Morrison fan (have every one of his albums/CD's) and therefore was very dissappointed to hear this recording. Anyone else experience this problem?

I am a huge fan of Mr Morrison and put this DVD on in the comfort of my home and swoon and cheer the whole way through.

Get something else, breast cancer can be supported in useful ways, too"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooring!!!!","review":"I think the only reason I purchased this product was to support the fight against breast cancer because I couldn't have intended to sweat. The little pink band that comes with it is worthless and kept slipping off my feet to the point of annoyance and the workout lasts maybe ten minutes. I thought this DVD would at least be good for making myself more flexible. Needless to say after the pilates craze, this \\"workout\\" fell short."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a fan of Mari, this one might be too easy for you.","review":"While the band does add some additional resistance, a lot of the more challenging poses have been removed.

If you are new to pilates I definitely recommend this, however if you are advanced you probably will not get too much of a challenge from this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"My feet won't stay in band!","review":"This flimsy resistance band is for the birds. My little toe kept getting stuck in it. If the band isn't spread out AND you don't keep your feet separated at the toes (heels together) it HURTS because of the smushing feet together while pulling. I had to reposition constantly and no, I don't think it will get better over time. I want to exercise but not struggle with this thing. This would NOT be a workout for heavy set people as you would never get positioned to do anything. I sold this DVD back to Amazon.com. There are SO many better DVD's to exercise with that are fun and easier to do for the legs and thighs BUT this one is NOT it. Sorry.... I like most of Mari Winsor's other workouts, especially the older ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its okay.","review":"Its okay. Need mat for your back and floor excercises.

I found the stretch band cumbersome to use in the timeframe the DVD alloted for each routine. By the time I had everything in place, the routine was almost over. Overall I was not impressed, and thankful I didn't pay full price.

Unfortunately, the publishers who reprinted the book never updated its contents. Dover editions contain exactly one page of new material - a \\"key to families\\" by an insect specialist (spiders are not insects) which is guaranteed to lead beginners wrong. Now, 100 years after Emerton wrote, essentially every spider species he discussed is known by a different name. The natural-history information, while largely correct, is also 100 years out of date. An arachnologist who already knows the current names of Emerton's spiders can still make use of his excellent drawings and photos, but an interested layperson will only be misled, and would be better off with something more current, such as Levi's \\"Spiders and their Kin.\\" Incidentally, the reason there are no common names in the book is that 95% of spiders have none!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Board","review":"This turned out to be a great purchase for my nephew. The board is made of wood and folds in half so you can keep the chess pieces inside for travel. It also is magnetic so pieces will not move if your playing in the car and hit the inevitable bump! Overall it is a great chess set, especially for travel or just taking to a friends house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces of Junk (yes--pieces)","review":"The pieces have such weak magnets that they move around easily on the board and/or fall over. I was expecting the magnets in the pieces would have been strong enough to hold the pieces in place--but they do not. Some of the pieces are also cracked, which in and of itself would not be a problem, but the weak magnets make the set useless as a magnetic travel chess set."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"Gave this as a birthday present.

Nice looking and great for breaks at work. The only sore point is the weakness of the puny magnets. The magnets are too weak to hold if the board is bumped.

Fabulous pop songs!","review":"I remember Martin Page as one of the writers of Starship's 1985 hit We Build This City, some songs by the Pointer Sisters and other artists. But this album that he put out in 1994 is by far one of the best pop albums made during that decade. Page just sounds fabulous on these songs, with loads of personal and emotional themes to load up 80 episodes of Oprah and lots of tissue on her set. I still love the title song, In the House of Stone and Light, which I still hear in some stores some 11 years later! But there are other good songs here, such as Door, Monkey, and some other songs. The arrangements are nice, the songwriting and music from Mr. Page very well done. It does have that adult contemporary pop feel in it, mostly midtempo to slow songs. The musicians sound nice on here, very much a live feel here. If you passed over on this album in the '90s, you need to rediscover it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD has true meaning","review":"You know, this CD has many songs that have meaning, mixed with excellent tunes. \\"The Door\\" has the most expressive meaning to it, and has the best sound.

In a sentence - it's about finding Mr./Mrs. Right or Mr./Mrs. Right Now at different times for different people in the story. I enjoyed it - and I don't really tend to go for those novels where the story can be a bit far fetched at times. For some reason, I didn't mind that so much in this novel. I don't know quite how to describe it - I would say cute, but then parts of the story are not so cute and may even turn your stomach!

I couldn't help laughing as he goes through mishap after mishap trying to find the woman of his dreams while Josie is dealing with the wedding from hell and her obnoxious ex-husband.

On the flight she meets Matt and they hit it off and arrange to meet up again later that day. Sparks fly, but through a series of blunders and misadventures the two lose contact with one another. At the same time Josie's soon to be ex-husband is flying over from London to try to win her back, and her cousin is about to make a disastrous mistake...This is a quick and undemanding read. The plot has just enough twists to keep you interested - although you know where it is probably going to end up at times it is hard to see how it is going to get there. However the comedic part of it falls flat. It's just not funny and at times it's downright stupid. Also, the characters are all very one-dimensional. This means that you end up not really caring what happens to any of them.An okay read, but no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I thought it was a wonderful modern day novel full of exciting things and instances.

The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is becuase the ending was semi-entertaining and half believable. For Better, For Worse goes on and on and on, twisting itself into a knot of repetition, and the writing is very dry, it is hard to hold your interest. I had to skip to the end, and even then, I could pick up the story because it was so predictable! The couple meets, they find out that they are soul mates, but they are both getting married to different people, both cancle weddings, look for each other, then find each other after way too many pages WASTED explaining, and live happily ever after the end.

How in the world are we, the reader, supposed to believe that Josie and Matt love each other when they don't spend more than a few hours together????? Especially knowing that Matt did what he did with Holly??? Would have been more believable if Matt and Holly ended up together. Maybe Josie was right and she was doomed to always pick Mr. Wrong! After all didn't Matt technically stray even though he just heard that she, Josie, claimed to love him and supposedly he felt the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong couple???","review":"I have to admit that I did like the book, in terms of the writing style. However, the ending was so abrupt and unbelievable. I wanted to know what happened with their relationship after those first five minutes back together.

Once they land in NY they decided to meet for an afternoon at the Statue of Liberty. After this point the book serisoulsy goes down hill. We are then treated to a cat and mouse game while Matt is looking for Josie. Throw into the mix an unbelievably lavish wedding, an affair (or 2 depending how you look at it), an ex husband who comes toting an expensive gift to win back Josie's affection, and a duck and it make a very unbelievable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I had high hopes for this book only to be disappointed. The beginning of the story seemed promising but I found myself not caring too much for the characters, not to mention that many of the situations are not believable; especially when Damian tried to pull off bringing the duck packed in his bag through security at the airport.

Apart from the outstanding version of \\"Hard Luck Woman\\"(Garth Brooks);a funky but cool version of \\"Deuce\\"(Lenny Kravitz);and a great job of \\"Christine Sixteen\\" by The Gin Blossoms this album is a real let down. The \\"Monsters Of Rock\\" deserve a better tribute."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD have been so great!","review":"Lenny Kravitz kicks this disc off with an amazing cover of Deuce. That was an amazing track. However, the rest of the tracks are far too experimental or performed by marginal artists. Honestly, I would have rather wiated 5 more years with the hopes of a double album featuring artists like STP, Megadeth, Metallica and the like. The Bosstones? How can you butcher a track like etroit Rock City? An instrumental version of Black Diamond? I know the title says \\"regrooved\\" but come on! There's a limit!Other good tracks are provided by Anthrax, Garth Brooks, and Toad the Wet Sprocket.

Great in theory, but just shoddy engineering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after Two Days","review":"I installed this mirror in our car two days ago.

I ordered the bust one size larger and the rib cage one size smaller and it fits very well. It's nice and tight under my breasts so it doesn't slide down, but not as tight as I wanted around my lower belly. The plus side is that since it's not too tight at the bottom, there is nothing getting \\"squeezed out\\" the bottom. The item is very pretty, it comes with removable garter straps, but no garters. The boning is not uncomfortable but is thick enough that it will show through any smooth garment. All-in-all I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I bought this product to wear with a fancy dress for a Sweet 16th party, it meets my expectation of making a slimmer figure and pushed my breast up. I bought this product in a 38C, my real size, but I realized that if I had bought a 36C it would be better. I had it on the tighter hooks and still, while dancing, the torsolette moved a little bit so I had to rearrange it a few times during the night. My recommendation is to buy it 1 size down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very supportive and true to size","review":"I haven't worn it yet for my wedding, but this is a lovely corset and very supportive. I wear a 34D and it fits well and really boosts the girls up. My only issue is that the back is pretty high, and my dress has a semi-low back. I was able to unhook the top few hooks and fold them under and it works, and is still supportive.

It's difficult to describe my feelings for this book; the complexity of the emotions, the depth of the historical vision, the intensity of the characters' passions combine to produce a novel that is hauntingly unforgettable. The religious themes interwoven with the narrative have created a story that is more intense and more meaningful than a simple account of the Pilgrimage of Grace as a political movement alone. For the discriminating, intellectually mature reader, this is a work that is prose-rich, thought-provoking, heart-breaking, and, in a word, exceptional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did well hope it lasts...","review":"I had one of these before it just suddenly stopped working...However I hope to not have the same experience with this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripp-off","review":"This was a dud.

Comin' Around is a good song, and Earle and Emmylou Harris sound great in their alternate parts, but for me they sound bad when singing together. The best songs are the awesome Rich Man's War and the defiant and irresistible F the CC. I saw Earle in concert last February in Dallas: if you're an Earle fan and like live music you'll want to see him sometime--he puts on a hell of a show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earle's music hijacked by his extreme left drivel","review":"OK, there are four songs that I find sonically, very appealing, on Earle's latest CD; the title song, Home To Houston, Warrior and Comin'Around. For me, these songs are enough to make this worth buying. Steve Earle and I, both 49 years of age, must have had the same record collection growing up; Neil Young, The Stones, Dylan and The Doors. Nobody cops their music better than Earle,adding his signature vocals and backed by one of the best bands around. So regardless of Earle's weak political drivel on this album, I still dig the sound of the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The well ran dry","review":"I hear many folk singers where I live who use vocal acrobatics to mask poor songwriting. Well that's what Earle is doing these days only he's using his brand of pissed off politics. This album was rushed? Why? Because the world had to hear what he has to say before it could continue turning? I for one couldn't care less. What is it about recovering coke head rock stars that makes them think they know better than the rest of us how the world should be run? Reading his own book tells me he doesn't have a clue how to run his own life. Let's face it, his creativity has dried up and he's running on foul smelling fumes. Make some music again for God's sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"please give us music not propaganda !","review":"Steve Earle was a country-rock singer that I liked in the 80's.

They didn't just jump on the revolution/hate Bush bandwagon because it was suddenly cool - they've hated Bush for a long time. I will say that this album is extremely intelligent for a man with only an 8th grade education and for those who criticize his \\"Condi Condi\\" song - maybe he's being sincere? You don't know. He has been married about 20 times... maybe he thinks it's about time for another \\"switch up\\"? And lets face it: Condi is hot. A little out of his league, but you can't blame a guy for tryin, can you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't get this album!","review":"I do not know why because I am 1) a huge Steve Earle fan and 2) anti-Bush but I really did not enjoy this Cd at all. I think the reason, for me at least, is that it was too overly tendentious. While Earle was focusing so heavily on promoting a message, the songs really lost a lot musically. Maybe with the election now over, he'll turn back to writing songs that are less political and more eenjoyable to listen in the mode of \\"I Feel Alright\\" or \\"Transcendental Blues\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"worst ever","review":"Steve just keeps getting worse with every new release. The days of \\"Train a comin\\" are long gone and so is any hope of well written material.Although I do get a kick out of Steve irritating the right wingers with this CD unfortunately there is little here of any musical value."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Kool-Aid","review":"I have been vascillating as to whether or not to buy this album. I am a long-time Earle fan, and have pushed his music onto many others. I am a genre-crossing music lover, and Earle's diversity has long been, for me, a barometer of all that was right about music. Then a hiccup. I was remarkably underwhelmed by Jerusalem. I have no problem with a person, musician or otherwise, expressing their political opinions. I do have a problem with a person with the seeming expectation that, because they believe \\"X\\", you should as well. And when that attitude is accompanied by a catchy tune, it moves beyond \\"problem\\" into down-right disgruntlement. God Bless Steve Earle and his \\"right\\" to prattle on, to rail against those on the right AND those in the middle. But don't expect us all to line up at the Kool-Aid stand, money in hand, repeating the mantra, Thank You Sir, May I Have Another!After hearing the new album once, I rushed out and bought.....an old Merle Haggard."},{"rating":"1","title":"The music is good, the lyrics insipid","review":"Come on Steve, if you're going to make a statement, just do it. This rambles all over and says nothing. What is the point of Condi, Condi? Sure it's a catchy tune, but it could have been anyone, it's no political statement.Sounds like you were hanging around with a bunch of stoned friends bitching about politics and out of that rambling you wrote these songs. Stick to what you know or do some research and get below the surface. Angry vague ravings don't mean much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened","review":"I have been a big Steve Earle fan for many years. I understand the reviewer who said that he gets worse with each new release. Eventhough I think Jerusalem was worse I think both albums have the same problem. I don't mind the political message. Earle seems to have a lot to say even if you don't agree with him, it just seems that for all the rage and information that he is trying to get across the music suffers. Some of the material makes it difficult to discern much of a melody. Maybe instead of writing a couple of topical songs and cobbling together a few more in order to finish the CD prior to the election, he might be better served writing an op-ed column and collecting enough great material to make a whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"okay, it's hard to be overtly political without sounding a little cheesy, but i appreciate the general earnestness of this album. i mean, who else put out an entire album about how messed up american politics are right after bush was elected last term? answer: no one. that takes some balls. and whoever wrote that \\"condi condi\\" is apalling clearly has no sense of humor. that's one of my favorite tracks on this album, it's a great piece of satire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching To The Converted","review":"It's no secret that Steve Earle's politics are of the far left. But after the mostly fine Jerusalem, this record sounds forced. The title track is prime late-period Earle, but songs like F The Fcc and Condi Condi could have been left off. Earle is vastly more effective as a story teller, as in Rich Man's War, where he can inhabit a character. Earle should be commended for continuing to exercise his right to free speach but in large part he's \\"preaching to the choir\\". His increasingly \\"in your face\\" approach has become more off putting than thought provoking at this stage. To get his message out Earle needs to look for some common ground that he can use to draw in the non-fan. He's in danger of becoming the mirror image to right wing blowhards like Rush Limbaugh. With Earle's talent and smarts, that would be a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Earle At Best","review":"The people giving this cd 5 stars must be doing so on it's political message and not it's musical content. As a long time Earle fan I can honestly say that Steve doesn't break any new boundaries here, and as the Amazon review said this was obviously a rushed album. It has a few highpoints, but it's not a start to finish good effort. On the other hand, even bad Earle is as good as most anything else being released right now. If you're new to Steve this isn't the disc to pick up, try El Corazon, Jerusalem or Transcendental Blues. Hey Steve, next time spend a little more time on the record and get it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a shame","review":"What a shame that a once great songwriter has sunk to such a low. Like all the TRUE Steve Earle fans, I find this album to be a nothing but a bad piece of music. I have no problem with him voicing his political view, see Ellis Unit One and Jonathan's Song. Both songs are obvious views about the death penalty, but unlike this new garbage they are great songs. Like some other reviewers wrote the days of train a comin, copperhear road, i feel alright ( all great albums) are long gone. Didn't he write on train a comin some speal about how train a comin wasn't his unplugged album and how he hates MTV. Funny how things change, he is MTV. All he needs to do now is to replace Emmylou with Babs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another case for No Child Left Behind","review":"Whatever happened to Steve Earle? The one who used to be a pretty good country musician and didn't dwell in realms he knew very little about?It's a shame that so many performers (Steve, Elvis Costello, The Roches, and Bruce Springsteen and BonJovi come immediately to mind) feel that they are so desperate for the attention of record executives that they feel the need to patronize them with silliness and empty-headed rhetoric bordering on lunacy.Can't we get back to being creative and, more importantly, entertaining?Oh, and great job on the Air America show, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Earle Has Gone Off The Deep End","review":"What kind of man would think that any sane American wants to hear his endless ranting and raving about world events. And that goes for all the other \\"Self-Appointed\\" Extreme Left-Wing Foreign Advisors in the music world. Earle's music and his mind have really gone off the deep end in the last few years. These songs all have catchy and shocking titles... but the music within contains absolutely no substance or soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, people, look at what's going on","review":"If I really wanted to know what Earle thought, I freakin' call and ask him, not pay him $10 to hear him sing his thoughts on politics. Oh, and I'm sure he'll be giving a majority of the profits he makes on this album to needy people anre charities. he's a typical Hollywood/music star: they love to tell people what to do with their money but they don't want to throw all theirs around. If I had half the money this dipsh*t had, I'd be so freakin' happy that a guy with a gun in my face couldn't get me to stop smiling. So, basically, Steve, SHUT UP AND SING! If you want to give your political opinions, go on FNC and do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album and Artist are Trash no-count Cimmies","review":"This CD was \\"rushed to market\\" all right and it whows in SPADES.This man is mainly a no-count dimwit,a cokehead and a jailbird FELON.He doan't want to do a day's honest work and I am ashamed to say I own two of his CD's before I wised up.Does he this think he will save the Demorats from defeat, NEVER.He may be well meaning but he is too stupid to know where reality really begins in this world. I think what he has left of his brain has been FRIED. Go lay down Steve and have you EVER VOTED? Are you really from Florida?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I listened to \\"I feel alright\\" & this is no \\"I feel alright\\"","review":"I am one who doesn't mind politics mixed with music as long as the music is good. See U2 (sunday Bloody sunday) or the Alarm ( A new South Wales), but I don't like it when it is bad music, see Springsteen (41 shots). This stuff is bad. I have been a fan of Steve Earle since guitar town came out in 87 and have purchased each release since with great anticipation.This one lacks the groove that is usually associated with his music. The songs seem like they are rushed and have little direction except that he wishes to bash the GOP.Save that for Chris Matthews or Nightline...Steve, give us another gem like Transcendental Blues or I feel alright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Steve, give it a rest for a while, ok?","review":"Man, would I give anything to hear some more of the Steve Earle that wrote \\"Tom Ames' Prayer\\" (Train A Comin') and \\"Dixieland\\" (The Mountain), among other classic tunes. Instead we keep hearing more of the same political bickering here. I'm no right wing nut either, just a concerned fan that is tired of hearing the same \\"I Hate George W. Bush, conservatives, and anyone who disagrees with me\\" song that seems to unveil itself multiple times on his last few records. As others have mentioned, there is an evident relationship between Earle's increasing political song nature and decreasing song quality. The lyrics are no longer given the attention that they once were, those unparalleled lyrics that once made him great. The musical accompaniment is also lacking the drive that was once there...a real shame considering at one time I thought Steve Earle was one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrically interesting, musically bombastic","review":"No problem with the politics. With as many of Nashville's hacks up there with their flag guitars to boost their record sales, I don't mind Steve Earle tweaking us and giving us something to think about, to talk about. I am beginning to tire of the SOUND of his albums, however. They are little more than sonic sludge bombs. The oversaturated wall of sound just wears me out over the course of this and his previous couple of albums. I love to rock it out, but how about a dynamic break in the action once in a while? I got spoiled by seeing him with the Bluegrass Dukes a couple of months ago. Now THERE was some dynamic variety and tension, plus I was amazed to hear Steve's voice sound the best I have heard in years. On these big electric efforts, it is little more than a compressed, shredded growl anymore. That said, glad he is doing what he does, lyrically. Musically, I am losing some interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened???","review":"Pass on this cd.Steve Earle lets his anger get the better of him and allows it to ruin this cd.There isn't really 1 notable song on this, which is really out of line compared to all his other cd's.He says on the inside liner that they rushed through this to get it out before the election and it really shows.I just wish he had put that note on the outside, then I wouldn't have rushed out to buy it.Even if you agree with Steve Earle politically this one is still very bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Compared to his other material, a weak effort...","review":"...and I'm not sure how much effort went into this disc. The political lyrics aside, it is not a strong effort musically. You can't take your art (or your fans) for granted and put out self-indulgent prattle like this... if it is good work the music will speak for itself. Frankly he can do better and this record doesn't diminish his other work... in fact his other work is such that he will eventually be recognized as one of American music's great voices. I'll give him a free pass on this one. He has to have something to sing and sell at the protest rallies. But if you are new to Steve Earle, start at Transcendental Blues or Train A Comin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I am a huge Steve Earle fan and am sad to say that this album pretty much stinks. Steve is capable of creating great music, but this was obviously just slapped togther to try to generate sales in advance of the 2004 election. Neither the music nor the message are interesting or compelling. After string of great records like \\"Train a' Comin',\\" \\"I Feel Alright,\\" \\"El Corazon,\\" and \\"The Mountain,\\" Steve seems to have lost his interest in creating great music and instead wants to rage against the system. That would be OK with me if he would devote more time and energy into the music that accompanies the message. Here, it is clear he did not do that. A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I am a big Steve Earle fan. While his big hits are catchy and memorable, no song on this album qualifies. I have come to love Steve for his way of hiding an important life lesson within the tune, rather than beating a dead horse with militantly-liberal propaganda. This album contains far too much of the later and none of the former.Some of the tunes on the album are nice and just the same ole' Steve. However, I hesitate to call many of them music.While it pains me to give such a harsh review to a legend like Steve Earle, this is not a work of art. This reeks of propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss Steve","review":"This may be the least interesting cd I've ever bought. Whatever happened to \\"New York City\\",\\"Fearless Heart,\\"The Other Kind\\",and many others that just me you want to hit replay and just say Steve \\"Freakin\\" Earle. Ditch the professor glasses, get off the Al Franken and Janeane Garofalo clueless soapbox, and tell us about the misfits and outcasts melodically like it used to be. We'll take you back. The two stars, by the way, are strictly for the appearance of Emmy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately boring","review":"I'm beginning to believe that Mr. Earle has gotten himself into a rut that he is not sure how to get out of. This insightful singer-songwriter seems to be pioneering no new ground for himself and, expecially if you've been a fan of his earlier albums, listerners will find the same themes raked over again and again. Strident advocates of a cause always run the danger of becoming pretentious or, and this can be just as bad for their agenda, so expected as to become boring - we've heard it all before and it was better the first few times around. I think Mr. Earle is far too sincere to be consciously pretentious but all artists can become too much of themselves in their presentations. Having said that, if you like his voice and arrangements, you will like this CD, even with all the familiarity. I'm probably undermarking this CD because of my disappointment as a fan - take a listen for yourself and see what you think but try before you buy to avoid your own disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freedom personified","review":"Steve Earle takes no prisoners on TRSN. In the purest tradition of protest music, his voice is loud and clear. Yet he maintains the sense of purpose and direction that has made him the vanguard of american song writers. This disc may be hard to digest for someone with a conservative world view, but freedom is a wonderful thing and few understand this better than Mr. Earle. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but worth the price","review":"Is it perfect? No. Is it important? Yes. Rushed? You bet. Is it country? Is it rock & roll? The answer to both is not really. For the most part a very good CD, except for Condi Condi, which I now just program out. But the CD is much better than the version of Home to Houston rushed to radio stations that was mixed so poorly the lyrics were unitelligable.To those complaining about the political content, Hey you know what you're getting when you buy it. If you want right wing, buy Ted Nugent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The word \\"immediate\\" best describes this disc","review":"This might not be Steve's best work to date, but it is a required listen. Tracks like Rich man's war and the Gringo's tale stand up to some of his best songs. This disc was quickly crafted so it could be released before (as Steve says) the most important presidential election in our lifetime. Steve has always been a leading voice in democracy, as we slowly allow our leaders to take it away from us. Please listen to him, the revolution starts now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Year's Most Important Album","review":"This may be the most important rock and roll record made since Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young recorded Ohio three and a half decades ago. Nobody will ever accuse Earle of being objective, but he certainly is passionate, and that's more important. He does get playful on Condi, Condi, and romantic with Emmylou Harris on Comin' Around, but the heart of this record is in the title cut, as well as within the tracks Home To Houston and Rich Man's War, both of which describe the helplessness of the men and women who have been put in the line of fire overseas. Whether you agree with Earle's idealogy or not, we ARE supposed to be living in a democracy, where the exchange of ideas is a good thing. Unfortunately, there aren't too many artists out there with the fire and eloquence of Mr. Earle.If you hear one record from 2004, this should be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Holiday Book","review":"Groundhog Day is a good introduction for young children to the holiday.

This CD has a feeling very similar to that captured by the outstanding performances in Melbourne. Jarrod Emick is brilliant as Joe Hardy with great feeling and good strength and fine tone - much like David Harris brought to the role in the Australian production. The rest of the company also brings much verve and energy to the show.This is an excellent CD with very welcome added tracks that flesh out the story line for the uninitiated. A preferred choice to the original and now quite dated, production which is also available on CD. Highly recommended - you won't be disappointed, 'cause \\"It's got Heart\\"!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yankee Fan - and Loved It Anyway","review":"I saw the musical back in 1994, and met the stars of the show as well. Jarrod Emmick was one of the most gifted newcomers to broadway that I had seen in years, with a voice that could lift a house off the ground. I remembered Victor Garber from years ago, when he was in the movie, \\"Godspell\\" - I have his autograph on my tape of the soundtrack, in fact. I also had this album on tape, signed by the principals, but I can't seem to find it - it seems to be lost somewhere. At any rate, I'm not too upset - I still have the cover, which has the cast signatures on it. I intend to purchase the CD, since I don't think they sell tapes anymore.

They sound like they could be good, maybe it was a bad producer, or them trying to be radio whores. Good singer, but pretty mundane melodies. The guitar work and drums are really really average. I wouldnt spend any money on this CD if i were you. go for something original, expand your horizon, i.e. Circa Survive, Paulson, Portugal. The Man, From First to Last, A static lullaby, The bled, cursive, he is legend, gatsbys american dream, The sound of animals fighting, vendetta red.

Don't buy this model unless you want to spend this money several times a year. If you don't care about reliability, then I'd give it 4 stars. Maybe the newer models have different motor designs, but I wouldn't count on it.

It is a softer jelly and does not transmit the vibration like it use to. Also, the rabbit ears no longer have the textured nubs on them.

The \\"bunny ears\\" portion quit working. So I researched the internet, and Googled \\"Impulse 5 sex toy\\". I found this one and read all the reviews. Men and women gave it high ratings. So, I decided to order this product, with hopes that it would perform exactly as the previous Impulse 5 had done. WRONG!!!!!! Even on the highest speed, the \\"Bunny ears\\" were quite disappointing. It made a high pitched whining noise that the other one never had. I bought new batteries and tried it again. I tried all the speeds, all the vibration patterns.

It's a great song with a wonderful video (available on The Bad Seeds' videos compilation). But the best part about this single is the B-side, \\"The Ballad of Robert Moore and Betty Coltraine.\\" It is one of my favorite Nick Cave songs (and that says a lot, considering his prolific output). \\"The Willow Garden\\", with vocals by pianist Conway Savage is also a nice touch to this trio of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not read yet","review":"Have heard good revies of it and am looking for the trilogy.

This is better. Way better.The only author that has ever kept me glued to a book as much as Manchester's is Michael Crichton. It's odd to compare a biography to Jurassic Park, but Manchester makes history come alive. He spends a lot of time and care setting the \\"culture\\" in a way that is not pedantic or boring (unlike some Civil War histories I've read!). And then he builds on Churchill's stories in a way that makes you feel like you're in Churchill's shoes, with the same issues and challenges.Unfortunately, there is no Volume 3 about the war years. Manchester's illness prevented this. What a sad loss to history.Read Vol 1 and 2. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Adventure Tale\\" portion of Churchill's life","review":"Before the cigar-chomping, top-hat-wearing portly gentleman hit the scene, there was a young man who nearly flunked out of school, chased war around the world, played polo, participated in the world's last meaningful cavalry charge, was a war correspondent, and escaped imprisonment as a POW in the Boar War. Churchill got around plenty before settling down in Parliament and \\"Visions of Glory\\" covers that portion of Churchill's life.This book takes an exciting life and brings you into it. As good as biography gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent History of Churchill's Early Years","review":"The beginning of William Manchester's (planned) three volume history of Winston Churchill, this book is an excellent history not only of Churchill, but of Victorian and Edwardian England, colonialism, Victorian social and sexual mores, World War I, and the 1920s. The book is diligently; one might say obsessively researched, and is written on a huge canvas. Many myths about Churchill are addressed and repaired in this work; and the full story of Gallipoli and Churchill's war as a battalion commander in the trenches is also addressed. Mr. manchester also does not shy away from the difficult task of addressing the death of Churchill's father from a progressively encroaching syphilis, or Churchill's mother's role in advancing his career. although Mr. Manchester is clearly an admirer of Churchill, he presents a very balanced view of Churchill's successes and failures. A marvelous book, eclipsed only by the second volume of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent--Almost as good as WSC's Marlborough","review":"Excellent book. Interesting to read along with other British histories including Churchill's own. His personality can be understood better by reading about his mother, Jennie Jerome (Lady Randollph Churchill; Mrs. George Cornwallis-West). Her Autobiography contains many pictures--she was truly beautiful and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Biographies of Sir Winston Churchill I have read","review":"Being an admirer of SIr Winston Churchill, I have read much material on this man's life. This series is by far the most comprehensive I have come across. The author is informative with copious detail but leaving the reader to form his/her own opinion about this significant, historical figure. If you like history, adventure, and a great narrative, this is the one to read. It presents Sir Winston, warts and all, bringing him to life for all to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Not the book to read if you're wanting clear and organized biography.

I had previously read his book on Churchhill covering 1932-1940(The Last Lion). I decided to read this book because I thought this would be interesting too. The book covers Churchhills life from birth up to 1932. I have to say it was a disappointment. Manchester is great but Churchill's life up to 1932 is very boring compared to how reviting his life was after 1932. If I had it to read again I would pass. Not worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"I have never been interested in WWII but always meant to read about Churchill. About a third of the way into this book, I was hooked. I could hardly put down the 2nd volume and it's not like I don't know how it ends! Fascinating and the writing is absolutely wonderful! I tried the Churchills in Love and War while I was waiting for Volume 3 of The Last Lion and gave it up halfway through because Manchester's writing style had spoiled me and the other suffered considerable in comparison.Looking forward to diving into Chuchill's version next beginning with The Gathering Storm and comparing his writing to Manchester!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest biographies ever written","review":"A great biography of a great man! I couldn't put this book down and was sad to have it end. What a life Churchhill led. What would the West have done without his leadership. I am so sad that William Manchester could not finish this trilogy as he is one of the finest biographers I have ever read. His biography on MacArthur was fabulous also"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Brilliant biography by an author who is to the political left of his subject. Manchester doesn't let his political beliefs color his judgement of Churchill. The Victorian Era comes to life with Manchester's prose. The author's defense of Churchill's strategy in the failed Dardanelles campaign is convincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY BERNSTEIN FANS NEED APPLY","review":"The production, conducted by Leonard Bernstein, who composed the score and wrote the libretto, can be considered the official version of what he had in mind. As such Bernstein fans, as well as those who are interested in the best known American Man of Music in his time, will find it a most useful source for judging the merits of the composer at an early stage of his development as a major purveyor of classical music. For that purpose, a contribution to understanding the development of The Maestro, I recommend it highly. Considered as a contribution to 20th century music or to Bernstein's stature, it is a distinctly minor work.Animation as scenery, singing , orchestral support and over-all direction seems to make the most of the material.In sum, an enjoyable brief (44 minutes)visit with an amiable Bernstein work but no great shakes as a contribution to 20th Century opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob hope and lucy ball at their best.","review":"What can i say about this movie, bob hope and lucy ball were at their best as far as i can say anyways.

His \\"advice\\" consists of telling his readers to be nice as well, and to ... get this: readbooks. Yup, Sanders seems to think all you need to know to succeed in business is how to get yourself to a bookstore, find the section on business books and start reading.

I'll be more positive, well read and generous with my network now, and that is all I could expect from a book. I loved it. However, Tim's tone is passive aggressive to the 'holders of the status quo' and I'm not surprised to see the polar scores (mine = 5 stars) and others = 1.

Me'shell NdegeOcello duets with Mr. Mellencamp and her pulsating bass provides a strong backbone to the song. The party atmosphere of that song is in sharp contrast to the rest of the album. The album's title is appropriate as the other songs are barer in nature.

We purchased a $14.95 suscription from Napster so he could download unlimited songs into it only to find out that it is not compatible with them so in addition to the monthly fee they also want you to pay .99 per song. In order to download music without the fee it would have had to be the Zen Nano Plus. I was under the impression that the regular Nano was also compatible. So be careful what you purchase and make sure you get what your looking for. Other that that it seems to be a good player with good quality sound and easy to use menu. A word of advise to parents thinking about joining Napster, don't do it.

I say near perfect because the cooling is phenomenal, the connections such as top mounted usb/firewire are ultra convenient, and the looks and build are excellent. The only reason it is a 4 star is because the power supply mounts on the bottom. A decent idea, but it means that the main power cable must have a very long power line, or it won't reach your motherboards connector. I had to buy a new one, because my 1 year old psu was too short.

To some extent, you can work around this by rearranging hard disks or the drive trays themselves, but I happen to use this case for a system with a big graphics board and a *lot* of hard disks.The result just barely fits, and the final system ended up sufficiently cramped that I couldn't implement decent cable management in places.

I have all of the fans running at medium speed and it is quiet, quieter than my my old case which had 4 92mm and 2 PSU fans. You could hear it in the other room. The ANTEC I can't hear in any room other the computer room and then only sitting next to it.The case sits under my desk and the 200mm fan keeps it cool underneath.

It also has built in mounts for additional 120mm fans on the clear side-panel, and on the 2nd harddrive bay. The clear side-panel looks excellent with the blue-led fans. The top-front audio, usb, and firewire ports are also very convenient. Easy installation and customization, and excellent instructions for assembly/modification.

From what I've experienced so far, this is a very good case for beginners. It's got plenty of space for several components, it's sturdy, and all of the fans help keep the interior very cool. My graphics card (GeForce 8800GT) does fit a little snug as the HDD comes close to bumping it, but I still had enough room for the power cables and SATA cables. I could do without the blue LED's on the fans, but I guess they provide a little bit of flair. I do like the side window as it lets me see what's going on in there. Overall, it's a nice case. The pictures really don't do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value - Great Performance","review":"Purchased this case to house a fast graphics rendering system, not a \\"gamer\\". The issues normally associated with a rendering box are somewhat similar to the gamer in that running the quad cpu, drives, memory, and graphics card for long periods of intense computing can allow damaging or life-shorting heat to build up in the components. This case provides excellent ventilation and air flow along with plenty of space for drives. I could live without the clear side and blue led's but it still gets the job done well at this price.

And while this book isn't really a natural history, the style works well for showcasing Jim Hamm's own personal history of his Texas ranch, the history of that areas peoples, and his land/hunting ethic.

So, while Donna's preparations for moving are coming along nicely, Dic is partying and neglecting his moving duties.Since many of the books out there on leaving home are textbook in style, and most young adults won't read a word of them, Leaving Home has brevity on its side, along with those helpful lists at the back of the book. The problem is the good girl/bad boy style garbles the message.

Its main flaw is a somewhat murky style of writing, and a somewhat slow-moving plot. It did hold my interest, however, and most Star Trek fans will enjoy this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diane Duane is one of the best Star Trek writers out there","review":"Anyone whose a fan of Star Trek who say's they don't like the books has never read any of Diane Duane's stories. These are imaginative tales with action and philosphy. She is one writer who truly understands the characters we love, especially from the original series. She also has some of the most wonderful aliens.The Romulan way is a sequal to My Enemy my Ally. This tale has McCoy being captured by the Romulans to stand trial for his crimes against the Empire. However he is there for a reason. To contact a Federation operative that has stopped writing reports and learn if that person wants to come back to the Federation. Interesting detail on Romulan politics and history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not common","review":"\\"The Romulan Way\\" is the second book in Diane Duane's Rihannsu series, following \\"My Enemy, My Ally\\".The book is original bacause it's located completely in the Rihannsu homeworld and has two clear main characters: McCoy and Arrhae; an ORIGINAL character, who's written as well as an apparent Mry-Sue character can be written.Believe me, I abhore Mary-Sue characterization, but you don't even notice it in this particular novel.I must warn all Spock and Kirk fans though, because one of the book's strenghts is that the two usual main characters of the series are not includet.It is a rare opportunity to see those extremely overused characters give room to more interesting, new characters.The book left me a little frustrated though, because I felt it might have had more to offer than it dit.If that potential had been used, I might have given this book all five stars. Not perfect, but a close must-read nontheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witless","review":"This is billed as Ocean's Eleven meets The Breakfast Club. Hardly.It's nearly impossible to sympathize with any of the characters, as they're either written to be caricatures (the quadratic equation genius), or the actors portraying them just can't act (the basketball player).I won't spend time tearing this down, because writing this much is really a waste - I just want others to know that this is really, really bad. The entire plot to steal the SAT scores is just ludicrous, and there are more holes in their scheme than there are in the heads of a million birdbrained idiots.The only redeeming quality is the inclusion of Scarlett Johannsson, who seems to add light to everything she touches.

As the Amazon.com description reads \\"mutuant hybrid of a heist movie and The Breakfast Club\\", it's exactly right, but neither story is done well. This film is also filled cliche' upon cliche'. It is not funny. It is not entertaining. It is, however, a good way to waste 90 minutes of life with zero fulfilmment. Not even Chris Evans and Erika Christensen, the \\"beauties\\" of the movie, could save this horrible script.

Oh what a TV movie ending... 2 hours of my life watching the kids try to steal the SAT answers and in the end..they chicken out? Wow, gutless wonders and a jip to anyone that agreed with the sentiments echoed early in the film about the SAT. A movie that lacks the courage of its own convictions. That is ABC afternoon special territory.When this movie started and I realized that one of the kid's dad owned the building that ETS was in I thought... well this movie will be over fast. But 2 hours later, even with keys to the building, these kids can't get the SAT answers, I realized why they SHOULD go to 2nd tier schools.

I found the plot very interesting along with the well thought out variety of characters. It is easy to connect to a particular character right off the bat (let's hope its not the stoner), which provides for some personal enjoyment while watching. This is the type of movie that starts off strong by catching your interest quickly and continues to throw out puzzling dilemas while the characters are attempting the theft of the SAT scores. I thought this movie was hilarious and offered several themes, yet I think it deserves to stick at a rental store instead of in your movie collection. It seems to be a great one-time-viewing-pleasure type of movie. Thus, be sure to check out The Perfect Score some way or another and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun movie","review":"This movie combines elements of \\"Mission Impossible\\" and \\"The Breakfast Club\\", then dumbs it down to appeal to its younger audience.

Nevertheless, I liked it that Gideon always tried to protect his Harriet. I did not like that housekeeper that was always fainting. I would have fired her the first time she called Gideon a beast.

I like other books written by Amanda Quick and a mystery to solve alongside a budding romance usually leaves a smile on my face. However the further I got into this book the worst my mood became. The heroine is beyond annoying. I don't mind having a hobby or even being eccentric about a particular interest, but every other word out of her mouth is bone this bone that. I didn't believe the romance between her and the hero. It was force and it seemed fights were always set up between them so that they could end up making out only to fight again once they finished. If you're looking for a book to take your breath away and characters you want to root for, or a love story to end all love story--this is not it. Not worth the hours of hoping maybe a turn of the page will reveal something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"soooo Boring!!!","review":"This just isn't my week, this is the second book that I regret taking a chance on.

They got along from the start and continued to get along until the bitter end of the book, snore!!! I found the leading lady slightly annoying and also pushy. I honeslty do not know why this book took so long to wrap up, to me it could have been a short story, couple meet, couple kiss etc, get engaged end of story. The reason why I gave this book two stars instead of one is because the writing was not terrible, I have read one other amanda quick book that I liked, there was tension and something to keep me turning the pages....gosh I hope my luck gets better I can't afford to keep buying books that put me to sleep!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong characters who are funny as hell","review":"I first read this a long time ago after picking it randomly from the library and enjoyed it so much that I decided I needed to read it again a few months after.

Not only does Gideon have a blotched past that is responsible for his woe, but he is scarred and finds his face to be utterly repulsive. Now I ask you....is this man begging to be nurtured or what? I personally found him to be at the height of sexiness. Of course, where would he be without his wonderfully lively heroine to come rescue him from his despair?

I paid $0.99 for it at Walmart but I still feel a little cheated. lol But seriously this was the worst version I have ever scene. Watch the ones with Ciaran Hinds, Timothy Dalton, or any other version!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Jane Eyre on DVD","review":"This is the lowest quality DVD I have ever purchased. I just received it and watched it today. Even the YouTube upload of this \\"Jane Eyre\\" is better quality than this DVD. The red tone fades in and out during the the opening and closing scenes. Much of the screen is so dark so often you can't tell what is happening. I only bought it because I had the other 8 adaptations of this great English classic, most of which I really enjoy. I think that even if the color and continuity were as good as the original broadcast 40+ years ago, this would still be the worst of the nine: worst screenplay, worst cast, worst everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A expansive tale of the west","review":"Lonesome Dove, the book is even better than the movie and I thought that was pretty special.

I love Vampire stories anyway, but these were so well written and the stories flowed very well. These are very erotic, steamy & hot stories. I couldn't get enough! I loved the story of Don Rafael and Ethan (two of the vamps) and their first encounter with a young maiden. Lets just say they had their way with her and she wanted more! LOL I won't give away the story lines, but I do highly recommend this ebook. It is a wonderful read and one that you will pull out again and again. Ms Whiteside, if you read this, when is the next book coming out? I want more of these fine, sexy, erotic vamps!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most","review":"I thought the formulation was easier on my scalp than most of the other products I've tried. It did bring out more of the reds in my hair probably due to the \\"honey\\" colorant. I think I will try more of an ash next time since I was actually going more for a lighter blonde. Although my husband claims it looks very natural and it matches my littlest ones hair color."},{"rating":"1","title":"men who have walked with god, by sheldon cheney","review":"A followup to my previous review... The writing in the book is still wonderful but the publishing is of the worst quality. It looks like the 1945 hardcover book has been photocopied and black and white stats made of the illustrations (which were black and white photographs of fine art prints). Since I own a copy of the 1945 hardcover edition, I compared page by page, and it definitely does look just like a copy job. The cover is flimsy and unattractive. I was actually wondering if it was legally published or stolen, but I don't know how to find out. The star I gave it was for the writing, not the publishing! What a shame to put out such a pitiful edition of a beautiful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Good Book","review":"This book is a good crafts book.

More Funky Stuff4. Hollywood Swinging(I think many other's would concur with my choices - they were heavy favorites with everyone!!)At the time (1973), Kool and the Gang made a serious dent in the music scene with this effort. \\"Jungle Boogie\\" is what landed them on mainstream television, where they were introduced to the nation (on \\"Soul Train\\" and NBC-Television). They were a force that had to be reckoned with!Five stars for Kool and the Gangs \\"Wild and Peaceful.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable but fragile","review":"These are very comfortable shoes and I really like the rubber soles. The problem however is that because the leather is so soft it scuffs and scrapes easily.

The art is extremely idiosyncratic, stylized, and modern, and it is not very appealing.

For one thing, a nineteen year old cannot pass for a thirteen year old no matter how young she may look. The characteristic thirteen-year-old outbursts seems over acted when done by an adult. Then there was the utterly self centered lifestyle of all the adults.One could hardly find a family that more thoroughly and consistently violated about every traditional family value there is. If you like a believable heroine in your movies, and if you care at all about unnecessarily exposing your kids to immorality, you'd do best to skip this loser of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"My African Grey LOVED this.

These are stories of real people written in such a way that you immediately connect with these folks, and it gives you a peaceful and uplifting feeling.

I just didn't feel any urgency. For a twice blessed amnesiac, I expected to feel sympathetic towards the heroine; instead I felt sorry for Sam and partially for myself for finishing the book!

But a fall at home causes Amy to hit her head and suddenly she doesn't remember Amy at all, only Adrienne; and Adrienne is scared to death for her life. Sam struggles with his pain and fear as he helps Adrienne to put her life back together.From beginning to end, I was pulled in to this drama. I could empathize with both Sam and Adrienne. The emotions are very real. Great job to Ms. Barrett.

His contribution to modern cinema, good and bad, is immense. This book is the only substantial contribution to Romero scholarship to date. Unfortunately, it is horribly written. Flat, dry and repetitious. Numerous grammatical and typographical errors. So, at best, this is a problematic work for everyone. Most \\"horror fans\\" will be repelled by the academic tone. Most \\"film scholars\\" will be repelled by the poor writing and the at times forced interpretations. Nevertheless, until something better comes along, this is all we have.Mr. Williams, it should be noted, also edited a worthwhile collection of Romero essays for the University of Mississippi Press. That book includes an introduction by Williams that is just as poorly written. The kicker is that this guy is a professor at a major university. In my opinion, he should audit some classes in composition."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's nerd-tastic","review":"Okay, I'm not gonna lie: the writing could be better. But the subject is awesome and the ideas are interesting. I love that he treats Romero's work with the same seriousness as Emile Zola's work. I, for one, think Romero's work has a lot to say about American society, whether he intended for it to or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"The man fron Greek and Roman, an old fashioned charmer","review":"I first read this book 30 years ago and, though it has no pretensions to literary greatness, it has a certain old fashioned charm with likeable characters, a feel good, if predictable, ending and a rollicking swift moving tale. sometimes things don't have to be imposing to be endearing and I rediscovered this book as a fondly remembered old friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Uber-Cane!","review":"If you need to walk with a cane, but you're still active outdoors, this is a killer alternative.As a cane, it's lightweight, solid, well-balanced. It's so nicely balanced that it almost swings itself forward for your next stride.It extends to a length more than sufficient to function as a walking stick in rough or hilly terrain, and the handle is beautifully designed for this purpose (turn it one way for cane use, the other way for walking stick use.You can put a rubber rip on it for city walking or use its carbide tip for hiking.The handle comes off to reveal a camera mount. Nothing like having a monopod when you need one!Plus there's built-in shock absorption, and lots of cool conversion tables printed on the barrel.What a joy to use something so well thought-out that you can not only find nothing to criticize, but it actually reveals itself to be more useful and versatile than you expected!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great of a show piece","review":"This was not a good purchase, a waste of money. I have a Leki walking stick that I love but this walking stick as not up to the quality that I expected. It had trouble locking in place and would let you down at the worst times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great OXO product","review":"This is just a solid fat separator with all the features that you need. It works very nicely and cleans well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Effective but not as heat resistant as I'd have liked","review":"Had this fat separator for a couple months and had used it with good results. The plunger to fill the spout with air is surprisingly effective at keeping fat out of the spout. Was reducing some pan drippings a couple weeks back and didn't have time to let them cool (my sous vide partridges - just browned - were already starting to get cold). So I dumped the contents into my handy-dandy fat separator and to my dismay the plastic body started to deform. To its credit, it didn't spring a hole and spew forth boiling grease onto my counter (and then floor), but I had to toss the sauce and make due with a sauceless entree. Will go with a laboratory glass model this round. A bit more expensive, but not if you have to buy only one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"Every time I have tried to use this thing the gravy does not come out of the spout. While tipping the cup the contents will overflow out of the top before they pour out of spout. It appears that the hole at the bottom of the cup where the spout begins plugs up very easily. Not only that but the angle required to make gravy come out of the spout is more than that of the angle needed to cause the cup to overflow out of the top. Complete piece of junk and waste of money. Please save yourself the trouble and do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed With This Item","review":"Perhaps I'm dense but I cannot figure out how the strainer plug works. Without the plug (and even with it) the fat gets into the spout, and if the fat doesn't come out the spout on pouring, it comes out thru the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets all expectations","review":"While searching for this product I used the term 'glass' in the search. This product came up. I assumed it was made of glass, it was not... Our old (plastic) one eventially cracked from age, making a huge mess, so we looked for a glass one... Oh well.Otherwise this product has worked marvelously. We used it on Thanksgiving several times and it was great. I especially like the small 2-cup size over the huge 4-cup that would take a lot of storage space. OXO makes some good products and this certainly is one of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Fat Separator!","review":"I can not believe I went without all these years.

I was able to add the pan juices to to gravy without the fat--great gadget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the 4-cup for a turkey","review":"This seperator works great when cooking a chicken or even a pot roast. However, if you're preparing a big holiday meal with a large turkey, I would go with the 4-cup fat separator. I tried to separate the fat in \\"batches\\" using this smaller cup and it ended up creating a mess. In a calm environment it wouldn't have been too difficult but when you're cooking for a crowd and your kitchen is bustling, fewer steps are always better."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the price, I love it !","review":"thanks amazon.

It is simple to set up, comes at a great price, but unfortunately something is up with the red toner alignment.

I cannot recommend this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Purchase I've Ever Made.","review":"I owned this printer for a few weeks. I was printing brochure pages on glossy paper and the printer turned all of the white areas grey. I tried al of their customer service suggestions none of which helped. Finally, after sending print samples to Lexmark they admitted it was a known problem with the printer however only certain people noticed the \\"graying\\". They also stated that a different printer would be no better because they all of the C532DN printers had the effect and that some customers simply did not notice it. They did graciously offer to refund me my full purchase price. However it has been 6 months and I have yet to receive the refund although they have had my printer for several months and I have spent hours waiting on hold... Stay away!!!! Get anything but this printer. Based on Lexmark's customer service I suggest you stay away from Lexmark all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"I too had the \\"graying\\" problem that one other review mentioned. I found that replacing the black toner fixed the problem for a while, but that means replacing the toner cartridge before it is empty!

A definite \\"do not buy\\" recommendation from me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cello Music","review":"I had better expectations from this cd, but on the whole the music is great.

The Star Ferry as it was, the vibrancy of a city that never stops. William Holden in one of his best roles and Nancy Kwan make a terrific couple for a love story that is poignant and rich with character. Love knows no cultural or class boundaries and this film proves that point. I will watch it any time and highly recommend it. You'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO. not Hollywood's very best, but so what?","review":"Anyone seeing this today has to remember that it's politically incorrect by TODAY's standards, but reflected the period it's meant to represent (1950s) perfectly. This is what it was like in Hong Kong then, and how Asians were portrayed in this particular setting, which by the way, was pretty daring for its day. Suzy and her friends were very sexy, Bill Holden was a little long in the tooth for the role, and some scenes were a little overly done, but as a whole, it all hangs together. The photography is excellent, and if the script gets a tiny bit cliched at times, it's easy to overlook. Worth seeing.PS: Maybe it's just me, but the cat/rice scene near the beginning has a certain offbeat charm to it all on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly the same songs....again (sigh).","review":"Cass Elliot's first two albums are rereleased here along with some B-sides and previously unreleased material such as \\"Darling, Be Home Soon,\\" \\"Sisotowbell Lane,\\" and \\"For As Long As You Need Me.\\" \\"Different\\" and \\"All For Me'\\" are released on this CD also, and to my knowledge this is the only CD that they have ever been released on. My main complaint is the price. Even though I paid for it for the unreleased songs, it is obvious that the record companies are trying to \\"stick it\\" to the consumer. Most people aren't going to pay $50.00 for one CD. The unreleased material is so-so at best. It is up to you whether or not you want to spend the money on this CD.

I'd much rather buy the albums in their original form. But as in the case of Cass, you cannot find those albums unless it is on vinyl so I settled with this CD and also the collection called \\"Dedicated To The One I Love\\". Stick with the latter, this one has the same songs with a few strange ones thrown in with the mix.

One's life is forever changed after reading the heartfelt story \\"I Survived\\". It is, in every aspect, a truly written true-life story of domestic violence; and it is told with breathtaking honesty. Kathy Williams has put all her pain, thoughts, feelings and fears into words, and made them your **own**. While reading this book I actually found myself crying, feeling her pain with her, and also sharing in her joy. Kathy, I wish that there were more people in this world with your courage!

Within minutes of putting my infant son down on this mat, he had disassembled the pieces, tasted them, and scattered them throughout the house. The pieces are cut in abstract shapes and otherwise have no detail, plus the picture of the assembled puzzle on the packaging has a different color scheme, so it's a formidable challenge putting the pieces back together.

The first run-through implants the ideas in one's mind, and sets up a series of mnemonics for future reference. The tutorials are detailed, and don't assume one knows things that may seem simple to another teacher. At the end of the book and the on-screen tutorials, you have a working knowledge of Photoshop, and the ability to know where to go to find additional help.

The book and the DVD are beautifully illustrated and the step by step procedure seems rational and should be easy to follow.The reason I did not give it the fith star was that I was hoping that it would demonstrate the technique of increasing dynamic range using blended multiple exposures in CS2. I believe this is called \\"merge to HDR function\\" in CS2. Although this may be present in the book, I have not found it yet.

Now please write/publish a manual for every software package in the CS suite."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good teacher and professional wrote this book.","review":"Reading this book for a beginner is like taking Adobe Photoshop CS2 class with a very good teacher and professional. My wife is a second-generation teacher. So I have good understanding what is a difference between a teacher and just a professional. The book is written in such specific and brilliant pedagogical manner when the teacher is always behind your shoulder when needed but not limiting or restricting your study. Feeling of high-level professionalism and confidence in teacher's knowledge you will get from practical discussions. For example there is not only complete description of each tools but also a practical discussion when and how to use each tool, their limitation and advances. This book is like good teacher, who will advice you and provide guidance for a long time after you finish the class."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best software book I've ever read.","review":"And I've read a lot.

The book and accompaning CD show you how to use the powerful tools in photoshop in a clear and easy to understand way. It doesn't matter if your just wanting to touch up a picture or layer several pictures together, the techniques given in the book are easy to understand and fun to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-Par for SLR Photographers","review":"If you're looking for a book with painfully drawn out explinations and unispiring pictures, this book is for you; otherwise, head elsewhere. If you need to learn the basics of photoshop for non-photography needs, or want to learn how to add layout and text to your projects, this book would suffice. For photographers who want to learn how to use photoshop to manage, edit and manipulate their SLR captured pictures, this ISN'T the book for you. The projects are drawn out, cumbersome and uninspiring. Topics such as layers and masks aren't covered until 2/3 through the book! I would recommend the How to Wow series over this book - How to Wow is conscience, informative and conveys information quickly vs. the verbose manner which Deke seems to favor....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"I ordered two poseys with the intention of using the to display my Holiday Cards.

I used to be able to buy a Permethrin based spray at Menards, but they stopped selling it. The alternatives just don't work as well or as long.This concentration diluted in my hose sprayer to the same concentration works great and keeps my backyard very livable all summer (a few applications every 4-6 weeks).I wrote up the mix concentration and instructions on how easily do it on a blog post at:[...]Essentially use 2.5 ounces of this 10% Permethrin solution (this stuff), fill the 32oz. dial-n-spray (or any other 32oz hose sprayer) with water, and set the delivery rate on the dial-n-spray hose sprayer to 2oz/gallon of water.

Permethrin 10% was recommended to control these little devils. I used it at the rate of 7 oz per gallon of water and could see NO results. I tried an experiment by setting up one container with fabric in the bottom that was wet with the insecticide. I set up a second container with fabric that we heavily dosed with the Permethrin and then allowed to dry. Ticks dropped into the container with the wet fabric died within 24 hours. Ticks dropped into the container with the fabric that had been allowed to dry out never died. There does not appear to be any \\"28-day residual effect\\" with this product as claimed in \\"Product Description\\". I do not recommend this product for control of ticks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective for killing flies - be sure to dilute!","review":"This product is VERY effective. I used it to get rid of flies in my back yard, when nothing else worked. I used about 1 cup of the product in a hose-sprayer attachment (it mixes water with the product as it disburses) and sprayed it onto my lawn. When I first sprayed it onto our lawn, we had hundreds (maybe thousands?) of flies buzzing around the yard. (Evidently, the sod in our yard had fly eggs in it and they hatched when spring hit). About a week after the initial application, I sprayed again. Now, instead of thousands - we only have 2 or 3 pesky flies.I highly recommend this product for severe insect problems (yes, even flies!)

NO checking and NO formatting was done on the text. Even the exising formatting is often missing (footnotes follow mostly continously in the same row (!) the text of one-one page), titles may miss on the beginning of chapters, one part of the content disappeared (I am not even aware of OCR to do that!). Without the original scanned book, it is impossible to read. I wonder how much it would have added to the present price to just check for formatting and separating text from footnotes, nothing more. As it is now, I would not recommend it at all, but only to buy the pdf, and print it out at home.

I especially like the section onbreakfast breads and cakes because my two boys,age 7 and 9, can prepare many of the recipes(with a little help).I like the Main Entree section because most ofthe meals take little time to prepare.

We should defend British working class culture, which is the positive aspect of our country's history, while rejecting the bourgeoisie's imperial, reactionary culture.

Most of the ideas found in it are common sense.I am bias, however, as I fear multiculturalism as it will only make students less educated.

It doesn't stay in tune, which is like the worst thing imaginable for a guitar, especially if you are learning and aren't good at tuning. I even have a friend who is amazing at guitar and can tune them easily say that this one is almost impossible to tune correctly.All in all, unless you are great at guitar and just want a cheap one, then avoid buying this.

Also during tuning one of the plucks below came out and just did not go inside again.The service obtained from Austin Bazaar was also not upto the mark.Not only did I have to fund the shipping on my own but it also took time and constant e-mailing to get my refund back.All the time, cost and effort to buy and refund it together was equal to the amount in which I could have bought a new guitar.This is just a device to fool begineers like me and I now seriously believe that people might be paid to write good reviews of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY BETTER ON THE MARKET.

As the other reviews state, the pieces did not fit together very well at all; some of the pieces would connect with other pieces, but others would not, so construction was impossible. I can't even believe that a company can get away with producing such a poorly designed/constructed product. I returned this item and will look for a better marble tube toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Tube Trax","review":"My wife just found one of these sets, and I've been helping my 4 year old son build it.

What Miles Radburn does not know is that his late wife, Annabel, who had recently died under mysterious circumstances, is Tracy's half sister. Apparently, however, he is the only one in the dark. Unfortunately for Tracy, others know her secret.As Tracy surreptitiously investigates the circumstances surrounding Annabel's death, she discovers that her sister had secrets of her own. Moreover, everyone is not as they seem. Someone has a very big secret, and they will stop at nothing to keep it so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received","review":"I would love to review this product, but I never received it.

My general observation is that the Northern accounts seem to be more politicized, more likely to talk about politicians and political beliefs, than Southern.Kidd started the war as captain of Troop E, 6th Michigan Cavalry, and ended up in command of the regiment. He spends a lot of time discussing recruiting and training, details fighting at Gettysburg and Williamsport, Trevilian Station, Third Winchester, et cetera. Kidd's admiration for Custer, his brigadier, is clear.A useful account, but not an especially anecdotal or vivid one."},{"rating":"1","title":"OLD STOCK","review":"They sell old stock items which may have old software.

The formula is amusing for about 20 minutes and then becomes exceedingly tiresome. Buster Keaton was inserted into the film, no doubt, to generate sales, but he has little to do. I laughed twice throughout the movie and spent the rest of the time trying to stay awake. At one point, the film descended to pies in the face humor (one recipient being Vernon Dent, the Three Stooges' foil for many years).Some highlites: Alan Mowbray was perfectly cast as the villain; Anita Louise was lovely; and Margaret Hamilton sings! Beyond that, there is nothing positive to say about this dud. The quality of the DVD was acceptable, if just barely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positively the worst","review":"Obviously I've missed the point. Yes, there are some excellent actors in this, but I had to force myself to sit through the entire film to see if something would happen to make sense out of it. Yes, it's a parody of old time melodrama -- but it's a terrible parody and much too long. What is its purpose? What was the studio thinking?I'm old enough to remember a lot of grade B movies -- our mothers gave us a quarter for the movies every Saturday, and that quarter got us not only our admission to the theatre but popcorn and candy as well. We got a movie, newsreel, cartoon and a short. Over the years I saw some pretty lame films, but nothing this bad.Keaton, Mowbray and a few others are good -- but it's sad to see them in such a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I ever get an issue I may like it","review":"It has been six weeks since I placed -and paid- my order.

The childhood stories are great -- very true from a parent's point of view as well as anyone who remembers what it was like to be a kid! There are also stories of a world most of us will never know, hilariously told and giving the reader the feeling of being there.

But I find it hard to believe that he had much to do with the writing, it's that bad. I can only suspect that it was mostly his wife's work (she is listed as co-author, in much smaller type). If you're looking for a Barbara Cartland bodice-ripper, this is for you. If you're looking for another Bernard Cornwell book, keep looking. I feel like I was tricked into buying it, and I will be more careful in the future.Jim Beckman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much schmaltz and not enough history","review":"I'm half way through this and probably won't finish it. It's a love story more than a historical novel. A bit of insights into the class system in England in the era of the French Revolution, but not much else in the way of history. Not a real Cornwell novel by any means. Not a bad story, mind you, but not what I was expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourite romance stories of all time!","review":"Fallen Angels is a well crafted story that will have you turning the pages until you get to its wonderful conclusion. It's such a lovely story with a strong female character caught between duty and desire, beset by danger and intrigue, facing betrayal from those she trusts. For those used to the usual Bernard Cornwell stories, this one will come as a surprise. For me it was a welcome one, but I have to admit that I prefer a well written romance novel to a historical war story. At the same time, unlike the run of the mill romance novel, this is written with a light touch on the romance; indeed for much of the novel it's not clear if there is a love-match. I first read it three years ago and I find myself going back to read whole sections of it again and again. Really such a graceful story. I couldn't recommend it highly enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fallen Angels","review":"I'm a big fan of Cornwall's , and his many books, This isn't one of them, What it is a slushy historical novel that is more in keeping with drug store romance stuff.

After many months of searching, I found the double cd with both albums on it and immediately ran home to play it. The first album KINGDOM COME is just super-cool! I hear traces of Zep, Hendrix, Cream, Purple...just wild stuff! The vocals can be a bit grating but hey, they fit fine with the music really. I can picture David Lee Roth listening to this album and thinking \\"I can make a career out of screaming every other line!\\" Cool guitar work, reminds me of Blackmore at times. As for the 2nd album SIR LORD BALTIMORE, man...it's awful. Hard to believe it's even the same band. I still give this four stars for being just such a neat disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very stereotypical metal","review":"Stereotypical metal indeed. it's heavy, fast, loud-what else do you want? The flipped out distortion blitzes from the sixties (heard on \\"Vincebus Eruptum\\" by Blue Cheer, and \\"Kick Out the Jams\\" by MC5) are starting to be a little more controlled here, but it's not as sterilized as Kiss. There's one ballad, and the opening track is sort of a throwback to songs like \\"Dazed and Confused\\" (the old style of slow, long & drawn out metal), but it also points the way towards Iron Maiden. The other 8 tracks are basically more primal versions of what you expect from Cream. Or Deep Purple. Or Dio. Or whoever does this stuff now (if anyone does). Maybe this band influence Spinal Tap! What can I say? It's metal, not punk, not glam, not thrash, it's one of the most pure examples of \\"Heavy Metal\\" ever recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"best early hard rock cd ever!!!","review":"this album is a standard for anyone who appreciates early experimenters of rock;these guys went out of their way to create a style rarely heard anymore;although they did not gain any fame..of everything i have heard in my life;if i had to choose 10 pieces of hard rock to keep of my collection;this would be one of them..a true masterpiece of hard rock!! a must for true rock fans.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard rock with no apologies, but....","review":"Like another poster, I bought Kingdom Come from a dime store cut-out bin in the mid-70s. Instrumentally, the band had some exciting moments, but drummer John Garner's vocals are hard for me to bear. Just imagine an entire album in which the vocalist screams and shrieks throughout every song -- it is an assault on the ears that simply wears you down. I always believed that SLB could have been more successful if they had added a real singer instead of relying on a screaming banshee!

I think this must be the worst product I've purchased from Amazon in the ten years+ I've shopped here. It is bulky, ugly, doesn't hold many keys, and most importantly, it DOESN'T WORK.I bought this for my husband, who loses his keys at least once a day. I've bought him three other items to help him find his keys- a doorknob hook, wall hook and a valet. He won't use any of them, so I thought this would be a good key ring for him since it doesn't require that he remember anything. The key ring did make a noise and light up. However, it only works if your hands are within a foot of the thing when you clap. (Yes, the battery was good, item switched on and the paper was off the battery.) Even clapping within a foot, it didn't always work. It did go off on its own once, when nobody was clapping or even making noise. Utter garbage. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone, unless they want little LED light in an oversized holder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as described","review":"I replaced the battery thinking that was causing the problem but it did not make any difference; the one I bought is overly sensitive and activates at practically every sound & noise.

He has a speaking manner that puts you at ease and makes you want to listen to everything he has to say. Self-esteem, self-confidence and relating to other people is who we are every day and he helps improve this with techniques for developing and strengthening our 'inner selves'.

Imagine having the ego of a really good guitarist but not actually being good..Honestly I think Moby is incredibly overated and any kid with a little creativity/pop sensibility who might be considered an intermediate guitarist armed with some acid loops could probably make music comprobable to whatever he does.

Most folks have family trees about the size of an oak. The Mallory family is like a REDWOOD! And JL explores every damn twig of that Redwood! If you really want a great JL read, try \\"You Belong to Me\\", \\"Angel,\\" or \\"Love Me Forever\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Johanna?","review":"Where did she go? I'm sorry. I usually find a Johanna Lindsey book an excellent read. I love her Malory novels and continually re-read those I have. There are very few Johanna Lindsey stories I have not enjoyed, and The Present was one that just didn't fit the bill. It didn't read like it was written by Johanna. Did she get kidnapped by gypsies and someone else write this book in her stead?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Present -- A Perfect Gift","review":"This was a most befitting gift to the Malory family readers. \\"The Present\\" was like a diary to the readers. It told the story of one of the first Malorys and his love for the beautiful gypsy, Anatasia.The Malorys are gathered together at Christmas when a gift magically appears. After finally opening the gift, they discover it is actually a family heirloom -- in fact, a priceless heirloom. It's a journal tracing their heritage back to the second Marquis and the gypsy girl.\\"The Present\\" brings the Malory family closer together. It is also during this gathering that old family secrets are uncovered. Jason's love for Molly, the family housekeeper, is revealed, as well as the true parentage of Jason's son, Derek.\\"The Present\\" is truly a good book. I am a Lindsey fan and have read all of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I love the Malory series but found this one lacking all the passion I've come to expect from the Malorys. A nice story...but check it out from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"She gives us some closing to beloved stories!","review":"Johanna gives us some closing to characters. They actually do have a future! And with that we get the past. We find out who started the Malory's off. Included in that we get introduced to new family members who just beg to have a life of there own. Jeremy is finally old enough to be viewed seriously as a potential hero. If you read any of this series you have to read this book. If not because of all it brings, then because of pure dedication, and loyalty to the Malory family."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing prequel to a great family!","review":"I love Johanna Lindsey but I was very disappointed with this book. For one it was to short and not enough time was spent with character development. The characters met, fell in love got married in what seemed like 20 pages. Definetly not this author's best effort especially since her fan's have to wait a year for a new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn!!!!","review":"This book was a complete waste of time. For a person who's been reading Johanna Lindseys' books for years and eagerly awaiting each and every one, I must say that this was a great disappointment. There was too much 'going back and rehashing' each Mallory romance. Was it either written for old 'Mallory' fans (in which case you didn't really need to rehash each couple's romance) or was it written for new people (in which case the rehash would have been totally confusing and irrelevant)? And the story of Christopher and Anastasia was boring. There was nothing new or exciting in this book and it was thoroughly predictable. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I'm quite disappointed in the last two Malory novels (The Present and Say You Love Me). The hero and heroine don't get as much space in the novel because Lindsey is so busy trying to tell about all the Malorys. I'm so disappointed. I loved the first four Malory books. Even though I would love to read more books on the Malorys, I still would rather have quality, not quantity. Lindsey, please develop the hero and heroine more and spend less time trying to bring back the other Malorys. Just a brief mention is enough to make us smile in memory. I felt so junk after reading The Present and Say You Love Me. Please don't ruin other Malory characters in your future books. Remember: quality, not quantity."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book i ever read! it made no sense at all.","review":"i have to say that i am very disappointed in ms. lindsey. i've been a fan of hers for a lot of years now. and of all her books this has to be the worst. the present: a mallory holiday novel, in my opinion was a huge waist of time and anticipation."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute story -- poor research of time period.....yipes....","review":"i usually love the books by ms. lindsey -- and really this was a cute story. but this time the historic facts were not well researched--- in europe as well as the states we are not celebrating christmas by putting up decorations and exchanging presents. presents are exchanged for the new year -- not christmas & especially not christmas eve. decorated christmas trees (a tradition brought to us by the germans)do not show up in homes until the mid 19th century at least. folks are not going up to thier attics to get decorations down for the chirstmas holiday. whew! any simple research -- even at a historic site -- would have given the author this information. those of us that work at historic sites use this point as discussion for christmas traditions compared with todays holidays. ms. lindsey was way off the mark here & it surprised me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Present is a gift for the heart","review":"The Present is an uplifting story based on Lindsey's Malory clan. All the Malory's are back in this book. But there are problems arising. Georgina, ex-pirate James Malory's wife is mad at him and refuses to tell him why. Jason Malory, head of the clan, cannot get his mistress and mother of his son Derek, to marry him. And in the midst of all this, a mysterious present shows up at Haverston. Is it about the mysterious so called Gypsy grandmother, Anastasia Stephanoff Malory? Is she a Gypsy or Russian princess? All is told and the best gift of all is showered on the Malory's as they realize what happiness and love is all about. This is my favorite in the Malory series. Reggie and her husband Nicholas are here, along with Amy and Warren, James and Georgina, Anthony and Roslynn, Jeremy, Derek and Kelsey, and all the other Malory's. Read this and the first 5. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't finish it.... I hadn't done the pre-requisite reading","review":"I'm sure people will think I should have \\"given it a chance\\" and stuck with this book, but the first NINE CHAPTERS deal with members of a huge family who apparently have all had books written about them. Not only had I not read any of these previous books, but there were too many family members to keep straight. By the time I got to the journal (the \\"present\\" of the title), I really didn't care about any of these people OR their ancestors. Normally I love a series in which common characters pop up and are woven through the books, but this one was ridiculous! I guess if you've read ALL the previous Malory family stories, this would be the icing on the cake for you, but if you just pick up this book out of the blue... you'll be as lost as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for anyone that loves romance novels","review":"The present is about the marvelous Malory family. When they gather for Christmas they find the present. I won't say anymore than that, except that the present helps people in the household see things a lot clearer."},{"rating":"1","title":"incorrect information on the back cover","review":"The back cover of this book states a love affair with the second Marquis. Throughout the book it was hard to understand the generations with the wrong information printed on the back cover and the gaps in the first couple of generations of the family tree. Although the book was cute and charming it was a little boring. I usually can't put down a Johanna Lindsey book. Maybe it was rushed to get out in time for Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"Like everyone else who reviewed this book, I too, have read all the other books in the Malory series. Unlike everyone else, however, I was not as enthusiastic about this book. Granted every romance novel is little more than a canned formula, but it is the telling of the story that makes it worthwhile. This book was to short to have any interesting character development and the love story wasn't believable. It is a very quick read so if you do decide to read it and are disappointed as I was, you won't have wasted too much time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking a strong storyline","review":"As an avid JL fan, 'The Present' was a distinct disappointment. The Malory clan have been delightful companions, but constant references to beloved characters of previous novels have made the last two offerings tedious at best. The passion and battle of wits that made me a fan in the first place were decidedly lacking. The novel started well enough, but I very quickly lost interest. Hopefully JL will be able to rekindle my interest with a steamy novel about Jeremy to conclude the Malory saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's Missing","review":"I was disappointed in this novel as a whole. I love the Malory series but this one had too many things going on at once, as well as terrible character development. The story of Christopher and Anna could have been so much better. It was very vague, I didn't get involved with the characters at all, and it's hard to believe the had a long and happy marriage after \\"suddenly\\" being in love when they barely spent an hour together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Confusing, Vapid and Disappointing...","review":"I purchased this book because I was going to be spending Christmas a long way from my home, my country and my family and hoped that reading it would help me get into the Christmas spirit. I have read many of the author's books before and enjoyed them therefore I expected to be pleased by The Present. If, like me, you have not read the Mallory series of books The Present is EXTREMELY confusing. I spent most of my time trying to figure out who was married to whom. All of the \\"present day\\" Mallory characters seemed to blend together into one faceless mass of people. The central Cinderella story of the long-lost ancestors was cute but lightweight. I was quite disappointed in this book and feel that Ms. Lindsay, who has always written intelligent historical romance novels, owed her readers more. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economic option","review":"Very nice features in a value driven class. I have had no complaints from my technologically challenged mother. She must have figured it out on her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend this camera","review":"Fujifilm Finepix S700 7.1MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical ZoomI cannot get this camera to focus properly - it is just off. I have tried the manual focus which is lame. It does not work. I have used the auto focus, and that is worse. The pictures (indoors with photo lights) are dark, and the colors are a bit off. Outdoors the auto setting works great. This camera needs a great deal of light to get the pictures to look like what you are shooting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"This camera would work best on a tripod all the time. The flash overexposes the photos. I bought this oversized camera believing it would do a better job then the more compact digital cameras. I was wrong. The Sony cybershot outdoes this camera and is more compact and lighter to carry. This camera does a good job in low light without a flash. The flash heavily distorts the colors. I haven't found all the settings very helpful. You can pay half the price and get a more usable camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed!!!!!!","review":"This camera is the best for its price. Plain and simply this camera is awsome!!!!! It does go through alot of batteries though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera at an unbelievable price!!!","review":"I searched for digital cameras for weeks. I initially saw the S700 and thought it was to good to be true. That it was not possible to get as good a camera as it read to be and as others were saying for such a great price. Well, after looking at various high end cameras, I came to understand that this camera was the best deal going! I have had it for a few days now and I am absolutely satisfied! That is saying alot for me since I am often a person that suffers from \\"shoppers regret\\". For some, this may not be a major purchase but it is for me. Again, I can not say enough about the performance, quality and feel of this camera. I am looking forward to taking it on my next trip. If you are converting from a 35mm film camera like me, this will make you wonder why you waited so long! You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Camera for the money","review":"This is probably one of the best quality, easy to use cameras I've ever used. Unfortunately, mine was stolen a few weeks ago, but because I loved this camera so much, I bought another one to replace it.It is lightweight, yet still feels solid. The macro function is excellent. and the all around color and focusing is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible results","review":"This was my 5th digital camera, second by Fuji. Trying to be as polite as possible, but sometimes you need to call a spade a spade. Comparing it against the other cameras I have had, it is the worst camera I have ever pushed the shutter button down on. For a point and shoot camera it's the worst. Take a look at the images I posted and form your own opinion. These were the first images taken with this camera on auto mode. I bought it today and it's going back tomorrow. My Fuji E550 is a far better camera than this one. Perhaps you might look at it or a newer E model. I also own an Olympus C2100, it's an old 2.1mil megapixel camera with a 10 power zoom with stabilizer and it far outperforms this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good pics","review":"The camera has alot of nice features, but the pictures were not what we were expecting. The quality was subpar from the last camera we had, which was a finepix also. I would not recommend this to anyone. We are still trying to find a finepix that works though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera at a great price, makes you feel like a Pro","review":"I brought this camera from Butterfly Photo through Amazon. The camera arrived timely and in good condition. It takes excellent photos, 7.1 MP the pictures are very sharp and clear. The menu takes some getting use to, but it is not too difficult. Have yet to learn how to work the manual settings. It also takes very good video clips up to the maximum of the card. That is another good thing, the camera accepts either SD or XD cards. So you can use the less expensive SD Card. It takes 4 AA batteries, that can either be a positive or a negative as you have to purchase rechargeables, but if you run out of electricity you can just pop in some disposable AA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, minimum downsides","review":"The product works very well and has a really nice price, minor problems observed up to the moment (only had it for a week): a slight deformation when photographing objects with straight borders located close to the edge of the frame, no \\"disk mode\\" forces you to install the included software (huge and poorly featured) or use a card reader to download pictures, the macro could be better. Nevertheless, I think it was a great buy for the price and features, even if the 2gig card wasn't included."},{"rating":"2","title":"good except in low light","review":"My daughter got this so she could take pictures at a concert - it takes wonderful pictures until it's dark out.Other than that, no complaints!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still producing fabulous photos","review":"I have had this camera since July 2007. I am a point and shoot person with little real knowledge of photography. This camera, however, makes me look like a pro. The photos are clear and crisp with billiant colors. At maximum zoom across a football field the detail is clear and perfect. I now have to wrestle my camera away from my daughter (somehow the camera now lives with her) who uses it to take photos of my grandson's sports and school activities. She posted some of the football photos on Facebook and got rave reviews on the great quality of the picutures. The s700 Turned out to be a great camera for a miminmal investiment with no performance problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a deal for the price","review":"i uprgraded after i dropped my s5100 for the 4th or 5th time and finally broke it. WOW!!! the bells and whistles on this camera are useful for when you want to just be a point and shoot kind of photographer and there are enough adjustments and to let you take some serious photos as well. more pixels do not always transfer into a better camera. speed between shots, ease of use, and the ability to see and make adjustments in low light or bright light are also very important. the ability to take a picture with flash and without at the same time is a great feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures from this camera...","review":"I purchased this camera in April and I am very pleased with the quality of the pictures I have taken so far. The only problem I have encountered has been the fact that the SD memory card cannot be used for pictures that you would want to transfer to a PC. The only card that can be transferred is the mDX memory card. So if you buy this camera, be sure to get the mDX memory card if you want to download the pictures on a PC. Otherwise it is great!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great camera with one main flaw","review":"this camera is great it takes good pictures and its feature are good the only flaw is the amount of memory required for saving the movie files.this files are enormous so if you are planning to take a lot of movies this is not a camera for you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Camper","review":"This camera does everything it boasts with ease!

Yet just like many other frustrated reviewers here, I found out the picture quality is poor: very grainy indoor or outdoor shots, no matter what settings I use.

I consider the photo qualities to be excellent. I think the number of megapixels is just fine for general use.However, over the years, the flash has stopped popping up. You have to manually lift it and hold it with one finger to take flash pictures. In the future, I will avoid buying cameras with spring loaded pop up flash units."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great SLR like camera","review":"I have multiple cameras, including an Olympus Evolt 500 (SLR), and a Fuji V10. This S700 takes great pictures and is easy to use.

I have had this camera for a few years but use it rarely due to it being very bulky.With the way I cared for it and the little use it had, there is no reason that the flash \\"pop-up\\" mechanism should have failed. Without the flash completely opening, you get no flash at all. I have crammed a piece of paper in the camera to hold the flash open all the time. These cameras cost too much money for Fuji to have skimped on moving components.Check the internet. There are quite a few people who have had this issue with this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a good buy...","review":"Amature photographer here, and this was my first camera buy.That said - so far so good. The picture quality is fantastic, with excellent stabilization.My only complaints have been that the camera itself freezes up in cold or windy weather. By this I mean, the zoom and picture review options temporarily stop working, and only return to normal after you restart the camera.Other than that - I love my camera and recommend it to anyone looking to buy in this price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera for the money","review":"I've had this camera several years now and I love it. The things that were important to me; View Finder, Speed (it shoots almost instantly) and price. I like the AA batteries, they last a long time and I don't want to mess with charging. It's proven to be durable (dropped it a couple months ago with no harm) and simply takes great pictures. Video with sound is a bonus. My kids (I'm 60 now) have purchased the little dinky pocket cameras and they all like mine better. Now they're moving into this style camera. This is a well made camera and has never given me a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this camera!","review":"I bought it because it fit my needs but have to admit I'm just in love with it. Easy to use for the basics, fairly intuitive (hey, it's an itty bitty camera, not a computer)to figure out the finer points and plain fun to use. Optics aren't top of the line but are quite adequate for most shooters. Haven't found a problem with the body or any special fragility as some have noticed, but I'm not prone to slamming the bare camera around gratuitously. Even the goofy software that comes with it works okay; I just take stuff into Photoshop to fix it up before printing or sending via email.If my first digital had been this fun and easy to use, this new one would have been my fifth or sixth instead of my second!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality camera, not for lazy point and clickers","review":"I know nothing about photography. I purchased this camera because of the reviews. After my first day of taking pictures, I was very disappointed. AUTO mode is decent, but it sets the ISO too high sometimes and the pics come out grainy. So, I read the manual and took pictures of the same object under many different lighting conditions and took notes to figure out the best parameters to use in any given situation. Since, then I have learned a thing or two about photography and I have also learned that this is a killer camera. I find that setting the FinePix color to CHROME gives me photos with vibrant colors. If you are the point and shoot type that enjoys auto mode and has no interest in learning about photography, then you will most likely not be happy with this item, otherwise I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great dissappointment","review":"I love Fuji digital cameras and have worked with them for years. The S700 came loaded with the features I wanted, but the optics were really poor, the light metering was questionable at best and the auto focus plain sucked. It also was lighter than I'm used to, which gave it an overall \\"low consumer level\\" feel. It's a cam with lots of bells and whistles that only work so well.I traded it in 3 days later and, still loyal to Fuji, bought the S6000fd for a bit more money and WOW! what a camera! It surpassed and continues to surpass my expectations every day. The shots I'm getting of my art work now rival those of a pro I hired to do the job a few months back. If you want the features of the S700 in a camera that actually works to support those features (especially in the auto focusing department), get the S6000 instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who is an amateur photographer.

Shipping via Amazon was prompt as always.The camera looked fine. but when I started to take pictures, the pictures were grainy and washed out, especially when viewed on a HDTV.I compared them to a 7.2M Sony W55 camera purchased by my son the day before. A world of difference. Not grainy, very sharp with vivid colors. I checked the settings on the S700, took pictures in low light and day light - no good. I will return the S700 today - shame it did not live up to the numerous great reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated with Grainy Indoor Shots","review":"I purchased this camera, because my 5mp Kodak's flash did not carry very far indoors (which made zooming indoors a lost cause)The s700 is much better in that area--the flash carries up to 15-20 feet, but the final results are grainy and disappointing.Outdoor pix are fabulous with the s700, but I have found that the majority of photos I shoot are indoors, and this 7mp camera can't hold a candle to the quality of the older 5mp Kodak that I have.Now, if I can just get the finishing quality of the Kodak with the flash capabilities of the s700 . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"This camera was a replacement for another older Fuji that died.

I use a Canon 5D DSLR for work, and carrying it around all day wears down on your neck and back. So I wanted a nice little high quality camera to carry around and take pics of my kids without killing myself. The quality is very good at low ISOs, and the zoom range is quite satisfying. The camera is made and feels like a baby DSLR. For general family pics, travel, and fun pics it is a very good match. Now if you are extremely critical, which at work I am, you might be disappointed in the sharpness and detail at the long end of the zoom. But this camera really shouldn't be used for prints over 8x10. Otherwise you start to see some softness and Chromatic abbrasions. But at 8x10 and under and for the itty bitty size it is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finepix S700 review","review":"This product is lightwight, simple to opreate and has excellent picture quality results.

Thinking I'd see a film where the good guy fights Satan, I viewed this piece...that not only doesn't show the fight, but it appears that the main character (Johnny Depp) is going to have a friendly \\"chat\\" with Satan himself (That's what I got out of the last scene in the film). This film is boring, stupid, and makes \\"Vertigo\\" look like an actioner (I thought \\"Vertigo\\" was a good film).

I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen and I found myself losing interest with the characters and ultimately the entire movie as well. Since this was a slow moving plot with very little fx, there at least should have been some suspense to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout, and this offered absolutely nothing.

The plot turns on Balkan's (Frank Langella) hiring of Corso (Johnny Depp) to find and buy for him two rare books - but Balkan's jumping on a plane and stealing them himself! Why did he hire Corso in the first place? So Depp could have several witty exchanges with Langella on the phone, each time asking him \\"Where are you?\\" without answer? Not enough to hang a plot on, guys....Even if the ending is supposed to leave you to your own interpretation, as many reviewers have suggested, it's still a huge letdown and wrecks the movie.I'm still shaking my head at this one.

With a certain Agatha Christie quality. No great meditation on Good and Evil. Just a shallow diversion to pass an evening. It descends into low comedy when Emmanuelle Seigner flies down a staircase and gives the villain a karate kick. I think a lot of people would turn the movie off at this point. As a matter of fact, I did. I couldn't imagine something further along that could justify this foolishness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being deliberate is not the same as slow","review":"In my opinion, this film is underrated. The pacing is perfect, as far as I'm concerned. This is simply a film that is not influenced by MTV.The ending, the first time I saw it, seemed too abrupt. However, the more I see it, the more I get it. If the story told you what happened next, you'd miss the underlying message of the ending:YOU are what happens next.The door opened for Johnny Depp's character is open to anyone brave enough (or foolish enough) to walk through.Regarding the woman who doesn't reveal her name, may God bless her thoughout this Age of humanity.

If this Roman Polanski horror vehicle helped finance his subsequent \\"The Pianist\\", well then, so be it. It is a rambling, increasingly tedious and superficial suspense thriller starring Johnny Depp, whose one-note negativism as an unscrupulous bibliophile doesn't contrast well with the overall dullness of the film. The lead lady's bizarre supernatural powers look like a paraplegic Peter Pan on training wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GATES OF HELL","review":"This is a psychologically disturbing film. In the Ninth Gate, Johnny Depp stars as a rare book finder/ investigator who is hired by Frank Langella (in one of his finest acting roles) to find a book which is supposed to open up the ninth gate, which is the gate to hell. There are only three copies of this book and everytime one shows up someone dies a strange death. A beautiful yet strange girl keeps following Johnny and seems to be protecting him yet also inticing or inviting him deeper into the unknown. In one of the best scenes in the film Johnny makes love with her as a raging fire roars nearby. She appears to be the guardian or gatekeeper to hell or the devil incarnate. At the end, we see Johnny walking towards the gateway or doors to hell. My only complaint with the film is the music, its dull and boring but Johnny gives a great performance to make up for it. The Ninth Gate is a film worth seeing, if you like dark and disturbing films."},{"rating":"1","title":"saved by Depp","review":"Without Johnny Depp, the movie would have been a failure.

It's amazing how Depp can portray such a wide variety of characters. 2) The screenplay, for the most part, is what makes this movie. There are very few, if any, unnecessary scenes and elements like lighting are all very appropriate to mood and style. 3) It's not a horror film. Thank God. If this had been a cheesy horror flick I wouldn't have seen it. No \\"dramatic buildup into nothingness\\" as is too typical these days. 4) An interesting taken on Satanism without stereotyping everyone who takes an interest.The only problem with the film: A few ridiculous plot twists here and there. Where do they come from? Who knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ninth Gate","review":"It has been on of the most clear and interesting movies I have seen in a long time, finally one that has a bit of substance to it.Best movie Ive seen this year, I would recomend this movie to those who have an interest in the \\"different\\" side of things."},{"rating":"2","title":"A creepy movie","review":"I've seen this movies so many times it never gets old.

Rosemary's Baby had them, and so does the Ninth Gate. The first time I watched The Ninth Gate I thought it sucked. Then I thought: \\"Hmm - I must have missed something because Roman Polanski can't suck this bad.\\" so I watched it again. Sure enough, I missed the puzzles. Every time I watch it I find something I missed before. In my opinion, it's pretty damn good. The more I watch it, the more appreciation I have for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"93 minute run time?

I did not notice this until I started watching the movie and realized this was a comepletely different version. Has anyone else had this problem? I returned it and left a message of the problem and they sent me another one wth the exact same problem!So I called and they are going to investigate it.

Almost Kubrick-like, wide angle shots and lax-paced screenplay and all.I was riveted. Riveted, that is, right until the somewhat confusing fire and cobblestone ending, which admittedly leaves you with very little to chew on and instead of appearing clever and ambiguous, as it perhaps wanted to, mostly comes off as complacent.Yet, the point of a mystery noirish film is to keep you intrigued through out, and the movie manages to do that quite successfully. The sleuthing process is almost done in tandem with the audience, which is fun. Johnny Depp is immaculate in his potrayal of a detached book detective and all others contribute richly. The music is tacky in bits, but not too distracting.Recommended rental for haunting cinematography of Portugal and France, and a fabulously captivating atmosphere in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad flick","review":"Never read any reviews, never heard anything about the movie...

I was prepared for all the normal compromises you must expect. However this movie fails on most levels despite the best efforts of Johnny Depp. The script is just terrible, and nothing anyone can do can get past that.I can see why the movie bombed, there is just isn't much to recommend. The cinematography is good, even great in parts. So perhaps that might appeal to a film student. Otherwise the movie is without real merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Disappointing!","review":"This is the worst kind of movie. The movie starts out with an interesting concept, then speeds up a little, then slows down, then speeds up just enough to keep you watching, then slows down, over and over again. I was quite interested in the movie (though a bit confused), until almost 2 1/2 hours into it the movie ended and NOTHING made sense! It was the worst ending I've EVER seen! I've never wasted 2 1/2 hours like I did with this movie! It was like they just got as tired of the movie as I did and just ended it with a short scene that meant absolutely NOTHING!

For instance, a girl follows around and helps out the main character for the entire movie and they never make clear who she is or what she's trying to do. At the very end of the movie, the main charcter and this woman have sex outside a burning castle for no reason that myself, nor my peers could find.

The rest is Johnny Depp bumbling around Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memorable, but not in a good way","review":"I saw this film at the theater, which was a while back, and I distinctly remember falling asleep briefly, waking up, and being distressed to realize it still wasn't over. Had I been on my own, I would have gone home.The pace is s-l-o-w, and there's precious little suspense to keep up your interest. You know all along that all the pieces of the dread book will eventually turn up, so all you can really hope for is a big finale ending. But then you wait, and wait, and WAIT...It's probably not fair to say the ending was a disappointment because, by that point, life as we know it would have had to be annihilated in a cataclysmic technicolor explosion to make it worth all THAT waiting. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, unless you generally enjoy long, drawn out, brooding films."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like watching paint dry","review":"I am a big fan of Roman Polanski. Even his more subtle horror films (The Tenant, Rosemary's Baby) were intriguing and well worth watching. But this lemon is not redeemable in any way shape or form.

It's one of my top 10 movies ever.Technically \\"Gate\\" was well-made, but the plot was all surface. None of the moral questions raised about the hero were answered; nor were any of the plot elements. The ending felt like the answer to the question \\"What's the quickest way to get this over with?\\"Could have been a good role for Depp if he'd been given a character with any dep(p)th.

Like a decent script.The online editorial mentions \\"Polanski's languorous direction and purposefully vague story...\\" - as if that's a selling point. A movie is like sex: it needs a climax.

He seems to be making a career comeback these days, but unfortunately this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ninth gate must require reading the book","review":"I just watched this movie and I am wondering what I just saw. I guess the intent of the movie is to lead you to beleive that their is some magical way to become immortal (albeit via the devil) which is possible from putting clues together from several issues of the same ancient book. The ending is terrible, the plot is easily guessed, and the special effects make you wonder if something is wrong with your television. My recommendation is that if you desire to own this movie, rent it before buying it to verify it is worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare and Rare","review":"For the Bibliophile who loves Depp!

This is by far a very strange film and mutiple elements that make you go what the heck is happening at times. But the basic plotline is threwout the movie and if you enjoy a good suspense triller as much as I do then you will enjoy this movie. There were a few moments the movie seems to drag along but Depp saves the movie with his amazing actor skills and sense of humor. I also enjoy how the movie was shot on locations very amazing shots of the layout of the country's.

First of all, the cinematography of this film is absolutely brilliant and establishes a heavy dark mood throughout fitting for an investigation of this nature. The boundaries of reality seem sketchy and blurred. Secondly, I always love the acting of Johnny Depp, and cannot say enough great things about the mysterious woman who shows up frequently throughout the film. Thirdly, Like The Blair Witch, this film does not spell everything out but rather lets you draw your own conclusions. In this film, unlike \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" the technique really works well. Also, the artwork incorporated into this rare book is so cool looking and awesome. Yes, the pace is slower than the current trash Hollywood pumps out, but if you surrender your preconceptions, the Ninth Gate will move you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the ending?","review":"What crap - good start, suspenseful music, nice nude scene, but then it seemed like they ran out of plot and just faded to the credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"I'll start with the good things about this film:1. It introduced me to the book The Dumas Club which is now on my TBR list. Although I didn't enjoy the film I'm still keen to read the book because it's apparently a literary thriller, which I love. These types of books are notoriously difficult to adapt to the screen as so much of their charm is in language.2. The cinematography was great. There are some beautiful scenes and images which established the mood for this type of film.3. The basic set-up was intriguing and had great potential.4. Johnny Depp is hot.Now for the negatives, which can be reduced to one word: plot.After setting up the storyline the plot begins to meander all over the place and by the end the whole thing has become farcical. None of the questions raised are answered properly, we never know exactly who the mysterious blond girl is or if she's really working for Fargas at all.

Her behavior at the end of the film is never explained. The clean sweep where Frank Langella re-enters the film shows absolutely no thought or creativity. The elderly twin book-dealers disappear but, again, no explanation. And then that ridiculous finale which comes out of nowhere! Johnny Depp is totally wasted in this film.

The only FLOP I see is their editing of essential footage. They have condensed the movie to under 2 hours...and have subsequently made certain scenes appear as \\"stupid\\" (for lack of a better word).This movie grew on me. I was not intially impressed, but after viewing it with friends and family, I have become a big fan of its haunting yet calming persona. The subject matter deals with Satanic idolatry, but the movie is in no way \\"goth\\". It's the kind of film you could watch with your children and not worry about them being scarred for life.As far as comedy, Johnny Depp's bad luck with women is hilarious. His facial expressions (even while killing \\"the albino\\") are a hoot.As for the ending, after many viewings I believe Depp went to hell where he was praised for being the human father of the anti-Christ. All along, the lady in the sneakers was Satan."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLOODY AWFUL","review":"I wish there was an option for zero stars. This is the worst book-to-film adaptation I have ever witnessed. I challenge you to read the book 'The Club Dumas' by Arturo Pérez-Reverte before watching the movie. Pérez-Reverte crafts wonderful tales and unfortunately most of his book was lost in the movie, and the rest was reduced almost to campy horror. The basic elements of the book are portrayed (gathering the elements necessary to summon the devil) and in the book, it all seemed plausible, yet in the film it was laughable. Having said that, I thought that Depp was a perfect choice for Corso.

Well paced and clever camera work stand out only to be overshadowed by a ridiculous plot. The ending aside, a BIG let down.Depp never ceases to amaze me as he is always quite good. An underrated actor for sure. Frank Langella's performance however is ridiculous,when you DO see him on screen. A lot of his dialogue is presented \\"over the phone\\". A trick student filmmakers often use to save money. Perhaps Polanski didn't like him either. He should have lit himself on fire in the opening sequence instead, and spared us his worthless characature of a truly evil man.The classic \\"Rosebary's Baby\\" still holds up today, and even looks good on TV late at nite despite commercials! Buy that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsuccessful ambiguity","review":"An amoral dealer in rare books (Johnny Depp) is hired by a wealthy collector (Frank Langella) to track down and compare the only three extant copies of a book supposedly written by the Devil himself. Of course, the purpose behind this is not immediately clear, and the major strength of this film is the way in which it follows Depp as he begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Director Roman Polanski shoots this in a way that allows us to make the discoveries right alongside him. By the end of the film, however, numerous details have accumulated without amounting to much. I was left in the dark about the true nature of Depp's mysterious female guardian (Emmanuelle Seigner), and the significance of the film's final shot was lost on me.

Let me at it, it sounds great!Don't be sucked in like I was. There is nothing compelling about the story or the characters in this awful film. Depp plays a rare book dealer who has the strange habit of smoking cigarettes over priceless books. Odd. His love interest seems to be a sort of devil/angel thing, and there is no character in the entire film that is worth being sympathetic toward.The plot is based on gaining keys in the form of pages from various rare copies of the same book. Lots of people die, sometimes in unintentionally funny ways, and very little action ensues. The dramatic tension created here is just about on par with a documentary on cheesemaking.Don't worry, Johnny, even DeNiro and Nicholson have made movies they are not so proud of. It happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"Just watched this for the 2nd time on IFC. I won't repeat what others already have said. The actors (esp. Depp) were routinely excellent. The road trip scenery throughout Europa was especially welcome and set the tone so marvellously. Some of the editing seemed rather abrupt although. In certain scenes where the veil was puilling back ever so slightly - bam - scene changed. My other issue was certain parts of the soundtrack seemed out of place. While the mood was dark and slow throughout, as was the music, abruptly at times (the chase along the Seine) segued into action film stereotypical.I'm afraid I still have questions about the female lead's identity, but the film works nicely both ways. The ending thus is totally up to the interpretation of the viewer. Don't expect special effects and demons, do expect a wonderfully engrossing film based on the performances and pacing of the film.

With tons of symbolism that doesn't lead to any sort of enlightenment about a) the characters, b) the plot, c) the Point of this film, the movie seems to be a really long version of the message: 'The Dark Lord is bad'.

All the acting is above reproach, mostly good special effects, same great polanski style. Another huge contributer was production manager Dean Tavoularis (who we may remember worked on the visually exquisite Apocolypse Now) whose warm lighting and muted colors gave the film an immpressive visual flair.

Depp's character was interesting and played well but I never really felt any connection with him. I personally did not like the movie and could not wait for it to be over.

Now I wish I wouldnt have wasted 2 precious hours out of time that I can never bring back. From the very beginning the movie presents a goofy undertone and it never stops. By the end of the movie all you have, as Roger Ebert says, is unanswered questions and unquestioned answers. It seems that everything is conveniently placed for the characters main benefits. Like the mysteriuos blonde woman (who you never find out who she is). The movie is slow and dull. The dialogue is cheap and completely unoriginal.

All that appears to have been missing was a script. Not even the brilliant performances of Johnny Depp, Lena Olin, Frank Langella and Barbara Jefford can make up for the lack of true tension I have come to expect from a Roman Polanski film. Its a fairly long film (133 min) that spends most of that time building up to a totally non climatic ending.

Unfortunately, you have to sit through 2 hours-plus of meandering silliness before you get to actually hear it. Johnny Depp is good as always, but cannot save an overlong flick that is just a notch above the monumentally bad 'Devil's Advocate'.With the exceptions of 'Rosemary's Baby' (and possibly 'Bitter Moon'), Polanski's films are generally overly drawn-out, though lightweight and unsatisfying. But this reaches new depths - there is very little to hold the attention, and you will more likely kick yourself for sitting through the whole flick.If you want to watch a very long, deep movie, you would be much better off with 'Dead Man' - a much better Johnny Depp film, from a much better director (Jim Jarmusch)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illogical and much too long","review":"I thought a Roman Polanski movie starring Johnny Depp would be great, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Depp is a rare-book expert who is sent on a trip to Europe to find a (you guessed it) rare book.

Depp is not nearly as evil as he can be, plus the characters that surround him, though intriguing, are downright as confusing to the viewer. It's not a secret that Mr. Polanski has made some great films, as Rosemary's Baby STILL looks good today even when it shows up on late nite TV. Also, the $100+ pricetag? Forget it.

I didn't care for any character so I didn't really care how this movie ended. SPOILER: I think that the main character chose to be the She Devil's patsy because he just hated himself, his life as he lived it, and people in general. I don't think I needed to spend $1.99 on this. It was well-acted but just so useless as a film for me.

Unfortunately the movie did not fully take advantage of this potential. I actually enjoyed the first 70% of the movie. The mystery alone had me glued me to the screen. In the last half our or so, however, all of the movie's worth was nullified. I enjoy a movie that leaves questions unanswered, but this movie left the WRONG questions. Because of this blunder, the story didn't matter to me and, in the end, it seemed that the entire point of the movie was to facilitate two nude scenes.If you're into movies that are just for nudity, I'm sure there are better ones out there.

After a very well-done first hour, everything unravels, as we begin to realize that Polanski is just filling the running time up as much as possible. The final scenes are also a cheat, it's easily one of the most disappointing endings in a long while, not only because of its abruptness, but also because of its contradictions, as the white light interferes with the film's dark tone.

Apparently obscure German synth-punk from the early 80s is not a big seller at Camelot Music.It's a startlingly unique album. Haphazard disco beats collide with chaotic, mistuned guitar squeals. Ludicrous German lyrics are barked in a frighteningly militant voice (one track translates to: \\"I'm the sexy Lola/Der Liebling of the fashion/I have a pianola/at home in my drawing room/everybody knows me/but no one can touch my pianola.\\" WTF?). Synths chirp and squawk amidst the din, and anyone who thinks that synths are incompatible with punk rock needs to listen to this album.There are also a number of more sober, orderly tracks, mostly repetitive, slower in tempo, and heavier on the electronics, but these are less interesting than the aural assaults.Recommended tracks: \\"Die Lustigen Stiefel\\", \\"Die Fesche Lola\\", \\"Co Co Pino\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out!!!","review":"There are a lot of guys trying to sell these, but most are scams.

However, you will get to the dealer and he will ask you for the code, then apologize that he is unable to help you out.So unless the vendor provides the code, it is a useless piece of junk. Ask.

Alas, it was cheap: cubic zirconia, enamel colors that faded over time and the jewels fell out. I wanted something to replace it, so the search for an elegant, cheap US flag themed ring led me to this ring. It is higher quality than my last since the band is made of silver alloy, it has cheap jewels and uses enamel that will fade, but that is to be expected since it costs so little. The ring when worn, is very pretty, worth the price, though since the band has a hollow and concave interior it will fit much looser than a typical ring of the same size. I recommend this ring, and it has served me well thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Exactly as pictured. Looks great. Pumps work flawlessly.

It isn't. \\"Lazy Days\\" is one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard as her voice moves from quiet at the beginning of the song to a climactic final note at the end of the bridge. This is the albums best track. I also enjoyed \\"Northern Star\\" and \\"Comatised\\" on first listen. I have come to appreciate much of the rest of the album, but it doesn't quite reach the highest rating. I think the album's weakness lies only in Leona's lack of songwriting maturity, something that I'm sure will develop because of the promise shown on the album's best songs.

Then i read a bio of Leona and read the Edie is an influence of hers. But Lazy Days & Comatised are signature songs for Leona .. a great find .. she is hot .. she is fresh .. she is talent .. we will be hearing a lot more from Ms Naess i am sure .."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to believe","review":"The only problem with Leona Naess is that she robs me of adjectives to use to describe her incredible music. To listen to some critics one would think that Leona is good now but used to be mediocre. This could not be further from the truth. \\"Comatised\\" is a stunning debut from an extraordinary talent. Why this cd wasn't as big or bigger than AM's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is inconceivable. \\"Charm Attack\\" and \\"Anything\\" are equally powerful tracks, there is something wonderful going on here. \\"Lonely Boy\\" blew me away, to the point I couldn't believe what I was hearing, it was so darned (stronger language warranted, wary of Amazon editors) good. More uneven than her most recent or \\"I Tried to Rock You,\\" it goes without saying that this is a must have for Naess fans, and would be a good introduction to Leona's music for new listeners.

However, if I were to compare this stunning debut to Tori's classic \\"Little Earthquakes\\", it would receive a solid 6 compared to Tori's 10. I hope that we hear alot more good things from this young artist.

To me the character of Mrs. Bridge gives the literary world a new heroine figure that all women of substance ought strive to emulate. Through her constant struggle to prevail against the overwhelmingly male egotism prevalent throughout the novel it should be quite obvious to any reknowned worldly scholar this level should be defined by readers as comprising the analytical skills of the notorious Christopher Seagen; she is indeed a character of great substance and unquestionable strength. In another word... \\"Refreshing!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Expertly painted portrait of dislikable woman","review":"Sometimes, you empathize with a character because he/she is genuinely likable--for example, David Copperfield. Other times, you aren't too keen on what you see. Such is the case with Mrs. Bridge.This weak, repressed woman is a product of upper-class Kansas City in the 1940's. Thanks to her workaholic husband, she has everything she wants--everything material, anyway. Her empty feelings are another matter.The author has done a good job of portraying Mrs. Bridge, but I wanted to meet her and smack her. She's prejudiced against all sorts of ethnicities, and she is pretty passive and spineless in general.The book is a pretty quick read, with lots of vignettes but not much of substance going on. Just as well, because I couldn't take more than 30-60 minutes at a time of this woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is so well written and addresses the problems of most women today, that it came as a great shock to find it was written in 1959!This is definitely one of my all time favorites and will be handed down to my grandaughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good classic tale","review":"My writing class instructor recommended this along with \\"Mr. Bridge\\" because I had written a short story in a similar vein.

BRIDGE was a delight to read. The story is told in a series of episodes that range in length from a few paragraphs to a few pages. Through these glimpses of Mrs. Bridge, I came to know that she is a woman of ideals about how the daily business of living should be conducted. But her ideals are often out of step with reality.

I didn't feel any tension, the only thing I felt was boredom.It was about (petty) crime by a small gang of thugs in New York City, but it wasn't well written and it was extremely slow moving, the title should have been \\"Slow Motion Crime Novel That Never Gets Anywhere\\".If you're looking for a novel on crime, I'm sure you can find better reading material. This book flat out sucked and I feel that my money was wasted. Maybe your opinion would be different, but I kind of doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"well researched but racist","review":"Coming from a journalism backround as the author does, it's clear he did his research. there is much interesting detail about being a probation officer. But the author's depiction of the black underclass is definitely an outsider's view, cliched verging on racist. I have no problem per se with white writers creating black characters (or vice versa), but the proof is in the pudding. You can either do it convincingly, with insight and compassion, or you can't.

Mike Bloomfield is in fine form... own this before \\"Live at the Old Waldorf\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somebody please rerelease this","review":"This album deserves to be rereleased. The obvious old Butter and Bloomer music has been rereleased so there must be a market for it beyond just myself. Recently they've released Bloomfield's old Guitar Player album on CD with some additional stuff. This was probably his best playing in the later part of his career. They also recently released the live Butterfield album with the horn band from about 1970. This also has a bunch of good tracks and some awesome Butterfield harmonica work. They also recently put out the complete Bloomfield/Gravenites Fillmore stuff and Maria Muldaur is always releasing stuff. There has to be a market for a domestic or reasonably priced import.

The star of the show, in my opinion, is the youthful Renee Fleming. How secure and pleasing her voice is, and she is an excellent actress to boot. James Morris is good as Iago, but the part could do with a bit more malevolence. Placido Domingo has virtually owned this role for the past 3 decades and is superb. Compared to the Solti / Covent Garden filmed performance, I found his Met portrayal less engaging to begin with, but it builds up to a shattering climax.Good filming, an interesting and intelligent production plus above average sound quality. Othello fans should possess both the Levine and Solti versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding performance of great opera","review":"This is simply the best performance I have seen of Otello.Domingo, Fleming, & Morris are excellent, as are Levine and the Met orchestra and the other singers.

Though there are some beautiful shots of South America along the way this merley proceeds to make up for the holes in the plot. Whilst Herbie Goes Bananas certainly has a few bright spots, the film as a whole is a rather nondescript affair which sees Herbie the Volkswagen Beatle car, with a mind of its own, rubbing bumpers with a gang of smugglers on their way to Brazil.

Marx's real title is An Der Juden Frage, obviously to be translated by anyone who has the least knowledge of Germs as On the Jewish Question. The fraudulence of the title strongly suggests the fraudulence of the translation and the introduction by Dagobert Runes.In On the Jewish Question, alias World without Jews, Marx argues that granting civil rights to Jews does not require their giving up Judaism. However he also argues that the basis for Judaism is huckstering, thus revealing his ignorance of Judaism even though his mother and father were Jews and one of his grandfathers was the chief Rabbi of Cologne.

It is a bit light on science, has nice pictures with cutsey captions, and frankly shows an atypical lack of modesty for a scientist in that the author has had herself drawn as the model human in all her cladograms. Whether this book is poor because the author does not believe college students to be capable of comprehending a worthy text (like that of John Fleagle), or because she does not understand theory-driven issues herself is not clear, but in later editions more attention needs to be paid to issues scientific relevance.More effort needed on this one before it is passable."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift for gardeners","review":"I gave this to my mom last year for Christmas and she really enjoyed it!

They sent it back with the same problem. It's a great camera otherwise. Lots of features and video w/sound. But now it just doesn't stay on long enough to use it.

But I'm getting a littletired of negotiation books with these obvious messages. So, when I pickedup 3-D Negotiation, I realized that it represents something different. Notjust war stories and platitudes, but a very practical approach, clearlyexpressed and based on a lot of experience. The authors stress theimportance of the right \\"setup\\" moves away from the table before you evenbegin the process at the table. They offer lots of examples to clarifywhat they mean. This book is a standout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great business book!","review":"I thought that this book was going to be about negotiations.It's a lot more than that. After years of doing negotiations, I was skeptical that a new concept could emerge.

Basing the case on actual historical events involving Franklin and some rather interesting letters that became available for public consumption in the states; Alexander had a good idea, but the execution is lacking. Franklin comes off as a caracature of himself, a bit of an old lech, (which he may have been but I believe he may have been a bit more circumspect in an unfamiliar environment like Sir John's home.)who was rather lacking in the wit or the intellect that is so celebrated in many of his biographies. Even the tales involving Sir John's household were particularly weak, involving an unfortunate return of Lady Fielding's son from the navy. While I appear to be in the minority on this one; I feel this book is lacking the quality of mystery and character development that is the norm for Alexander's generally excellent historical mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth, cheerful story","review":"This movie was a refreshing breathe of clean air.

I have tried mat pilates before and was not strong enough to do many of the movements, so I gave up. This video is very accessible and reasonably paced, but the moves definitely build strength. Leslie filmed three workouts; the first one short and instructional, and the next two increasing in difficulty and length. You start with the instructional, and move up to the others when you are strong enough. I already feel much stronger after doing Level 2 a few times, and would recommend the video to anyone who is curious about Pilates, unless they are already extremely fit (gymnast, etc).If you are very strong and fit, including your abdominal and lower back muscles, you may prefer a more advanced video with another teacher, but if you are discouraged by its difficulty, try Sansone's You Can Do Pilates.

The great Casals performing Brahm's concerti. Maestro Pau Casals ( 1876-1973 ) was, certainly, the best musician in the twentieth century. He was, also, an incredible conductor, and a composer, too ( for example \\" El Pessebre\\").However, in this cd, we are able to hear Mtro. Casals playing his violoncello sharing the orchestra with some of the best musicians, the french pianist and conductor: Alfred Cortot and the pianist Mieczislaw Horszovsky. This is a very interesting jewl because Cortot is conducting which is not common in the recordings. This Brahm's performance is beyond our undertsanding inasmuch as the musicians are the best ones in the history. When you hear this record, you will agree.

Hypocritical (Rage Against the Remix)-Sounds more like a demo than a remix to me. But that's just my opinion. A good track, nontheless.3. Spun (Album Version)-This is the album version of Track 11 on their debut album. It's a techno kind of song, no words or anything. The Crystal Method produced it.

And in between, they tell family history, stories, myths, and folk tales to help explain the milieu in which they are living and the motivations for their sometimes inexplicable behavior.A brave and worthy first novel that gets better and better as it goes along.

It tells not only a great story but also touches the Filipino soul.For those Filipino-Americans searching what it means to be a Filipino, read this book and look into the past of your ancestors.

There is no emotional attachment to the main characters from the person telling the story. Please, do yourself a favour and go buy Susan Kay's Phantom. I cannot say enough about her book. It is the definite telling of the story. She obviously cared about the characters and the story line. It is a fabulous book. The Phantom of Manhatten, however, is NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This book disgusted me beyond belief. i could go on for hours, but I'll just say that Forsyth wrote piece of garbage! He trashed Leroux, and then wrote a highly unlikely and unbelievable continuannce to The Phantom of The Opera! As a big Phan, this is an insult. It's also not worth reading if you are not a Phan. The writing is hoorendous, confusing, and suitable for a 5th grade quick pick.And the pages aren't even soft enough to wipe my bum with"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coming from Forsythe .. dissapointing !","review":"Coming from Forsythe ... this was one BIG dissapointment. I read the preface before buying it, and was expecting something reallyy worth reading out of it, instead what I got was a really bad sequel to a really great story. It was heartwarming to see his efforts at potraying the phantom as much more than just a beast, but the story lacked credibility, and felt like a badly sticked quilt !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Waster","review":"I decided to get this book to see if it was anything like Phantom of The Opera.

It was a waste of time for me to get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big mistake for usually talented author","review":"What was Forsyth thinking with this one? and for ALW to give it the thumbs up, it's a disgrace to phans everywhere! just read susan kaye's book, it is by far better ."},{"rating":"1","title":"tearing down a good literary character","review":"What Forsyth has done here is changed a Salvador Dali into a still life. Everything that made the phantom such an intriguing character in the original book, everything that made us have sympathy for him, has been stripped away. What's left is a thoroughly dislikable phantom and a lot of dry dialogue. I don't doubt that Andrew Lloyd Weber will be able to dig up enough from this book to make a decent new musical. For those of us who haven't been knighted, though, this book is not worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, *PLEASE*!","review":"Do *not* waste your money on this book--go to a library if morbid curiosity truly compels you to read it.I could barely get past Forsyth's appalling arrogance in his introduction which derides the original novel written by Leroux. I can only assume that he went to so much trouble to put Leroux down in order to make himself look better. Very cheap shot, that. Add to that Forsyth's obvious pandering to Lloyd-Webber and you've got a pretty obnoxious book before you've even reached Chapter 1.I'm really not sure why Forsyth bothered to write this book at all; the characters don't show any evidence that he cared about them--they simply strut around like puppets, going through the improbable movements dictated by the author (Erik in a *clown suit*?!? Please...) until he seems to lose interest and wrap up their respective jumbled storylines in a sloppy rush.It seems publishers are hard up for good material these days..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"Forsyth's Phantom of Manhattan was nothing less than painful to read. I approached it with hope, looking forward to the story of the Phantom of the Opera being approached in an unusual manner, but my hopes were smashed by around the third page. The introduction alone turns a reader off- it claims that the original Leroux novel was terribly written and goes on to cite just how \\"bad\\" it is- as he attempts to write a sequel. Also, despite the unusual approach of using various points of view, Forsyth fails to grab his readers' attention- he confuses or bores them instead. The characterization is minimal and pathetic at best.Kudos to Forsyth for trying a different approach, but condemnation for a piece of writing that fails to capture its audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Phantom of Manhattan","review":"this book gave me a headache. i will never read anything again that tries to continue a broadway play. it was a mistake on my part, it won't happpen again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like It !!!!","review":"I was searching for this book because ALW is making this book sequal into a musical sequal of his version of The Phantom of The Opera. I have enjoyed reading the book alot. You really can't take this as a sequal with the first book by Gaston Leroux's original novel, you actually need to go off the Broadway Musical of The Phantom of The Opera because it follow that format more..which I prefer. If you loved the musical than definately check this book out. If You watch the movie of the musical than read the book afterwards you'll see how well the fit together."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a book?","review":"You have to be kidding me!

It's incredibly short and takes up pages and pages with the background of meaningless characters. It takes almost all of what made the Phantom (and the Phantom's relationship with Christine) away.

Borrow it from the library if you must read it, but you don't want this sitting on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgrace to the original work!","review":"I am appalled after reading this book. It completely throws out the original book, and bases the whole story of the Andrew Lloyd Webber Musical. Not only does he bash the original story, but then tries to disprove it! I find it sort of a paradox, trying to disprove a work that one is writing a sequel to! Apparently, trying to impress Lloyd Webber, ALW's name is even mentioned at least 10 times in the preface! Forsyth goes even farther and says at the end of the preface - \\"This is the story of the Lloyd Webber musical and it is the only one to make sense.\\" I think you should compare his book to the original and see which one makes sense.I don't even recommend this book to a NON-Phantom fan, as it will probably even make the world hate \\"The Phantom of the Opera.\\" Negative infinity stars would be the best rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don\`t know what to say","review":"I really don't know what to say, with this is the third book of Frederick Forsyth that I don't like at all...When you read this book you will know the story of The Phantom of the Opera, but if you only read the preface the book will be perfect, the rest of the book is what happened to the phantom when he escaped from France, that includes two or three chapters that don't have to do anything in the book, take my advance, don't waste your time with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Read","review":"I have to say, I didn't really enjoy this book. I'm an avid Phantom phan and I have to say this was a disappointment. There were a few errors that I had picked out that had amused me, and the way that some of the characters acted, (i.e. Erik and Pierre, Christine's son) bugged me. The preface was an annoyance when Forsyth stated that Mme. Giry was portrayed wrong in the original novel. Well, Leroux wrote the book, and he can portray his own characters the way he wants to. I guess I'll stop there but the list does go on. As I said, this book is a disappointment and I only finished the novel for the sake of saying I've read it, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"This book doesn't earn a single star (but it's a required field for Amazon, so I had to give it one). It's a real letdown for Forsyth fans. If you're looking for his usual intricate plotting and character development, forget it. You won't find it here. The style is simplistic and the vocabulary wouldn't challenge an elementary school student. A real waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"No","review":"Like a lot of other people, I was really excited to hear that there was a \\"sequel\\" to Phantom of the Opera out...but this book was a big letdown. The plot was pretty shallow, as were the characters. The ending fell totally flat. Maybe if the novel had been longer, it could have had some substance to it. On the other hand, considering the plot, it probably would not have been a good idea to prolong things. Also, I don't mind that the author based his story on the Lloyd Weber version of the story as opposed to the (original) Leroux version, but I thought it was rather bad taste to actually go and criticize the Leroux version and state that it is inferior to the Lloyd Weber one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phan Phail","review":"This book has irrational explanations for everything, from the creation of this book (it questions Leroux's validity, how can you do this anyway considering The Phantom of the Opera was a work of fiction anyways) to the characterizations of all of the characters.The one good thing about this book is the opera scene towards the end with explaining the context of a duet Erik and Christine sing in the Manhattan opera House. Otherwise, this book is rather illogical based on the concepts of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical to which it was based on.If you want a very good piece of fan fiction that has a magnificient plot, and not a soap opera, I would suggest you read PHANTOM by SUSAN KAY, which is probably one of the BEST adaptations of the Phantom of the Opera nPhantomovel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous Piece","review":"I am an avid PotO fan, and when I heard Love Never Dies was coming, I immediately began researching all I could, and apparently this book was at least partially the inspiration for it. Earlier, I looked upon the sequel with anticipation, but now that I have read this piece of garbage, my hopes have been dashed. This book is HORRENDOUS. It has none of the wonder that exists within Leroux's novel, or any of the magic that is in the ALW musical. The entire book seemed completely forced, and had no real decency to it.If you are looking for more PotO, I suggest Phantom by Susan Kay, which is much more enjoyable (and ties in to the original story better). I gave this 1 star simply because I'm forced to give it something."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting concept","review":"What happened to Erik at the end of The Phantom of the Opera? That's the basis behind this story. It is a quick read (which is probably a good thing) but ultimately its just bad mass produced Phan Fiction. There are many plot points that contradict the Leroux novel and some of the things characters do are so out of character you wonder how familiar Forsyth is with the primary material (his critique of Leroux in the prologue notwithstanding. wow did he not like the Persian. Heck or Raoul for that matter). Even so, if you can get past all the drawbacks the ending is very touching and that is why i gave the novel the benefit of the doubt and two stars. Would i read it again? nah. once is enough. read it just to assuage your curiosity. Borrow it from the library, though. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Forsyth really beats you over the head with symbolism from the Lloyd Webber musical and historical references to famous opera singers and political figures, while concocting a garbled sequel-storyline rife with uninteresting characters and stories. He banks on hyperbole all too often when discussing the Phantom's mangled face as the reason he cannot live in society, thus belittling a much more \\"real\\" human trauma outlined in the musical we all love."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Phantom Failure","review":"This book was terrible. It completely contradicts the orginal novel. Oh, and by the way, how can Gaston Leroux's novel be incorrect? It was his brainchild in the first place. Even if I knew nothing of Phantom of the Opera prior to reading this book, I wouldn't have enjoyed it. The plot was stupid. In the end, I kept reading just for the pure sake of being able to say I read it. I think people should step away from reincarnating Phantom. Give the story a rest. The Phantom dies at the end, okay? There is no more story. Thanks for reading my review. I hope you agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably BAD","review":"Do not waste your money on this book. If you want to read a more expanded version of the Phantom story, do yourself a favor and read, (or re-read) \\"Phantom\\" by Susan Kay. The \\"corrections\\" made by Forsyth are just plain maddening. (How can anyone have the nerve to correct fiction is just beyond me.) This is the proposed \\"sequel\\" to Phantom of the Opera? Where is Eric? Where is his passion, his pain? Who cares about this Phantom who lives in Manhattan? I certainly did not! This book is nothing more than bad melodrama. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phantom betrayal","review":"How do I review the work of a person who begins his novel by trashing the work of the man on whose famous work his novel is based? Gaston Leroux's classic novel \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" has thrilled readers and movie/theater patrons who have seen the screen & stage adaptations of his work. Forsyth attempts to expand on Leroux's characters, while saying that Leroux was totally wrong in his creation of those same characters.The Phantom of Manhattan is written from many different points of view, which makes it very confusing. The characters do not \\"live,\\" they are not believable, more cardboard than living, breathing people. For those familiar with the Leroux Phantom or the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, these characters bear little resemblance to any of those beloved characters. This story is neither romance, nor mystery. I would advise anyone who wants to read about the Phantom to read the original Leroux book, or the wonderful novel, Phantom by Susan Kaye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forsyth was not at his best with this book","review":"Being a Phantom of the Opera fan and enjoying Frederick Forsyth's books, I expected a lot more from this one. I found it tedious reading with a very thin plot. It did not keep my interest. It was written on request of Andrew Lloyd Webber who intended it as a sequal to his Broadway smash. However, it misses the mark completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the true phantom","review":"Please do not waste your time and money on this book. If you want to read a book that captures every element of the phantom of the opera, read Phantom, by susan kay. It is better than the original novel. here, forsyth creates a pitiful soap opera where his characters are unemotional and one dimensional. The facts do not even come close to matching the original novel. He left out important characters and gave all the credit to Andrew Lloyd Weber for the original. I found the book a severe disappointment. some things are not meant to have a sequel. This book was written purely out of egotism and greed. There is no understanding of the story or what it means. Please, reread the original or susan kay's book before even thinking of buying this filth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the dollar","review":"I'll keep my review short and sweet: I picked up a copy of this book in a dollar store.

Then, I got to the end of the book and realized that, though it is a well written book, the plot stunk. It's not worth the time it takes to read this book. There are better fan-written sequels than this one. Heck, I could write a better one than this. So, don't waste your time reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, should a REAL Panthom exist, he would sue Forsyth !!","review":"This book has nothing to do with other works from the same author. It is difficult to believe that this is the same author of bestsellers \\"Odessa\\", \\"Jackal\\", and so forth. FF even is critic against LeRoux novel, but his is worst. Rather he likes Leroux's style or not, Leroux's book is a classic, while Forsyth's book is only crap.I agree that Lloyd Weber's opera is the best expresion of art regarding the legend of the Phantom. And Leroux's novel is not a great novel, but Leroux created the Phantom, and he has the paternity over all the other books, movies, etc about the character. FF book is a waste of time and money. Don't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even deserve the one star!","review":"All my friends warned me, but I just had to see for myself. Well, I saw...and almost wish I hadn't! In the preface of the book, the author of *this* singular work discounts everything M Gaston Leroux had created when he wrote the original novel nearly a century ago. The story is told in a patchy tedious round about way. To say that the style is evocative of Susan Kay is both an insult to Ms Kay and to the story. As an idea, the story might have had merit if only handled by a more capable author, one more familiar with the story rather than someone who just walks right in and decides to change the whole thing. No respect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely disappointing","review":"I was so excited to read this book when I saw it on the shelf, and so disappointed when I finished it. Like the other reviewers, I found the multiple narrators completely irritating, as well as the lack of depth. The best audience for this kind of book would have been the true \\"Phantom\\" fans, and if they're like me, they would have wanted a long story, full of depth and character expansion, not something like a fluffy tabloid serial. Ironically, I thought the story of itself was just fine, but would have been much better if it had depth and one or two narrators. The only redeeming thing is that ... - I found it at...a book sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear","review":"Rather unbelievable attempt of Forsyth to enter a new genre... autor of briliant thrillers, so stick to that I should say.

I couldn't wait to read it, and when I finished it, I was sorely disappointed.I was thoroughly amazed at the lack of storyline given to Christine. I wasn't thrilled with the ever-changing narrator, most of whom were frightfully boring. I'm reading the book to find out what happens to Christine, Raoul, et al. and I could care less what paper this person works for, what sort of pants the \\"fun master\\" wears, etc. And the rediculous \\"trances\\" and \\"prayers\\" have got to go! There wasn't enough of the original characters, Erik aside. Erik's continuing plot was a bit silly; going from gutting fish to being the most wealthy man in NYC.If you want to read this book because you loved the original, I would only for the sake of completion, not because it's as riveting and engaging as the first.Tepid, at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAZY","review":"Such potential.....

I should have just skipped this one. My anger at Forsyth began even before I read the actual book. He begins by giving us a very longwinded explanation about how Leroux was a kook who can't be trusted and totally discredits the orignal book written by him. Then he changes most of the original story to suit his whims and tells a short and horrible tale. If I were Leroux (and still alive of course) I'd sue for damages.If you are really morbidly curious enough to read this book, I suggest taking it out of the local library, or at least buying it used, also preferably at a library so that you do not waste much more on it that your time, and won't feel bad ditching it somewhere afetrwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst sequel since Beverly Hills Cop 3!","review":"The original Phantom of the Opera was a book about a sinister monster that terrorized an Opera and the love of his life. It was thrilling and theatrical at the same time, and a classic. This book is neither.Basically, the Phantom escapes death and becomes a millionaire in Manhattan. He anonymously builds an Opera House and persuades his former love to come back to perform. Then he tries to seduce the girl once again.The book is mostly a description of Erik's and his former lover's life. The thrills and the mystery are all gone. This book is barely a shell of its predecessor, and I don't recommend it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention all phans!","review":"This book is the most pitiful excuse for a sequel I have ever seen! If you loved the Kay or orinal novel, you are going to be in for quite a shock! It follows basically NOTHING from either novel. It doesn't even keep well with the musical! A lot of the plot and just general idea of it is completely absurd to anyone who has any idea what Erik is! It degrades his character to the point where he is simply another cold muney grubbing exec., and veiws the entire original story with the kind of view a foolish non-phan, or just fan would hold. It has been sugar coated, and tossed in a clown outfit to keep the kiddies happy. Not something a true phan, or anyone who wants serious reading would enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was more about Christine than Erik!","review":"The story was disjointed and lacked the title character.

It was thin, uninspired and insulted the intelligence of all Phantom Phans everywhere. I was so livid, that I actually had daydreams of the many ways I would torture Forsyth for this travesty.

Finding out Raoul couldn't be Pierre's father was bad enough-- how can you respect a \\"hero\\" who rapes his heroine?-- but I mean, my god did it have to be because Raoul got shot in his nether regions???? Couldn't the author have left him with some dignity???? Christine gets shot, Pierre dumps Raoul without so much as a second thought, you find out Raoul doesn't have a complete set but everything is great between Erik and Pierre.

The character development one normally finds in his books is non-existent. The intrigue, plot twists and surprises expected in his usual work is woefully missing. This seems to be a book written for one of two reasons:1) he had nothing to do on a rainy weekend, or 2) he belted something out to meet the publisher's deadline.I suppose he is laughing all the way to the bank as many of his devotees purchase the book because they expect his usual level of excellence. In the future, I will certainly be more selective in my choice of books by Frederick Forsyth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frederick Forsyth left m disappointed","review":"The reason I ever read the original Phantom of the Opera in the first place was so that I could read the sequel written by Forsyth and be able to relate the characters with prior events.

After reading the preface, though I didn't completely agree with it, I expected the book to take the story to a higher level. However, with a weak and hurried story line, and a writing style, though true to Forsyth's earlier style in the beginning chapters, but deteriorating to an amateur's rendition of a run of the mill novel, this book had me wishing I had never read it.

This novel just demolishes the idea that Leroux wanted.The idea was that there was an opera ghost,but he was distroyed by lust,betrayl,obsession,and what killed him was...his love for Christine.

Mr. Forsyth portrays the phantom as a lust-hungry villian and totaly twists around the true facts. He makes Christine look like a wealthy snob, and Raoul a man she only married out of convenience!

The description of New York at that era is fascinating and the characters are interesting, even if one is not familiar with ALW or the movies, books, etc. The way the plot unfolds is excellent and the use of several characters in describing the action elevates the book to something more than just pulp fiction.

Further, although the author obviously had done some research into the history of the period, he had apparently not read much of the literature of the period because he missed the \\"voice\\" of the period. By that I mean, the way that people spoke and what they spoke of. His characters spoke as if they lived at today, not the late Victorian period. In short, he did not understand the culture of the time. Do your self a favor. Don't read this book. (You might try Angel of the Opera instead, especially if you happen to also like Sherlock Holmes)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash. Do not read","review":"This review will be brief as most other reviewers expressed the same opinion. I also do not think this book was written by Forsyth. The characters are quarter-finished with no inner or outer life. The multiple narration permits much filler with no relation to story line. In fact this book is probably an outline for a Webber musical, which is the only thing that makes sense of this non-novel, especially with the authors awknowledgement that the idea for the book came from Webber. The book is typical Webber without the music and scenes. I believe that Webber's musicals are all special effects and little substance. That describes this book. In effect , the book is a ripoff. Buyers should beware spending money on a premature musical script. A Forsyth secretary wrote the outline and he sold it as a book usung his well-deserved name as bait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baffling","review":"I find it difficult to believe that Forsyth actually wrote this book. It lacks all of the qualities of a Forsyth novel - complex characters and plot. More perplexing, it doesn't read like one of his books (eg, I would place it at reading level grade 8). Completely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifying","review":"I'm sure all the other 1-star reviews give an accurate description of this 'sequel'. So I will simply say this:I've read fanfiction by fourteen year old girls that had more accurate characterization, more believable plotting, and more satisfying writing.Nothing else really needs to be said, does it?So disappointed that ALW is making the stage sequel (quite obviously, though no one is saying so) based on this... thing. (Set in Manhattan... Coney Island... uh huh)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother.","review":"As a new \\"phan-attic\\", I was eager to read The Phantom of Manhattan.... boy, do I wish I hadn't.As the story is told through several character's eyes (most of which I think were added to fill pages), the redundancy is appalling. I felt like I was getting the same story in each chapter with miniscule bits of new information. I finally thumbed to the end of the book simply to find out what happened to Christine and her son, Pierre.The only benefit I found in this book was the preface, however, much of it was from the author's immagination, rather than from fact.********************A book I LOVE is The Phantom Returns by Stefanie Cole. It brings to mind the characters from the Phantom of the Opera movie (2004) perfectly, but does have some typos (not enough to irritate me, but it might to some)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself the heartache!","review":"I am a die hard Phantom Phan. I have been for about 15 years now. I view every form of Phantom movies/plays/performances and literature I can get my hands on.My 1st experience with reading this was an ARC (advanced reading copy) a friend that worked at a bookstore scored for me. I was SO excited for a new POTO book endorced by Webber to come out!Blech! If you care AT ALL for the main characters, this is NOT the book for you.I actually enjoy the different variations on a theme, this is not variation of a theme, it's butchery of a theme.The \\"author\\" starts the book stating how horrible he thinks the original Leroux version is. If you dislike a book so passionately, WHY write about the characters??I just found out in the news today that ALW is going to work with Forsyth for his upcoming sequel to be out in 2009 / 2010. I'm heart broken. ALL excitement about seeing a sequel on stage has deflated out of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it zero stars...","review":"This book is... horrible. I've never read a worse Phantom novel in all my life.First, before he even goes to write the novel itself, Fredrick Forsyth mocks Gaston Leroux, the writer of the original novel. He criticizes the book, then goes on to write something that should be burned. Only the epologue is worth it.I was reading the entire novel shaking my head in shame. I would not pay more than the penny that I did for this novel.It's really not worth it. Mr. Forsyth should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read if you need to read everything phantom!","review":"I did not enjoy this book as much as many of the other phantom stories that I have read. I try to read anything on the phanom, but this one was hard to get emotionally involved in. It jumped around so much that you were always being jerked to the next spot before you really got involved in where you already were. Although you could follow what was going on it just did not flesh out each situation enough to really get you involved and it felt somewhat cold to me. I will keep my copy just because have have to have everything phantom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This, Utter Waste of Time and Money","review":"Terrible sentence constructions, utterly mediocre (actually not even mediocre, he belongs to bad high school book report fare), and definitely made of the worst kind of putrescence!I would NEVER recommend this so-called 'book' to anyone, and I'm a a voracious reader, I know what's good, what's bad and the ugly...this is UGLY! I had to put 1 star or amazon would't let me print my opinion here.Good God! I can't believe St Martin's Press (or any other publishing house) would publish crap like this! it's a disgrace to the literary world and especially to the legacy and honor of The Phantom of the Opera.I had to stop reading every once in a while because I was scared my writing might be affected with his bad example. (I still shudder to think of that horrible experience}"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phantom fans stay away! Terrible story.","review":"I give this tale a -100. Characters had no depth, aroused no feeling of any kind. Author completely ignored facts and happenings in the original novel and musical. Author obviously had no feelings for what he was writing. This tale is an insult to the wonderful characters in the novel and the musical. Orginal facts were changed to support author's ideas. If you want to read some truly great Phantom stories check out the webb and see what the fans have written. Those stories put this one to shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phantom Fans Beware!!!","review":"This is *not* Leroux's (or even Lloyd-Webber's) Phantom. This is an entirely different character that the author apparently couldn't work up the creativity (or courage) to establish independently. Rather than attempt to stand on his own merits, the author instead chooses to extend a pre-existing story (which has a definitive end, by the way) while belittling and contradicting it at the same time. The characters are mere shadows; they may as well be completely different people who just happen to share the names of the primary figures from \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\". I find it laughable and yet infuriating that such an apparently well-known author would even think of putting forth such a sophomoric effort. If you're looking for a Phantom of the Opera pastiche, try visiting the many fan-operated websites that offer much better fare for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of a perfectly good tree...","review":"This book is a sham. I read a lot of books and rarely do I find one I can't say at least ONE positive thing about...this is one of them! How dare anyone take a classic like the Phantom of the Opera and completely rewrite it? to say...no, no, no THIS is what the author REALLY meant to say! Shame on Mr. Forsyth. Shame on the reviewers who try and make this farce into something it is not...a book worthy of the time taken to read it...! No one should waste their money OR time on this thing...take my advice...just burn the money and take in a no brainer at the cinema instead...or feed the birds in the park or give it to charity...don't waste it on this THING. And I mean this from the bottom of my heart! And for the ONLY time I have EVER said this...shame on YOU Amazon...for requiring that I actually have to GIVE this tripe a star to get my review printed! If I cannot just put in the minus sigh you have in your rating window...then why do you have it there?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Phantom","review":"Frederich Forsyth continues \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" in fine fashion, taking our anti-hero from the slums to the sky scrapers. He does this by seeing/feeling/talking through several people each with their own view point. Does he keep the Phantom fixed in time? No, he takes the Phantom further into time as anyone would who lives, learns and grows old. It's a story that moves on. If you are in love with the original story don't bother to read it. You won't like it. If you liked the origional story and can see future posiblities and like a good tale...read it you won't be disappointed. I liked his tale quite a bit. It was entertaining and thought provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Is it Possible.......","review":"Despite the many poor reviews listed here on amazon I decided to give this book a chance. After all,Forsyth is a very respectible author with many best sellers to his credit. The bottom line is- this novel really is just as bad as the reviews say it is. It is so horribly bad I doublechecked to make sure that the author of this train wreck really is the same Frederick Forsyth who wrote such notable and well-known novels as \\"The Day of the Jackel,\\" \\"The Odessa Files,\\" and \\"The Dogs of War.\\" Even if Forsyth had stepped outside of his box to write in a different genre there still isn't any reasonable explanation as to how \\"The Phantom of Manhattan\\" could be so bad.I'm still shaking my head in disbelief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phans will want to read, but really poorly done","review":"Phans everywhere will want to read this just to see what is imagined for the main characters' future, but the writing is awful. Even the novella format is too long, so expect to skim most of it to get to the climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stinker!","review":"Yep. This one is a real stinker. I loaned my copy to a friend, and don't care if it ever gets returned to me. As many others have said, don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book really is a Phantom!!","review":"Not only is this book a coldly written, readers digest version about the Phantom but the pages were a phantom as it was missing chapters Four through Eight in the book. They weren't removed, they were simply never were put in! And the last page was printed inside on the back cover! I've never seen such a sorry excuse of a book done by any publishing company before. I am very sorry that I bought this book and for what I paid for it and that Amazon did not check out the quality of this book and it's seller before hand. Shame on the seller!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"This book is odd because the Frederick Forsyth starts off explaining how Gaston Leroux made a lot of mistakes in his original novel and then Forsyth seams to repeat the original mistakes.He writes the story though random reports of characters you've never heard of. These new characters overhear conversations between Christine and Erik (the Phantom) and retell their friends. Each chapter is told by someone else. Reading it makes you feel so far away from the story. You end up sorting though nonsense trying to find the story of Christine and Erik.I see how they say, \\"captures the spirit and style of Gaston Leroux's novel...\\" they just forgot to tell you that it's also mixed up and in need of a rewrite.If you haven't read Susan Kay's Phantom, go for that one. If you have read Susan Kay's Phantom, read it again. There is no other Phantom novel like it. -----Phantom of Manhattan is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"After reading 13 sequels to POTO this is one of my least favorite. Just not an exciting enough story for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing beats the original Phantom","review":"I am a huge Phantom of the Opera fan, both the Leroux novel and the Webber play. This book was written by a close friend of Webber so I thought this would be one of the better \\"spin off\\" continuation type novels. I actually found it to be pretty lacking. I didnt find any of the intriguing mystery I expected in this Phantom, just a guy full of himself and bent on revenge it seemed but nothing too special. The ending was kind of a surprise but I agree, not really all that believable. Plus, the whole tangent on the money god and all that detracted from the main story (at least for me) and just ended up boring me until it got back to Christine and the original tale. If you want a REALLY awesome spinoff of the Phantom novel, read PHANTOM by Susan Kay. I found the history she creates for Eric brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Triumph Of The Will/Olympia","review":"These are classic documentaries but the quality of this particular release is terrible. It has the quality of a one dollar movie in a bargain bin. Do not buy this! It is a rip off for any amount of money. If I could, I'd return it but I have opened it so I'm stuck. Do not make the same mistake!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No commentary, no extras!","review":"I'm still glad to own this set but there is no commentary and no English subtitles to highlight the films. I had a previous DVD of this - must have been from another producer - and the commentary was invaluable. It's very much missed here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just look at the cover","review":"The cover says Adolph, not Adolf, and refers to Riefenstahl as his Nazi film maker, which Riefenstahl never was. Two postwar de-Nazification trials found her not guilty of having been a Party member--all she did was film what was in front of her, these were documentaries. Judging by that looseness with facts, I wouldn't buy these versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile to buy if you're into 60s British Rock","review":"This CD is definitely worth having in your collection if you enjoy the British 60s sound. \\"The Game of Love\\" is considered by many to date to be a classic.

The two biggest hits here (\\"The Breaks\\" and \\"Christmas Rappin'\\") are also available on that CD, although the sort-of-novelty \\"Basketball\\" included here is not. Blow's style changed little over the years, so the tracks fit together seemlessly, but the effect can wear a bit by late in the disk.

However, this same translation is the problem, although it manages to avoid some of the anachronistic elements of some more liberal translations. The explicit material is what defines this play and gives it its classical \\"Greekness\\" but none of that is present in this edition. It is certainly written for a younger audience not in touch with Greek theater.It's cheap, but this text does not reflect what the Greek one does. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lysistrata (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Bought this play to use as a prop in another play 'So What Do We Do About Henry?' by Charlotte Hastings.

No extra frills, no bells and whistles. Just perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolting and insulting.","review":"\\"Lysistrata\\" is truly a revolting play that pokes fun at women. They say Aristophanes thought women to be more than toys for their men, but I see the opposite. I think Aristophanes made a satire out of women and the only thing they are good at: sex and reproducing male babies. This is no compliment. To think that the only way women can change their husband's minds would be by withholding intercourse. This is preposterous! I found this play derogatory with ill humor. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Secret, But This Doesn't Do It!!","review":"I read so many critiques of this product and they were very positive about it's performance. My past experience with the regular Secret product led me to believe that I need to try Clinical for better performance since I seem to out perspire the strength of the regular and though I truly believe the amount Clinical costs is too much for the amount provided, I ordered it anyway. Boy was that a mistake!! I figured the performance would make up for the cost but was I wrong. This product does no better than the regular Secret and it was a waste of my money when I could've just stuck with the standard. Now I need to yet again find a new anti-perspirant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creates A Very Weird Scent","review":"I recently purchased secret clincal strength, and I am not pleased with the results. I applied some of this deodorant at night and followed the directions. Instead of leaving me powder fresh, It left a very unpleasant odor... worse than sweat. My daughter also used it and people in class commented her scent. It was a very embarrsing situtation for her. One positive to secret clinical strength is that it leaves smooth armpits. I recommend that you dont use this product. Go to a doctor and get perscription strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works Great!","review":"I love Secret Clinical Strength. I could not believe that I did not sweat or smell after a full day at work and then after a workout. My daughters and I all used it and then spent a few minutes testing each other's armpits, which sounds crazy and a bit disgusting, but that's what I call being there for each other in our hour of need, and to our amazement we all found no sweat, no odor. We were all amazed! Needless to say, I will keep buying this stuff. I like it better than Certain Dri, which made my underarms twitch and burn for some reason. There is no side effect, just dry underarms that are odor free. I don't mind paying extra for this. It's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off with no deoderant.","review":"I purchased this product and used it like the directions said and I sweated more and smelt bad and I usually don't have a problem with smelling bad.

I highly reccomend against this product unless you just want your armpits to smell good for 10-20 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing dispenser","review":"The deodorant itself has a nice fragrance and rolls on smoothly. However the dispenser requires very dry hands and strong fingers to press the deodorant through the slots at the top by rotating a disc at the bottom.

Well it's Monday, didn't sweat a drop all weekend, but I was at work 15 mins and I'm sweating like a pig now. I guess I must just be special.

First of all, I neglected to check the product weight...the box is enormous, but the actual container itself is VERY small...and only filled about halfway, at that. So, per ounce, it is extremely expensive. Secondly, while the deodorant aspect is fine (smells fresh throughout the day), the antiperspirant aspect is TERRIBLE. I'll have pools of sweat under my arms within two hours...something that doesn't happen with regular deodorant/antiperspirants, even in the summer. Perhaps it's my personal body chemistry, but this product does not work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"read the label!","review":"I bought this at around $8.00, got it home and read the ingredients. It is EXACTLY the same active ingredient as the Secret Platinum anti-perspirant.

I never saw the advertised results. Perhaps because the concentration of the active ingredient is only slightly higher than in the average antiperspirant, it is only slightly more effective. For me it was not worth the extra money. It would be a good choice for a woman who may sweat a little more than average and who wants softer underarms (I know that's an great concern for all of us).If you are like me and sweat regardless of the weather and of stress, you probably have an actual sweating problem and would be better off seeing a doctor about it than buying an ineffective antiperspirant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work Well","review":"I don't think this works much better then any other product I've tried.

It works very well. I have used it for years and I am a woman. Secret Clinical is a total rip off. You can use Mitchum and save money. But you won't smell like a flower or anything because it is unscented. Secret Invisible solid is the same ingredient at 19%, which I find works just as well and offers different scents, and it is less than 3.00 as opposed to 7.49 for the \\"Clinical\\"!

I have tried almost every product out in the market, including branching out to men's deodorants. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in this deodorant. It does not work any better than the standard Secret line, which is about 1/2 the price. It does not significantly reduce sweat in the pits. I tend to sweat more than an average person, and I do not recommend this product (even if they have tempting $2.00 off coupons in the Sunday papers.) The deodorant is also semi-wet, so the consistency is between a gel product and a regular solid stick. Therefore, you need a minute or two for the product to dry and for the \\"white stuff\\" to disappear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't come out of the dispenser","review":"As a deodorant, I think it works slightly better than my usual Right Guard. It's not astoundingly great. However what prompted me to write a review is the ridiculous dispenser. It requires the strength of ten thousand men to operate. I can't get it to turn at all. I have to ask my boyfriend to do it and even he can only turn it with a weird special grip technique. The fact that no other reviews seem to mention this makes me wonder if I just got one with a manufacturing flaw. But really...it's absurd.

It is a cute movie and I'm pleased that it's on DVD but I see that the DVD is fullscreen and I'm wondering if that's te correct aspect ratio or if it's an edited pan and scan of a widescreen movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take my advice...PLEASE! (See for all Herbie Sequel DVDs)","review":"Disney is NOT adding any features whatsoever for the Herbie, the Love Bug sequels. The only thing that could possibly be of any good quality within these discs would be a remastering of the picture and sound. Unless you've given up using your VCR or you are a collector, don't waste your time purchasing the Herbie sequels. Only the original movie, The Love Bug is worthy of it's \\"Special Edition\\" title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great multicultural flavor and refreshing to watch","review":"I saw this film for the first time in January, 2013. I was pleasantly surprised by the great casting of the many supporting roles and the great multicultural flavor of this film. And, being shot in 1977, it had very modern cinematography qualities that were not in the previous Love Bug movies. I also enjoyed seeing actor Dean Jones playing Jim Douglas again, at the age of 46. He really looked his best in this film. I watched this movie on DVD and the digital restoration and color repair, on this DVD version, was superb.It was a very refreshing film to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting individual account","review":"This is a short, intense account of a specific period of the war. I found this to be a gripping story, and hard to put down. With the number of personal accounts appearing, I also found it interesting that it tracks and crosses with several other personal accounts currently available dealing with the battle for Berlin. The one disappointment is that the story starts in the middle, since the ending was so exciting, I would have liked to read about the beginning. Because it is the story of one person and limited to his view as a member of a mortar platoon, I would recommend reading something with a larger scope to give this book more context. None of this detracts from the book, however, I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed","review":"I have read the priceless \\"Forgotten Soldier\\" and never thought anything could touch it but this book does. The story begins with much of the war already lost for the Germans on the Eastern front and fights on until the final battle for Berlin. My only regret is the story does not start with his experiences from the start. He leaves good detail of the Russians he is fighting and really opens your eyes to the amount of Mongolians and other ethnic groups serving with the reds. A great book and a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"A harsh look at the Eastern Front. The book follows the experiences of a Swedish SS soldier. What I found depressing about this story was his infatuation with Nazism. It bothers me how reasonably intelligent people can be duped by absurdity. At the end of the story he cuts and runs for his life, removing his beloved SS insignia. It appears that even though he gladly participated in the enslavement of a people, he wasnt about to reap the \\"whirlwind.\\" A story of moral degeneracy and cowardice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hoplessness of the lost","review":"I would have thought that a book written by an ex-SS member would have been full of justification for what the Nazi's did in Europe. However this is more about combat experience and the hopelessness of the final fight in the last days of the Reich. Like soldiers everywhere it was about your mates rather than any political system One wonders if the full cost of the war was ever properly reconciled.A good read if you are interested in the Second World war, but I would avoid it if you are a bit squeamish. As a combat veteran I can understand many of the excesses and I have seen some pretty horrific sights especially when the perpetrators have been communists.Perhaps it should be standard reading at Dultroon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unabashed Nazi Propaganda..... Pure and Simple","review":"This exceedingly short memoir of a Swedish SS volunteer in the last days of the SS Nordland division in 1945 is short on real specifics yet long on multiple condemnations of the Bolshevik hordes. Wallin through Hillblad (the editor), gives little in detail on his unit or men he fought with. This contrasts with his unrepentant and relentless anti-Soviet propaganda which even reaches out to American flyers. Wallin conveniently forgets a couple of facts: (1) Nazi Germany was the aggressor nation in WWII., and (2) Wallin volunteered to fight for this criminal regime.Apart from this, the quality of the Wallin's writing or recollection and Hillblads editing is very simplistic. Fictional works like the Forgotten Soldier capture the drama and action of the Eastern Front conflict much better and without the speeches. One star only and that is for the few pages of photos at the end of the book. \\"Twilight of the Gods\\" yeah, sure Erik."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really slanted view point of the SS","review":"The author rambled about his political view of the SS thru out the book. There were some detailed combat stories that were poorly written. I did not agree with the SS \\"Army of GOD\\" defense or his view of the Russian Army being sub human. However it was an interesting read from someone totally immersed in the SS creed. I would recommend this book only to someone interested in the SS view point of the final battles around Berlin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"A honest book about the bitter fighting on the Eastern front during the last days of the Second world war. A read which is comparable to Sven Hassel's 'Wheels of Terror'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it!","review":"Save your money, the book is a waste of time.

This book does not even come close to meeting my expectations. Since Mr. Witham does not seem to understand the arguments of the Pro-Design-Faction, he cannot put the quotations he constantly cites into proper perspective.

The jazz compositions of Nando Michelin pale horribly in face of the sacred hymns of the Candomble that only come through in barely recognizable snippets here and there. As a jazz musician, Michelin is mechanical and monotonous. Notwithstanding his annoyingly academic jazz, where in the world did he get the hubris to mess with the Candomble. This CD is only a musical form of gibberish. Listen to the sacred music of the Candomble, if you want to rejoice. Listen to this CD if you want to waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Candomblé de gringo","review":"This recording has nothing to do with the soul of candomblé. It's outrageous to use the name of candomblé with so little knowledge about it. The compositions don't use the rhythms of the orixás (toques) and when they try, they fail.Candomblé is a brazilian religion which reflects a complex and complete culture. But Brazil is not in here. The attempt to play the avamunha rhythm ended in a candombe-like \\"samba\\". Probably because the leader is from Uruguay. And the overall interpretations are far from being authentic, which reflects a lack of studies and \\"experience\\" in candomblé.Maybe they could name the record \\"candomblé banana\\" or \\"candomblé de gringo\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, I am afraid","review":"I will never understand why some American authors have this need of constantly harping on the... the mythology of the story of their own country, I guess. I was quite enjoying the political setup of the story, when the Declaration of Independence started. I then realized that I was reading a sci-fi reworking of American history. Something similar to Orson Scott Card Book of Mormon-Earth saga. I would have enjoyed it anyway, but -in case someone had missed it- the authors launched in a word by word reiteration, going from tasteful recreation to lamentable rip-off. I am not American. I am not a mormon. I think such reworkings show a deep lack of respect for true history, specially because they tend to turn into maniquean expositions of Good vs. Bad. I would ask Mr. Weber and Mr. White to please refrain from further indulging on this historical... parodization.

However, when the book arrived, I saw the condition was far from what was advertised. The pages were yellowing and within two days, and only being read twice for a total of maybe 15 minutes (it was fairly dull in my opinion), the cover fell off. Another few days and the back cover was gone as well. Then I noticed the edges of several pages were torn. I realize it was \\"used\\", but the seller should have at least been honest about the book's condition. The irony is, the book now looks VERY well-loved, but I didn't like it personally.

Quite frankly, I am now sorry that I donated my other set of cookware to a charity, because even though it was well-used, I consider it to be better than this set of Farberware. The set was purchased because of the Farberware name and I am now very disappointed. However, since I paid relatively little for the set (and utilized a gift certificate), I am not about to go to the trouble and expense of returning it to the manufacturer for replacement.

When I got them, I immediately noticed that the quality was much less sturdy and well-made than the Foreverware. And the most important feature that I was looking for - non-stick, that was a joke. I'd never buy any Farberware products anymore. I do recommend Foreverware. It had sustained lots of scratches and damages from me over the years and yet it's still perfectly non-stick.

Hey Farberware, I shouldn't be able to fold your pans in half with my bare hands. I chose Farberware because its a known brand and I thought it was a quality brand.

Some of his songs sounded the same, but thats beside the point because they all sounded great. They called him \\"The Walrus of Love\\" and sure enough, that's what he looked like, with his big droopy 70's mustache and hefty physique. Todays music can either be very vapid {dance pop}, or violent {Rap}, so a talent like Barry's is missed all the more. There was a time when men and women wrote deeply and intensely about love and sensuality and Barry was the King of that era.

This is a great anthology, and these 20 tracks are all winners'. There are 2 problems though. One of the problems are that the tracks are edited (maybe 6 or so). This anthology doesn't have any hits from 1979, but it does have a great summarization of his post-1971 hits.

Everywone should watch and own this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two good movies in one set","review":"I remember seeing these movies in the theater and I'm happy to say that they hold up well through the years. A dream cast plus a witty script make these films the model for Musketeer movies, although the quartet in Man in the Iron Mask comes very close. The set is attractively packaged and there are lots of nice extras, from the time the movies were released and some new interviews with the stars today. These disks are well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a technical note...","review":"I can't add anything to the numerous enthusiastic reviews ahead of me, but I did want to warn the buyer that though the DVD video transfer of both titles was magnificently done, the sound track from the Four Musketeers appears to have been taken from a damaged original--the dolby 2-channel stereo had long stretches of unpleasant boominess except on low volume. I hope on the next release the studio can remix the soundtracks to multichannel (the action in these films will work great with it) and fix the quality of the 4M track. And I take to heart what the hearing-impaired reviewer said: don't forget those subtitles and narrations..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The complete musketeers","review":"All dvd's should be this nice.

There's a ton of swashbuckling and sword play mixed in with humor and satire. Racquel Welch is beautiful but has limited scenes.

It is a 'guilty pleasure' with a few laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slapstick comedy","review":"Warning. This movie is a parody of the book. If you where inspired by and loved the adventures of D'Artagnan in the book, do not watch this movie. I had to turn the movie off in disgust after 20 minutes. It is a goofy slapstick comedy. There is nothing wrong with comedy. But when it's based on a book with the caliber of romantic heroes such as D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis - that is a crime.Alexander Dumas wrote two great books; The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo.

I liked this version and the acting a lot better than any other version. The sword play seemed more realistic in this movie except for Oliver Reed , who preferred brawling rather than swordplay. Mind you the 1948 version had better swordplay but that was the era of over the top fights and a little over acting by Kelly. The Disney movie was simply a Young Guns for swashbucklers, The more recent movies are pure what ever the CGI and flavor of the day is. Lana Turner is still the best M'lady ever no matter what era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious cheese","review":"A totally fun ride and a worthy wet Saturday afternoon watch.

It is a little bit more space efficient than the G.I. 1 quart bottle. It is very easy to clean (just empty the water out of the canteen and put the canteen down on a cloth or a carpet for a quick drying) so it is easy to manage at a campsite. HOWEVER this water bottle has many MASSIVE downsides to it. #1- It leaks badly. #2- Any scratches make the canteen look bad. #3- The bottle has a horrid design which makes it difficult to hold and store.

That is, although he took his trip before the Russian Revolution and even before the country had begun to modernize and industrialize in earnest, he picked up on something so fundamental about the land and its people that it is still recognizably there today. You would have to read the book to figure out what that is, and the czar's autocracy, mentioned by the previous reviewer, has a lot to do with it even though today's czars are elected. From that standpoint, de Custine's subtitle, \\"A Journey Through Eternal Russia,\\" is literally true: he saw through the external and the accidental to the eternal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, it even helps young adults to grow in faith !","review":"I have been using this book for my bible study group for past few weeks, and these teenagers are showing great interests.

The music is so awful that it made me sad that the younger generation would be led to believe that this garbage is representative of the golden years of hardcore from NYC.I could excuse the omission of the 80s bands if the film was well made and included an interesting cast of characters that had more to say than, \\"I'm an outcast of society; hear me roar!\\" Unfortunately, the result is an art student quality film of live clips from (mostly) CBGBs and interviews with band members and fans who are not at all compelling or articulate.Watching this film made me wish that CBGBs had closed its doors in 1992.

It is written from the perspective of a daughter, Evie, and is beautiful. Themes are adult and inappropriate for children; however, for mature adults, the material is rich, not offensive, and poignant. This movie is special because although it is written from Evie's perspectice, it is easy to understand her mother's (played by Amy Madigan) perspective, that of her sister, young boyfriend, and even husband.It is rare to find a movie that is beautiful, without gratuitous elements to appeal to our popular culture (and thus sincere), telling and interesting and different story, yet one with which at some level we can all identify.View this movie if you are looking for something thought-provoking, well-done, with spectacular acting and an intelligent plot.

The author caught and kept my eye by using real facts, court transcripts and actual research about the events. He also has a background in psychology which helps him understand and explain what happened. I would recommend the first half of the book. From that point, it talks about the weird happenings of the Lutz family. Instead of the author speaking, it jumps to another woman explaining what she thinks. The book lost my interest then.

It's just one melodramatic 'evil event' after another. The most ludicrous sequence being a moment where Father Mancuso does spiritual battle with a satanist in a San Francisco head shop (a scene that reads like something cribbed from a Graham Masterton novel). Only passing references are made to the creation of the first bestselling book, the hit movie adaptation, and, in the most revealing moment of the novel, aiding Ronald DeFeo's defense attorney with the story of their unfortunate experiences (for which all this nonsense was created in the first place, to give the insanity plea supernatural credence - it failed).

More time wasted Andre-package two wrong orders and stand in line to drop off the package at the post office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sebago men's spinnaker shoe","review":"Good solid construction while maintaining classic style lines. I bought them for my teenager and they are still holding up great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bloodied foot","review":"Went on a day trip with my new Sebago mens spinnaker boat shoes. By the end of the day my right foot was very red and almost bleeding. On looking at the shoe the stiching inside the right shoe was bunched up and causing the shoe nto rub against my foot. Further investigation showed that the right shoe actually was a different shade than the other. Come to find out it was the last pair available. I believe the shoes were returned and than sold to me. How could anyone with a conscience offer a product like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice shoes, even better service!","review":"The first pair I bought were a bit large and I was pleasantly surprised at how simple Amazon's return and exchange policy was. Now the shoes: They seem to be of excellent quality are comfortable and look good. If you're choosy about which shoes you choose then you should choose these new shoes (now say that fast three times...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Looking Shoe","review":"Great Looking Shoe. Needs a little breaking in as they are leather and stiff. But you will be the talk of the dock with these. They are suede, so be warned. They are more of an evening shoe, vs sailing shoe."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Need Them","review":"I got these shoes for a trip to the Carrabean and they are now a new favorite. Simply stated they are so fly, enough said... Buy them"},{"rating":"2","title":"great shoes","review":"These shoes are great for all occasions ..... nearly.Wear with shorts, jeans,boardies. Beautifully made, extremely comfortable, and well priced.I love \\"em."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my foot bleed","review":"Ignoring the comments of one of the reviewer, I went ahead and ordered these shoes, being captivated by their beauty. The item arrived as promised, and looked as good as the picture.However, a 5 minute walk with these shoes made the upper part of the heels (tendons) bleed profusely. I actually didn't realize that the pain I was feeling was already being accompanied by bleeding.I would suggest the manufacturer to look into this, and improve the shoe design from the back, seems the shoe protrudes too much towards the inside and hurts (actually ruptures) the tendons."},{"rating":"1","title":"hurts my feet","review":"I tried on a party, I felt hurt on both feet and the edge of the shoe cuts my skin and bleeding.The style is nice but it causes so much trouble to me while I couldnt feel comfortable on wearing it.I woulent recommend people buying this shoe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they has been","review":"I found the shoes unconfortable ,very hard for nubuck leather,they are not what these shoes use to be ,sebago should look at a better manufacture"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. Stick with sperrys","review":"Ordered my usual size 11, was too long, heel was rock stiff, figured it might be okay after some break in time. Returned it and got a 10.5, front was too tight, too narrow , heel was as usual, rock stiff, wore it for 2 hours an decided to return it, feet was crying for help, pain at the heels were excruciating. Colors may be attractive but it isn't worth it, stick with sperrys ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most comfortable","review":"The first few times I wore them my feet were pretty much raw. I just thought that I had to wear them in but after 4 tries (I really wanted this to work!) I just could not deal with them again. The style is nice, but wearing these things without socks is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfort with Style","review":"I just received my Sebago Spinnaker Boat Shoes and I completely love them! They were delivered to me in a mint condition! The packaging is great and the shoes themselves are simply awesome. Not only do they look great, but they are extremely comfortable. The materials used to make them is top notch. I extremely recommend them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Fit","review":"Shoe color was not the same as the image on Amazon. The show was very stiff and did not fit well; caused blisters on my feet within 15 minutes. I recommend a different brand if you are on the market for boat shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"I first had a sebago dockside 24 years ago just bought a new one after all this years looks exactly the same feels the same ...great shoe could use a little more comfort hence the 4 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard shoes","review":"shoes, hard, rough, uncomfortable to use, they have hurt my feet, and I have almost no use them; regret that a brand like SEBAGO have concessions that discredit, I hope they give me some alternative change, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile Battery Hog","review":"The title says all I need to say. This is an awesome toy until you tire of unscrewing the door to change the batteries, or until it just gives out. Ours lasted four months. The toy blower is the same story, which supports the notion that it is not just a bad unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"YARBROUGH ( BEND OR)","review":"THIS ITEM IS A PIECE OF JUNK. OUR SON GOT LESS THAN 1 HOUR OF ENJOYMENT FROM THE WEED WHACKER BEFOR THE BUTTON FOR CONTINUED USE BROKE. NEEDLESS TO SAY WE HAD ONE UPSET 2 1/2 SON. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM, IT IS A GREAT IDEA, BUT IS POORLY MADE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl drop ear rings","review":"The ear rings were exactly what I was looking for in a gift for my wife and the picture on Amazon was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDINGLY UNIQUE AND ENJOYABLE!","review":"One of the most unique and original bands I've heard in years. They combine a percussionish, alternativish, rockish and a kind of feel to the songs that makes them OH SO hearable and enjoyable!!! Almost indescribable. A MUST HEAR! Send me on my way was what got me into them. After hearing the song in \\"Ice Age\\" I was rusted rooted! It heard the rest of the album and take my word for it. They really ARE GOOD! Their songs have a milarepaish kind of osho music kinda feel to them. Really nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent and never annoying","review":"There are many reviews of this CD already. I will only add that this is one of the best bands to come along in the 90's and this is a truly magnificent album. Contrary to the amazon.com review, there is nothing preachy about any of the lyrics. Ecstasy would appear to be a protest song and one with as much power and emotion as you will hear anywhere. If anyone finds it preachy, they should consider listening to the Beach Boys."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],C={key:0},R={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),b(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const N=d(O,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-5dd34b07"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/2.md","filePath":"library/2.md"}'),W={name:"library/2.md"},P=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
