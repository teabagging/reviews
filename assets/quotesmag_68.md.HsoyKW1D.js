The album features the excellent gritty work of Ronnie Kayfield on guitar who brings to life songs \\"Love Loaded\\", \\"Night of the Wolf\\" and \\"Women in Chains\\". The album is heavier than the usual UFO fare but retains sufficient melodic backdrops to Fin's (vocalist) screams. This is an epic hybrid album that moved the melodic metal sound pioneered by UFO (then stolen and trashed by Def Leppard) in a gutsier direction. Many Waysted fans prefer the Paul Chapman work (who I acknowledge did some of the best UFO work and had some good chops on the later Waysted albums) but this album is one of those hard to find gems from an era that many only recall for bad hair, parachute pants and awful music. But those early 80's metal pioneers may remember this. What happened to Ronnie Kayfield? You were great, man."},{"rating":"1","title":"I remember this piece of poo","review":"I am walking down memory lane. I remember this cover, and I also remember I didn't like the album.

The tunes are so catchy that I caught my husband humming one of them in the supermarket last week. I can't say enough GREAT things about this album. Most childrens albums become so annoying that I actually have hid a few of them from my children until I could secretly donate them to the library. But, this one is a lot of fun. What also impressed me is that EVERY single song is 100% G-rated. There is NO violence, sexual suggestion, or exploitation whatsoever. Actually, the songs have a great message. Call me old fashioned? PERHAPS, but I like for my girls (ages 6, 4 and 2) to stay \\"little girls\\" and sing about flowers, smiles, and happy thoughts.

This collection of songs is no exception. Zvonko Bogdan, from Novi Sad, Serbia was a featured guest soloist on this album and was superb as always! The group, Sviraj, however, should study pronunciation of the Serb-Croat language before they attempt to perform. This two disk set is a live concert from Philadelphia. It contains videos that are hard to see unless you are on the internet and have QUICKTIME 5 installed. The performaers mouths and lyrics are out of sync, just like watching a poorly dubbedKung Fu film or Hercules movie of the 60's. Sviraj's first album is much better, 4 stars! Don't waste your time and money on this one unless your a Zvonko Bogdan fan, he only sings a medley of his hits on the disk.

Saying this, if you watch CNN and have followed the events of the both Gulf wars or even have a vague idea about what went on during these two conflicts, then 60% of this book is basically a broad and generalized summary of those events.The first quarter of the book is interesting if you're curious as to how Saddam came to power as a young Islamic buck. Then especially interesting is Saddam's sons Uday and Quasay (whatever). Both sons would make your pot smoking kid look like an angel in comparison to the sadistic naughtiness of these two young Persian Gulf monsters.The book reads like a text book, and lacks any sense of eloquence.

That's why you end up liking Corman's \\"B\\" films.SCORPUS GIGANTUS is not a classic even for Corman, but the effects of the bug are much better than usual, but alas the acting is atrocious. Even the usually dependable Jeff Fahey goes overboard in his role as the head of an elite delta force called in to battle--what else---a genetic experiment gone wrong. Most of the action is set in dark places like warehouses and on a boat, so you don't get to see a whole lot of the bug monster, but when it does appear, it's not too bad.

Other standouts are \\"Painted Desert\\", \\"Temprary Heroes\\", and \\"Diamond Field\\".The songs are melodic and show a maturation to the music's complexity.

The best thing about them is that you don't have to fill in the holes and you still don't see the pins. However, if you want to buy one I would stay far away from the SENCO. It is a cheap tool all around. The magazine jams, pins don't go all the way in, and you have to adjust the tool every time you use a different pin.

The value of any coating is lost immediately when the bit is sharpened and a such seem ill-suited for anything but casual, homeowner use. Quality control seems to be lacking as drills are out-of-round, the drill point angle is uneven, etc. The drill point angle can be corrected but there goes any perceived advantage of a coating. Never mind drill point angle and coatings...an out-of-round drill bit is worse than no bit.

Like most kids her age, we're reading pretty 'big' stories to her (Pinkaliciious, Fancy Nancy, Ladybug Girl, etc) so for her to just have a picture board book with few words is just too basic.

The ink drawings bring little Davie and his impish little rabbit so close to you, they might well be snuggled next to you.

Radin presents an excellent scientific case for the truth of psychic phenomena, using statistics to examine \\"psi\\" -- the phenomenon that includes the three broad categories of anomalous phenomenon of psychokinesis (mind-matter interaction), extra-sensory perception, and survival after bodily death. Radin excels at presenting memorable stories along with his clear, concise, and comprehensible statistics in such a way that one feels compelled to either accept or reject his findings and the implications they suggest. This is an excellent book for reading when you're ready to do your own thinking... and change the way you view the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid evidence, theorizing shaky","review":"Radin presents the scientific evidence for psychic phenomena, the criticisms of the skeptics, and how the experimenters have convincingly addressed the criticisms. This is very well presented, and very persuasive.He then goes on to speculate about the theory that might explain PSI. This seems a lot more shaky and speculative. He seems to argue that current scientific methods are inadequate to handle PSI, but I don't see why that should be so.Overall, a very good book that'll change your thinking if you're currently skeptical about psychic phonemena."},{"rating":"2","title":"best evidence of psi","review":"The only significant refutation within the scientific community of the information presented in this book appeared in nature, but was subsequently retracted due to an inaccurate depiction certain points found within the book.

That's too bad, because this is the most comprehensive scientific study of psychic phenomena I've ever seen. This is not another fluffy book full of amazing psychic stories, but an even more amazing story of how science demonstrated that some psychic effects are real, and also why most scientists dare not admit it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed statistics","review":"The conclusions in this book are largely based on combined analysis of published studies. As noted by the Author, such \\"meta-analyses\\" are subject to publication bias. Unfortunately, the \\"fail-safe file drawer\\" method of assessing possible effects of publication, used by the Author, is flawed.

If this is the best evidence ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dishonest treatment of facts","review":"This book is an attempt to treat paranormal phenomena using the tools of science. However, solid statistical evidence is overwhelmed by telling the reader amusing stories. The fact that selective reporting accounts for virtually all the strange claims by Dean Radin becomes obvious if we look at reviews of this book, for example. Radin wrote that none (except of prof. Scargle) gave him less than 4 stars. Radin \\"overlooked\\" the review by the \\"reader from Pittsburgh\\" called \\"one good chapter\\" which gave him 3 stars. Furthermore, Radin wrote a review for himself and got 5 stars for free in this way. My review (and I guess that many others) were not published several times. This type of \\"selective reporting\\" occurs not only when people judge this book but also in paranormal phenomena generally and the book does not take this dishonesty into the account at all and treats uncritically the claims by people who really wish paranormal phenomena to exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE CONSCIOUS UNIVERSE","review":"NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

The author DOES attempt a scientific statistical analysis of published studies of psychic phenomena. However the crucial \\"file drawer effect\\" (the fact that studies with negative, neutral or inconclusive results are often not published) is not dealt with satisfactorily. The author simply asserts large values for the estimated number of studies that would have to languish unpublished to explain his statistical results, without giving the reasoning. These estimates (~10 to 1000 times the number of studies published) are obviously way too large: it is clear that unpublished studies numbering on the same order as those published would have a large effect on the results. If this is the best evidence for the reality of psychic phenomena, I don't see any reason to accept same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man's unknown potential","review":"This is a rare book in the sense that exploitative or New Age accounts muddy the field and seem to leave nothing but skepticism as an option: but Radin is wise to these wrong approachs and actually succeeds in making a case for the existence of psi phenomena. The current dogmas of reductionism, while they set the baseline of skeptical inquiry, filter out a whole side of man. One problem is the way a scientific approach tend to reify into a set of crystallized concepts, e.g. 'esp', and these are defined as abstractions, which are then subject to misleading tests and/or fantastic claims. But the realms of these supposed phenomena don't follow the rules of standard definition. This is an important book because the current mythologies of the age of Big Science are provoking an immense reaction by those who simply won't submit to definition of man proposed. It is unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Paradigm Shift","review":"This truly important work foreshadows the next major paradigm shift in human understanding and exposes the fallacy of the concept of time. Finally, here is a scientist who takes psychic phenomena seriously and puts it to the test. Radin presents his data in a complete and straight forward way, leading even the skeptical reader to agree with his fascinating conclusions.

Dean Radin is a true open-minded scientist,courageously withstanding the potential onslaught of dogmatic criticism and simply reports phenomena based on research and experimentation. One cannot claim that the results are based on wishful thinking. Statistical results of closely-guarded experiments speak for themselves.

It's got a pretty good fuzz going with a really great up-octave effect at the same time.If you do double-stops, you'll get a really nice ring-modulator-ish effect.This pedal will give you taste of some of Hendrixes tone, all you need to add is the talent. :)Now that the nice things are out of the way, I'll discuss the not so nice things. It's cheap. Be careful not to break it.Really.Don't expect to be able to abuse it or kick it around the stage. If you're not careful, when you're stomping (funny how people tend to stomp on these things), you could break off a knob.I've had mine a few years and haven't managed to break it yet. Your mileage may vary, yadda, yadda...Bottom Line: I'm pretty happy with mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fragile yet cool","review":"This pedal isn't built for stomping, so I would suggest leaving the protective plastic cover on. As far as tone, this thing is really cool. The distortion on tap here is pretty heavy, but that suits me fine. As far as the octave-up mode, you can get some great Hendrix style tones. If you don't plan on an octave fuzz as being an integral part of your sound, this pedal is a great buy. If, however, you do a lot of Hendrix or SRV covers, invest in a Chicago iron Octavia or maybe a full tone octafuzz."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have pedal? I totally agree.","review":"First of all, I consider the octave fuzz an extra. This pedal is about great fuzz and distortion. Along with classic fuzz pedals like the Fuzzface and Big Muff, it does fuzz but also a nice variety of distortion tones. You can make it sick and spitty (a good thing) or get a fully saturated distortion tone. The tone knob is where a lot of the magic lies--twisting it yields a variety of fuzz flavors.

Easy to use & quick too! I can weed an approx. 200 sq. foot area in just a few minutes. The size makes it easy to work around plants. Light weight so it won't wear you down. It's almost addicting once you start using it. I almost always end up doing more area than I intended to. A must have for anyone that wants to limit the use of chemicals in their gardening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best on the Market","review":"By far the highest amount of retinol you'll find in the over the counter lines. I love this formula, it's not too hard on your skin but after a week or two you'll certainly notice the difference. Be sure to use a sunscreen during the day because it makes your skin much more sensitive to the sun. All the beauty reviewers love this product - that's how I first found this line of skin care products. Check out the enhanced AHA creme too - great for summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gratifyingly huge","review":"This tube will last me a lifetime considering that you need just a dab for the eye area. It feels pretty light and doesn't smell too strong, although I have not noticed any significant reduction of wrinkles and fine lines within a month that I've been using it. Or maybe I just don't have enough of them to see anything significant. Going through the ingredient list, I was impressed to see a lot of good anti aging ingredients, but Parabens have to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I'm 35 and my skin started showing some signs of aging. After reading about the benefits of Retinol and considering the low price and good reviews on this product I bought a tube of Retinol ResQ in my local Ulta store.I first used it on my chin, then on my forehead and above the upper lip. I didn't feel any burning or irritation. Encouraged by this one night I applied a thin layer on my cheeks. The next morning my face was covered with a small red rush. It could have been clogged pores, caused by emulsifying wax in this cream. Or that was my reaction to the retinol in this cream. The rush turned hard the following days and it took over a week for it to go away.I stopped using it and switched to Neutrogena, which doesn't irritate my skin, but also doesn't seem to work either.I'll try to use ResQ during my summer break, when I don't have to go to work :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"We all truly enjoyed this movie!

I havn't seen the video in a few years and still remember it vividly. My son and I were downloading music (of MJ ) and it brought back memories of Smooth Criminal and all the claymation.

I can promise you that I am the number one Michael Jackson fan. The smooth criminal video is incredible but the entire film is unnecessary. The video appears on History Volume II, so buy that one instead. The Dangerous Short Films and History Volume I are also both a lot better than Moonwalker. Even if you are an avid fan, I suggest buying all other M.J. videos before you even think about buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, sorry to say.","review":"I have to agree with the \\"Time Out Film Guide,\\" that calls this \\"a witless project...boring...unimaginative.\\" Sorry to disagree with the other reviewers who loved it, but I really do think it's one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. And I'm a Michael Jackson fan. The worst part of it was the last part, with the 3 children - and their dog, who makes an appearance just in case you didn't think it was cute and sentimental enough. Cute stuff so that your toes curl. I borrowed it from the library, I'm happy to say, and that's where it's going back, today. I was impressed by his running ability - there are a few scenes in which he runs very fast. He looked good, and he looked like he was in very good shape at that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film deserves a review????????","review":"Michael Jackson's Moonwalker... ahh.

Michael looks so joyful and earnest in these pieces; you just want to eat him up! I especially liked his pseudo-live (well, I guess it's really live, but given for a preset audience) rendition of the Lennon-McCartney classic \\"Come Together.\\" His treatment is suitably funky! For comparison, go on the Web and find one of the Beatles' live performances.

Sure the music videos are great, but it doesn't make up for the horrible deeply disturbing Michael Jackson montage. The beginning of the movie starts off with the wonders and greatness of MJ... then it moves onto how he hates the attention and he hates being famous... then it turns into complete insanity. I could feel my soul trying to jump out of my pores when I saw the \\"plot\\" shown. It involves MJ turning into random vehicles/animals/objects specifically to save children and scare the heck out of me. Another thing greatly disturbing is the focus on children, which most definitely does not support MJ on the entire pedophilia issue. But maybe I'm just weird... The music's great! The rest is disturbing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is it?","review":"Is it a movie? Is it a music video? Is it a freakish pederast's homage to the children he loves?

Christ was born in the spring. The catholic church made Christmas a holiday only to spite a pagan Holiday happening a day or so before and/or after December 25. That's the only reasons why most Christians celebrate Christ's birth in December.Before I make any sort of statement regarding the book, I must confess to be a born again Christian.Now, I must say I respect anyone who wants to hisorically research Christ and His body of believers--it is not a sin by anymeans for a Christian to question or doubt nor is it a sin for unbelievers. Job had questions and David doubted the dedication of God, though in the end God revealed His grace and love to them--as He does to all men--and David and Job both were comforted and reaffirmed their faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writing, but the content is pure fiction","review":"...The book is a complete joke. Well, not completely but rather rather only the believability of the content. Nothing depicted here is anything but creative spin on already known information that has been available for centuries. The twists and stretches required to postulate such nonsense breaks under even a quick glance at the logic employed.Only spend your money on this book if you like conspiracy theory and are an avid mystery reader. As fiction, its not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literally hooey!","review":"When someone takes the time to write and publish a book with a title like this, one really has their hopes up to see what evidence they think they have.

Whether you are a Christian or not, the issue with this book is its commission of numerous errors and assertions that have been proven false by scholarly historians. If you want to wrongly conclude and believe that the historical Jesus was nothing but a conglomeration of pagan gods, then this book is for you. But if you want the truth, then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"NONE OF THE ABOVE, i.e., zero stars","review":"I would have given it zero stars -- if that had been an option. Hence, none of the above.I find no enjoyment reviewing a book of this kind. I couldn't get through it and there is no point trying to enumerate the reasons why. The book's problems are too many and too deep to enumerate. Aside from the fact that it is poorly written, Freke's more fundamental problem is that he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. I shake my head in amazement that people will actually buy such twaddle. Readers who are sincerely looking for real answers about the rooots/origins of their own western spiritual tradition would do better to have a look at my own book, also posted here at amazon, Gnostic Secrets of the Naassenes.A word to the wise: Don't waste your money on Freke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speculation posing as research","review":"Probably better researched than Christ Conspiracy by Acharya S.still not the book we hoped it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"an opinion","review":"To be fair, I am not a fan of this book, but I have decided to revisit it lately. It fails on two basic levels: an understanding of theology; and an understanding of history. There is absolutely no understanding of culture and religion and how these work in a society. The authors have a tendancy to confuse philosophy and religion.In terms of histiography, its pretty poor. This book is filled with wild conclusions on shaky evidence. They also have a tendancy to misquote and to take out of context."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jesus Mysteries","review":"Simply put this is possibly one of the clearest books written on the subject of shared spiritual heratage through the centuries. Focusing on the mythalogical motifs common to Greek, Roman and Christian traditions \\"The Jesus Mysteries\\" offer an astonishing insight into the possible origins of the Christian belief."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book with huge information about the 1. century CE.","review":"I took this book with me during holidays, travelling around Iceland and it was much fun to read it. This is a book, easy to read, with huge information about the 1.century CE and common beliefs in those days. The book has a good bibliography and notes to all pages, as also informations about who's who, for those who haven't learned a lot in church history. At the end of each chapters there are conclusions which makes it easier for the reader to grasp the chapters ideas. When reading this book it is obvious that the writers are very well educated and there is much to think about so I will definately be reading it again and again. What we are dealing with here is the idea that Jesus was originally a myth and never a historical figure. So I think this is more a book for skeptics and scholars, than for those who take the Bible seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I really loved reading this book, then I bought \\"Jesus and the Lost Goddess\\" by the same author, and it was good, but this one is better. If you enjoy this book, you should also read Freke and Gandy's book called \\"The Second Coming.\\" It's very different, they seemed to be having more fun writing that one. I think they did all their heavy research in the earlier books and then decided to lighten up a little! I have to say, the \\"Jesus rant of 2000 years of pent up rage\\" at the end of the Second Coming book is worth the entire price alone!!!! I recommend reading this book, as well as the others they've written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspiracy junkies unite!","review":"This book is perhaps one of the biggest con attempts played on anti-religionists. The entire premise of the book is founded the authors attempt to stretch controversy so thin that just a little common sense reveals the underlying errors.The authors have very little concept of statistical probability, and the use of data. Additionally, the inconsistencies presented in the book are numerous and continue through the whole. I find the concept of Biblical inerrancy to challenge common belief, however this book utilizes over-generalization and extreme language in order to blast the reader onto their heels. I was expecting to find some evidence here, but instead discovered petty theories of the small-minded.A must read for anyone who is desperate, yes desperate, in their attempt to find moral liberation at the expense of truth. Forget all the evidence, forget logic and reason, step right up and take a look at the folly of an emotive tirade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting to say the least.

You seethey don't teach these facts of history in bible school, privatetutoring or in public school history classes. I suppose thesefacts of no literature found until the 4th or 5th century CE(common era) regarding anything about Jesus would have causesome problems with all the kids asking questions and thenproviding dates and all.I wish more scholars could actually get there works up to the status of TOP TEN or #1 NEW YORK BEST SELLERS list. People haveread thousands of those, but I seriously doubt any have readanything like this book.

Freke and Gandy compare history to fiction in these books. There was an historical Jesus; there was never an historical Osiris/Dionysus. The mythology of the Greeks and Romans was designed by the ancients to explain the unexplainable in their physical world. How could a serious student of ancient mysteries be impressed by this rambling? The authors have compared apples to oranges by placing side by side-- as though equivalent in value--the historical Jesus and the mythological fiction of the ancients as though both bear the same validity. This is ludicrous and not serious literature. It is also misleading to customers who are genuinely searching for answers and knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most ridculous books ever written","review":"This book suggests that Jesus never existed. Almost every historian knows that Jesus was a real person based upon evidence which includes other writings from his time besides the Bible. The question should really be if you believe he is the Messiah or not. Not a question of his existence. This alone proves to me that the authors have no credibility whatsoever. Amen"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your time, save your money","review":"The authors offer nothing new. Rather, they spend a lot of time congratulating themselves on what a great job they have done and reciting the list of other books they have written that they think are just super and that you should also buy. They also seem to resent the amount of money other others (lesser authors, in their opinion) have made writing about the same subject. - It is not funny. It is not now. It's not much of anything. So save your time and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gnostic Apologetics","review":"Most of the previous reviewers have shown the incredible amount of flaws and misquotes that these authors have inbedded into this gnostic text.Honestly, just look at the evidence. Everything in this book is eaisly refuted by anyone who searches a bit into it. The authors didn't count on the readers actually RESEARCHING their extensive bibliography, which shows outdated soruces and bits and pieces that are taken out of context.Most of their claims are purley speculative, and can eaisly be turned around on their own gnostic beliefs.The Bible has withstood the test of time, scrutinty, and historical authentification.This can't even withstand the Amazon.com review section.Unless you're a gnostic fundamentalist and need this as a utterley flawed reassurance that you're not getting into the wrong thing, don't waste your money with this book.

For a book that claims to include \\"copious notes giving sources, references, and greater detail for those who wish to analyze our arguments more thoroughly\\", it's rather inexcusable that the Kindle edition's footnotes are not usable. They are included in the notes section, but none of it is linked to the footnote annotation within the text itself. To see a source or footnote, you first have to go to the table of contents (which is the only thing that is linked), travel to the notes section, then forward one page at a time until you reach the desired chapter and note number.This alone makes the book nearly worthless for research. If you buy it, don't get the Kindle edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great place to start","review":"I found this book very enlightening. In the beginning, I did not know that much about the pagan origins of the Christian religion. I knew that they were very prominant in ritual and form, but was unknowledgeable about the specific characteristics. The book was very well formed via a hypothesis, and then working to verify said hypothesis. The authors are well versed in world and mystic religions, and their correlations are top notch. The only reason I count it down a star is due to the fact that this book could have been twice as big with all of the research presented. Some areas were skimmed, and left me wanting more. That merely forced me to research on my own, which is always a good thing. I appreciate these two mens' efforts, and look forward to reading more from them. May peace be with you today..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening and Annoying.","review":"'The Jesus Mysteries' is both very enlightening and very annoying at the same time. Among the irritations are the authors pretensions (they repeatedly claim that they started out with no particular agenda when it is quite obvious that this is untrue) and the book's tabloid style (they tend to use a lot of exclamation marks as though they are astounded by their discoveries). Despite these annoyances, the authors' argument - that there is no evidence for a historical Christ and that the Jesus story was cobbled together from elements of Platonism and contemporary Mystery cults - is extremely persuasive. So much so that this book, despite its tabloid style, demands a serious counter-argument from theologians."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has well","review":"Made me dumber for even reading, its pure subjective nonsensebased on absolutely nothing. Denial of Jesus is a brain fart from the mind of any simpleton. Whether he was who he says he was or not (which I believe he was) he was most certainly a real person, & the greates philosopher to ever live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and needless","review":"If you don't believe in Jesus, no big deal, just don't be complaining about him when he drops you in the lake of fire.These clowns cannot offer anything better than Christianity, paganism is a sure way to get your soul damned and damned good and proper.Jesus taught that God loves us and wants to help us, what's wrong with that?I enjoy indian food, a fine wine and pleasant conversation.Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Satanism","review":"John 1:1 (among countless others passages from the Bible) teaches that Jesus IS God. May He have mercy on, and change the hearts of the authors. Yet another attack on the only One who is able to save mankind's souls. The only reason there is a single star in my review is because there has to be one on the amazon rating system!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The subject of the book is fascinating. I was looking forward to reading it. Unfortunately, it was written the wrong authors. Anybody who has done any serious reading re. the historical Jesus vs. the Jesus of the modern church will easily spot the gross historical inaccuracies & lack of up-to-date research. Many of the same old silly arguments are made, just with a lot more exclamation points. There are some interesting items, which may make it worth a read, but mostly this book is not very useful to anybody seriously researching this subject. In a nutshell, this book seriously suffers from lack of competent scholarship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus Mysteries","review":"The authors took Sir James Frazer's \\"Golden Bough\\" to ridiculous extremes. They set a new record by revealing their bias not in the first page, but on the dedication page! This half-baked bit of scholarship somehow manages to combine Osiris and the Greek god of ecstasy Dionysius into one being, despite the inconvenient fact that they are two separatre and distinct deities from different cultures, and there is no reason to do it whatsoever. The work then plods through a buffet of Near Eastern religions and cults, grabbing on to anything which even remotely resembles gospel accounts and considers it as absolute evidence that all of Christianity is a fraud. Pagan philosophers are called 'sages' while early Christian wirters, saying much the same thing, are referred to as 'mouthpieces'. While the authors concentrate on surface details, the major differences between minor fertillity deities and Jesus are completely overlooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two books in one","review":"The first half is intriguing, and make several good points, but the second half drops the topic entirely and becomes a harrangue about all the errors in the New Teastament. Watch the proliferation of exclamation points, always a sign that an author is on a soapbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"old hat","review":"Nothing new in this wah-wah book, but what else would you expect from two authors whose background is in New Age mysticism and spiritualism. The bibliography is packed with texts that are nearly a hundred years out-of-date, e.g., The Mysteries of Mithra by Francis Cumont, published in 1903. So if you want the latest scholarly opinion on the relationship between pagan religions and Christianity this book is not the place to look! Whilst sources contemporary to the period bieng written about are ignored or quoted selectively (e.g., Justin Martyr).Wads of respected modern biblical scholars are also ignored (e.g., J. D.

The book essentially describes a theoryas to why Christianity was created. That is, they explain theancestry of the Christian faith (ie it is descended from paganMystery cults). It explains what motivated the ancients tocreate it and describes at a high level some of the techniquesthey used in creating Christian theology. I would recommendthis book as well as the following:1. The Homeric Epics and the Gospel of Mark2. Who Wrote the New Testament (Burton Mack)3.

Harry (b. Wyatt) is an ambitious hunk who splits his time between tricking and trying to make it as a movie star. Handsome Dean (Alan Boyce) is younger and more nave and falls into whoredom through a kind of pathetic disengagement with life that saturates this world and its denizens. A clueless pal of Harry's, Billy (Garrett Scullin), gets sucked into the life with disastrous results.Certainly not for everyone, its dark and bleak, I found it captivating and intriguing. With the use of different camera effects, infectious dialogue, and a good cast of characters it has become one of my favorites. A psycho-sexual drama that's sure to please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a mess","review":"I like Everett Lewis' movies. His characters are always quirky, kind of at the edge of society and the actors he chooses to play their parts, are well chosen and provide great dialogue. I've watched this thing two times, and my response is that it's kind of a mess. No clear story lines about the three male prostitutes, doesn't really add up to much,and like a foreign art movie that is supposed to have some deep meaning, to the ordinary observer, it looks like a piece of crap.It is difficult to have any sympathy for any of the characters here. No one makes any real connections with each other, and the film ambles along much like three semi-connected nightmare dreams sequences involving people who are on the road to nowhere. A much better choice in terms of the subject matter here would be Andy Warhol's Heat. Skin and Bone could have been a much better film. Would like to see Everett Lewis redo it today and see what he could come with. His later films are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Trash","review":"if i could gie this less than one star i would trust me...the stroy line terrible only on attractive guy in the whole movie and the sex scenes less then gratifying..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A disappointing movie, full of logical inconsistencies. First and foremost, the mysterious madam whose way of dealing with wayward merchandise is to rub them off. What? She kills her own golden geese? Second: the directors obvious fixation with anal sex--including at least two totally gratuitous \\"rape scenes, both happening to the \\"top\\" male character. Third, an ending that makes you want to shoot the director--a total cop out in the most classic homophobic tradition. And i could even add a fourth, a character that does naked cleaning while covering his jewels with one hand, whereas seconds later he is supposedly administeringto the sexual needs of his paralyzed client!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unltravox best of","review":"Had longed for this album ever since losing my cassette version way back when it was originally released.Ultravox certainly emulate the sound of the 80's - big synthesiser choruses and drum machines.

Constructed around the old saying of \\"don't beat a dead horse\\" this book illustrates that there comes a time when you must recognize that the proverbial horse is dead and you must move on to a new way of thinking. This book is excellent for staff development and illustrating that it is often important to step back from a problem and think outside of the box. It is a perfect illustration of the old saying \\"if you do what you have always done, you will get what you have always got\\" only with some humorous educational examples. Simple, but to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a joke","review":"I bought this book for my girlfriend who is an elementary school teacher thinking it would have some funny anecdotes about teaching. It is a joke. This is not a book, it is more like a pamphlet. It just uses old, overused attempts to poke fun at various teaching/administrative methods (i.e. forming committees, throwing money at the problem, having standardized testing). Basically it is a childlike book that critiques all of these methods (through a cartoon about riding a dead horse) and provides the final answer to get off the dead horse and \\"try something new!\\" Oh how brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Read the Title","review":"This book consists of exactly eighteen sentences; the title tells the whole story.

Why anyone would recommend it I have no idea. I question whether or not Forsten and Grant have ever been in a public school or seen the inside of a principal's office. This dimwitted oversimplification of the educational process and its problems is neither innovative nor humorous. It does little more that point out the obvious, that the world is full of idiots who cry and point fingers when they don't have real solutions.Public school teachers should teach in golden palaces, be paid salaries higher than rock stars and all drive hybrid Hummers to work.

This camera was a good buy at the time, now it's just an outdated dinosaur.You'll likely get better image quality on the \\"Barbie\\" digital camera than this one.

I have since purchased a higher end camera and can only find small differences. I generally use the higher end camera only when I need the zoom feature.

I get to see the pictures as soon as they've been taken. Downloading to the computer is fast and easy. Makes for some nice screensavers.

I purchased this camera for a real estate agent who wants to take pictures of homes and e-mail them to potential customers. I had two problems with the camera. 1) The data connector is similar to a headphone jack and I had to wiggle it to make a connection to the PC. 2) The quality is only appropriate for pictures you intend to post on the web.

I tried 3 different computers and when I called customer support that is only available 8 - 5; M-F and they suggested that I had a bad cable but couldn't be sure so I would have to wait 7 - 10 days for a solution to my problem. (The cable is not available through any standard camera stores or office supply stores.) This obviously defeat the purpose of buying a digital camera so I sent it back after only having it for a week. I am very computer savvy and have been able to work with a Kodak camera with out any problem. My frustration came from the lack of customer service from the company to help me solve the problem quickly. I need the pictures for a marketing piece that deadlined the next day.

I used it semi regularly, never dropped it, never exposed it to the elements (heat, liquids, etc.). It ate batteries like mad, but I was satisfied overall....except that it just up and died. New batteries didn't work; the display just flashed the 'empty battery' sign. I put a message on Agfa's website to get tech help. Never got any response except for the automated email they send when you enter a message. Overall -- descent camera that had a fatal flaw that Agfa apparently doesn't give a s**t about.

Instead this DVD seems to be more about making up a break by playing notes within the chord patterns. While this is also a helpful technique that I can use and learn better, I would like to find a DVD that is more of a bluegrass technique and style for flat picking. I also wish that this DVD had more standard bluegrass tunes to work on. Wabash Cannonball and Peach Picking Time in Georgia aren't generally tunes that get called in a bluegrass jam circle. All in all I think the DVD will be helpful though."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cool!","review":"I just discovered this series of books - and just ordered The Great History Search.

Places covered include: USA; Amazon Rainforest; Iceland; Greece; Morocco; Trinidad; The Alps; The Middle East; East Africa; Siberia; China; India; Thailand; Japan and Australia. An added challenge is that you don't progress through the book from front to back. You have to solve another puzzle to find which place you should go to next!

However, there is one major issue that, for me, turned the book from a 4.5 star to a 2 ... and that is the lack of denounement. The book ends on a very heavy action scene, with no resolution of the romantic conflict between the hero and the heroine -- the literary equivalent of being left unsatisfied by a one minute man.Otherwise, the book is incredibly good ... but judging by the \\"foreplay,\\" I expected much more out of the finish than I actually received"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather dissapointed","review":"I purchased this book due to the high reviews it got on this page and was very dissapointed with it. It was a light read but the plot left a lot to be desired. It had too many excessive characters and felt very forced and stunted. It seemed as if the author either wanted to just finish the book, make it longer, or write a sequel. So much more could have been done with it. Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd be willing to burn the book","review":"Although I rarely read contemporary romances, the reviews made this sound like a good possibility. I managed to finish it. But it required effort. This book is more adventure/thriller and lust than romance, and the thriller part is not urgent enough to keep the pages turning and is too quickly resolved to justify its word count.The relationship between Alec and Domini is never given emotional depth, and Domini seems to readily give up all her previous views on life at the end. Sizemore simply did not make me believe in them as a couple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn it","review":"<groans, rolls eyes and sticks tongue out> This is a really BADromance novel. I finished it only because I had paid good money for it. I bought it because it was supposed to be about vampires. Ha! The author spent a lot of time trying to make the main male character look like a complete badass. What female could resist that right? <ack, barf> It made him into a jerk and the female lead knew it. In fact all the way through the book she keeps saying he's a jerk and that she didn't know why she kept having sex with him (again ha!). Of course she completely changes her mind on the last 2 pages of the story and decides that he is her soul mate and she will live the rest of her now immortal life with him. <again, ack and barf> I was so anxious to get to the end of this book that I skipped a page towards the end to help move it along. I then discovered I had skipped the entire climatic ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than zero","review":"Too bad I could not rate this book a zero because it screams for it! To say I was disappointed is a gross understatement. I read the reviews from many readers and really expected a good read but in my opinion this book lacked everything I look for in Vampire Eroticism/Romance. The characters were dead-on one dimensional. There was no definable tension between Domini and Alec, no suspense within the story, and certainly no anticipation leading into the sex which, let's face it, all Vampire addicts crave and expect. And really, what was up with that Indiana Jones hat??? That was a real turn off for me. A Vampire with a fedora? Ick!

I had gone online and read all the reviews about this book, and as i'm sure you see, most of them are 5 stars saying how great the book is. So i decided to buy the book. Well..........I'm an avid reader, and I've read almost every vampire book put out there. But this book was soooooooooooooooooooo boring, and dragged on. To me there was no point to the story, took me forever to even finish the book. I'm was very much not fond of any of the characters, and was disappointed. Not an enjoyable read. If you wanted to read a great vampire book of some sort...I suggest reading Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles & Laurell K. Hamiltons- Anita Blake Vampire Hunter novels. If it was romance you were looking for w/supernatural in it I suggest Christine Feehans Dark series."},{"rating":"1","title":"No burning, more like indigestion.","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I've heard great things about the author and the premise looked interesting but that's where the excitement ended. I wanted to like the main characters but they seemed so flat.

I think that there should have been less hopeless lusting and more details of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better vamp stories out there --","review":"I stopped around 120. Too slow paced and too alpha male for me. Not very thrilling either. With regard to vamp books, I liked JR Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood & Maggie Shayne's Edge of Twilight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"3.5 stars. Really liked the uber-alpha male, strong heroine, and the reasonable conflict combined with the high sexual tension between them, along with the vampire cosmology Ms. Sizemore slowly meted out.

Channing does her usual fine work and Silver manages to avoid being too sensitive. The whole film really depends on the character of Jack and I'm afraid Anton Yelchin can't pull it off. He has a strangely disconnected affect, almost as if he were practicing for a self-deprecating stand-up routine about his kooky family. His pain never becomes believable and so the piece mostly moves by and you wind up observing it, but no more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in the series","review":"I own 6 of the 8 editions in the Ultra Dance series, and this is by far the best one.

As a farmer in the Red River Valley of Minnesota, we do not use chisel plows in the spring as she mentions. In my opinion, one error discredits the entire book.

It worked! After two packets the first day, and by the third on day #2, I had virtually no cold symptoms. The energy boost didn't take effect on me, and there is definitely a metallic like vitamin taste to the drink (which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5), but this is to be expected with such a high potency forumla. I have not tried the other flavors, thinking Raspberry would taste the best. I recommend this to anyone who doesn't get enough vitamin C in their daily diet, or for anyone who wants to kick start their body when a cold is brewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burning sensation","review":"I really wanted to like this product, but to no avail.Last night I applied the Jason eye cream and within 15min my eyes were on fire. It felt as if I had rubbed in chilly oil. I immediately washed my eyes but the damage was done. Two RED, PUFFY eyes. This morning I had to go to work, and it's my birthday thank you, with red, puffy eyes that has started to flake and peel too. I guess I will be enjoying my birthday party tonight in a Halloween costume.I understand the people react differently to cosmetic products, but how a product marketed as: \\"best and most effective natural products in the marketplace.\\" (quoting Jason's website) can bring such a harsh and vile result is beyond me.

The item arrived without the \\"feet\\" that are supposed to prevent damage to the roof and floor of the cargo area. The box was beaten up and opened & re-taped--I don't care about how the packaging looks, but it means that it's not the factory losing parts but the company reselling the barrier.

I was disappointed in the cheap quality of the metal, but thought I'd live with what I ordered. I had to get some tape, find UPS, and send it back myself. When the replacement order arrived, it had only one foot. I wished I hadn't sent back the original because I realized I would have the 4 feet that were needed. Meantime, it came time for the surgery that my dog needed. I had to drive him 45mins to get home while he was still 'drunk' from the anesthesia. By the time we were home he had damaged the surgery site and made a mess of the upholstery. Bottom line, I didn't have the item when I really needed it and consoled myself that I wouldn't want to look at something with that cheap quality day in and day out, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother doing business with this company","review":"First, I received a damaged box, with incomplete parts.

Only when it's swung around... that's because the strap rests uncomfortably and tightly below the breast and it is very awkward.

I'm able to carry all that I need due to the roominess of the bag. Plus it has a zipper pouch on the front that easily holds my cell phone, coin purse, lipstick, etc.The main compartment of the bag is divided into 3 sections. Two outer sections and the main. I use one outer section for camera items like filters, cleaning fluid, air blower, etc. The other section holds personal items. The main holds my camera, a Nikon D40 with a 18-55mm lens attached.I love the sturdiness of this bag and the ease at which I can grab my camera at any time.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this camera bag","review":"This little bag does the trick.

I am accustomed to down pillows, my old one had gotten rather small/low fill after 10+ years of use. I don't like giant fuffy pillows so I thought this pillow would be perfect. This pillow is of good quality and construction. I aired it for a couple of hours and did not notice much odor. With this purchase, I've learned that I prefer a higher fill rating (above 550+). Fluffing pillow before sleep helps, but it is still a rather loose fill, not a lot of support for back/side sleepers. Mine didn't come with a pillow protector cover, though it came in a nice plastic bag for closet storage.

Toby tries a different style of country music on this disc, and while I am all for artistic experimentation, I realize that it fails miserably sometimes. Unfortunately this is one of those times. All three singles are horribly laden with influences of pop music a la Shania Twain, and the rest of the disc is nowhere near up to par with Toby's previous efforts. Bring back the old Toby please!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Famous for all the wrong reasons.","review":"Look guys. I hate to burst your bubble. This is a bad album. I am a fan of country - this still sucks. A lot.Admittedly, I think Toby Keith is an idiot capitalizing on 9/11. Nevertheless, you find that the majority of the album is ultimately forgettable. He's not talented, and is simply using \\"patriotism\\" to sell a record. The positive reviews here prove this: they are all seemingly based on the concept of \\"we love this album because loving it makes liberal people mad.\\"Listen to an album for musical value. Not because you have stupid political agendas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down to Earth and the Common Heart","review":"\\"Courtesy...\\" represents the common heart of the American people, both in the US and Canada. We have never tolerated bullies and this song captures that sentiment.Having known Peter Jennings for almost 30 years, I am qualified to point out that his ego will forever seek the limelight. Peter Jennings has an attitude that is \\"holier-than-thou\\" and by comparison, other Talking Heads seem intelligent.

Whether he supports the war in Afghanistan or not is or no interest to me. For me it is all about music and the song on this remarkably pedestrian album as mundane and trite as their titles and the hugely embarrassing cover art that meshing with the album title.Make no mistake about it, but Keith is little more than any of the other suburban guys in cowboy hats that have taken over country music in Nashville's quest for airplay at the expense of its soul. Do yourself a favor and skip this junk and use the money you would otherwise throw away on it to stick with the masters -- Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, -- those are just a few of the names that will enrich your life considerably more than Keith and his ilk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragedy sells albums!","review":"No one will say anything positive came out of the 9/11 terrorism, but they'll gladly profit off it.There's nothing American about dashing off a song with grade school lyrics and inspired by blind anger, jingoism and a case of beer. Is it American to profit off of the 9/11 victims? But it sells, so we don't question it.Donate the money you might waste on this, there are far better causes than Mr. Keith's pocket.

It can also be pretty rotten. Listening to garbage like this makes america an embarassment. We're not all white trash war nuts, like Mr. Keith would lead us to believe. 9/11 should have been a wake up call to people who are blind to why other nations hate us. Of course not, that would be too logical. So keep on being blind to your patriotism folks. Either you'll wake up one morning and realize what being part of a \\"great nation\\" really entails, or you'll get bombed into the ground for being idiots...Oh, and the other songs on this album are terrible too.

The bad news is that it's really quite awful. Toby's voice is flat & he uses that wavering effect as if that's going to hide the fact! The lyrics on this disc are so bad that they actually make me laugh. As in most modern country, the production is way too polished, and it also sounds very thin. The musicians are fine, but there's no spark to their performances. The whole cd is a very ho-hum affair, but I guess that's what sells country music these days. Like I said before, if you're a TK fan, you can't go wrong with this release. But if you're into classic country like me, stick with those Marty Robbins, Merle Haggard & Buck Owens discs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toby Keith is the BEST!!!!","review":"Toby has come a long way and I am so proud of him.

He deserves tons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, though don't judge just by first song.","review":"For people who buy this album based on the first track \\"The Angry American\\", be warned, the whole album doesn't contain the same boot stopmin American anger and patriotism that this song displays.The rest of the album on a whole is a sometimes fun, sometimes sweet collection of songs that will stick with you and leave you waiting to get to listen to the album again.From the playful \\"Who's your Daddy\\" to the funloving and almost Calypso sounding \\"Mexico\\", and the sweet \\"Huckleberry\\", this album runs the whole gamet of emotions and is sure to please.My reccomendation is to start with the final track which is a live recording of a verbal introduction by Toby of his reasons for writing \\"The Angry American\\". Set your CD player to repeat all and allow the introduction to flow into the song. You will have a better understanding of the very personal reasons for Toby writing \\"The Angry American\\".Overall a great album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DIXIE CHICKS, YOU CAN DIG YOUR OWN GRAVES!!","review":"Toby Keith's \\"Unleashed:\\" what can I say? The CD is one worthy of any music collection. It has great tunes: some funny (\\"Who's Your Daddy?\\"), some serious (\\"Losing my Touch\\"), and some just to listen to for a good time (\\"Good to Go to Mexico\\"). But the highlight of the CD is the rocking, terrorist-bashing hit \\"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American),\\" the greatest American-themed tune ever written. Don't listen to those stupid Dixie Chicks! Toby's song speaks the truth. His words were the words that everybody had on their mind, but didn't know how to say it!

Grade: A+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do these stupid celebritiesget political?","review":"I'm so sick of these rich celebrities feeling like they have the right to talk about American foreign policy, it's absolutely ridiculous. People like Toby Keith should shut up about American foreign policy because they don't know anything about it. I used to enjoy his music, but his turn towards jingoistic support of American policies has sickened me. He's just as bad as Bill O'Reilly, Sean Penn, Alec Baldwin, Michael Moore, that guy who's making Michael Moore Hates America, and Barbara Streisand.

Oh and a little message in closing to the music world of Nashville: You talk about how your wife/husband left you, how they did you wrong, how you're down and out, etc, etc, etc. Well, did you ever stop and wonder that the reason all of this might be IS BECAUSE YOU LIKE TO DRINK ALL THE TIME? Wow, what a crazyconcept!!!! (rolls eyes)Bottom line, if you're looking for enlightenment, look elsewhere. And if you're looking for post 9/11 music, try Bruce Springsteen's The River.See Ya!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot DAMN!","review":"I believe Toby Keith, along with many Americans living in that huge wasteland stretching from California to Pennsylvania, is borderline retarded. I have more fun tumbling down steep hills made of thousands of extremely pointy shards of glass than listening to this deluded dude think that his opinion means anything. He does raise an interesting question though, \\"If it's so good in the city, why don't anybody smile?\\". That's just charming. I think the answer, Toby, is that they aren't drunk off their asses 24/7. It's a lot easier to smile when you're passed out in a barn or whatever people in the country do for fun. And by the way, dissent is patriotic you ridiculous, bloated caricature of a \\"real\\" American."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ken Doll of Country Music Throws a Hissy Fit","review":"Ten years after the phrase \\"Who's your daddy?\\" peaked, Toby Keith stumbles across it. Never the smartest, or the best singer, the Ken Doll of Country Music does his best to come off genuine, real, enraged even. While we might buy that from the great Johnny Cash and certainly George Straight could pull it off, with Keith it comes off like a hissy fit.His singing, as always, is ragged and frequently flat. But then the Ken Doll of Country isn't about the voice, it's about the \\"la vida loca\\" ways that dancing boy shakes his hips in those vids. Since you never quite believe for a minute that Keith has any idea what he's singing about maybe it's unfair to point out that \\"Beers for My Horse\\" appears to be a pro-lynching song. At least guest vocalist Willie Nelson sings in tune.Keith's the Billy Ray Cyrus who just won't go away. \\"The Angry American\\"? No, just the Ken doll of country music throwing a hissy fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeee Haw! Calling all ignorant hicks....","review":"This is the perfect disc for you!

Similarly, those who disdain country music may not write much of a review. Still, others who would rather this country not fight against those trying to KILL YOU AND ME would not like the lyrics in many of the pieces in this album. In fact, those who are quite misguided and think simply sitting quietly and turning our cheek and being nice will make the terrorists go away and stop wanting to kill us would indeed hate this album!

There was thrash metal (Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer) and hair/glam metal (Ratt, Motley Crue, Dokken). In 1984, the saints came marching and released their debut. Their debut, however, was differnt than the other material being released by American bands. They weren't hardcore thrash yet they weren't pretty boys either. They were band of their own sound at the time. It's like they took some Euro metal styles such as NWOBHM and mixed it with some thrash. Many called them \\"power metal\\", but that really doesn't fit them either as that genre is dominated by super fast bands such as Helloween, Running Wild, and Iced Earth. What can I say, they were a band with their own sound and its a shame their debut wasn't more of a success and the band was, and is, a terrific straight ahead metal band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I have used this product before when I bought it from my vet.

Our dog was infested with ticks. Within 24 hours the ticks were gone. It was great. However, according to the literature with the package, no new ticks were supposed attach to the dog. That wasn't the case. They did attach, but they would die within 24 hours. So, the ticks were still being brought into the house. Additionally, within 3 weeks the collar had lost its effectiveness. I literally pulled about 40 ticks off of our dog! Not fun. So, I used the second collar. It's working great right now, but how long is it going to last? By the way, the first collar never got wet, so there was no reason for it to lose its effectiveness. I don't know why the collar was uneffective after just 3 weeks.

Political equality and equal rights are what the equity feminists (the original feminists) were trying to accomplish. Christina shows, through her research, that this is what the gender feminists are attempting to sabatoge. Common sense and loving men does not mean we equity feminists are back-stabbing other women. ...

Instead of actually attacking her arguments, an activity which many gender feminists consider disgustingly masculine anyway, they resort to petty name-calling and insults (which apparently *isn't* a masculine trait) such as a woman's Uncle Tom. They use metaphorical attacks. They claim she's betrayed her gender and tell her to get a sex change. Others completely misunderstand the focus of Sommers's narrative, attacking arguments that she doesn't even attempt to make. First and foremost, this book is a study in totalitarian modes of thinking, indoctrination, and groupthink."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book should be required reading for all college grads.","review":"The biggest surprise between the covers of Who StoleFeminism? is the humor.

Can't BELIEVE she found someone to publish this nonsense. One has only to read the type of nonlogical thinking engaged in by the other reviewers of this load of slanted nonsense to get the drift: It's not that women are battered that babies are born with birth defects; no, it's because we don't screen, or, in other words, let's not do anything about the battering of women that results in deformed children.

Not only is this at issue, but her methodology and the logic of her argument is unscholarly. I believe that all theory, including feminism, has a right to be critiqued.

However, the focus of modern feminism is gaining the SOCIAL equality that cannot be garaunteed by lawmakers, but must come from changing scoiety as a whole.

Just as vanilla metalheadz can't understand Sunn 0))), yuppified metalheadz wouldn't understand the sinister power of the Merzbow collaborations on Bow 1 and Bow 2. One has to understand Merzbow's involvement with the s/m scene, to understand the intended pain imparted from each hammered note from the prepared piano. With the persistent metallic-grinds of Sunn 0))) guitars bethrolled to Merzbow's irrepressible death-electronics, one cannot escape the inexorable feeling of death, doom and gloom, over and over and over.

This game does not start off easy though. It takes around 2 to 3 hours to acually really get good at it. But ohhhhhh its worth it.

I like everything about this game. It has an excellent story line and really good graphics compared to the other wii games. The sword fights are cool and the gun fights never get old. I definitly recomend this game along with far cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does anybody know how to write good conversation anymore?","review":"Why do game developers spend endless wads of dough on graphics and almost none on decent writing? These games don't have to have the utter blandness of a Jean Claude Van Damme throwaway film. Halo, Half Life, Max Payne, Ratchet and Clank all prove that.But the writing for this title is dreck. Combine that with endless encounters with dumb people holding guns, and even more dumb people holding katanas (that I don't just blow away with a shotgun?!?) and you have wasted fifty bucks.The Wiimote is the one saving grace of this game. It's a vastly superior control for first person shooters than the traditional Xbox/PS3 controller. It's the closest thing to mouse-and-keyboard gaming possible.Buy a Wii first person shooter. Just not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"New controls are the only thing this game is good for","review":"If this were your standard FPS it would get terrible reviews. The sword doesn't match how you swing the wiimote, it just swings a direction when you swing. There are only certain times when you can use the sword. The controls aren't perfect but they're decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration","review":"At first I thought this game was going to be awesome. Sadly I borrowed it from a friend and only kept it one day. It was that bad. The controls are just so uncooperative and annoying. I would just be running along minding my business and then he would point his gun at the sky and start running in circles. Not cool. I think the designers were on the right track at some point (sword play, kicking over tables for cover) but lost their way when the actual camera angles and all that came into perspective. Why do you have to keep the camera level and run/duck/shoot/slash? Why not have a fixed POV and then be able to look around if you need to? I suppose if you have patience (lots and lots of patience) then buy this otherwise do yourself a favor and get something else that wont make you want to throw your controller across the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Steel 2 is better.","review":"Just get Red Steel 2 it is better in every signal way it's like night and day.

Oh wait that line is a lie.","review":"Red Steel has sluggish controls when it comes to aiming. There is not a lot to be said about this game that other reviews have not already said.

I found the enemy AI to be very aggressive. They really forced you out from your cover. The shoot outs were alot of fun. The destructive environments help to make the shootouts very exciting. The swordplay was quite challenging. It was difficult to pick up some of the new moves that you were rewarded. The later sword fights kept you on your toes because they had different techniques. I thought the graphics were pretty good. The length of the game was perfect for me.

But, It is loads of fun and with exercising patience you will have fun trying to play it.The graphics are good, the choice of weapons are extensive and the story is entertaining. You will spend hours going from each level to the next.I would have given 5 stars had it not been for the bugginess and sensitivity of the controls, However with patience and control this can be worked through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game","review":"Overall, a lot of fun.

I usually put in between 10-15 miles a week, and they hold up well for months. By the way they make great walking around shoes as well. Will keep buying them as long they keep making them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pair of Shoes -stick with what you know","review":"I was new to the running scene 5 years ago. I didn't know that you should get fitted for the right kind of shoe at a running store as they can analyze your running gait and recommend shoes based on what you need. Plus if you don't like them they have a generous return policy and you can exchange them for the right ones for you. I used to only purchase Nike running shoes, but after having many of them wear out prematurely and not cushioning my feet enough I went to the running store. They fitted me for the Asics GT-2110. They provide lots of cushioning for a person who is 5'10 and weighs 265 pounds. They are light enough, very breathable, last a very long time, and help me run further and slightly faster. Hence, I am on my 4th pair of the same model over 4 years. I will buy again till I can't find them anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Running Shoe","review":"I've worn this model of Asics running shoe since it was the 2080. I thought it couldn't get better and then there was the 2090, the 2100, and now the 2110. It's a great all around shoe that provides good support. I wore this shoe for the last half-dozen marathons that I've ran and it has never let me down. It's a reasonable weight, and is comfortable out of the box, especially for people with high arches. My only complaint is that they may wear out a little too quickly on the inside of the shoe near the ball of the foot.I personally find that I get best results out of these shoes by using two pairs and alternating them. The padding tends to re-expand by doing this.Cam Snow"},{"rating":"2","title":"MENS ASICS GT-2110","review":"ORDERED A 10.5 WHICH IS MY REGULAR SIZE BUT THEY WERE A LITTLE SMALL.

I've seen a lot of reviews bashing every aspect of this film just because of its Christian overtones. Honestly, the fact that it brings to the screen a story that reminds me why I praise and give glory to OUR Lord is the main reason I've enjoyed this film so much.Great acting, a well written story and the excellent production value in this film as well as in the other films PureFlix offers gives me great hope of getting more decent movies that can compete with the big screen blockbusters.And the rapture scene is amazing, I found myself watching that part over again several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the way they made the ending!","review":"To start off I will say I have not read the book yet, so I don't know if they stuck to the book or not... that being said last night I watched this movie I and I loved it! The special effects were great and the story line was good and believable.

Then you have as the usual bad guys - communist like Russia and non-Christian Islamic Iran. Then you have the symbolic ultimate apocalyptic nuclear war head as the evil people's tool (no mention that only Christian USA has ever used it on people) and interpreted by some through Bible prophecy as God's final wrath. The bottom line is that the movie is a low intelligence hodgepodge of stereotypes and robotic, stand and stare and read short memorized lines, acting (what better representatives of this than Lee Majors and Randy Travis). Even the science and technical backstories were Hollywood fantasy and would fail a middle school science class exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy script, no suspense in this \\"thriller\\".","review":"David A.R. White plays an FBI agent who finds out that nuclear weapons have been smuggled into the US by terrorists who want to attack the US and Israel. Inspired by a Christian non-fiction book about Bible prophecy, \\"Jerusalem Countdown\\" is heavy on religion and often feels preachy, while it fails miserably when it comes to plotting and creating suspense. The result is a boring movie that doesn't even measure up to other faith based thrillers. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie - Bad Frame Rate","review":"The movie was pretty good.However, the dvd had major frame rate quality issues.The video was quite choppy, as if it were shot at 20 frames per second.We tried the dvd in two different dvd players, but the result was the same.We paid top dollar for this dvd when it first came out, and were very disappointed with the quality of the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a surprise!

There was a bit of surprise \\"ending\\" in the flick as well, making it even more interesting as you go along trying to figure out what will happen next. All the actors are top-notch and professional. The actors were really doing their best at realism and natural reactions to what was happening in the plot.This is NOT your typical Christian movie...it goes way beyond whatever you might expect!

Friends have Sony Mavica's, and the rechargable NiMH Pak gives so much of a better option.

The pictures are overwhelming if the settings are correct. If you depend on the Auto Mode you will end up with many shots that are sub par. You may need to adjust the lighting to accomodate for indoor and dusk pictures. The shortcomings are the bulking feel when holding the camera for several shots, that is why I prefer the tripod for a steady shot. The optical zoom is pretty good, and the digital zoom is worthless (I hear the same holds for other brands too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and easy picture taking","review":"This camera is great I have had it for a few days and take tons of pictures.

The watch is just as pictured and came within the stated time frame and in good condition. One of the wrist bands was slightly askew and needed readjusting, something that can be done at home with a small screw driver. It is easy to adjust for size.

Plus, the higher speed in the DeWalt allows it to do more in the drilling area.Milwaukee overall is a so-so tool, but DeWalt is much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fantasy about Jason Connery","review":"I wanted to like this novel: I really did! Unfortunately, I am a big fan of the Robin Hood legend and the British TV series it inspired. I became angry as I noticed the amount of overlap between this book and the series: Much, the halfwit; Little John, the humble shepard; Will Scarlet, the hothead with a vendetta against Norman soldiers. The only character that didn't match the TV show was Marion whose description matchs that of the author. Coincidence? I don't think so. Especially since the entire plot involves changing comely young Robin's orientation... and I'm not talking about compass direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started but not finished....","review":"It turns out I should have heeded the reviews that said this is a romance in a historical setting rather than the ones that stated this is really good historical fiction. There IS a big difference. I began this book and went through about 40 pages before I had to put it down in disappointment. There is nothing special about the writing here, and the sexual references are so many that it seems the writer needs these to carry the story or make it compelling. This never works for me! I want something substantive, and this is not it. Perhaps I gave up too soon and will try again another time, but for now I'm going to take the suggestion of one of the reviewers and dive into The Black Chalice by Marie Jakober -- it looks most compelling. I understand that it, too, has some good, steamy scenes, but ones that are beautifully subtle and thought-provoking rather than ones splashed across the pages.

I don't normally enjoy the endless retellings of the Arthurian and Robin Hood legends, but I will definitely make an exception for this book. Robin is haunted and wounded from his service in the Crusades, and Marian is a very believable and likeable heroine.

Robin and the other male charaters are not the negative stereotypes she has written before. The descriptions of Sherwood are excellent you can truly see the places and people of this story. And this book is missing the negative men vs. women debate that turned me off of the Tiger and Del series.I enjoyed it from begining to end. This book also has a sequal which I have yet to read but it is on my list of must reads.

Very well researched and pieced together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy, just plain crappy","review":"Jennifer Roberson has some talent. It is best seen when confined to books where she has control of the plot and characters, and not when she is reworking famous legends which have had numerous retellings by far better authors than she. I recommend her Tiger and Del stories, but not anything based on actual historical myth and legend. This book is an insult to anyone who grew up loving Robin Hood stories or movies.One thing I did notice: Miss Roberson seems to use these books as opportunities to play out her own fantasies, judging by the fact she tends to cast herself as the heroine. Quite frankly, it is not worth my money to indulge her."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of the cover!","review":"I loved this book a long time ago and decided to purchase it to reread again. Unfortunately, the cover pictured (with an illustration of Marian and Robin) was NOT the same as the one I got. The version I got had a HORRIBLE photo of a woman and a Fabio-wannabe. Honestly, it looked like porn. I was embarrassed to put in on my bookshelf, never mind caught reading it. Amazon was very good about returning it, since the cover pictured was VERY different than the one I received. Now, I'm looking for an original printing of the book. The story line is really a good version of the Robin Hood legend.

My favourite videos on the dvd are for Hurry Up And Wait (The once with the war theme) I Wouldn't Believe Your Radio (the one with the motorbikes in the desert) More Life In A Tramps Vest (the one with the people with televisions on their heads) and Taffic (the one set along a roadside with Kelly Jones on the phone).

Aside from a few humorous skits and a track with The Outlawz that is actually pretty good, this album is very mediocre. Most of the tracks aren't very catchy and even a collaboration with one of my favorite emcees, Sticky Fingaz is not very noteworthy.Do yourself a favor and go out and get \\"We Come Strapped\\" because that is where M.C. Eiht shined. This is just an average album.

NO DYLAN JUST STUPID SCENERY FILMED BY ONE OF HIS FORMER DRUMMERSDONT WASTE YOUR MONEY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very UNCOOL home movies","review":"A very misleading video about Bob Dylan's world tour of 1966. This is all about the drummer Mickey Jones who had an interesting music and movie career and brought his 8mm camera along on the concert tour with Dylan. THIS IS ALL ABOUT MICKEY JONES. I wish I had read the reviews before I paid 19.95 for this. Although some insights are given into the lifestyle of touring musicians, there is very little to add about the '66 tour that you wouldn't already know. The glimpses of Dylan walking away from the camera or peering out from the back seat of a limo are not much different than some footage I have of friends on a day trip to Disneyworld-would you pay 20 bucks for that? I don't think so. and the co-producer is a Bob Dylan tribute artist who makes an appearance near the end as Bob Dylan...a bit of shameless self promotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"On The Road With Bob And The Band!","review":"I have often pondered what it would have been like to be on the road with Bob Dylan circa 1966.Now thanks to the brilliant narration and commentary by drummer Mickey Jones I have been on tour with Bob and The Band at a time when I was just a few months old.Being born in 1965 I could never have seen the footage of Bob and the Band cavorting on the streets,flying through the air,and shrugging off the hecklers were it not for the 8mm camera of Mickey.I have now heard the boos from the audience,heard the shout of Judas permeate through the air and felt as though I was a part of history.I often feel like I was born too late having missed the wonderful music and tours of the late 60's now I will never again wonder what I missed because I've been there and what a journey it was!If you've ever wondered what the great World Tour of 1966 was like search no longer,just pop in this DVD and take a trip with Bob and The Band down memory lane."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Dylan fanatics only","review":"I went into viewing this film with pretty low expectations, but still was hugely disappointed. There is no live music here, just previously recorded album cuts playing in the background as Jones comments, ad nauseum, on Dylan's hat and more. This is really just a vanity piece for Mickey Jones. Jones was a great 60's drummer, but these home movies should have stayed at home.There are a few worthwhile shots of Dylan and the Band at work and play, but precious few. At many points I felt challanged to continue watching. Jones doesn't have a lot to say, but he keeps talking anyway. There certainly is not any new insight into the dynamics that drove this revolutionary tour. Jones seems in awe of Dylan himself, but that keeps us at arm's length.For those of you new to Dylan, the infinitely superior \\"Don't Look Back\\" is the place to start, not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"Lessons learned: Read the reviews.

Essentially, we are treated to an opening that introduces us to Susan Heller (played by Andrea Roth, who despite being in movies such as this has quiet a following online) who stumbles into the lives of a ranching family when his car \\"breaks down\\". She manages to win the trust of the husband (played by Gil Gerard - yes, Buck Rogers himself - who shows us all just how low you can sink) and gets a job.

Imagine my surprise when I make my annual pilgrimage to get the new single and hear the b-side this time out \\"Base 6\\". WOW! This isn't self parody, kids. It's a stunning return to form. Not only is it the absolute best b-side they've ever done (yes, better than \\"Morning Lemon\\"), it's the first time they've returned to the totally rocked-out style that they mastered on \\"Exit Planet Dust\\". Why this track didn't make the album or better yet, why wasn't it released as its own headlining single, is mystifying. If you've been secretly hoping they'd eventually do another track with the stomp and energy of songs like \\"Leave Home\\" or \\"In Dust We Trust\\", your wait is over.

Although Amazon states that \\"Songs are encoded at 256 kbps\\" [http://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/help/faq.html/ref=sv_dmusic_0] they actually use a variable bit rate which means sometimes it's 256 kbps, sometimes it can be, say, 195 kbps. If you care at all about audio quality, and prefer MP3s, at least purchase this from [...] where the songs are all at a constant rate of 256 kbps.

The protagonists try to take a picture of a dead famous person in his coffin. Absolutely hilarious! The female protagonist is naive and personable, very believable.

I don't like \\"mean\\" sounding music and while this man has a story to tell on every song and some of them could be really sad or hurtful his music isn't. I don't think I will ever tire of listening to his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are kind of nuts, but they are funny.","review":"First, I'd have to agree with Amazon's chosen critical review wholeheartedly. It isn't that the group sounds like Brave Combo as such, but they do have a similar, unleashed sense of fun romping around various musical styles, and sometimes you end up with a huge, somewhat baffled smile on your face. \\"Cyrano\\" sounds like a strange combination of 70's rock, samba, and theme music for a TV show of the Munsters variety. It is a blast. \\"Pensando Nela\\" is a bossa nova with a really relaxed, happy groove and a consciously loungy air that will have you smiling even if, as the case with me, you generally don't care for songs of that description. In his famous song \\"Chiclete com Banana,\\" Jackson do Pandeiro satirically called for a fusion of American and Brazilian music he named \\"samba-rock.\\" He would definitely enjoy these unimagined results. Have yourself a \\"Tudo Bem\\" day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over, Jackson 5 and Village People","review":"OK, I have to admit, while I love samba music, whether it's from the masters (Clara Nunes, Martinho da Vila, Beth Carvalho) or from the samba schools (Velha Guarda da Portela or Mangueira), I don't necessarily care too much for samba funk; I can't help but think it's dull and drags on too slow. Then again, what makes Trio Mocoto stand out from most samba funk performers (as is the case with Samba Rock) is that they can throw in a twist or two that's SO wacky, playful, upbeat and (on the whole) incredibly wild, AND, lots of non-stop fun to listen to and enjoy. =)Anyway, forget the Village People; they always tend to outdo themselves. Even though I've already listened to half of this album, I LOVE IT!!!! These are sambistas who really know how to ROCK, and will ROCK you out of your seat once you buy this CD!!!

I listen to it everywhere: in the car, on my computer, and in my house! I especially love the song, \\"There Goes the Girl.\\" This song should be an anthem for empowered women everywhere! Also, the song \\"See\\" lingers in my head with its haunting melody and deep lyrics. I can really relate to many songs on this album. The music has such a range in styles, not to mention the vocals by Daniela are incredible! The song, \\"I've Got the Music in Me,\\" has such depth and soul it makes you want to sing along! You will not regret getting this CD. It has music for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Album 1 rules all before it: roll on No.2.","review":"Why can't all debut albums be this good?Daniela Roth is the complete artist. Having spent time working hard at making it into the business, she has finally suceeded and if there is a shred of fairness in the world she will go all the way. The album contains a tour de force of what Danielas voice is capable of, and it's pretty wide reaching. From true power, POWER ballads such as \\"Call it love\\" and \\"If the world lost all it's love\\", through country (\\"Unspoken\\"), blues rock (\\"There goes the girl\\" and \\"Unspoken\\"), and ending up with a truly profound leftfield sound, the music Daniela wrote herself, which raises some real issues when the lyrics are listened to.If you don't believe my words, believe my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game","review":"besides the fact that the online servers are down now, this game is still amazing, terrorist hunt is where its at buy this game and enjoy the great gameplay"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game but requires a lot.","review":"I played this game first on a tricked out 6000+ AMD system with 4 gigs ram and 512 meg video card. Ran beautifully and fell in love. It's a LOT of fun, looks great and the gameplay is awesome.Having said that, I purchased for my computer and had many problems with lockup, slowdowns and such until I turned settings to 640x480. I am running it on my personal computer which is a 3500+ AMD Athlon 64, 1 gig dual-channel 400mhz ram and a 256 meg 6800GT Video card.

I bought that first and then got Vega & Ghost Recon. The later two have NO story line compared, the graphics suck compared, and the game play sucks compared. Splinter Cell is a masterpiece in Gaming. Because you dont go around with a big gun or grenade in your hand the entire time. You actually play a role and use your'e body. Very disapointed with the Earlier games.

SEE IF YOU GET HIT ONE TIME YOU DIE! awful design once i went down to an alley on a rope and got killed countless times before my feet hit the floor. horrible game design. a complete waste of 63 dollars.

The graphics are incredible, gameplay is great, and there's so many weapons to choose from. This is a must have for any serious first person shooter lover. The multi player capabilities are excellent because you get to choose from tactical light, tactical medium, etc. However, if you dont like a game that has pretty challenging enemies you may not like it. Overall though this game is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"At first I was reluctant to buy this game because I was saving money for the Halo 3 legendary edition but then I played it online at my friends house and its amazing. One of my favorite thing is the ranking system along with the Ability to customize your armour. Whether you want to be wearing recon armour or an all out assault vest is up to you. I am A halo fan at heart but ive always loved the Tom clancy series. Played the first ghost recon on PC and so on. Definately a good buy I have been playing for only a month now and I still havent played every single map theres nearly 20 of them. And ill be playing untill September 25th, 2007(Day halo 3 comes out for all you people that dont know)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realism on a differant level","review":"First of all, after the first few Rainbow 6 games I found the franchise mediocre at best. I am a large fan of tactical shooters and this is one of the best I have ever played. This is the first game to truely capture the use of cover in a firefight. I love the fact that the game makes you move from one position of cover to the next. The level of detail in the maps is also astounding as (like real life) there is so much junk everywhere that the enemy can literally be anywhere. My only complaint so far is the lack of a lean ability and the ability to switch from a right handed grip to a left handed grip ala Splinter Cell. Great game for tactical shooter fans and honestly the best game I've played for the 360 this far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really awesome game","review":"this game really accelerates the feel of the legacy that is Tom Clancy's rainbow six. it really was one of the best games that i have played although it was painfully short on the normal game difficulty. the second should really answer some questions, so i would get both of them to really get the full game story which lacks a little in RSV as the story is bitted together whith the picture-in-picture briefings that don't really make any sense, though the point of any given mission is to kill the terroist. This is made more exciting with the variety of ways to enter a room and clear it etc. the commands are really just fantastic with the variety of ways to get to a certain place or room, which really just makes the overall game 4 stars since the story and motivation don't really shine though the graphics are simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot more fun than I expected","review":"I thought that a video game 1st person shooter based in Las Vegas was going to be over the top campy and silly. But I was pleasantly suprised to see that everything worked well and the game was very fun to play.I recommend this game. Last I looked I saw it was selling used for around $[...]. A very good purchase for less than $[...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd best 360 game!!","review":"This is the 2nd best 360 game(Gears is the first). Very realistic, amazing choice of weapons, and cool take cover feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic game..very addicting..","review":"I am so glad that I purchased this game, its amazing. Everything from graphics, sound, gameplay, level design,and weapons are great. Its very customizable, you can even create your character to look like you. Also it has an option to be a female, which most games I play do not have. The split screen co-op mode is fantastic( my favorite mode). The graphics are very realistic and well designed. You have the choice of choosing your difficulty, realistic is my favorite,the ai is more developed, but it can also be more frustrating. Also there is extra maps available on xbox live, which can add extra gameplay. The story mode is very good as well.Even after completing the story mode and terrorist hunt, I continue to play this multiple hours every week. Overall I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"2006 Game of the Year!!!","review":"Easily the most enjoyable game I own on the xbox 360. The ability to intuitively take cover using the left trigger is awesome, as opposed to the unnatural cover in the two ghost recon games. The weapons are awesome and very satisfying. The co-op modes are a-lot of fun too. My only question is why do all the terrorist speak such good English (profanity) with an American accent?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game...","review":"Ok so I will make it short and sweet. Great gameplay and nice graphics... not as great as \\"Gears of War\\", but still good. Very realistic with the shooting and hiding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good God","review":"It's a great game for the more patient sort, and might take some adjusting by those recently spoiled on Halo 2 or Gears of War, in terms of aggressive play. My only complaint (as one spoiled by the latter) is the lack of a run button to cover open ground, but hey, it forces me to take better cover.Highly recommended, especially for the online co-op option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tactical shooter ever ... ?","review":"Yup, could be as Ubisoft does it again.I've played through all the other Rainbow Six games numerous times and Vegas is by far the best. Without a doubt, it's the best AI I've ever seen in a game. The bad guys know how to shoot and elude you and don't always do the same thing twice when you have to repeat a section.Graphics are killer, game play is intense, sound is amazing and the weapons rule.Yeah, I liked this game ... a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, a great game!","review":"It's a great shooter, with quite a bit of strategy built in if you choose to play on the more challenging \\"Hard\\" difficult setting. Involves a lot of fast paced gun battles, with slower based \\"move, and shoot\\" mechanics. NEED to use the cover mechanic, which is actually built really well.Overall, 9/10, as the story is a bit weak, yet still exciting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game","review":"I bought this after rsv2 and the multiplayer maps are way better, but you can't sprint so your often taking 2 mins to get across the maps but I like it so I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent game","review":"It is a decent game, doesn't stack up to the shooters today, but for the time it was a good game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Game so Far!","review":"I love this game. The online multiplayer is awesome and VERY addictive. The fact that you can personalize your online character with your own face is hillarious. I have both my eyes closed, so when people see me on-line it looks like I am shooting with my eyes closed. Very funny.The single player games are just as fun. The movement is very quick and smooth. The few glitches are so funny sometimes we (online Friends and I) have to take pictures with our cellphones to email to our other buddies. I can't wait for the new maps."},{"rating":"2","title":"RBSV2 a Winner!","review":"Very pleased with the latest Rainbow six edition. Action packed, cool gadgets and lots of mayhem.

Some maps have objectives others don't so you end up spending most of the time just walking around trying to figure out what to do. Also no way to save games except at checkpoints.

I have found myself playing till the early hours of the morning.The single story mode is an absolute blast also, the control that you have over your partners is very quick compared to some games that I have played.

Even with the lack of special effects and the Batmamobile this was the film of the day and maybe even best film i've ever seen.The film starts off with the gangs huddled together watchin the great speech of sirus and the warriors watchin in aur. However the nutter of the film who is the leader of the Rouges whips out a gun and makes sirus 'the magical' eat led. The warriors are blamed and there is now more than 50 thousand people chasing them.With a funky 70's feel and a smart storyline which wil keep you occupied throughout the film this is a CLASSIC.

Our heros , accused of a murder they didn't commit, face barriers on their treck back to Coney island, by rival gangs. Lots of chasing through the subway, and unmemorable rumbles with other gangs. The movie, however, has some historic relevence in the perceptions of gangs at a time when the Guardian Angels were up and comming. Has that New York flair, but for the most part the movie is not that entertaining.

Growing up, the film hasn't dated as much as it might have, simply because of it's pace, editing, and charisma.All of the actors do a great job, even if some of the dialogue is of its day--but James Remar as 'Ajax' and Michael Beck's 'Swan' are particular stand-outs as the typical street hood with a chip on his shoulder, and the disillusioned, somewhat idealistic gang leader, respectively.The romance in the film is realistic, but of secondary importance, and the bathroom fight scene in the last third of the movie is very impressive. The score of the film sounds exactly like the year it was released, but suits the mood to a 'T.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poignant Blu-ray Review","review":"The Blu-ray has a sharp picture, decent sound, and some nice extras.

The heavy handed Anabasis crap that they shoehorned into the story? Even the clarity of the images threw me off! Put it this way - two minutes into the UDC DVD, I was back on Amazon to purchase the original version. Yes - the audio has been cleaned up - so tf what? Walter Hill is one director who is clearly out of touch with the impact of his own work. It should've never been touched! This film demands its grain. It demands the classic look and feel that gave it its classic cult status. I know there are cinephiles out there who must have everything in HD, BluRay, whatever. Don't do it. Some things should stay old school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the directors cut, get the original!","review":"When I purchase a directors cut, I expect to see additional scenes that where cut during original production.

But watch it we must.As a lifetime Brooklyn resident, I am particularly fond of this movie as I cheer the Warriors on as they try to make it home, through the darkened gang-ridden streets of New York.To this day, every time I see James Remur I shriek out ...

The first was the regular one. This is the director's cut with a few featurrettes. The next will be the 2-disc version with both versions, a ton of extras(those deleted scenes everyone's talking about), and come with a free baseball bat or rollerskates bundled with the film(my personal guess, might not actually happen). Keep whatever version you have, and get ready to buy the next one. When the remake is done(one's in the works folks), there will be a publicity stunt with the original, and THAT'S when we'll get the \\"Meatnormous edition\\" of this movie on dvd.

After a meeting in the Bronx that went totally wrong, after the Warriors were accused of killing the leader of the Riff's, there was no choice but to bop their way back to The Sand's of Coney Island. Ahh but this is no ordinary trip back home, as the Warriors are traveling with a price on their heads, along the way they encounter angry cops, punks, fires, baseball bats, knives and guns, all the ingredients, for the B-Movie enthusiast. Determination, heart, and street smarts, their only weapons, bring them back home, only to be met with one last challenge.This is an awesome classic, grab your chips and soda, have a seat and enjoy, you will be glad you did.

And where's the all important documentary on the release of the film in '79, when teen crowds across the US went wild and attacked police, destroyed theatres, etc... Only ten years old at the time of its release, what I remember most about the Warriors is seeing the nightly news reporting that the movie should be banned, due to the violence it was causing out in the streets! A truly strong film at the time and a strong piece for a DVD time capsule. What's really ironic is that in today's world, compared with the flix out there now, The Warrior's would be released as a bad after-school special - very tame compared with present standards.

In his taped intro, he admits that some might not like this version of the film. What was your clue, Mr. Hill? The fact that you ruined your own movie? Imagine taking \\"The Godfather\\" and, in between every scene, cutting to a shot of John Cleese saying, \\"And now for something completely different ... \\" and you'll get an idea of how badly Hill junked up what was a solid, gritty, fun, action-packed thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be stupid","review":"Like me that is.

I assumed that by \\"Ultimate Director's Cut\\" They meant that they maybe cleaned up some scenes, added scenes, added some bonus features, anything but what I got. The movie begins with an apology from the Director which anticipates some of the abhorrent changes they made to the movie.

Unwatchable in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Warriors is a \\"B\\" Movie that Deserves an \\"A\\"","review":"Walter Hill's vision of this fictional gangland is more interesting than any realistic street gang movie in the past twenty years. The Gramercy Riffs want to organize New York's gangs and take over the city. All the gangs meet, and the leader of the Riffs is shot and killed. The Warriors are blamed and have to make it back home with every gang in the city looking for them: not to mention the police. Is that a great set up or what? The soundtrack is great and adds to the impending feeling of doom that looms over our unwitting protagonists. The script and plot stick to the issue at hand and don't drift into any silly subplots. The dialouge is simple and to the point. It also has provided us with many great one-liners, \\"Warriors come out to play-eh-yhea!\\". The fight scenes are great. Walter Hill has created a true cult classic that has stood the test of time. Thank you Paramount for releasing this great film in DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, but DO NOT BUY this version.","review":"I love The Warriors. I hate this cut. As many have mentioned in great detail, the \\"Ultimate Director's Cut\\" includes idiotic comic book cutting/editing/graphics. It ads nothing to the original version and takes much away.

You will see every type of street gang that you could imagine. The Warriors are forced to do battle with every one of them in order to get to their home turf. You will never get a better tpur of the gang hangouts of New Yok as this film offers. The battles that this gang have to go through are also classics.

The fight scenes were pretty good and entertaining. All in all, I'd say if you're a fan of cult classics like Clockwork Orange, Romper Stomper, or Suburbia (the punk version from the early 80s) I think you're really gonna like this movie. Violence, but not gore. Brawls, but not guns. Gangs, but no rap music! **lol** This is a classic example of a Cult Classic.

It's one of the best action movies I've seen. The Warriors is a highly-stylized, campy, dated, yet fun film about the trials and tribulations of a street gang making its way back \\"home\\" through rival turfs. Packed with violence, innuendo, and great music, The Warriors is very definitive of the late 70s.

Honeytraps, a capricious El and subway that provides escape for some while cutting it off for others...danger awaits the beleagured Warriors at every turn in the menacing, atmospheric New York City night. Michael Beck is the Warriors' cynical War Chief-turned leader Swan who must hold the imperiled gang together during their desperate journey back to Coney Island. James Remak is the \\"not too bright\\" (like his ancient Greek warrior of mythology namesake) Warrior Ajax, who proves a formidable foe to the gang's adversaries. The DVD is beautiful, befitting the movie's colorful comic book-like plot and illustrious characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you don't want to pause a movie, you know it's good.","review":"Sometimes, something is SO good that you wonder, \\"Had anyone ever thought of this before?\\" Well, a friend of mine turned me on to a historical book by the name of \\"The Persian Expedition\\" by Xenophon. The premise is similar to that of The Warriors in that we follow the adventures of a group of 1,000 soldiers trapped in a foreign land trying to get to the sea (all the while having to fight any enemies they encounter along the way) because from there they can get home.

So I was at first elated to see that this piece of comedy history had been preserved. Sadly, this fuzzy DVD is an early British version of the show that came to Broadway, and some of the better jokes are missing. (For example, the skit of a one-legged actor trying out for Tarzan ends without the casting call for Long John Silver.) Still, it's a lot better than having nothing. Peter Cook and Dudley Moore are probably better here than in their later, more American, appearances, especially Moore's piano playing.

The trick is to keep the stripper from drying out. I found several short (30-60 minute) applications worked better than letting it sit for hours. Best of all, I was able to use the product indoors with proper ventilation. Oh, by the way, this product probably isn't good for porous surfaces such as paper, sponge, cotton candy and MASONRY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Citri-dip","review":"I bought this because I read so much good stuff about this for removing the terrible orange color of SX bass guitar necks. Well, either the SX-factory changed their lacquer or Citristrip changed their product because nothing happend to the finish of the bass neck. Completely nothing! Even after 23 hours, of which two and a half with the neck wrapped in foil. In the end I had to remove the lacquer with a scraper and had to sand it all. I can't be certain that it's the Citristrip that's not working, but for me it was not the succes I hoped for.Tools & Home Improvement did their best though! The product was sent very quickly to the Netherlands (Europe) and very well packed. Cudo's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very smelly and doesn't work well","review":"The reviewer who described the smell as orange and perm cream mixed together nailed it right on the head. I am trying to strip a 50+ year old bookcase with at least two layers of lead paint in various colors. I put the first coat on last night and waited about 20-22 hours before attempting to scrape. It is not going well. I scraped as much as I could but had to put on another thicker coat and we'll see what the results are tomorrow. I am seriously considering trying SoyGel if only to get something that is not so smelly and toxic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I've tried a number of safe, eco-friendly strippers over the years and have usually found that they are not up to the task of loosening the numerous and incredibly tough layers of ancient paint in my home. After two or three applications of a safe stripper (often leaving it on overnight), I would resort to one of the more toxic, possibly carcinogenic products (ZipStrip or its equivalent), which usually finished the job easily in about 45 minutes.I thought that would happen again, but after two coatings of CitrisStrip, I'm close enough to a complete job that I am going to skip the carcinogens and just give it one more coat. The toxic stuff is still much stronger, especially if you want speedy results with old, tough paint. Still, this stuff isn't bad if you have the time and don't mind applying it more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Citristrip works slower than some of the \\"deathly\\" chemicals I've tried, and I have to scrape off and reapply it once or twice to get through three layers of paint. However, I like the fact that I can leave this product on furniture for several hours before scraping; also, it smells nice and caused me no respiratory or skin irritation. The residue can be cleaned easily by scrubbing with mineral spirits (which CAN cause irritation)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor results on concrete, metal","review":"Does not work on concrete, despite repeated, thorough, applications that are left overnight. Leaves an orange stain on concrete that can only be lifted with a scrub brush and hot water and lots of elbow grease. Essentially: Open wallet. Waste money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work that great","review":"After reading all the reviews, I expected the product's performance to be better. I used it to strip 3 layers off kitchen cabinets. I had to reapply the product THREE times! If you have a week to spare, you might not find this problematic. If you want to get the job done most efficiently, use a regular stripper. I chose to use it because I was working in an area with minimal ventilation. If I could have had access to more ventilation, I would recommend more effective stripper.Pros: Easy to apply; fumes don't seem as toxic as other strippers.Cons: Orange smell could be tempting to a child, never leave this product unattended. Works about 50% effectiveness of other strippers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The magic answer to stripping - not!","review":"As far as I'm concerned, the search for a near drinkable, good smelling stripper has achieved so-so results at best. I'm removing one coat of latex painting and one coat of oil paint from my deck. I put on a thick coat of Citri-Strip and allowed it to stay on overnight. I then scraped and pressure washed - some of the first layer and a little of the second (in a few areas) came off. Hmmm.....not so hot to say the least and A LOT of Citri-Strip! I then tried a coat of Strip-Ease. Thirty minutes later I lightly scraped, then pressure washed and guess what - I was down to bare wood on most of the deck. Another light coat of Strip-Ease, pressure washed and it was perfect! I'm the environmentally conscious type but with some jobs there's a reason a product has been around forever! Of course, one could make this a month long project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed, did not work for me","review":"I have an old solid wood bookcase that was given to me..It is bright yellow, not sure what is underneath. I purchased Citristrip and gave it a good coat, waited a couple of hours (directions say 30 min-24 hrs)and started scraping and scraping for about 2 hours and only part of the yellow came off (first layer), under that is green and I do not know what kind of paint it is, and under that appears to be stained.So now I am still trying to just get the first coat off. This product does not take off several layers as they advertise and is very difficult to scrape off. Not happy with this product at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just amazing!","review":"We have a den with stained and varnished wood wall panels. We were thinking about painting them with a lighter color. They are not flat and cannot be sanded easily and I have been exploring options of mechanically striping the varnish. They all seemed like a lot of hard work.Yesterday I saw this product on Amazon, so I picked up a container from the local home improvement store. I brushed it on a small (about 7\\"x3\\") uneven area to test, left it for about one hour, then used an old used 3M scotch brite pad, followed by a damp paper towel, and that little patch looks like the raw original wood. It was quick and painless! I will be buying a couple more containers from Amazon to do the whole room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as strong as other products","review":"I've striped wood finishes before with OTHER products and had no problems other than the fumes are strong.

It only stripped parts of the door into patches and in other spots it wouldn't strip the paint at all. I applied Citri with a paintbrush and left it on for 7-24 hours as the directions indicated. I scraped off the first coat and tried a second coat then left it on for awhile and came back hours later and it didn't work either. Save your money this stuff is garbage not to mention it dries into a dusty chemical residue that blows in the air doing who knows what to your lungs if you're not wearing a particle half mask."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff - works and it doesn't smell","review":"OK, it does smell, but it's not a bad smell. It has a rather strong citris smell; not a bad smell though.I wanted to refinish a fireplace surround. Lots of dental molding, nooks, and crannies. I used this product on it and am very pleased with the results. There wasn't any paint on the wood but it did have a lot of polyurethane (I know because I'm the guy that put it there 5 years ago).I left it on for about an hour, scraped what i could off the flat surfaces with a putty knife (being very careful not to gouge the wood). I then wiped the whole project down with mineral spirits and a rag. I had to use an old toothbrush in the smaller areas, but they cleaned up nicely.I found that a little of this goes a long way. A 6-pack is a lot of stripper! FYI, both Lowes and Home Depot sell quart and gallon sizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good paint remover and very expensive","review":"I bought this stripper to remove varnish from my kitchen cabinets.

Leave it on overnight and next morning it all comes off. Although it's no dream as latex turns into mozzarella and comes off the wood, but then snaps back and sticks to itself which generates a lot of little twisted bits of semi-sticky gummy latex covered with residual Citristrip everywhere, so definitely use a tarp of some sort. But I tried using Jasco and that took way way more work to get off and this stuff smells way better. Plus its color allows you to more easily see the areas that have already been covered. I don't think I'll ever do this again, but if I do, I'll reach for this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Stuff Really Works!","review":"I bought this stripping gel to strip the poly and paint from a guitar body. Of course it wasn't designed for that, but the guitar body was made of wood, so... I used a brush and painted one side of the guitar body with the stripper, then waited about an hour. One thing I noticed immediately. You need to wait until the gel completely dries and forms a sort of \\"crust\\" on the finish before using a putty knife or other instrument to scrape it all off. If you try scraping while the gel is still wet, it won't work well at all. At least it didn't for me. Once dry though, you scrape off stripper, finish, and paint...all in one motion! This stuff worked to perfection, and it really doesn't take a huge amount spread on the wood to get the effect you need.I still have a ton of it left in the bottle, and will be using it for my next wood project for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff is awesome.","review":"It really helped my curly hair..my hair was easier to straighten then ever before.

I used to have it on vinyl, wore it out, and now I'm buying the CD. The highlights on the album have to be \\"Free Nelson Mandela\\", written while he was still jailed in SA - exhuberant, and although in a SKA guise, with the same emotional context as South African township music - protest music that that will move your feet and your heart and will run continually in your head when it's not on your headphones. The rest of the album is haunting. \\"Racist Friend\\" and \\"Alcohol\\" in particular are great songs. If \\"More Specials\\" the second Specials album made any impression on you, then this is worth sitting on your CD shelf alongside it."},{"rating":"2","title":"sublime masterpiece","review":"Honestly, I'm a bigger fan of Stan Campbells (the lead singer on this album) than Special AKA. As STan only came out later with one phenomenal solo album, this early material with Special AKA is must have material if you want to hear his amazing voice, one that resonates within you, forcing you to take notice of whatever he is saying. His voice is hauntingly beautiful and lended itself well to the compelling song Free Nelson Mandela as well as Dammers robust productions of other songs like Lonely Crowd, Racist Friend, and Bright Lights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"Love the no residue feel.

Aside from their contribution to the boyband craze, there isn't much else to distinguish Boyz II Men from the rest of the pack. If the title of their latest disc \\"Full Circle\\" implies that these guys took risks and worked with different-sounding material, then this record is a disappointment. We're treated to subpar ballads that are sung efficiently but with hardly any spontaneity. Only on the track \\"That's Why I Love You,\\" an engaging mid-tempo number, do the Boyz cut loose and get down. I had hoped that Boyz II Men would someday break themselves free and surprise me with an album full of unexpected spark and with an edge.

A classic ballad!-Oh Well - Sad ballad, meaningful lyrics-Whatcha need - good melodies and harmonies-On the road again - one of my favourites on the album. displays their ability to combine their voices.-Makin' Love (Interlude) - Okay, it's an interlude, BUT A VERY GOOD ONE INDEED!-Roll Wit Me - The only dance track that i liked, very non-Boyz II Men, but its pretty good-I'll Show You - the outro song.

Musically, their harmonies haven't sounded this good since II, and this album is overall solid (with the exception of \\"Roll Wit Me\\", a corny attempt to reach out to the younger audience). The best songs have to be the piano ballad \\"Oh Well\\" and the lustful \\"Right on Time\\", and this album may even be on my Best of 2002 list. Unfortunately, their glory days have come and gone. Boyz II Men are still the best modern-day group I've heard and they can still sing circles around anybody, but in a world full of *NSYNC's and B2K's, the Boyz are about as relevent as The O'Jays (as in, \\"Girl, they used to be the bomb back in the day!!\\").

The sound that made Ultravox so compelling is all but gone and replaced with the cheesy pseudo Sting like music that Midge has produced ever since he quit Ultravox with the exception being If I was. This album is an abomination compared to their earlier releases like Quartet, Vienna, Lament and Rage in Eden. This is the beginning of the end for Midge Ure as a songwriter. From now on his music has been more or less schlock. This album should never have been released."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's alright to pretend this album doesn't exist","review":"Don't talk about it. Don't buy it. Don't play it.

The quality and ease of use is just not there. Overall a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of flaws","review":"The data in this book is filled with errors, from dates to biographies. It has too many flaws to be considered a good reference source. A few examples; Ailsby states that Richard Gl��cks, the infamous inspector of the concentration camps made some sort of spectacular escape, in true life, Gl��cks killed himself in British captivity. Ailsby also states that Herbert Kappler (the head of the Gestapo in Rome) escaped from his prison cell in the -80s and has not been seen after that. And again Ailsby has got it all wrong. Kappler escaped in -77 and died of cancer in -78 in Germany.It seems that Ailsby's primary source on the Knight's Cross winners was Jost Schneider's \\"Their Honour Was Loyalty\\" that is clear from the way he copies Schneider's text.So my advice is that keep away from this rotten apple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Way to many errors and NO work(S) cited page. Much better authors around. Try Mark Yerger if you want reliable writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good starting point","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer, some people are a little too pedantic for their own good. While Alisby's book does have some flaws vis-a-vis dates and supposed fates, if you are researching any particular member of the SS then this book, would be a good place to start. As any good researcher will tell you, you should cross-referencing any material with multiple sources and any flaws should be shown up.Ailsby does a fine job of given a precis of all the various branches of the SS. He covers the most nortorious members such as Himmler, Heydrich, Eichmann and Eicke and some of the more well-known members such as Dietrich, 'Panzer' Meyer, and Hausser. But there are also hundreds of bio's for members that I've never heard or read about (surprising given some of the crimes they were guilty off).This book acts as another piece to the jigsaw that is the SS and should not be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good resource for the money","review":"Some people are just too picky, considering that there are roughly 400 or so names listed in the book it's not so difficult to understand how Ailsby might have made a minor error or two with regard to a date that someone died or some obscure detail of a persons escape etc., but the vast majority of information in the book is accurate. SS Roll of Infamy was never intended to be a comprehensive biography of each individual listed in the book, such a work would require several volumes of 500-600 pages each and cost ten times what this book does. SS Roll of Infamy is precisely what Ailsby intended it to be, a concise and largely accurate synopsis of the careers of some 400 of the most notorious and well known members of the SS, and is a worthy addition to anyones library as a quick reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first but still awesome!","review":"While I think the last album was better overall, this CD does have some pretty awesome tracks.

I was a huge fan of \\"Hell Yeah!\\", since it combined alot of elements - punk, old fifties love songs, rockabilly, etc. with plenty pure fun and enthusiasm. I expected, then, big things from this second release \\"Bring It On!\\" and was sadly disappointed.Because it seems like much of the energy is gone, or they just weren't trying as hard. Many of the songs here are just plain punky-stuff, with generic \\"whoa\\" chorus, et cetera. Too many of the songs are downers, about breakups and being pissed off, and I think this lost a lot of the fun vibe the first release had.

At times, i found myself thinking: \\"Did this have to get stretched out here? He could have minimized wordiness here.\\" That's the bad part. But i will say, it makes up for it's wordiness with a deep introspection of the Lords prayer broken down, line for line. Everytime i recite it now, it means so much more. The purchase of this book is for that reason alone. I give it 4 stars because of how it explained the prayer. It didn't get five because of what i first stated.

While I've used 5 different bits, by far and away the most used was the 45 degree bevel. This bit has done over 1200 feet of 1/2\\" edge bevels in wet pressure treated 2x6's and is still going. The bearing is getting rough at this point, and the blade edge is getting dull, but it probably has another 300 to 400 feet in it. A quarter mile of work before failure makes this set worth the price in that one bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative experiences","review":"I purchased this set a couple of months ago. I have used two of the bits so far and ruined two projects. As reported in other reviews I had the shank on the 1/4 inch straight bit snap off. I was routing in 3/4\\" pine plywood. I was not overloading the bit. Next I used one of the round over bits. About half way through the project the bearing came off and ruined the project.This is a very light weight set and suitable for very light use. If you buy it take all the bearings off and use lock tight before re-installing. At the very least tighten the cap screw holding the bearings. I found several less than hand tight. I would not purchase this set. Pay a little more and get something that will last and not ruin your work.Since writing this review I have continued having poor experiences with this set.

However, the intervening years have changed my opinion.One of the greatest disservices it does is portray New York City as a uniform cesspool of unchecked crime. It is illogical that Paul Kersey's family would live in a part of town where street thugs would so brazenly roam. And, although it does make an attempt to show why Kersey, the man of peace, turns into the avenger, it takes place too swiftly.Otherwise, this movie is talky, has LOUSY and irrelevant music, spends a great deal of time in digression, and is unrealistically resolved. The DVD I viewed was a terrible transfer too, but this might not apply to the one being sold here.I was more than disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despite dark(and timely)black humor, a crass exploiter","review":"Charles Bronson is realistically nervous taking on NYC's muggers, robbers and assailants after the murder of his wife, but what was once a shocking expose of big city crime and ruthlessness now merely looks ugly and sad, with only detective Vincent Gardenia's pungent asides to give the film a little humanity. Bronson can't seem to go for a walk without a vicious thug picking him out, and while the film isn't very dated, it is over-the-top in its cheap nastiness. The brackish color and dawdling pace are other handicaps that make the whole queasy enterprise slightly stultifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahh....","review":"Okay for the seventies I guess, considering I wasn't even born during this film's release. I am not a Charles Bronson fan because all of his films seem to be one Death Wish after the other ( and I don't mean the actual sequels ). Charles was believable in the role but the movie got stupid when he started whacking muggers on the street. It was as if we were supposed to believe he'd snapped because of his daughter and wife's tragic situation, but the film never showed him progressing into that sort of state. At one moment he was dealing with his wife's death and his daughter's rape, the next he was killing folks, but he still ACTED as normal as he was before. I didn't think the writing or the direction was done very well, but for Charles Bronson fans, it scores. I was impressed by Jeff Goldblum most of all. He wasn't on screen long but he left a lasting impact. Jeff was fabulous as a rapist and great in his first role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. Famous film. Horrible movie.","review":"Can't deny that \\"Death Wish\\" is a cultural icon, but blast me if i don't know why. Maybe it's not that it responded to the high crime rates of the mid 70s in an effective way, but that the crime rates were high in the 70s because society was going thru such a stupid period that movies like \\"Death Wish\\" became box office successes. Bad acting, cliched writing, slow pacing, mindless story. i dont feel like writing about it anymore. it doesn't merit more thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we say: o-v-e-r-r-a-t-e-d?","review":"Classic movie my white behind! More like possible camp classic, but in actuality not quite incompetant enough for that. This is simply a stinky movie that has aged worse than limburger (which I happen to quite like, if it's fresh and very thinly sliced - which my local deli does acceptably well). Charles Bronson, may he rest in peace, was indeed a screen legend but his acting abilities were limited... to one facial expression. The dubbing on this movie makes it seem almost like a foreign flick, albeit without any kickbutt kung-fu action! The \\"villians\\" (among them young Jeff Goldbum) are laughable and very nearly something out of a Troma movie. I will not examine the \\"feminist\\" or \\"neo-femme\\" implications of this movie, because it was made in a (thankfully) bygone era when such concerns did not generally surface in Hollywood productions. But it is safe to say this film is a relic best approached as a mild comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not really a movie fan","review":"I bought it as a gift for somebody that likes movies.

I was amazed and it summed up my attitude toward those die hard criminals. It was a relevant message about how crime is out of control and how the police actually have no responsibility or liability to protect us. We must do that ourselves ultimately. The music was a little off, but still very classy and physcotic at times . The end of the movie was definately a chill for me when it showed his vigilantism would continue. Except for the next movies, it would be with a more serious group with much more guns involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death Wish","review":"Death Wish is a somewhat dated 1974 crime/action drama. It started the Death Wish series in which four sequels were made. It's hard to imagine anyone else but Charles Bronson playing Paul Kersey. The murdering punks are played in an unbelievable fashion.

O'Hara never engages in swordplay and even compromises her integrity to achieve a goal.

Overall a great camera..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I bought this camera when it first came out in 1998 for $700 + TAX!!!!This is what i got: Unnatural blurry pictures, 4 AA batteries run out after 10 shots, no options, slow shutter speed, zoom sucks, have to wait forever between pictures, uses old compact flash, slow transfer rate (serial port, 1 min per pic!), software sucks (wont install on newer versions of windows), no lens cap, nowhere to hold on while taking pictures.Please, go and get yourself a real camera. You can get one 10 times better for the same price. Try Cannon, Nikon, HP ...... Kodak is not the anwser!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Fragile, Slow","review":"I guess I expected more from Kodak. This camera takes a long time to turn on, a long time between pictures, and a long time to transfer pictures. Picture quality was adequate.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the mark . . . .","review":"The camera is good but it has the following problems :1. The camera does not shut off, we need to remove the batteries from the camera.2. It gives continous problems right from the second month onwards. The battery shutter does not close properly. Sometime the zoom does not go in.Just imagine the frustation that I went through - I brought the camera from the US and the Kodak authorised showroom in ASia did not take it under warranty as the warrenty is based on grographical locations only.I have now sent the camera back to the US for repairs and I don't know how much will it cost or when will I get it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Priced, Low Performance Dud of a Camera","review":"Initially the camera worked fine. Pictures were of good quality and all features worked fine. After only a few months the camera's performance has dropped considerably. Brand new batteries only last for about 12 pictures, the camera doesn't even power up at times even with new batteries. If you check the other reviews you'll find equally frustrating problems others have had with the DC210. Consumer Reports' Nov 2002 issue contains Kodax's repair history which speaks for itself. The same issue also provides excellent alternative cameras with superior features at much lower cost. My advice: Don't waste your hard earned cash on the overpriced, poor performing DC210."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This is my second experience using a digital camera (the other was an Olympus). The software is a pain to install, and I tried installing it on at least thre different computers and got problems with all. The user manual is totally unstructured and Kodak use too much jargon and buzzwords to describe the simplest operation. Some problems encountered were: The memory card indicates a full 'magazine' of 19 shots, but when reviewing my shots on the camera viewfinder I get only 15. So I lose 4 shots somewhere. Try connecting to the computer, you get a myriad of problems, and to make matters worse, every time you need to stop the download, the software has to go through the same connection link-up procedure. The use manual is terribly written, you get two choices of software without anyone explaining in simple terms what each does.In summary, I would look elsewhere, e.g. Olympus."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Where's The Replacements?","review":"Okay...so I know nothing about these bands but no mention of the Replacements; whose song \\"Bastards of Young\\" this dvd takes it's name from?!

It's a great phrase and it could reasonably be said that the lyrics might speak for any generation of rock and roll, but I'd counter that every generation ought to write their own goddamn song. Not take up the banner of one that was written before most of them were born.

The music on the DVD is really cute too (not annoying). I agree with a few reviewers that the blue light is very bright. I put a small round piece of white duct tape over it and it still works fine.

I think this is a great toy and your child should like it if they enjoy watching videos like mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loves It!","review":"My daughter absolutely adores this toy. She barely pays attention to any other television show, but when she just sees the dog she gets excited. We often sing the songs from the show to calm her down or get her attention.

If only they made more videos than just a couple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Toy!","review":"My son has loved this from the day he got it at 6 months old, and he is now 11 months old.

Do you research on these tires, they are know to split on the sidewall for NO reason at all. I contacted Panaracer (Panasonic) and they said that they would do nothing besides forwarding my complaint to Japan. They said that the split was a result of something cutting the tire but as you will see in the picture, it is not a cut but a pulling of the fibers away from the webbing. BEWARE for you own safety.

It's as close to perfection as a film can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Film","review":"After hearing how great this film was, I thought I would see for myself if it could hold up to the standard. What a waste of time, this is an incomplete film that invests no interest for an educated viewer. The French do not know how to entertain us, they are overtly too serious and pompous.

Several years later he stumbles onto a story involving a hunter of Indian relics trapped in a mine by a cave-in. Recognizing this offers him his ticket back to the 'big time,' Douglas manipulates the situation to bolster his own reputation. Unfortunately, this has serious consequences for both the trapped relic-hunter and himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilder's prescient heart of darkness","review":"Ace in the Hole has been unavailable for many years. I had high expectations, as the film sits in the middle of Wilder's string of masterpieces and near-great films from 1944's Double Indemnity to 1961's One, Two, Three. The film is darker than any other of Wilder's work's, partly because it is unleavened by humour or by having a sympathetic character who isn't a dupe. Kirk Douglas is ferociously self-serving, and brings the intensity of his 40s and 50s roles without the conscience or the warmth. The other characters are stereotypes or plot devices, and the film seems schematic at times.Despite this, the cumulative effect is stunning, and the huge set pieces of the crowds gathering outside the cave unforgettable. With Michael Powell's Peeping Tom and Chayefsky's Network, here are three films that predicted all the tawdry, amoral pervasivesness of modern media and reality tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing; advice is obvious and not very innovative","review":"I was disappointed with this book.

Of course this had to happen in the early 80's when everyone made their stinky synthesizer robot boy album and this one's no exception. Like The Human League with a flute player.

Even Under Wraps doesn't seem much more than a distant cousin to this recording. Upon closer examination, I quickly added this album to my list of favorites. Granted, it's not a collection of tunes for all occasions, but it's certainly a pleasant listen when one is receptive to a bit of adventurous music played by talented performers.Highlight tracks include: End Game, Black & White Television, and Different Germany.If you want \\"classic\\" Tull, look elsewhere.

'A', 'underwraps', and 'walk into light' provide a tapestry that when considered together, show the exploration of an idea for ian. while they are lacking in some respects, they are good music after it all. 'walk into light' is by far the best, and when listened to in comparison, it helps one to understand what was going on in 'A' and 'underwraps'. i actually think this is one of ians masterworks, and i think he should admit its beauty.high points: 'fly by night', 'made in england', 'walk into light', 'end game', 'toad in the hole', 'looking for eden' and 'different germany'. contains some of the best lyrics of ians career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk Into Light ~ Ian Anderson","review":"Of Ian's solo albums, I think this one is the best.

The result that my television was unable to synchronize with the signal and the picture was garbled. The problem was observed with both discs in the 2 DVD set. I have never had this problem before or since, so I assume there is a problem with the mastering of this DVD set.Additional comment:Another review writes: \\"Don't blame EMI for making their DVDs available in both formats.\\" I don't blame EMI for making DVDs in both formats. I blame them for distributing PAL discs in a release that was billed as NTSC, and I blame EMI classics for being of no help whatsoever when I contacted them in this matter.

Don't blame EMI for making their DVDs available in both formats.Region coding (0, 1, etc. to protect copyrights) is an entirely separate issue.

Friends was one of those few series. During the first few seasons, I was glued to the TV on Thursday nights at 8:00 pm. Unfortunately, after about the fourth or fifth season, I was unable to watch it regularly because I had to work every Thursday night. However, I decided that since I loved Friends in the beginning, I would start the complete season collection. When I started watching the first season, I soon remembered how much I loved this show! Every episode makes me laugh out loud. My favorite episodes of this season are:The One with George StephanopolousThe One with the East German Laundry DetergentThe One with the BlackoutThe One with the Dozen LasagnasThe One with the Stoned GuyThe One with All the Poker(and of course) The One where Rachel Finds OutNow I cannot wait to complete my Friends collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They won me over","review":"Believe it or not, I never watched \\"Friends\\" during the entire time that it was in production.

However, I finally decided to see what all the commotion was about and watched the entire first season. I'm hooked!

The girls who were more attractive than average, usually really skinny, and way too chipper. And then the guys. Kinda clunky. No depth at all. Smug.As you might have guessed, I find it very difficult to watch this show. Far from making me laugh, these characters make me want to leave.

And they are right, of course, it does end abruptly. However, I was tremendously relieved that it did end when it did. To me, it was kinda like watching a train wreck...I just couldn't look away.Of course, you may want to take this in with the information that for me, this series ended after the 1st half of the series. For the most part, I found the 2nd half too experimental, farily dull, and not at all keeping with the tone of the 1st half. (if I wanted to read the manga, I wouldn't have bought the DVDs, now would I?)That being said, I've started reading the manga and it is great! (I'm not very far yet, though)So, final thoughts....?

The entire book simply repeats the same pictures of the same positions over and over, maybe varying them a little (and I stress little).

This book was a total disappointment...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handicapped people like sex too!","review":"My wife has been disabled with cerebral palsy since birth. Since she has little control of her legs and so forth, sexual positions are somewhat difficult for her to achieve- especially those that require an acrobatics training course. This book showed both my wife and I some interesting variations on positions that we hadn't even thought of yet. Plus, it's easier to read than the original Kama Sutra. The illustrations showed us exactly what we needed to do to try out more positions. Needless to say, it has spiced up our sex lives GREATLY! I recommend it to everyone, handicapped or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Acrobatics doesn't equal passion. This book is over-rated.","review":"Many challenging sexual positions here.

Be kind to your lover and give this book a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I did not enjoy this book at all. There was NOTHING new in it for me. And I truly didn't buy it to see naked people pressed against each other, I am looking for the more adventurous positions.

Not worth the money, I sent mine right back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Gotta Be Kidding!","review":"Anne Hooper's Kama SutraThis book seems like a fabulous thing, but when you begin reading through it seems that the positions are unrealistic and are not explained that well. It was interesting, and the models are beautiful, but I didn't find it was something my partner and I could use practically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice pictures","review":"I got this book for my wedding. I'm glad I got it. Too many people, especially men, attempt sexual acts like those seen in porn movies, and fail miserably, if not painfully in the process. This book on the other hand, shows the pluses and minuses of various love-making positions. One only wonders how many the auhor has attempted herself.A book such as this relies on pictures as much as words; and the pictures are quite good. Most of the sex scenes are played out by live couples, except for the explicit scenes of entry, etc... Interestingly, for a book based on an ancient Indian text, all of the models shown in this book are surprisingly light skinned. I've heard that in India and in most of Asia, light skin is prized more highly than dark skin. Maybe this biasness has seeped into this book? Overall a good book though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other works provide better info in a way that honors both","review":"I was disappointed in the content and presentation of this book. The nude models do not add any value to the information provided. The author seems to want to bend the line of pornography under the guise of an instructional manual. The content was contradictory in places, particularly relating to the use of alcohol. The book does a disservice to women by not honoring their role in the marriage relationship. The book, Intended For Pleasure, by Dr. Ed Wheat and Gaye Wheat was much more valuable, as it covered the full spectrum of sexual experience and its part of the marriage relationship. A weekend at a Family Life Conference would do more for a couple's love life than reading this book. I found nothing new under the sun here. What I did find here was better expressed in other works. I returned my copy for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"Having looked at the original Kama Sutra (I'm not a gymnast so put it down again!) I was sceptical at this interpretation as it seemed so simple. Yet Anne Hooper has done all the ground work and produced a magnificent, classy and easily understandable lover's bible. You must have this on your bookshelf. It is a book you could show your mother or your (adult) daughter. Beautifully presented and easy to follow. To purchase this is one of the best decisions I made."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would expect better from Hooper","review":"Ok, its not to bad, but not to good either. First off, the book is huge, not in lenght, but in actual size. Its hard to even fit it on a book shelf.It has nice photographs, and several pictures of positions etc. But it doesnt go into detail enough on how to do the possitions. I found that when my girfriend and I tried them, it was more work than fun. I think it would have been easier if Hooper described how to go about the possitions in detail rather than showing other couples making it look easy.If I had another chance, I would have looked through the book more before I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Take on the Sutra","review":"This is an interesting book genre to review, as there is a LOT of books to choose from. I agree with some other reviewers - Hooper's style generally tends to be big on pictures and short on substance. However, this book does do an excellent job of realistically editing the Kama Sutra. Let's face it, some of the positions are just fantasies for almost everyone. For you Sutra purists out there, get a different book (you probably have three anyways). For those expecting a thorough scholarly analysis of these sexual positions, look elsewhere. For those simply looking to expand their perspectives on sex positions either to rekindle an existing relationship or please a new special someone, this is a good one. You'll probably learn at least a little bit even if you have been adventurous in the past. This is a good Hooper book worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's next--Ann Hooper's Bible?","review":"How DARE this woman graft her name onto a classic and complex work.

This is a good product... effective, and gives you the ability to have a good soak with your shoulders down in the water. However, order TWO of them (I did). They don't last forever... only a year or two, depending on how much you use it. After that, the little suction cups stop working (so it falls off and doesn't work), and the clear plastic becomes discolored and kind of funky.Still, I can't find anything else that makes a deeper bath possible.

This is a must have for those of us who like to stay in the bathtub for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for shallow bathtubs","review":"I grew with a deep bathtub an missed being able to take long baths when i moved away from home. This is really useful for letting you fill a bathtub a few inches more than normal.Pros:- Easy to place and remove. Only takes a few seconds to stick on and it is easy to adjust its placement.- Does what it is supposed to do. It prevents the water from leaking out of the overflow and I haven't had any problem with water seeping in around the edges. It also has a hole at the top so that water can still drain if the tub gets too full.Cons:- Needs frequent cleaning. If you don't wash this frequently, you start to get residue buildup around each of the suctions cups. It can be a bit of a pain to clean because you have to clean around each one of the suction cups.Overall I love this item. I used mine for over a year before I lost it in a move and I immediately bought another one. Because it is so inexpensive, there is no reason to not give this a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Does not work, water get through it and it doesn't stick.

It sure beats trying to cover the drain hole with my foot. The only downside it has is that I now have to remove the tub stopper to let out some water to add more hot water. It used to drain out on it's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works and is LARGE","review":"I was worried this wouldn't fit the piece on my tub since it's slightly larger than typical and also square shaped. This covered it just fine. The suction was good presented no issues.One thing that I figured out after a day that was really nice ... my drain piece is actually quite high on the tub and so with this covering it, the water level actually gets TOO high and movement or submerging my head for a minute causes splashing and overflow. The nice thing is that you can place this so the hole is more on the side than on the top - think of the default position as being 12 oclock. I put this over the drain so that the hole is more at 2 oclock. And that works great for the level I want!This is a really good solution for people who love baths - it fits weird sized drains and it is adjustable for the water height you want. It also is a soft good quality and the suction is nice. Nothing about this that needs improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!","review":"I must admit that I was not convinced that this would work, but I was wrong...it works!

I've now taken a half dozen extra deep baths, I've tested out the overflow hole on top, and I can attest to the high quality of this product. I feel like I've been missing out on deep luxuriating baths for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"It's not perfect sometimes it takes a little effort to get it to stick, but not bad.

We just re-did our 2nd bathroom and now only have a slipper tub in there. I ordered this after realizing it most definitely needed it since, though I'm fairly small framed, the water came nowhere near covering me. This works...but I think it was made for a flat tub surface rather than the rounded slipper or clawfooted tubs. It did NOT want to suction to the tub the first few days. I had to work with it, mold it a bit, so it would fit better. The way it works now is that the bottom and sides suction, but the top part cannot suction to it due to the curve. Basically it does the job--I have to re-suction it most every time and water leaks in a bit but I can take a deeper bath now and so I have to say it was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I was worried this product wouldn't work for my tub because the over flow drain and the faucet are very close together. Fortunately, it doesn't seem to need a tight fit at the top to work. Soaking it in the warm water to soften the plastic while the tub is filling helps it stick. Great gadget. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is a piece of cr*#. What was supposed to be the most relaxing bath ever ended up being a wet exercise in frustration just trying to get this thing to work.

Try another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design","review":"Poorly designed product. The suction cups around the rim prevent it from doing its job naturally.

When I bought my house, I was very sad that tub would only hold about eight inches of water. And the water would get cold pretty quickly. So much for soakin' in the tub. I figured for ~$6, this was worth a try. When I saw it, I thought for sure the suction cups would leak water in. But they don't! Not in the least! I'm now able to fully submerge myself in the tub. The thing that I found most surprising is how much longer the water stays warm. I had seriously considered drilling small holes in the exterior of the tub to inject spray insulation thinking that might help retain the warm temperature longer. Now I don't need to do that.

I bought this for my deep claw foot tub so I could put more water into it... what I didn't figure was that my drain is wedged right underneath my faucet so there's no way I could fit the cover over it (DUH!!!). So, this may be an excellent product but I'll never know because I was a dope and didn't double check the size and layout of my tub drain :) Only wrote the review to potentially save someone else the hassle - will make a great gift for a family member or friend if I can find someone with a tub this will fit over! haha... oh well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Franky, surprised. Very good quality.","review":"I bought this on a whim thinking that if it didn't work it wasn't that much money just to try it. Well, I was wrong. It works like a charm. There's a hole in the side that you can position at the height desired so you will still have overflow protection. This was great for me because my overflow drain is much lower in the tub than I would like. Not only does this allow me to get a higher water level, the water seems to stay warmer longer. Not sure why that is; perhaps the absence of the draining? In any event, a very good purchase that does exactly what it advertises.Also, I really like that there are many small suction cups all around the rim. It gives a nice tight fit but makes it easier to remove for cleaning. It was a cinch to install. I simply dipped the rim in a bit of water to wet the suction cups, put it in place and pressed around the edges to push each suction cup. Took less than a minute and was completely secured."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's amazing how much difference a couple of inches of water can make!!!","review":"I was very skeptical that it would create the barrier needed to keep the water in. But it works amazingly well. Warming it in the running water to make it more pliable as I fill the tub works very well now that it's 2 years old and not as supple.

Couple of suggestions - dipping it in water before suctioning makes the hold stronger, it is easier to push each suction cup down individually than to try to do them all at once, and if your tub is not large enough to have the hole at the top you can adjust it to where ever it works best for you. I am really happy with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the job","review":"This works well in my bath tub. You make to let the tub fill first then get it wet and apply it. If you try to move it later it will let water in and it doesn't work as planned. In my opinion this should be a rectangle shape large enough to cover the circle. Then the outlet could be like a chimmy style opening. I still cant fill my tub to where I want to with this design.Follow up: a year later it doesn't work well... Lots of mold build up too. It falls off easily and lets water in"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool gadget but stains over time, hard to clean","review":"I've had two of these over the years since discovering them.

I got rid of the paint and left it \\"as is,\\" so I was a bit worried that the suction cups wouldn't adhere to the scored ceramic. No problem.

Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its just okay. Can't use it more than a few times.","review":"The first time I used it, it was great. no water got into the circle. But after i disconnected the item from the tub wall to wash it for the next time i took a bath, water kept leaking through. no matter how much i tried, whether applying it dry or wet- water just kept leaking through and now its useless.. Maybe the product just doesnt last long enough. I probably shouldnt have taken it off the tub.i dont know what went wrong because i read so many good reveiews before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work At All For Me","review":"I had this when I lived in an apartment with a very shallow tub. It wasn't a big investment, which is why I tried it, but it didn't really work either. It did allow a little more water, but it usually fell off in the first five minutes, so not really useful at all. If I held it on with my foot--a trick I established--it lasted a little longer, though water still seeped in around the parts I wasn't holding down and drained out, albeit more slowly than if I wasn't holding it on, but that's not terribly effective or comfortable. Kind of surprised to see such positive reviews here. (And I tried all the suction cup tricks, too, to no avail, at least with my model.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless if your overflow drain is recessed","review":"Your overflow drain must be flush mounted against the tub wall or this unit will not adhere, rendering it useless.

Well, after viewing the DVD's it's very clear that numerous episodes were ommitted which makes me glad that I still own the \\"complete\\" series on videotape. My second complaint is the terrible production quality of these recordings. Could they have put any less effort into these reproductions? Very POOR POOR quality! I'm sorry I wasted my money! Missing episodes include: Chump Secret Code, Weather or Not, The Sour Taste of Success, The Barron's Birthday Ball, The Spy Who Went Out in the Cold, Too Many Chumps, The Mysterious Motorcycle Menace, The Great Beauty Contest, Chump Takes a Holiday, To Tell the Tooth, The Great Brain Drain and The Great Double Double Cross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad, I was really pumped up too.","review":"This HAS to be a bootleg.

Unfortunately, the latter is so bad as to ruin the experience for me. Audio and video are so poor that I found myself wondering if the manufacturer recorded these episodes on a home VCR....in the 70's! We're talking faded, grainy images and muffled audio lacking even the tonal range of a commercial VHS tape.

These politically incorrect chimps fascinated me as a youngin' and it holds up- even today.

The production company may have gone to great lengths to try to make it seem legitimate, but it is not. The legitimate co-owners, ABC and Sandler-Burns-Marmer, are not receiving a penny from the sales of this dvd.However, as soon as this is resolved, it is likely that a legitimate, excellent quality, with bonus content, will be made available.I encourage all people who value intellectual property to hold of on buying this until it's released legitimately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dvd","review":"I got this for my mom for her birthday because she used to watch it as a kid and she just loves it.

It should be obvious by the fact that, a couple of days after being slipped LSD in her coke, the \\"author\\" is intravenously injecting speed. Anyone who cares about the book should read the Wikipedia entry at [...].

The diary entries gave me hope. So, when I finally got to see the movie a year ago, I almost cried. I saw no connection between Alice, and this pathetic attempt of a movie. It totally violated everything that had happened to Alice and turned it into a \\"family\\" movie, made-for-tv. I don't recommend anybody waste their time watching the movie, but i do recommend they read a copy of the book. It will turn anyone's head around, and most probably you'll never forget the book. I'm 16 years old, and i know I'll never forget Alice."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so much","review":"i was very disappointed with this movie, the book was so much better. it left out alot of parts, like where she was baby sitting in the end and got drugged by a 'friend'. it skipped the entire scene and went straight to the hospital, leaving you wondering what really happened. i guess if i had seen the movie first i might have liked it better though, but i recommend reading the book also"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Ask Alice","review":"The sound on this video is off.

I would highly recommend this movie whether you are British or Canadian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cabbage War","review":"This is essential viewing for anyone who has a loved one in aged care, or contemplating moving into care - it reminds you to keep a sense of humour, while telling a few 'home truths'about aged care.

Adnan Khasoggi the super wealthy armsdealer and deal maker, Muhammad Ali who was a good friend, Daniel Ortega the Nicaraguan leftist leader, Imelda Marcos, and Rajiv Gandhi the Indian prime minister. Bearing in mind that the author was born in 1953 most of the action took place between late 70's to early 90's. Plenty of interesting intrigue and action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cable","review":"This.

It is of good quality. I am happy with the new parallel port printer cable. Not much more I can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Benni Harper mysteries!","review":"I really enjoy Benni Harper...and Gabe and Dove and Isaac...and the new characters in this latest of Earlene Fowler's series. It's like getting together with old friends. My only disappointments were that there was hardly a mention of quilts, quilters, or quilting; and the ending was a smidgen disappointing...But that's just my opinion. I will keep on looking forward to reading each of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't Benni say NO!!!!","review":"Benni, as I have previously stated, is so annoying. Why can't she say no to anyone? Not at one point in the book was she doing anything for herself. She's always running errands, taking on extra work, doing favors, all for others, and it gets really old really fast. Not only that, I would like to take her husband and kick him to another planet. How many adults really act that way, especially the way he treated his new step-father? Just atrocious. And, the plot was weak, the characters shallow (really Elvia?) and outcome predictable. How often does Benni have to be almost killed before she stops doing favors for other people? I think this is my last Benni Harper book. I just don't care about her anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vintage Fowler but sputtering","review":"If you love Fowler, as I do, this new entry will give you everything you came for: familiar family and friends, a generous view of faith, a slowly spun-out mystery and her always witty dialogue. What's lacking is the emotional impact. Nobody really grows. Hud has lost his edge. Dove has lost her impact. Gabe has lost his mind! And the ending stretches all credulity. Hope to see better next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tumbling Blocks","review":"This captivating series is just so fun to read. I look forward to each book as they come out. I hope they never end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Love these books! Earlene Fowler's Benni Harper mysteries are fantastic! Hope she writes more. I would be right there to read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last time to read an Earlene Fower book","review":"I bought this book at a bookstore. From the front and back cover, it looked really interesting and mysterious. Boy was I wrong! I barely made it through this book and really only finished it out of stubborness and the fact that I had paid good money for it.The plot was thin, and worse yet, boring. I didn't even care who or why the person was killed and instead wanted them to off Benni. You know you're in trouble when you are rooting for the bad guy. Benni's husband was annoying and I still don't understand why her Dad is referred to as \\"D-Daddy\\", however I don't care.I won't waste anymore money on this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of Gabe","review":"I think I have read the last Benni Harper book I ever will. I got so tired of listening to Gabe moan, groan, and generally be a pain in the neck to everyone around him. The mystery plot was too thin and not really a mystery at all. Actually the series might be a whole lot better if Gabe were to disappear. He adds nothing to a book or to Benni's life other than a thorn in her side and mine.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best in the series","review":"This series is usually well-written with interesting plots and good character development. Unfortunately, this entry fell short. The \\"mystery\\" wasn't strong enough to keep the plot moving, so there was a lot of extraneous details about Benni's many errands, and too much focus on the new puppy. Normally in this series, there is good interaction between Benni and Gabe, so that their relationship continues to grow. Here, there was very little interaction between the two, and Gabe seemed one-dimensional. The ending felt rushed and seemed at odds with the way the story was driven from the beginning. I would recommend the series but this entry can be skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tumbling Blocks","review":"I am a true Benni Harper fan and every May I can't wait until her new mystery is available for me to read. However, Tumbling Blocks falls well below my expectations! Nothing happends--I kept turning the pages to finally get into the book only to have nothing happen. It is a very bland storyline with a very simple climax. I found little depth to the characters and walked away from the book with no sense of growth in my relationship with any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.... again!","review":"Thanks Earlene for another super book! Please keep great books like this coming! :>)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life as Carola","review":"Joan Grant has written a vivid account of her life as Carola, the illegitimate daughter of a Griffin in 16th century Italy. One in a series of her \\"past life\\" novels, this account is seen through the child Carola's eyes against the backdrop of pre-Renaissance Italy. As Carola faces major life challenges and matures into a young woman she grows both in strength of character and spirituality. Grant's style, as always, is seemingly effortless (as in Winged Pharaoh and Scarlet Feather) and it is as though she'd experienced this life herself. It's a masterly read which has parallels for today's society as it contrasts the harsh conditions of the very poor with the excessive privileges of the rich. The idea that we cast off our bodies at the end of each life (as an actor does his costume) and return again and again until we learn life's lessons provides an intriguing perspective. An unforgettable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN INTERESTING READ","review":"This was a very mystical read. It talked about things like withcraft, reincarnations, and sometimes Grant's descriptions of things were a little too grueling. However it was a good read and also a historical read that enlightended me about Renaissance Italy. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a good vocabulary and is ready for the breadth of emotions present in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"its sand paper","review":"Not a lot to say about it. Its sand paper and it works. The sleeves fit my grizzly sander and I use it for those not so square shapes. Be careful with the rougher grits, you can cut into the project without meaning to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dearest Samantha","review":"Your ignorance clearly comes rushing forth in your rebuttal. I did not state that I personally read the book several times. However, some of my friends did. I elected to submit the summary on behalf of several others, which apparently did not cross your mind. You chose to jump to conclusions first without regard to the possibilities.Secondly, I commented on what I found to be positive (once again something that you chose to overlook) and then made the recommendation for the well read not to read it, not everyone in general. My recommendation to you, sweet Samantha, is to visit your local debate team and take notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Higgins, My, my my","review":"If you were so well read, why did you have to read the story several times to figure it out? I got it the first time. But hate on. Good book, excellent story line. What really disturbs me about Jane Higgins is that in one breath she's saying on a positive note and in the next breath she doesn't recommend the book. It's one thing that she has admitted that she can't read, but now she's demonstrating that she can't write either. This is a fiction book, not real life, got a Jane? I found the book to be hilarious. If you want a funny book that will enlighten you on a few things, then buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Breathtaking","review":"I read this book in 1 day. I had been in a reading funk lately and finally I am out. YEAH!! This book was definitely a page turner. You won't want to put it down once you pick it up. I recommend this to anyone who is not scared to question their sexuality. Can't wait to read more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read!!","review":"I enjoyed this title while sipping on a cup of coffee and eating a danish. I purchased this authors first book entitled Wrong Perception, and was glad to see that he has written another mouth watering tale! Silk Sheets is an explosive masterpiece!

Jackson writes a good story but lacks in overall quality. This would be a great book for people just getting into the habit of reading, however, for those people who are well read, this story leaves you wanting more. The first three chapters use the first person narative for three different characters. Where that has an interesting perspective, it disrupts the flow of the story causing for the reader to stay confused or reread several portions to get the story straight. On a positive note, the story does a good job at developing the character's desire to fully understand themselves and their life problems. I do not recommend this book to well read people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silk Sheets","review":"I was looking forward to getting this book after reading the reviews...too bad I didn't choose another. I found the way it was written choppy making it hard to read (or hold an interest) The dialogue didn't seem to have much effort behind it; childish almost.I finished the book, but only because I had nothing better to do while riding the subway.If you want to take a chance because of the other reviews, go for it- to each their own- good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Erotica","review":"Is this erotica? I highly doubt it. It's the story of a poor, black, teenager in the south; her family relationships and those of her friends. The writing is choppy, and the writer spends way too much time with details that do not add to the story. Who wants a paragraph on cleaning your teeth? The main character, Tanya, thinks and talks like a twenty-something black man! She's supposed to be a teen and female! From a cultural standpoint,it's revealing.As far as erotica, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy Olden, Confidence Gal","review":"Growing up a hard life as an orphan, Nancy Olden falls into the wrong crowd and a life of crime. She's quick on her feet and quick with her tongue, talking herself out of trouble most of the time. Through a series of misadventures (she's not THAT successful a con artist, really), she begins to rely on the kindness of strangers and slowly straightens her life out. She has only one last scam to play in order to help those who have helped her. Will Nancy be able to save the day? Or will this be the job to finally send her up the river to the big house?I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. Published in 1904, Nancy Olden isn't your typical heroine of the age. Author Miriam Michelson has created a strong, smart, clever fighter of a character who doesn't lament \\"Oh woe is me, someone save me\\" like many other female characters written from this generation. I can't stand wimps and have no time for fools. I wonder if there was a movie made from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good story until","review":"Borton de Trevino tells a very compelling story about her grandfather. The book was hard to put down, it was action pack and when his family is about to be saved, the style of the story changes it is as if time ran out and there is no place to place your quarter to see the end of the story. The great majority of the story is outstanding; it is well written and very well told.

Though not as awe-inspiring as his previous \\"instrumental\\" efforts, the album is still a sound to experience.The album's tone is more upbeat, with a lot of percussion as well as (mentioned before), the RAMU (computer processed instruments such as vocals, roto toms, bells & whistles, etc.).The songs are greatly constructed, but it is not a CD to chill out to. It is an album to groove and dance to. A little more latin-flavored too. Amazing stuff here.So, if you're into a CD that has a little more meat in the sound, get it. If you're looking for a CD to take you on a journey, I recommend some of Mickey's previous efforts as well as Spirit Into Sound.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prequel","review":"A good spin off of Chow Yun Fat character from God of Gamblers.

Yes I would say it is better than their first c.d. Yet this c.d. pales in comparison to Life and Group Therapy. The songs on this c.d. sound too similar to one another and all have the same message. f*ck everything. There are very few standout tracks on this c.d. and more than enough mediocre ones on here. The cover song of people are people is worth a listen but I can't say the same for f*ck the police. Oh well I'll give the c.d. a few more spins but I'm sure next week i'll be back listening to Life, Dopes best c.d. to date. Go pick that one up. And for a f*ck off attitude on a c.d.

I was expecting a lively, smart romantic comedy, but this show feels more like the dramatization of some thirteen year old kid's diary. It's about one third boring everyday stuff, one third whiny, sniveling inner monologues, and one third recap stuff, which is mostly just a transparent excuse for more inner monologues. Since the recaps are usually cumulative for the whole show, they just get longer and longer. Also, as the relationship progresses, the main characters get more and more obnoxious and arrogant, especially the girl. Why is everyone so amazed by this show? People should take some more time to think this over, rather than just jumping on the bandwagon and proclaiming the greatness of what is, at it's heart, a mediocre, half-hearted series."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD","review":"I LOVED this ANIME!!

While I'll agree that the suite is getting a little bulky for older machines, my year-old machine has absolutely no problems running Illustrator, InDesign, Acrobat, and Photoshop simultaneously.Having moved to CS2 from Quark and a hodgepodge of other other applications (Freehand, Photoshop, Acrobat), I can honestly say that the seamless integration of CS2 is a thing of beauty.

Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future.

Nothing works! Everything falls flat! The gags are not funny. The tip-off should be, on the cover it says 'A Comedy,' and any time a movie has to tell you it's a comedy on the cover, you gotta know you're looking at a turkey. If you're a true horror fan and must watch it, rent, don't buy.

You can't use regular flatware to cut meats or anything sitting on them cause the plastic is softer then the food and get cut too. And if you have anything that weighs more than the plate, you're going to have to use at least 2 hands to remove the plate from the oven since they aren't strong or ridged enough--I often grab a regular non-microwavable plate to slide these plates onto since I don't want the microwave plate to fold during removale.

This book is about Junie taking the bus to school, but she didn't. I love the bus. And I like Junie B. The End."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful series of books for all kids","review":"I have read almost the entire series of the \\"Junie B. Jones\\" books aloud to my 9 year old daughter, who loves them and laughs out loud at Junie's antics. I volunteer in our local elementary school library where the librarian reads these easy chapter books to grades 4 - 6 and holds these kids in rapt attention. My youngest is in kindergarten (and much like Junie B) and his teacher had borrowed one of the books from me to read, because the library copies are always checked out by the \\"big kids\\". This is a WONDERFUL, ENTERTAINING series. One that is good for older kids to read on a rainy day, and a joy for parents to read at bed time. Cheers to Barbara Park for her wonderful character!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of paper","review":"This has got to be the worst series I have ever read. My children NEVER used such poor grammar, even when first learning to talk! Junie is a rude, obnoxious, disrespectful little brat. Definitely not a character I want my children reading about. What this author is thinking, I can't imagine. But I know I won't be supporting her by buying any of her trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Junie B. Jones and the Stupid Smelly Bus","review":"It was Junie B's. first day in afternoon kindergarten, so she wore her best clothes. This is a really good book, because this book can relate to kids on there first day.Like haven't you ever mmet new people before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad my kids don't like it either!","review":"All I can say is I'm glad my kids hate Junie B as much as I do. I helped regularly at my school library, and some kindergartners would come up to the counter to check these out and say how much they like Junie B. because she uses words like \\"stupid\\" and \\"dumb\\" etc, etc. Junie is rude, and everything out of her mouth is incorrect grammer. Not an occassional \\"slip\\" - constant! Is this the way you want your kids to talk and behave? If the answer is no, find another series. My kids LOVED the I Can Read series, than Magic Tree House, or there's Arthur chapter books, or the Flat Stanley series. Would not reccomend any of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a zero star book in my opinion...","review":"...which is obviously not shared by most of the reviewers here. However, this is the literary equivalent of Caillou. Junie talks back to grown-ups, yells, disobeys, calls people stupid & dumb, gets into things that aren't hers without asking...all without any punishment other than \\"Keep talking like that & you'll be in trouble, missy\\" from a parent. I reluctantly let my daughter continue w/the second Junie book & now she's worrying about drooly things under the bed, just like she did when she watched Caillou. Sorry, but the only redeeming thing about this book was using Junie as an example of what NOT to do, for both children & parents, & the Junie books won't be coming home from the library again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Girl and a Smelly Bus","review":"It was a great book because sometimes the author capitalized the letters of words. This book is really funny because Junie B would get on the bus and say \\"I hate you, Jim\\". Jim is the bus driver. You don't see that in other books. Kids will laugh at the funny words Junie B says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbara, if you can't keep your target audience intrested, then stop trying.","review":"I read this book about four years ago. I hated it, as JBJ would say, becase she apparently hates the universe.I only read two or three chapters before I stopped. I remember thinking, \\"Seriously?! Grown ups expect us to like this?\\". Grammatical errors and spelling mistakes have always been pet peeves of mine, even back when I read the book in 1st grade. JBJ was also a brat, and made some pretty ridiculous, ignorant, and illogical decisions (Did you really just try to clean your shoes by licking them? Were you really about to eat candy from off the ground? Why would your mom be talking about BATHROOM emergencies when she taught you how to call 911?).I didn't like the series, and the JBJ 1st grade version was worse.So if you're a fan of the series, stop reading now. Trust me, it's for your own good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I should have listened to the reviews. First of all, the grammar in this book is so confusing for my 1st grade daughter who is trying to learn correct grammar. Then, I have hammered it into her head that she shouldn't use the word stupid. Then the story was lame. No more Junie B for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"even my five year old thought she was mean","review":"The story is about a little girl who has to ride the bus for the first time. She is very rude to her mom, teacher, and other students.

I was asked to read the book.I think it is funny and a great book for little kids started or in kindergarten.Personally, I sat in my chair laughing...This book was a great and wonderfl way to explore the world inside little kids minds (I gave it 4 stars because, it was very short)...Thank You! I also suggest you read more Junie B. Books...they are hilarious! Bye END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the way I want my kids talking.","review":"I picked up a copy of this book for my kindergardner on the recommendation of another Mom at school. We have been trying one book from just about every easy chapter-book series we can find. I was very unimpressed with this book.Junie uses poor language skills, not something I want to encourage in my son.Junie says that she \\"hates that Jim\\", also a word not allowed in our house.I could go on, but my dislike of this book comes down to the simple fact that she does not provide a good model for my son. There are plenty of wonderful, engaging books for this reading ability that don't dumb down. Magic Treehouse and Arthur Chapter books are so far our favorites because they are fun while also maintaining the type of language and character behaviour that is positive. We work hard to help our kids do and be their best, why offer this negative example to them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad really....","review":"I managed to get about two pages in before I put the book down and told my daughter we should pick something else. Like many of the other reviews I was floored this book has even made it to print. It is a beautiful example of how to be an awful person so if you want to discuss how not to be with your child, here you go! Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scared my daughter to tears!!!","review":"My daughter has been so excited about starting kindergarten and riding the bus. I thought this book written from the perspective of a kindergartener might be a fun read for us... boy, was I wrong!!! Now my daughter is awake and crying at night because she's scared to take the bus. Does anyone have any suggestions for reversing this Junie B. curse??? She'll be taking the bus 6 days from now, and I have a lot of un-doing to do. And I even skipped reading aloud several parts of the book and all of the \\"I hate that Jim\\" parts. Junie B. couldn't be a meaner, naughtier little girl. I am now completely horrified by her popularity. Plus, have others noticed that she is a Ramona (Beverly Cleary) wanna-be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother??","review":"The author tries to be cute by making grammatical errors much like a 3 or 4 year old would. Can a child learn good grammar by reading a book with bad grammar? I suppose, if errors were corrected as they are encountered. I must admit that I do not feel as though I am enriching my kids life with any book in this series. There are enough good childrens books available that I say, \\"Why bother??\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junie B. is a bad role model","review":"This book might catch your child's interest - but it is likely to be in the same way that a smart aleck kid from the neighborhood might - and it is not a positive way!The grammar is poor - as an adult I understand that it's done for humorous effect; but my child doesn't get that! And Junie is rude, bossy, and she name calls; again, not the behavior I want my child emulating.Overall, the books seem entertaining but not really beneficial in any other way; there are many better books out there to hold the attention of young readers.* UPDATE: I am editing this review to just add my insight that this series of books is better suited to children ages 7 and up = I see now that kids of that general age range are much better equipped to identify the silliness of the characters and empathize with them by understanding why they act as they do - much better for second graders than kindergarteners or first graders - just my added two cents. Now that we are older, we enjoy them more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junie B. Jones . . . I'm not impressed","review":"Okay, I don't think that the words \\"hate\\" and \\"stupid\\" are words that should come out of a Kindergarteners mouth as much as they do Junie B. Jones' mouth. I bought several of these books on the recommendation of my sister, who is a second grade teacher and the myriad of recommendations online. When I began reading them to my 5 (almost 6 year old daughter), who is also in Kindergarten, I realized that I had to reword most of the dialogue as I was reading The books are certainly humorous to us adults and strike a chord with those of us raising children in this age group, but I don't think the misspellings and poor usage of the English language is very educational or entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding me!","review":"My daughter just started kindergarten and is participating in a school wide reading program to read for 20 minutes a day. Since she is past the 'little kids' books as she puts it, I told her we would read 'big girls' books with chapters. This series was recommended for K-3. I am with the other reviewers that gave the book 1 star. I was horrified!!! I too had to change the dialogue quite a bit. The words stupid and hate are not words I approve of for a child just starting school. I also don't like the word bestest. These are children learning how to read and to use proper English, you would think a book towards their age group would be AGE appropriate. I will not be purchasing any more of these books and will not recommend them to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think we're related, Junie B.!","review":"Barbara Park has done it with her creative works of Junie B. Jones. What a joy it is for my six year old kindergartner and me to enjoy this mother/daughter time as we see what Junie B. will get into next. Junie B.'s antics are overwhelmingly hilarious and a joy for any family member to read. I hated riding the school bus too when I was little and reading about Junie B. and how she felt brings back many wonderful memories of going to school as well as some not so wonderful. My little girl could be her sister also. She delights with laughter as she hears about Junie B. hiding, but most of all she eagerly awaits each book to hear what Mrs.' last name is. Keep them coming Barbara Park. You have two Junie B. Jones fans in this house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"I don't even know where to begin. These books are so horrible, and not just for the fact that the character of Junie B is a mean, bratty, ignorant, pathetic excuse of a kid. I fully realize that the grammatical errors and misspelled words are put in there on purpose for so-called humorous effect, but when you have 1st and 2nd graders reading this and you have to keep explaining that it is not correct to say \\"bestest\\" or \\"funnest\\" or \\"I runned to her house...\\" well, it gets highly annoying. I would not recommend these books to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sets the WORST possible example for a young reader. AVOID!","review":"My 5 1/2 year old daughter got this book as a Christmas present. Supposedly the main character Junie B. is the same age as my daughter. But I was astonished when we read the book together because throughout the book, Junie is disrespectful, mean, and constantly talking about beating up a classmate. WHAT?! Is this quality reading for a kindergartner (or even a 1st, 2nd or 3rd grader)? I don't see the appeal of having to explain to my daughter while reading every page, why Junie is not nice, acting inappropriately and wanting to beat kids up. Seriously?! I don't expect my daughter to be reading books that have a moral every time, but c'mon! There are plenty of other good fiction books out there where the main characters have fun, even get into trouble, without being such terrible examples to their reading audience. I would have given this book zero stars if I could have, as this is hands down one of the worst books I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"greet Book Book review by Arian Juarez","review":"Book review by Arian JuarezJunie B Jones and the Stupid Smelly BusYou should read this book because maybe you would love it if you read it.

Within the first two pages I was completely turned off by Junie's poor grammar and how rude she is. These may be funny stories but encouraging such poor language and behavior is unecessary. I returned the book without sharing it with my daughter and am now looking for other series books to share with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who can be more stupid and funny than Junie b.?","review":"Think about the emergency situation in the school! My God! She is so funny. but I love her."},{"rating":"2","title":"These books got my 6yr old to read!!!!","review":"My daughter just finished 1st grade. At her book fair last month she bought one of the JUNIE B JONES books. The next day, i was looking for her in the usual spots: in front of the TV, etc.. Finally I found her up on her bed quietly reading JUNIE. She loves them. She read through the first three in 1 1/2 weeks. Until now, she had been mostly a reluctant reader.Junie is a feisty character with a mind of her own. It is easy to identify with her and enjoy her antics. As a parent, I highly recommend these books!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"anti-intellectual","review":"This book and the series in general appear to be part of the wave of ignorant-is-good anti-intellectualism drowning our culture. We were given a few books from the Junie B. series to read aloud to our son, who loves Beverly Cleary. Needless to say, the comparison is inapt (and insulting to Ms Cleary). I'm happy this author (?) can crank these out so readily (yet such frenetic production should be a red flag about quality), but reading an ill-written, unrealistic story with an unrepentantly rude antihero to your child squanders the time you spend trying to have a positive influence on him/her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Grammar And Disrespectful Children","review":"Writing about the first experiences of a child taking a bus to school is a good subject to read to children to help them better understand the process. However, author Karen Park writes characters that openly disrespect their parents and teachers. The language is also a bit much for a 5 or 6 year old, and words that are not appropriate to say out loud in school and should not be praised. The incorrect grammar is also something that children should not read or study. Before they can understand what is wrong about a sentence, they need to first learn the correct way of writing and proper sentence structure. I was very disappointed in this book and will not buy any more Junie B. Jones titles. Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is my bestest review","review":"\\"This is my bestest hat\\" is a fairly typical line from this book. Though I understand that most first-graders are still learning grammar and often speak like this, I don't feel that it is appropriate in a book targeted at children of this age. Children learn by example and will pick up on the good and bad habits that they see and hear, so why would anyone want his/her child exposed to this constant stream of sloppy language? Sure, it's great when a child loves a book and learns to really enjoy reading, however there are literally thousands of good books out there that kids will love reading. Why bother with this one? If this were a television show rather than a book, no one would stand for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Loved it! I definitely recommend if you like Junie B Jones.

Junie B. Jones is about to ride a school bus for the first time in Kindergarten. She has a lot of trouble with riding the bus because she doesn't know where it's going to and there are a lot of mean kids that ride the bus and stick their tongues out at her. One of my favorite parts is when she asks her mom and her teacher, \\"YEA, ONLY WHERE'S THE STUPID SMELLY BUS GOIN' TO?\\" Her mom finds her a nice friend to ride the bus with and then Junie B. is not so afraid to ride the bus after that.-Ellena, 3rd grade"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Completely Ergonomic","review":"The photo shows a keyboard that looks ergonomic (i.e., designed to avoid repetitive movement injury). However, an important feature is missing. Unlike the Microsoft Natural keyboard, this one does not have an arch built into the top so that the hands slightly face each other. Instead the top surface of the keyboard is flat. This lack of ergonomic design defeats the purpose of buying this kind of keyboard. I have found that a touchpad like the one on this keyboard is very helpful because it avoids the need to reach out and strain your wrist for mouse usage, and it's a shame Microsoft's keyboard does not offer this. The price is good, and the keyboard seems to have quality construction. Because I was expecting complete ergonomic features, Amazon was gracious in taking it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Ergonomics - Poor Construction","review":"I had a keyboard like this before, but it was in all one piece. For some reason they have decided to split the mouse section from the keyboard, and it was a poor design choice. Being able to split your arms wider with the ergonomic keyboard will make you a faster typist. but the small touch pad in lieu of a mouse is poorly placed, and the part that it rests on kept coming apart from the main keyboard. Plus the touch pad is not very sensitive. I finally just gave it to the thrift shop and went back to a one-piece keyboard.

The maximum font size you can program in the system is 16 point.

My first one year subscription is up at the end of the month and I just got a notice they are raising the service rate from $99/year to $150.00/year and why. It runs on my phone line, with my paper and my ink and they hardly even store anything since it downloads every 24 hours.

Only other requirement I'd like to see them add is the capability to know when your note was printed to assure me it has been delivered, or a queue to show the administrator what volume and sources of notes have arrived over the recent period of time.

Good thing grandma has Mediacare and Social security....too bad taxpayers pay for them.HP should be ashamed for marketing this to elderly people....it is such a rip off.Ink jet printers are the biggest rip off in the IT industry....$22 for 10ml of liquid.

The process was explained in detail and the website for managing \\"friends\\", sending newsletters and checking on email activity, ink and paper level is incredibly simple. From my house I know when Grandma needs more ink or paper and I can see who she's received emails from and who has forgotten to keep in touch. The printer sits on a table next to her bed at the nursing home and she loves hearing it come alive three times a day sending her news, pictures and stories. We were able to adjust the font size to compensate for her failing eyesight and the convenient automatic header naming the sender and giving their phone number is genius.

Very worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful answer for the older generation","review":"The family have been trying for years to get my 88-year-old grandmother on email but she is afraid of computers. This printer and service was the perfect, affordable answer. She is delighted with it, and I am delighted with the ease of service and ability to manage everything for her from 3,000 miles away.

She enjoys getting the mail.BUT --*The printer did not last long. We had to replace it after two years. The hinges that support the cover are flimsy and one broke, which then interfered with the machine knowing if the cover were open or closed. We lived with it like that for a few months but eventually it died and we replaced it for her.*The ink cartridges are a MAJOR expense. My mother is not happy having to shell out $40 or so every 4-8 weeks for ink. (This little device is a very, very clever product to make money for HP!) Because it uses a multi-color cartridge, the machine says you have \\"Low ink\\" when any of the colors runs out, even if you have plenty of the other colors. Tremendous waste of money.*Some email attachments cannot be printed.*Machine seems to jam more often than most printers. Not sure why.Having said that, i have not yet found a better solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read for Roosevelt Junkies","review":"This biography written by one of the Roosevelt children is an enjoyable and informative read. The author claims to have written the book to dispel rumors and myths about his parents. It is quite good. I had not seen in other bios about the Roosevelts that FDR not only had the early affair with Ms, Mercer, but also another affair that went on for some twenty years with his secretary, Missy LeHand. Eleanor is painted with a somewhat severe brush by the author. He clearly liked his dad the best. The book also covers in a lot of detail Louis Howe, the man who according to many was the man who made Roosevelt president.

She uses fun, not necessarily complex footwork but also not for beginners -- if you are a more advanced exerciser you will know the moves she says and keep up well enough. For me it will take a few times to master the moves but I kept up well enough most of the time.I LOVE playing with the sticks. Not only do I feel like a tough cookie brandishing sticks but they also make a satisfying clacking noise when you tap them together.Overall this is a fun workout and it will get your heart rate up if you give it all you've got. It's challenging choreography-wise so it's for intermediate or more advanced exercisers. I recommend it if you want something a little different and if you like swinging sticks around like I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great fitness DVD","review":"A great buy.

My favorite track is \\"A Better Way to Be\\" with its John Lennon meets Brian Wilson vocals and its gorgeous melody, \\"Did you know that's not the way it's supposed to be?\\" On the final Sun King track \\"Le Roi-Soleil\\" the over 9-minute holding of a single note was a bit more experimental than I care to follow.

I've gotten into the habit of making sure my hands are clean before I use the mouse, because the slightest residue on your hands from hand lotion or greasy food will gunk up the mouse. Even with regular use, by clean hands, the mouse still needs to be cleaned out about once a week. It becomes unusable if I don't clean it. I truly regret buying this. I do have to say it's a comfortable design, and the infrequent times it does work, it's nice to use. However, the times it does work are few and far between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets dirty too easily.","review":"I have been using this trackball for about a year. Because your fingers touch the ball, it gets much oilier and dirtier than a regular mouse where the ball only touches the mouse pad which doesn't have skin oils.

This book is totally inappropriate for young girls. If you are a concerned parent reading this do not let your children read it. Let them keep their childhood a little longer. Even though I am nineteen this book, starting out with ritual rape and baby sacrifices, left a bad taste in my mouth. I do not feel we need to dwell on such negative aspects of human behavior. I felt that the writing was also poor. The Elske character was flat and not well developed. I also read The Wings of a Falcon and was disappointed with it too. This whole series is a bust. After reading the wonderful Dicey's Song and Homecoming I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure if this book is fantasy or historical fiction...","review":"I guess I would have to call it \\"historical fantasy.\\" When I read the book, I was unaware that is was part of a larger series, or for that matter if any of the cultures portrayed were parts of actual ancient cultures. That said, Elske is the story of a young girl who escapes the \\"Wolfers\\", a barbaric band of people. She eventually ends up in Trastad, where she makes contact with a women rumored to be a queen, Beriel. I disliked Beriel, and felt that after Elske met her, that the book went downhill.

It's not as though I feel I'm prudish about topics dealing with issues young adults face. I loved Laurie Halse-Anderson's, Speak. Elske, however, disturbed me because I felt as though I were reading an illicit child-pornography tract. Instead of a thought-provoking examination of the exploitation girls may encounter, society's response to it and the ultimate successful resolution of that girl finding her voice and becoming healthy and whole, Voigt treated us to Elske's grandmother getting gang-raped to death in her stead so that she may run away... to what?

I encourage young women and their mothers to read this book in their book groups and to explore the medival world. My 12 year old daughter, a mature reader, loved it. Cyntia Voigt has done it again with another great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read","review":"I read Voight's other \\"Kingdom\\" books as a teenager, but when I came across Elske on the site, I had to buy it. I was a little wary that I would have outgrown the series, but I quickly found myself completely immersed in the story. Voight crafts an excellent tale, doing well to tie this book in with the others in the series, but with such subtlety than one must not have read the others to enjoy Elske. The characters are strong, and the only negative thing I can say is that it all seems to wrap up too quickly. The last few chapters could have been fleshed out a great deal more without overburdening the plot, and I, for one, would have enjoyed a little more substance. However, it still makes for a great read, whether or not you're family with the other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elske","review":"Elske was a well written book with many different sides and turns.

Besides the crap Honda motor the Mantis stainless steel blades bend very easily and have to be twisted back straight every time you use it.

I'm always stopping the thing to pry out rocks that get stuck between the tines and the tine cover. Any tall weed will also wrap around the tines and I need to stop it to dig them out.

All the advertising on TV and in magazines, etc.Delivered to home promptly, put it together and it took about an hour and 10 minutes to get it started. Once started it ran sluggish. After a few minutes turned it off and it has never started again. Emails to Mantis seem to fall off the world as no response.So I went out and purchased a large 5 hp front tine tiller and it starts first time every time. Does a great job compared to the Mantis, seeing I can not get the Mantis to even run.I am not going to drag the mantis all over town to get it fixed, that is just plain nuts. Not going to send it back, as I do not see much in track record of Mantis happy repairs for customers.

Oil spewed from the spark arrestor. Covered under warranty. This year ran Ok but there has been a gradual loss of power over the past three years. After running it for about 1 hour this year I could not start the engine. Brought it in for service. Needed a new carburetor (only about 35 hours on the engine). Still had problems- replaced pistons and head gasket. $300 in repairs, started right up and ran about 5 minutes, then would stall out when I tried to start tilling.Repair company has no idea what else is wrong. Called Mantis who said to call Honda - talk about passing the buck. The number they gave me for Honda was not working.I have had used Mantis tillers for 25 years. But my run with them is finished!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Choice","review":"I used the tiller 1 time. After that time it sat for 1 week. All the oil leaked into the cylinder.

The drawback is that you have to attach it to the camera with the Kodak lens adapter. The lens is somewhat heavy.

It is very comfortable, fits the hand comfortably and has a good feel to it. Rolls nicely and it is easy to unscrew the little cover on back for cleaning. (some micies have a pop off cover which makes me crazy)I use my computer for work and play and kids use it for school and hubby uses it for business, so this mouse has been very well used.One thing - I rarely use the scrolling feature. It jumps too far for me. I prefer to roll down the screen a line at a time or a page at a time. The scroller moves down about a half page - which I find disorienting and I lose my place while reading.However, hubby *loves* that feature. (the scroller)It also comes with cute features and software. Different on-screen pointers and cursors. And according to our mouse odometer, me and Mr. Mouse have traveled nearly 15 miles. Wow, that's a lot of movement on a mousepad that is 10\\" square."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touchy scroll wheel quickly annoys","review":"I have an IntelliMouse at home that I love so I decided to buy another for work, unfortunately this mouse has a scroll wheel that is difficult to turn, and is easy to press. This combo results in several unintentional clicks, causing annoying behavior in applications. At times I feel it?s easier to scroll with the scroll bars (which defeats the purpose of getting a wheel mouse). I would recommend passing on this version, and shopping for a better built wheel mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels sorta cheap to me...","review":"I really dislike this mouse. It's made out of a hard plastic and doesn't move across the mouse pad easily. The wheel couldn't of been designed any worse. It feels very cheap, and when you try to scroll with it it starts to zoom, because it jams up inside the buttons. I was expecting a little better from this Microsoft product. I would advise against buying this mouse, and buy an optical one. I guess you have to pay a little more to get more."},{"rating":"1","title":"After experiencing this mouse,","review":"I realized how right the other reviewers were. I also liked the one I had at work, and yes it had a dull finish, so I ordered the same mouse. I found the scrolling device to be more annoying than helpful because I ended up usually pushing the button and not scrolling at all. I also thought that the mouse jumped a bit,it was so frustrating trying to edit with the mouse jumping too far ahead and not pointing at what needed to be edited. I would never recommend this particular mouse, the one made in Mexico, to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality control is not good","review":"I recently got a new computer at work that had the OEM version of the Intellimouse. I liked it so much that I bought one for home. Unfortunately, the one that arrived is close to unusable. The whole reason for buying it was that once I got used to the scroll wheel feature, I loved it. This mouse, however has a wheel that gets very slippery and the switch under the wheel is extremely sensitive. You have to bear down on the wheel to keep it from slipping but that causes the switch to activate. My mouse at work has neither problem. The wheel does not slip and you must give it a definite push to activate the switch.Clearly, Microsoft does not have good manufacturing process controls. This one was made in Mexico by TEAM SCLA....By the way, another reviewer complained about the scrolling feature moving too much or too little. That is configurable on the control panel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Information to add to my earlier review","review":"I wrote an earlier review critical of this mouse. I found out from Microsoft that the OEM version sold by Dell is NOT made by Microsoft and might be slightly different, though it is made to Microsoft specs. That may explain why I really liked the Dell version and I do not like the Microsoft version. I recommend the Dell, though I didn't see it offered on their web site for separate sale.Also, the Dell software has a few minor added features than does Microsoft's. (e.g. Hit the ctrl button and it highlights your cursor.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This mouse is AWFUL","review":"One reason I bought this mouse was for the scroll feature. And guess what?

The mouse does not track well across the mouse pad, and it is VERY cheaply built. Here's the real kicker, I have had this mouse for about a year, and suddenly the wheel is not working any more. Tried re-installing drivers, and it didn't work. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find out where it is made first!","review":"Same experience as previous reviewer... I have an intellimouse at work that I liked, so I bought one online. The new one's middle button was so sensitive that it was impossible to use the scroll wheel without triggering the button. This is horrible in UNIX, where the middle button is mapped to paste, so you get <scroll> <paste> <scroll> <paste> ... It messes things up in a hurry :)Anyway, the (good) one at work has a dull finish and is made in China. The new (faulty) one has a shiny finish and is made in Mexico. I even returned the new one and got one at a local store, with the same results. It is also a shiny finish and made in Mexico."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in Mexico - la rueda no jira","review":"The wheel on my \\"Made in Mexico\\" mouse stopped working after a couple months.

Boy was I WRONG! The Intellimouse software [messed] up my laptop and made internal errors. Everytime you restarted you would have to do it again because there was another error. The mouse was also messed up. It would move at extremely high speeds and open up everything it touched without me even clicking on it. The right and left click buttons both did the same thing. I originally had Win 98 on my lap, but I had to install Windows 2000 Pro just to get it fixed. I am lucky that even worked. Do not buy this mouse. Microsoft is USUALLY dependable but this time their product is defective. One more thing, the price is not that good either.Instead buy an optical or wireless mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Porter Cable sleeve for Grizzly Sander","review":"I purchased a Grizzly oscillating spindle sander. At the time of purchase I was looking for a higher grit than Grizzly offered (150) and Amazon suggested the Porter Cable sleeve at 220 grit. This was just what I was looking for. The problem, that caused me to rate this only 4 stars, is that I had to virtually hammer the sleeve onto the grizzly 1 inch core. I'd rate the sleeve, by itself, a 5 star but if you're going to use it with the Grizzly sander it's an extremely tight fit. Makes changing sleeves a major pain.

I was fascinated by the story of his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb film about about a hero","review":"Since it has been and remains so popular to paint the CIA as some renagade agency bent on taking over the country and guilty of assassinating anyone who disagrees with them, it is wonderful to find a film that provides real history and insight into the CIA and one of it's great leaders. I have been a fan of William Colby since the 70's when he demonstrated honesty along with courtesy and professionalism par excellence in his testamony before the Church Committee hearings. During those hearings when many were simply on a witch hunt and looking to make a vain glorious name for themselves, Mr Colby's testamony was nothing short of superb. His autobiography reveals a man who was dedicated to his country and to freedom and democracy. This film is a grand history lesson and, contrary to another reviewer, provides insight into Colby as a man and not just as a spy. Carl Colby has honoured his father and his father's work with this film.

As such, it does little to satisfy either side of the equation.Another problem is probably 75% of the content is focused on gay male activities. While that is fine for gay males, it leaves out a very large part of participants in the lifestyle. The one straight male Dom that is interviewed feels as someone chosen primarily on his looks, as opposed to any great skill or knowledge, as evidenced by his calling the falls of a flogger 'bristles'. Even my friends who have participated in the lifestyle for only a few months laughed at that statement.Overall, it's a good try, but doesn't do justice to the people, diversity, or breadth of the lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible ghosting/shadowing on the display","review":"I had this delivered with an Amazon Fresh order to extend the connection between my desktop and monitor.

I have gained some confidence in that area by trying to read while playing (although the current tempo tends to make that quite difficult).

Unlike Feehan, I enjoyed that the female in this was truly strong, and not just one of those no means yes kind of girls. She pretty much accepts her physical attraction to the main character from the get go and doesn't feel guilty about it. And honestly, kicks serious butt, and gets the true admiration of Marc. Not just, oh how cute, she is fighting back, but to no avail. I do like alpha male type characters, but I also like women characters written to give as good as they get, and this one didn't disappoint.I thought the writing was fresh and real, and at times, surprisingly funny.

It is even better than the first read because now, I notice even more detail that I may have missed the first go around. Sizemore writes brooding and dark vamps with feisty heroines. However, she also interjects a little humour here & there which is really fun. She's also created an ancient vamp society which I really love.If you love vampire romances with alpha heroes and tough heroines as much as I do, then you are going to love Susan Sizemore's vamp series.

It uses slow moves (which are proved to be most effective), all within 30 minutes. I am totally satisfied with this tape and can guarantee that I will use it at least three times a week (as she suggested).

This book explains it.Richmond exploded two days after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Other cities, large and small, across the nation were experiencing their own civil difficulties with riots and looting. At first, some thought this was related. This included, famously, a telephone operator who couldn't get through to the town. In contrast to other communities rupturing, Richmond came together during and in the wake of this tragedy.In the context of the time, this story is one of hope. It's an example of a community uniting regardless of race or religion. You may find inspiration here, others will find remembrance. The events of that day are remembered for the loss, but also for the gain of one small corner of America putting aside barriers and rediscovering common connections."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't read just one!","review":"This was an excellent read.

The arrangement is pure beauty, even more atmospherically wistful and poetical than the originals. It is by no means very profound music, but extremely attractive and melodically highly memorable. The quartet movement, on the other hand, is quite impressive, making one regret the fact that Dvorak never worked a complete work out of it. The Waltzes and Gavotte are slighter but worth a listen, at least.And the Vlach quartet conjures up real color and spirit in this music, drawing out every shade and reflection in consistently refined performances. Perhaps the sound they procuce is, as other reviewers have observed, slightly unbalanced at times, but these are still overall very recommendable versions, especially in the fine, well-perspectived sound they get here. Overall a very welcome release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hebrew Christianity","review":"Excellent for messianic Jews wrestling with just who they are and how they fit in.

King Dork was definitely worth the read.While Portman's constant grudge against Catcher in the Rye and his pretentious devotion to bands I've never heard of annoyed me, I got over it and was able to appreciate the clever story and the quirky characters that everyone can relate to. Little Big Tom is one of my new favorite literary characters.Portman hits dork humor on the head with this book and creates a great mystery that keeps you guessing and entertained until the end. Definitely worth the read. My only complaint is that he went on some tangents about rock 'n roll that were long and unnecessary and boring.

When I sat down and began to read it at the end of the summer, I realized what a mistake I had made.I immediately found myself identifying with the main character, being sucked into his adolescent mystery of decoding messages written in the margin of a ragged copy of Catcher in the Rye.In a broader sense, though, this book is about finding one's identity in the absurd social landscape that is high school in America. Frank Portman adds insight through humor, as his protagonist struggles against MAG, Teone, and self-obsessed percussionists.An excellent read from start to finish, that will leave a smile on your face like the first time you rolled a 12 sided die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Language Arts Superior WI","review":"\\"This is a very interesting book, it relates to what a high school that i go to is like with AP class.

The bumbling teenager that I was long ago was suddenly present front and center, radar out for slights and bullies, longing for validation, convinced that life has no meaning outside of friends and music, and desperate for sexual experience of any kind. Took me right back there, and helped me remember that being a teenager is still the hardest time of life. It's amazing that any of us survive. Frank Portman has told a story that will resonate with teenagers, and with anybody who has ever been a teenager.King Dork"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holden, you got nothing to worry about","review":"A previous reviewer writes: \\"The writer is extremely clever, and has a way with words.\\" I agree. Unfortunately, he doesn't have a way with the kind of words a 14 year old would be thinking and speaking. That's the genius of Catcher In The Rye, and why it's still a great book -- and still being read -- 50 years later. Holden talks like a 16 year old. Chi-Mo talks like a senior year Lit major at a small private college somewhere. Trust me on this, King Dork will not be on anyone's reading list 50 years from now. A 14 year old high school sophomore probably wouldn't give a shout out to an obscure Hemingway short story (see if you can find it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just fell apart, such a shame...","review":"This was a sure five star book for the first three quarters, but the jokes just kept repeating, Tom kept repeating himself and saying in 2 pages what could have been said in 2 lines, or not at all.Ok, ok, we get it, the mystery is a tough one, why not go on forever about how it's hard to be sure about what you know or don't know or how it could be speculation, then 10 pages later make the exact same speech.Is this a mystery novel? Not really, unless you think giving us a ton of evidence and theorys and turning them all into hanging plot points a mystery.Why is the step dad is a more major charachter then the sister and mothercombined? because apparently the author really hated the sixties, and the step dad is a hippy.Tom hated catcher in the rye? yeah, he mentions it about a billion times.This book started out so fresh and funny and went absolutley nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get through","review":"I was assigned to read this book for a writing class. Otherwise, I would have put it down after the first couple chapters. It quickly became one of those rambling, boring books where you keep having to read pages again because your mind drifts off. The narrator wasted the reader's time with incoherent stream of consciousness, and used cheap gimmicks (like mentioning lots of obscure facts about really cool bands) to seem cool.There really wasn't a plot even though the book was huge. The most interesting plot thread (a mystery) never got solved! There were way too many coincidences. I'm not a big fan of _Catcher in the Rye_ but it was so much more masterfully written than this book.I am surprised that there have been so many good reviews of this book. I think it's because there may be a lot of people who start reading it and never get through it (and thus, don't end up writing a review). I know I wouldn't have finished it if I hadn't been assigned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. It is like reading an adult pretending to be a teen telling teens how much life sucks. We know. For some reason, these crappy angst books are so popular now. Perks of Being a Wallflower, which is just as bad, was recommended with this one. Honestly, pick up a decent book and don't waste your time. Tom hates Holden Caulfield? Why? Because Holden has something worth saying, rather than being a pretentious tool? I hate Tom and I hate this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Dork lives up to its title. And not in a good way.","review":"This is a book for those annoying old people who think that just because they were a teenager years ago, they can write a book about teenagers.

Lu is not a stereotypical teen ager. Although she has a need to get high to deal with her life (as others her age in this small Kentucky town also do), she views her own life and feelings with honesty. Related from Lu's point of view, the novel's plot is simple, perhaps even predictatble, but it's strength is that it doesn't shy away from the casual drug use and binge drinking, the sex, the impulsive desire to get on with life, and the feelings of apartness that make up the lives of many teen agers. The book is at its best when dealing with her new and powerful attraction to the older Jay and with Lu's sense of being different from the others around her, even her best friend, Ginny. Death, both past and present, plays a powerful role in this young woman's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK EVER","review":"I've read this book multiple times. It not sounds just like the typical life of a teenager, but it's kind of scary how close in personality the main character is to me. I've even gotten to the point where i'm underlining thing's she's said in awe that they are some of the same things i've said to other or even just myself at times. If you're my age, which is 16, soon to be 17, you'll love this book.

The EU is struggling with increased immigration from Eastern Europe and third world countries and how to incorporate these new arrivals in fairly homogeneous societies. I enjoyed the film's presentation of the challenges faced by poor immigrants from Italy in trying to adapt to Swiss life, but facing deportation as illegals. The film is probably more relevant to the present day than when it was made. It offers a picture on the issues the U.S. is facing in deciding whether to make illegals citizens or deporting them to their home countries."},{"rating":"1","title":"a punishing bore","review":"So fecund, so multi-faceted, and so brimming with scalding tears is the Holocaust that the minute a mediocre movie about it rears its head, it oughta be run out of town.Lifeless characters, mismanaged tension, and a punch-pulling script all help to make \\"The Boat is Full\\" the most forgettable film I have ever seen about the Holocaust.Strictly for completists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Cutsy","review":"I was looking for a much more true approach to this wonderful story of Ruth and Naomi.

These guys have not gotten the credit they deserve. This is a shame as Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir, and Emperor fans would probably love this. The album opens with a very strong track \\"Tristetea Vehementa\\", that then fades into the shadows of a dark, evil, and punishing track \\"Banner of Blasphemy\\". Then comes the beautiful epic song \\"Near Dark\\" that clocks in at about 15 minutes in length, it's also one of my personal favorites. The sixth track \\"Contemplation Song\\" is an instrumental keyboard track which is eerie and mesmerizing at the same time. the vocals are done in a semi high-pitch manner and the guitarists play heavy riffs and catchy melodies throughout the album. This would most likely appeal to fans of the gothic, symphonic spectrum of black metal. Agathodaimon has created a dark masterpiece with \\"Blacken the Angel\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to this requiem you always loved to hear...","review":"Simply put, a prime offering of dark, melancholic black metal.

Small holistic practices are not based on selling a particular product that is patentable, therefore, they have no R&D; budget.Dangerous? expensive? Threatening to America's health? How about all the toxic drugs they are taking, made by large drug companies? Have you read the prescribing information in the package inserts?

It is full of inaccurate information, poor research, and vague references, and even though it's supposed to be exposing quacks, he never mentions the quacks in conventional medicine.

After giving a lecture at a chiropractic college in Japan, I was amazed that the doctors know as much about my job as I do! But how much does the author know about chiropractic? It is books like this that keeps modern medicine in the dark ages. Some doctors are even ignorant about the fact that HIV is the cause of AIDS!

My fingers, which are of normal size, kept hitting the adjacent half-size keys, making it highly unproductive to use.While the half-size arrow keys would also not appeal to gamers, I suspect they would also not like the Elite cross-layout of the arrow keys.

What this means is: \\"Do you want to know how to make a window or menu? OK, here is the code.\\"There is far more code in the book than actual text. The code is almost never explained outside of brief remark statments within the code. If the author had written a book about learning how to build a car engine from scratch, he would have thrown in a bunch of engineer's designs and left it at that.The book also uses MFC and ActiveX controlls heavily without explaining them. The book can't even be used as a reference. This book is a stain upon the autor and Sybex.It dosen't matter what learning style works best for the reader.

Once was too much, but he continues to fill hundreds of pages of the book with dozens of redundant wizard source code dumps. Why I don't know. This copied source code isn't even commented on a whole lot by the author. An obvious filler.

Although Jeeves's solutions are always brilliant, this one is probably the most ingenious (and for a moment, shocking) of them all. While the plot is beginning to feel a bit contrived (it is, after all, basically the same as all the others), there are always enough eccentric characters (notably Captain Plank, who has Bertie nailed as a villain named Alpine Joe), lively interaction between the two principals (this time over a blue alpine hat with a pink feather), and wonderful, Woosterian language to keep us laughing along the way.

This is not my typically genre of book and I was pleasantly impressed and surprised by this book. I have not read the prior books in this series and had no problems following along so the priors are not a necessity.

Of course, we know he always is calm and collected which is why he's the best! A great Wodehouse story and wonderful word play by the master. There is not a day that goes by that makes me wish I had met PG or Plum as he was known. I wonder if he was as masterful with language in person as he was with the written word?

The disc ends with a spoken-word \\"Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\". In other words, it's perfect for a Halloween function for young children -- not too scary, just gently spooky.Procees from this CD went to the St. Jude's CHildren's Research Hospital.

Nonetheless, it is one of the greatest books I hav ever read. I had always heard of it (I am 58 years old) but had never purchased it until a friend of mine gave it a rave review. It's not the easist book to read but once you get into it, it is addictive. My son, who was then 19 years old picked it up when he was home on break and refused to give it back to me until he went back to school. A must read especially if you are a history buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book deserves no rating","review":"I first read War & Peace at 17, and have read it cover to cover three times since. I would not be exaggerating when I say that I have read the ballroom scene where Prince Andrei met and danced with Natasha over 500 times; the window scene where he happened to eavesdrop on her conversation with Sonya about 300 times; Andrei's ruminations while passing the aged oak over 200 times, and his proposal to Natasha over 100 times. Why this endless fascination? Simple - Andrei & Natasha ar real people to me (more real than some flesh and blood people I know). I've come back to the book again and again simply because I love them, and want to experience with them the joys, the fears, the ecstasy, the doubts, the uncertainties, and the hundred other emotions that assail the captivated heart. For me, the rest of the book is just a frame. Natasha and Andrei's relationship is the picture that I will admire for the rest of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be afraid.....","review":"I've wanted to read this book for a long time, but was afaid of its size and my lack of knowledge of things Russian. After 20 pages, I was hooked. I've found it much more readable then I had assumed. I love Tolstoy's writing style, his attention to every day detail, his insights into his characters- each and every one fully drawn, no mater how minor a character. So, don't be afraid- you'll miss out on a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Best","review":"Superb. I put off reading this book for something like 20 years, but it was worth the wait.Worth the weight, too. It's damned hefty.Tolstoy's passages on historiography and the philosophy of free will, mingled with the narrative, often come in for attack. I say, the only rule for writing novels is that there are no rules! Tolstoy's excursions into non-fiction within a work of fiction are just fine by me.Mrs. Garnett's translations of the whole shelf of Russian classics are no longer the most current, but I think they're still the best. They carry the scent of their times (early 20th century) which is simply much closer to the times these books were written than any modern translation can provide. It's frank, manly English. The original comes through strongly, and the translation doesn't call attention to itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece of the mind","review":"This book was the first 'complex' book I read. I have now read it three times, and I wish to do so again. It is an interplay of the subtle and the obvious, from Pierre's struggle to find peace to the innocent young Natasha's love for Prince Andrey, and Bezuhov. But what affected me most was Tolstoys ruminations on the nature or war and life. His logic is concise, flawless yet has a depth beyond that of any other I have read. His final argument, that argues that we must depend on something we do not understand is so perfect I can find no flaw. It is the only argument that proves there must be a God that I can't attack. War and Peace is a large commitment to read, but once you have finished, you will be more than what you were. That is a guarantee."},{"rating":"2","title":"War and Peace","review":"Everyone knows it is a classic. Was supposed to read it in high school just couldn't master it due to size and involvement.

Easy to read but yet a vast portrait of pre-revolutionary Russia.That being said the periodic discussions of Tolstoy's theory of history which from time to time are inserted amongst the novel are, let us be frank are silly boring to read and out of place.The book however is a rarity. Anyone can read it with pleasure and come away richer for the experiance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long yet still can be interesting","review":"This book was a very interesting book but for me it was extremely long. I had a lot of work to do and therefore it took me a very long time to read. I can see why some people may like this story but it has too many sub plots and too many pages. If you have a long time to read a story and you have a thing for Russian history or war in general than you will probably enjoy this story. It is one book that should probably read before you die but don't read it in high school. Just a suggestion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not Karenina- not piercing, too revolving...","review":"I sometimes read War and Peace in the dull hours of the early morning. I find that the revolving interaction of the 5 familys during the wars leaves a lot unsaid: this I cannot appreciate. Anna Karenina was much more insightful and passionate.

Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between \\"serious\\" works of literature like this one and allegedly \\"lesser\\" novels.

The fight scenes, as expected, are unforgettable (especially the two nunchaku scenes), but Lee's inimitable intensity, charisma, and charm make the rest of the film equally enjoyable.

The dialogue was overly dramatic and any obstacle the characters faced was far too quickly overcome. The lack of real human connection and struggle negated any merit the book may have gained from its concept.

Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the last Statesmen Quartet newer project","review":"The name \\"Hovie Lister\\" will forever be linked to southern gospel music as a true leader and legend. Hovie, who passed away on December 28, 2001, has left behind a gem with this newer project featuring the Statesmen Quartet, which he orginized and managed since 1948. This record is a top-notch project with top-notch musicians, including Anthony Burger on piano. Jack Toney is outstanding in writing some great songs and singing the lead. The quartet has truly a quartet sound: no screechy tenor, no sloppy bass or twangy lead...just a true, clean/crisp southern gospel quartet sound (a trademark of the Statesmen). Hovie out does himself featuring one of his classics, the Bill Gaither tune, \\"Thanks To Calvary\\". For you who have enjoyed this group down through the years, get this one while the gettin's good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prejudiced views","review":"The prejudice of the author comes through loud and clear from the dedication to Bill and Hillary to the bashing of conservative views at every opportunity. I was extremely disappointed. It's the last of Greeley's books that I'll waste my time reading. Also, it was much too easy to figure out who and what was happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Greeley Book I'll read","review":"As others have said, this book is really an apology for the Democratic party. That would be fine, but I would expect better of someone of Father Greeley's intellect than repetitive phrases such as \\"Republicans have always been good at stealing things, especially elections.\\" By the way, where was the ACLU when there was a mass said in the White House. A building belonging to the people of the United States, terrible, terrible, the sky will probably fall on us all now. I stopped in disgust three quarters of the way through the book. I had already figured out the ending anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bishop should take an eternal sabbatical!","review":"This was a very thin and obvious story -- I figured out who the perp was after the vice president and her daughter were initially introduced. I agree with all the points made with another reviewer who gave this novel two points. Especially on how Andy portrays certain people in a sterotypically fashion. However, I have a stronger dislike for novels written by liberals who use them as political platforms. Seems history was trying to be rewritten here, and a sickly yearning back to the Days of Camelot were very much evident and not appreciated by this reader. Overall this was a stupid and ignorant novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackie Ryan always a great companion","review":"I'm never disappointed with this author. This book was very timely! Written over ten yes ago the sub-plot is spot on for today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greeley is always a fun read!","review":"Bishop Blackie (aka Punk) is attempting to find out who or what is haunting the White House. Here is a Roman Catholic, Democrat, widow, with two daughters, elected president. What more -- the man is from Chicago - home of both fictional Father Blackie and Father Greeley. This book is a fun and quick read - with a number of twists and turns along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"Interesting premise an ethnic Chicago politician as President. Blackie Ryan is always entertaining - the political slant in this book made it especially entertaining 10 years after publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bishop in the West Wing","review":"I consider this book much too polarizing to recommend it as a fun read for the general public. The focus was too political. The author vilified conservative republicans and glorified liberal democrats. He then had the audacity to have the President (liberal democrat of course) denounce partisanship. He also seemed to negatively stereotype the Christian religious right in order to support an Irish Catholic power team in the White House. If you have a particular disdain for Republican-Conservative Christians, this book will resonate with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last book by a priest","review":"This book took me forever to read because it was extremely slow-paced and uneventful. The idea of poltergeist attacks sounded interesting to me but this book focused more on the sour relationships between the Democrats and Republicans in office than the acutal poltergeist attacks (which were more of a side note). I also found the character of Bishop Blackie to be rather annoying. Perhaps though, I just do not like political novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Massively underrated and ignored","review":"Ignore the weeping LSD fans still trying to get over the fact their favourite band went in a new direction they didn't like.This album fuses together my favourite elements of music- melodic guitars, brilliant percussion and dreamy soaring vocals. Nova is by far the best track on this album, though they are all good quality, and seemingly unique these days (if anyone knows of anything like this album get in touch!). Sunset Bell is also brilliant provided you listen to it sparingly.If you enjoy drum and bass- you will like this. If you enjoy spanish guitar- you will like this. If you like strong, but not grating female vocals- you will like this. It's an album that appeals on many levels. So go and buy it and ignore the LSD fans who don't like the electronic feel of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best yet...","review":"Unlike many other reviewers here, I prefer LSD's newer, more electronic sound to their older work. As much as I enjoyed past albums, each song was so similar to the next that they all blended together. Yet Flux has many standout tracks (\\"Psyche,\\" \\"Nova,\\" \\"Ring,\\" \\"Sunset Bell\\"). Also, unlike past LSD albums which served mainly for late night, introspective listens, Flux is also great in a club or for long, late night drives. Personaly, I don't think the electronic aspects of this album take away from the ethereal qualities of LSD at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Decided to give this group a try after hearing one of there songs randomly.

LAME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely a Downward Spiral.","review":"Love Spirals Downwards, \\"Flux\\", was purchased for me as a gift, a further exploration of a band I'd found to be a godsend, to say the least. Unfortunately, LSD's magical work was laid to rest, in favor of a more poppy, electronika sound for \\"Flux\\". If you're a lover of LSD's earlier work, then this album will be depressing for you. If you instead enjoy trip-hop, or soundscapes that mirror that of some technological lounge music, I still wouldn't recommend \\"Flux\\". I love LSD, but the electronic midi-work and poor drum sampling of \\"Flux\\" more than compromise Suzanne Perry's otherwise seraphic vocals, and send the album in a Downward spiral of its own (excuse the pun). Decent tracks exist, such as \\"Alicia\\", but if you wish to explore the true passion of LSD, turn to their better works..which is *any* of their other material."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad dose of Love Spirals Downwards","review":"I am a huge fan of Love Spirals Downwards. Unfortunately, \\"Flux\\" is a flawed and disappointing album. There are some good songs (\\"Alicia,\\" \\"I'll Always Love You,\\" \\"Nova\\" and \\"Sound of Waves\\"), but they are all sabotaged by the lousy mixing on this CD. For evidence of this, listen to LSD's excellent compilation, \\"Temporal\\" -- two of the three tracks from \\"Flux\\" have been (thankfully!) remixed into more engaging incarnations.As another reviewer correctly pointed out, on this album LSD removes the Gothic cloak in favor of sterile, too-fast trip-hop drum machine rhythms. Stylistically and technically, \\"Flux\\" just doesn't work (even Suzanne Perry's lovely voice is not sufficient redemption); you will be disappointed. The kindest description I can give to this album is: experimental. If you're new to LSD, start with \\"Temporal\\" or \\"Ever\\" -- both excellent albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"So ethereal as to lack any content","review":"I purchased this CD on the strength of one track and that turns out to be a mistake. Almost the entire album is so ethereal and breathy that it makes no impression. Even ambient, soothing music needs to have enough substance to impress a mood and this one fails to meet that standard. This CD is so weak that I would slot it in below ambient. Call it \\"background music for background music.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"youngblood fan","review":"this album is very inventive. it's unlike anything i've ever heard. i still don't understand how the tuba can sound that amazing-or how the guy on snare pulls off those wonderful beats. i can't take it out of my cd player-every time i listen to it i like it a little more. it's the cd of mine that i am most proud to say that i own."},{"rating":"1","title":"come on boys","review":"I dig the band. I've seen them twice. I think they're live shows are great, but the album's kind of boring. The Kweli and Ladd tracks are tight. It sounds too produced, not as live as they really are. Written solo too? Sounds like it. Stick to what you're great at guys. I'd wait for the next one. Tuba player plays some bomb stuff though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooks a plenty","review":"Heard \\"Acousticon Theme\\" by YBBB on WLUW here in Chicago, ordered the disc soon after that and have it in steady rotation with my current personal favorites. I'm not a big hip-hop fan, but the subtle combination with all the horns and the FANTASTIC tightness of the band and compositions make this disc a must have. If you are TIRED of the same old same old, this will surely shake that media made malaise from your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Don't waist your money","review":"This is a very poorly made MP3 bought two units one for each of my children one worked and the other didn't even turn on.

Just thought I'd leave this warning for animal lovers and those sensitive to animal cruelty. The film opens with a close up of a real live rooster in flames and screeching in agony. I was so sick to my stomach, I threw away the dvd.

I believe that this is rubberwood, which is known as environmentally friendly. You can Google rubberwood furniture, and get all the details if you have OCD, like me. The table was very easy to assemble, just put the legs on with two bolts. The chairs took a little longer, but you could tell that the engineering was done by pros. The only reason I dropped the rating to a 4 is that it was missing a U-WASHER from the hardware bag. Of course, that is a special, non-hardware store item.

Rent the movie instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misleading title, not much science.","review":"I must say upfront that this book has very little if anything to do with science besides some obscure inferrences drawn between creation and religion. Considering the title I was certainly disappointed. However, trying to move past the title and the contents one finds a belief that man is essentially evolving past the need for an omnipotent God much less a personal one. To make matters worse, his attempts at Christianity and attempts at reducing Jesus to man with a vision come right out of the late 19th century with more recent vocabulary. This book lands squarely in the Ba'hai faith without much imagination. Drawing some teachings out of Kabbalism, I strongly believe that this book would disappoint even most Kabbalists."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cold theology bordering on pantheism.","review":"Daniel Matt has written a book attempting to integrate modern physics and ancient theology. For his effort he comes up with a 20th century quantum version of deism -- the view that God started the universe and then walked away, leaving the clock (or the waves and particles) to fend for themselves. The trouble is that such a universe and such a God have nothing to say about ethics and even less to say about the practices we should engage in to enoble and sanctify our lives. What we are left with is a cold theology which sees God in energy and in matter, but not in the soul. Such a God is literally \\"no-thing.\\" For a better attempt at a similar synthesis I would refer readers to Lawrence Kushner's \\"The River of Light.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Filler...","review":"No offense meant to other reviews but frankly this album falls flat. I have bought a fair amount of what is commonly called \\"Trip Hop\\" and \\"Nu-Jazz\\" and found this to be among the least compelling records I own. Furthermore, to compare this with Miles Davis (even in his *least* interesting periods, let alone Kind Of Blue & Sketches Of Spain) is blasphemy of the highest order ; )Again, no offense meant - just want others to know that other choices are probably better.It's not that this disc is horrifyingly bad: but in the end it just really feels like filler - background music... and not really good background music at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"extraordinary","review":"This is one of the most extraodinary movies about 3 of the most extraordinary men and their work on the front lines that I have ever seen.

It also has suspense, danger, and some new morphs. what is special about Animorphs books is that the characters can turn into (morph) any animal they touch.

The Sister and her charges hide the Jewish children and help them on their journey. In the process, they learn that Jewish people are no different from themselves.

Moreover, Elnora was not the same type of person as she was in the book. In the book, she was a well rounded girl who was intelligent, beautiful, and who had grown and matured by the hard knocks given to her by her mother. In the movie she seemed whiny and sorry for herself all the time.

The fact that Derek refuses to take center stage on his own album is absolutely dumbfounding and profoundly disappointing.To make matters worse, a large portion of the songs sound as if they were the rejects from a BLS or Malmsteen recoding session and were probably written mostly by the guitarists themselves rather than Sherinian. The final song \\"In The Summertime\\" does not belong on the CD at all (except maybe as a hidden track) and fails to bring an appropriate ending to an already sub- par album.

It's so bad it's hard to believe any one would put it on a CD other than to draw attention and sales from the names. Too bad, I had higher expectations from this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst sherinian solo album","review":"i like all of derek's albums to one degree or another and have heard his planet x stuff as well. blood is by far his worst and most boring work. the synth tones and note choices are redundant and unnecessarily overplayed. some of the guitar work as the song with john petrucci is okay but too much sax and non-metal sounds abound this cd. derek plays too much unmelodic stuff and the vocal tracks are blah. in the summertime with billy idol is laughable indeed. the song with zakk is ok i guess. i recommend you check out inertia and the first album by derek. this one seems rushed and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not related to STOMP (dance/music group)!","review":"This is a martial arts video from the late 60's; if you're looking for STOMP, the dance group that uses various things to make sound with, don't buy this tape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not about the musical group STOMP","review":"This is a Martial Arts movie.

It is, in fact, a martial arts film that has nothing to do with music. I did not watch it, so this review isn't about the content of the video...just a warning to potential buyers. I bought it under the \\"new and used\\" section and was told by the seller that in returning it I would have to pay a re-stocking fee as well as all shipping charges which will probably amount to the price of the video. More information about the DVD could have prevented this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Atmospheric Black Metal","review":"When I first heard Christcrusher, I was not really all that Impressed. My first reaction was this sounds like Dimmu, Graveworm and every other Atmospheric Black Metal Group out right now. After listening to the album a little deeper, my first Impression was wrong. This album is very melodic, serene and has it's own Identity. The track Christcrusher is extremely brutal and almost doesn't fit the rest of the album, but I'm not complaining. This release offers a lot to the genre, it's well played and the production is perfect. The vocals are very evil sounding, the clean vocals don't sound like Progressive Metal and the acoustic guitars and keyboards are blended perfectly. This doesn't sound nearly as assessable as newer Dimmu releases but still has that Epic feel to it. Add this to your collection and you will go back to it time and time again. A great addition to a your Black Metal Collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Deck the Halls.","review":"Just good to relax movies.

All I can say is WOW! Im so glad I did. Leslie Sansone's workouts have changed my life, and it all started with this one! It was extremely easy to follow, and I felt great everytime I did it. I also started to see results immediately. I had been dieting for 10 weeks before I got her video, and I had stalled in my weight loss. Once I started doing her workout every other day, the pounds started coming off again. I was able to meet my goal, and keep that goal maintained. She opened up a whole new world for me. Now I go to a health club several times a week, and work out with weights. Although I haved moved on to the next level of fitness, her videos are the best place for a beginner who is struggling with weight loss, to start. Believe me, her system works!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"After sitting on the shelf for weeks, I decided to start exercising and boy am I glad I did. I was expecting to be discouraged after the first routine, but Leslie keeps you motivated. She targets key problem areas of the body and those lunges really [work]! You're not bopping all around your living room doing this video. This is definitely for the low key exerciser. You do get a great workout and work up a nice sweat. The length is approximately 30 minutes. Just enough time to not bore you after awhile. She moves into each exercise at a steady pace which allows you to keep up with her. I highly recommend this video to anyone just starting out."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout for legs and butt!","review":"I have a few of Leslie's DVDs. My favorite is the two mile walk with the hand weights. This one I just bought and have only done 3 times so far. I like it a lot. I feel the muscles have been worked. I think its great for the lower body especially! I am going to do this fat burner one 3 times a week and Leslie's two mile walk away the pounds 3 times a week. I recommend both DVDs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gentle but effective aerobic & strengthening workout","review":"This tape is ideal if you're new to exercise, recovering from illness, or just not one of those hard-core exercise-types. The workout is quick (about 31 minutes) and low-impact. You'll still be able to get our of bed the next morning after doing this workout. But you will get your heartrate up, work up a sweat, and tone your muscles. And when you get the hang of it, you can do the same moves on your own when you're travelling or just can't get to play the tape for whatever reason. When you get stronger, increase the intensity by adding ankle weights and heavier hand weights (maximum 2 lbs). Leslie is upbeat without being obnoxious. She is motivating and genuine."},{"rating":"2","title":"walk don't jog","review":"This is a nice home excercise video.

Oh, and forget the cover - you don't get any special effects like that in the movie.As far as plot goes, it involves a group of kids who go to a cabin and open up a game, which essentially brings the ghosts of 3 witches back to kill them one by one if they don't understand and complete the game.Don't bother with this one - you'll thank me for it later!"},{"rating":"2","title":"durable good price","review":"Beefier then the leash I'm replacing.

The pictures are great and, from a historical standpoint, enable the reader to go back in time and imagine oneself in the scene. However, when you put together a project like this, the author should ask herself \\"In 30 years, will a reader be able to pick this book up and and appreciate the historical tidbits of information I presented?\\" My point: there are WAY too many of her \\"present\\" pictures that include the name of the tourists smiling for her camera! Will a reader now, or in 30 years, care about the names of these people? I think every aspect of a book like this should be of historical interest and more ink should be spent on image information, not names of random people that wandered in to her photos.I am addicted to Then And Now books and, other than the minor problem stated above, I loved this book and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding example of courage and fortitude","review":"This book has been in my family for many years. It is the story of Mormon pioneers who were called to settle the Southeast portion of Utah and serve as a buffer between the Navajo Indians and other settlers.

The title comes from a slot in the cliffs above the Colorado River where they blasted and built up a road to the bottom of the canyon, only to find that the hardest parts still lay ahead.

The illustrations are beautiful but are geared more toward nostalgic adults than children. This particular book reflects what is wrong with several titles in the series: poems chosen because adults have an affinity for them rather than because they will appeal to children. One of the poems in this book is \\"The Emperor of Ice Cream\\" about the death of a poor woman, possibly a prostitute, surrounded by her poor neighbors trying to spiff up her house by bringing in flowers wrapped in month-old newspapers while the \\"roller of cigars\\" whips \\"concupiscent curds\\"in plain old cups in her kitchen.

Her range of emotions shows well not only in the words she says, screams or cries, but her eyes tell you much more of what she is thinking.

In general, books centered around a bitter, grieving person are not really as engaging as this one's description made itself out to be. Also, it seemed very drenched in New York... and I felt outside of its targeted audience, simply because I have never lived there. It felt a bit like hovering on the outside of this clique, and never really connecting with it, which was not something I expected to feel about the setting. And the \\"precocious\\" 5-year old was UTTERLY UNBELIEVABLE. It wasn't quite girlie enough to qualify as Chick Lit, and, frankly, not good enough to qualify as Literary Fiction.

I would have given this one-star for the irritation of having bothered to read this after a professional review I read of it gave it a rave of some depth... except that Central Park plays a fabulous character here, and even though I hoped all the characters would disappear forever into the park, I thoroughly enjoyed all the details about the park itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as a doornail","review":"Not to rain on anyone's parade here--with all these beaucoup glowing reviews--but I was bored stiff with this one. There was absolutely nothing unique or refreshing about this read. The characters seemed flat, lifeless, and not very likable. And I just could not see anything redeeming or noteworthy about the story. In fact, it's no more than mere domestic drama at its worst!The main character whines and moans her way through. She comes off narcissistic and even the step-child she tries to embrace is unlikable. Ultimately, though, there is no literature here.

In fact, the only character more irritating than the narrator is the stepson, who I would have pushed off a pier. I wound up wondering whether the poor baby was better off wherever souls go than living with these self-absorbed morons. I can't figure out why the reviewers think this was funny. What was funny?

At least I'll make sure never to read any other book by either of these \\"writers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-put-down-able?","review":"OK, I know people have different tastes, but I'm shocked to see the stars given to this shallow, lame, predictable, and sappy book. I just read all the reviews (slow day at work) and something else surprised me: how similar all the good reviews are. \\"Un-put-down-able,\\" \\"I couldn't put this book down,\\" \\"I literally could not put it down,\\" etc. You get the idea. Did all the friends and family of Ayelet Waldman talk and agree to write reviews on this site, saying how \\"un-put-down-able\\" the book is?That is the only explanation I can find for the glowing reviews of a book that is, at best (and I'm being generous here) mediocre. I could put it down. Easy. No problem at all. In fact, the big effort was to pick it up again and finish it. I made the effort, read it through the laughable and maudlin ending. Never again though. I will not pick up another Waldman novel again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talent is the other impossible pursuit!","review":"Amid the glowing reviews, the only way to get an objective view of this book is to read the 1-star comments from other readers. It would save you from having to read the book and then write the negative comment yourself.This is the first time I've read a novel by Ayelet Waldman and I didn't know that her husband is a famous author -- so I had to judge it by its own merit. And the verdict is that with or without help, the author is a terrible writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A melodic hard rock masterpiece!!!","review":"This CD is awesome, to say the least. It's a refreshing return to a grassroots hard rock sound compared to the more experimental vibe on Vaughn's \\"Soldiers..\\" album. Standout cuts are the scintillating title track \\"Fearless\\", as well as \\"Time to fly away\\", and \\"Was there a moment\\". If you liked Tyketto back in the day you will be more than happy with this effort. The songwriting is more mature, and Brooke St. James razor-sharp wails on lead guitar have been replaced by PJ Zitarosa's steady yet equally potent vintage classic rock style playing. This is just an absolute must-have if you are a fan of pre-90s hard rock. For another great new hard rock CD, check out Mike Tramp's \\"Recovering the wasted years\\" effort, available on his self-titled website."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun toy","review":"My daughters enjoy the toy, but we all felt that it should have come with more parts.

There's one book for baby Jesus, another for Jesus' adult life, a book for various Bible heros, one devoted to the creation, one for The Lord's Prayer, and books for Daniel, David, Esther, Jonah, Joseph, Moses, and Noah.What I Like: The concept. The small size is also nice for infants and toddlers.What I Dislike: The illustrations are unimaginative, for the most part. Some are colorful, others are pretty bland.

I got tired of the nasty flare my earlier Olympus Stylus zoom gave me, so I went with this camera. The optics are sharp, with nice color and contrast. Flare isn't a problem and the lens has decent speed for low light. The spot meter and focus lock let you compose better photos. All-in-all, an excellent compact camera without the tiny image size on an APS camera. My only complaint is it's so small that it's easy to lose.

The illustrations are good, similar to those in the first book, but that's about it (a repeat). The first book was fun, funny, and more than anything VERY original in its approach. Plus, most kids can relate to the attitudes portrayed in the first book, while this one is mostly for conventional families that go to conventional doctors and use conventional medicine (as if that was the only way to get well). Not us, and not so many families I know...

This isn't a one dollar bag of chips I'm buying, it's a 40$ jug. From the outside, it looks like a satisfying sized container, well worth 40$, but why even make a container that big when you're only filling it halfway?

I'm sure it's even better if done in a blender with other additions.The flavor is kind of bland. That's more of a feature in this case. It doesn't have off flavors, artificial sweeteners or chemical tastes that require strong flavoring to mask it. It's sweetened with Stevia, which is an all natural herb.I've always found Optimum Nutrition to be a quality supplement manufacturer, and have liked all their protein lines, but now that the Natural lines are coming available, I'm going to be supporting the production of it in place of their traditional protein powders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Natural Whey","review":"I have tried several natural whey powdered proteins.This is by far the best tasting, mixing, and has the most % of protein.I don't know how you could complain about the taste. Mixed with skim milk this tastes better than pretty much any other whey. So if your not looking for results and are too concerned about taste, then maybe you should not even be taking whey.Mixes well in a shaker cup (which cannot be said for all wheys)It also has a high percentage of protein per gram and gives results. It is also very cheap for natural whey.Until they say that their cows are not given hormones (which isnt going to happen), this whey cannot get any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"For $18.99 I didn't expect audiophile quality but the master speaker was dead out of the box.

It spent alot of time taking apart the mentality of the average trader and contrasting it with what a winning trader should be thinking. Some chapters seem a bit redundant. It makes you examine your beleifs about trading and helps you self examine to see if you have any of these traits that will hurt your trading and also gives practical suggestions for how to change your mentality.

I bought the book to learn how to become more disciplined in trading and hoped for strategies and exercises to enhance a discipline for trading. He does give a couple exercises at the back of the book but there are no strategies. The book is full of examples of poor trading due to fear of a loss. (i.e. holding on to your losers).

It has a very complex writing style, talks a lot about pychology (which is also very important in my opinion), but gives no clear picture of what is important or even what the author wants to say. A useless book. A lot of the positive reviews about the book seem planted to me. I am a proffessional trader and cannot see how anyone can benefit from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent advice but wordy","review":"It is a shame that those who give one star ratings never get into analysis about why. Their comments would be better appreciated and contemplated if they had. I agree with the 5 star ratings on the content of the book. Everything is quite logically stated. The breakdown of our thought processes, the psychology of the human mind, negative and positive influences on us, etc. and how all these things impact on our trading decisions is quite comprehensive. I give 4 stars though because the book was dry and somewhat a little wordy and repetitive, especially when many paragraphs throughout the book started with \\"This book will show you....\\", \\"You will learn from this book\\", \\"My plan is to show you\\", \\"I will give you an example\\", etc. If you push through the wordiness, I would recommend it still as a primer for the beginning trader or the trader who keeps losing his money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff...","review":"As the wife of an investment professional, I often pickup books on the psychology of investing.

From making the decision to continue trading even after my first big trading loss to reevaluating my trading habits and facing facts, this book has given me the most help - by far - in improving my trading.

If you are looking for controlling your emotions and responses, I would suggest reading the \\"7 Habits of Highly Effective People\\" by Stephen Covey. I found 7 habits much more readable and useful for the emotion/pre-conceived notion that the Disciplined Trader tries to explain.The 10% related to trading was somewhat interesting.

I have a Harvard Ph.D. in psychology, and I thought I knew it all. Boy was I mistaken! Mr. Douglas showed me how to think in such a unique perspective, that of a winning trader, not a 'hopeful' trader. I can't say enough about his books.

After reading it, I found that the solution to this phenomenon was the following: to truly understand the book, you need: 1) To understand, that this book is not going to present you a clear trading plan or any technical knowledge whatsoever. It's about the mental aspects of trading. 2) A certain level of intellect (not that it is very hard to read, but I'm sure it is too difficult to understand for some). 3) (a lot of) trading experience. You can only appreciate and understand the book, if you can relate to the mental processes and experiences that are presented in this book.Once these three conditions are satisfied, I'm sure you'll just LOVE this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Disciplined Trader","review":"As a former exchange member, I can attest to the validityof the concepts and the effectiveness of the methodologypresented in this book. Those who have ever traded seriouslyknow the mental game is the real game. You probably will have to execute over 1000 trades to really appreciate the thought process Douglas lays out. For beginners, reading the bookwill introduce you to the REAL challenges in trading.They don't call trading \\"A hell of a hard way to make an easyliving\\" for nothing. This book is one of the very few that addresses this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Trading","review":"I've had this book for a couple of years and finally got around to reading it. I wish I had done so much sooner. This book is so much more than a pyschology book for traders. It is a book about the pyschology of life. The concepts, once explained, seem so simple but most people do not think in such a way as to understand why they do what they do. Douglas doesn't use stock charts or technical analysis but rather examples from his own life and those of others to illustrate the principles he is trying to teach. This book is for anyone who wants to know why they do what they do and how to change their thinking to acheive their goals in trading and life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bible of the industry","review":"Mr. Douglas finally lays it all bare. Successfull traders have the discipline to stop their losses.This is one of three books that I keep handy when I am working with clients. Many futures traders don't understand how to properly trade, they have a all or nothing approach.Mr.Douglas forces average investors to be introspective and face their demons of fear and greed. Once you take control of these emotions you are on your way to being a disciplined trader. This book along with my book, Futures For Small Speculators, will help any beginning or experienced trader literally put their money where their mouth is, on profits.Great classic and should be required reading for all those that consider themselves traders."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is ONLY targeted at the most careless speculator","review":"I've been trading for nearly 10 years and was looking for a book thatwould teach me to conquer my hesitation and be disciplined in the faceof so much confusing data and emotion. This book was not it. Ibelieve this book was written for day traders who haphazardlyspeculated themselves to failure -- not for those experienced traderlooking for greater discipline.The first quarter of the book wasgood. The last 3/4 of the book repeats itself OVER AND OVER again.Basically, it keeps talking about positive mental energy and negativeenergy and keeps trying to define EVERY little definition. It was SOpainful to read, I had to skim the rest of the book until I realizedthis book wasn't going to help me.Take my negative review howeveryou want in light of all of the positive reviews here.

I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy reading this book. This book actually held my attention longer than a lot of books on the trading. Entertaining though it was, in the end though I walked away with nothing. This book did not make me rich, in fact it made me about fifty bucks poorer. I don't need a lot of abstract concepts about inner consciousness and outer consciousness. I need a plan, a concrete strategy, something I can use and mold to my own style. This book offers nothing concrete. This book reminds me of The Inner Game of Tennis, which I also consider to be a bunch of bull, but that's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy and read \\"Trading in the zone\\" by the same author","review":"instead of this. Douglas had put what he learnt during the 90's (which is a whole decade from the first edition of this) in his latest book \\"Trading in the zone\\" and you really can tell the significant improvement between the two.

Please refer to my review of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"phenomenal content + painful writing style","review":"Even if you don't trade, you should read this book. The insight the author gives into a person's psyche is astounding. I learned more from this book than from dozens of psychology books and the couple of psych classes I took in college. On the downside, the author's writing style is very tedious. It took me three times as long as it should have to read this book because I had to reread (at least once) nearly every other sentence. I've heard the author speak (on the Web), and he speaks much more clearly than he writes. But the content is worth fighting your way through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"i've read better trading books","review":"there are def better trading books, there was someone in particular that i wanted to read about, that's the only reason i bought it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob is a blast !!!","review":"The first time I heard of Bob Malone was in the French Quarter of New Orleans in an open air cafe.

Even the best futurists are wrong in key areas. In this one, the messages left by a lost advanced civilization are on videotapes that degraded. The degradation of the information media is important to the story and the master was just a little too specific about the tech involved.In all other aspects, the story is fantastic and captivating.For anybody who loves space opera, science fantasy, or dystopian themes, this is a classic must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"None","review":"I found this book EXTREMELY boring and long winded.

If you find the characters without personality, then think about the era the book was written in its almost robotic lacking emotion and singular identity that is an important part of the writing.

This is not for anyone though who only wantsrefined studio music. This is a collection of solo Gregg demos, Gregg with a band demos, alternatetakes, live cuts, and also a few studio cuts. This collection is RAW to the bone. This is undilutedGregg Allman. At points it can be a little ugly, but one must remember that creating a refined studiocut for an album has to begin somewhere. If you ever wondered who Gregg really is, or wanted somelayers stripped away, this is the collection to buy. This is essentially all about Gregg Allman. Itcan be a bit overwhelming in places but this is only because one is listening to RAW footage thatwas probably seen as too hardcore for some who only want refined studio music. Real fans of the ABBand Gregg Allman will immediately recognize there idol in his purist form as he bears his soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demos, Alternate takes and hits","review":"These 2 CDs represent the best of Gregg Allman in the 1970's. If you like the \\"Laid Back\\" album,much of this is in that style. It's great that all the rarities are on these discs and it is well worth your time. There are stripped down versions of Both solo and Allman Brothers songs here so this is very worthwhile and highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must get (If you can find it)","review":"This CD set was released in 1997 then withdrawn quickly due to legal problems with Greg Allman and others.It's a shame because it's a lovingly produced set that contains many demo's and classic songs Greg recorded during his solo career.A must get if you can find one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One More Try Seems Like a Lot More Than That","review":"I love the mellow, rhythmic miracles from Gregg Allman's unreleased, secret solos. In this CD, you can hear him become. You can hear his pain, his struggles, his love, his passion, his angst. Full of internal struggles, this heartfelt, kind & blessed musician, puts a current spin on EVERY TRACK he records. I don't feel I am listening to something written years ago--or recorded years ago. Maybe that is part of what I gained from living & being born in America. Maybe it is a BIG PART what a true musician can do for us. Make us FEEL. I feel $200 would not have been too much for a CD I never get tired of because it has MUCH variety,talent, depth. This is music from the King of Southern Rock I can feel deep down in my Grinchiest heart anytime of the day or night. I LOVE it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Of This Collection","review":"I will not delve into the movies themselves but rather into the quality of the three films included in this collection. \\"The Ghost Goes West\\" is perhaps the best print of the three leaving \\"The 39 Steps\\" and \\"The Count Of Monte Cristo\\" as rather poor renditions. They are both dark and not well presented. To say they were in anyway restored, would be to misinform. I have seen a better print of \\"The Count Of Monte Cristo\\" on VHS tape.Criterion did a fantastic restoration of \\"The 39 Steps\\" leaving this version far beneath it.This collection is only worth the asking price if you really want \\"The Count Of Monte Cristo\\" on DVD no matter what the quality of the print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"The quality of the movies is the worst I have ever seen on a DVD.

The movie is colorized, apparently by a kindergartener with crayons. Blotches of pink and orange for faces and a torch which burns with green, orange, and yellow flames are evidence that the colorizing process was done in a haphazard manner with no concern for the quality of the job. The movie itself is quite good although I personnaly prefer the Richard Chamberlain version. 2 stars for a really bad print of a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Having read the book and having a DVD with Richard Chamberlaine in the principl role, I was interested in securing this older edition, i.e.1934 B/W movie.Though the acting was predictable (better than fair), the producer/writers took liberty with the story line. (As in the R. Chamberlaine edition. Tsk, tsk.)For instance: an opening scene on board between the captain and young Edmund.A disappointment in the story presentation: it was assumed that the viewer(s) understood the length of time spent as prisoners/co-conspirators to develop Edmund's education/preparation before the dramatic escape. And the underwater sequence was well done.Background music was... worse than poor.The 1934 movie edition does show the ancient process for sending messages across great expanses of water, etc. therby enabling the Count to confuse his enemies.Generally, the movie presentation assumed viewers knew the story and would fill-in the blanks.However, I was glad to secure this 1934 movie of a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Count of Monte Cristo [VHS] - Robert Donat","review":"This is a grate story they should have left well enough along ,they colorize the movies should have left it in the original black and white format didn't turn out very good.

This book contains assorted lists (for example, '5 Scandals That Rocked Art') classified into 15 major subjects ('Art History' to 'Religion'). Each entry in a list is followed by a paragraph; the lists average 2 pages each.The book is fun but not as funny as the authors seem to think. A few lists are horribly trite (e.g. '3 Rock Gods Who Died At 27') and some are mere opinion ('7 Classic TV Episodes That Should Be Sent into Space to Demonstrate to Aliens What We Earthlings Call 'Funny'').The 'Fake Your Way Through A Conversation' sidebars are witty and the page layout is attractive.

I'm not an expert on every subject the book covers but the subjects I do know are sprinkled with inaccuracies here and there. The biggest animal, the blue whale, is described as a \\"vegetarian\\" that eats plankton. First, some plankton are animals and not plants (or algae to be specific) and second, whales don't eat them anyway. They eat krill, which are tiny crustaceans. That's one example.

There are some decent songs on here but it's really nothing special. Nothing new or exciting. In fact, I'm inclined to say this is total garbage when compared to Nihil or Xtort, which were both fantastic albums. And umm... can you really say they're based in Germany when the German fellows left (or whatever) and the \\"Kaptin\\" seems to have a Russian name? Anyway, if you are thinking about buying this as your first KMFDM album (which i doubt since they're just milking old fans for money and not bringing many new ones on at this point) don't. Buy some GOOD KMFDM like Nihil, Xtort, Money, Angst or \\"Symbols\\" instead to see what KMFDM really was, and should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"KMFDM is back, better than ever before","review":"I am a longtime KMFDM fan, since the late eighties, and my favorite albums are Angst and Money. Hau Ruck has just bumped those two and become my number one. Although I loved the last few KMFDM efforts, I didn't feel they were their best. This is their best. Hau Ruck is an amazing album, every song is good (which face it, most albums have a song or two you have to skip through). Lucia's voice is beautiful and clear, and the band works together like a well oiled machine. I am totally blown away by this album. If this is the dawn of the new KMFDM, I can't wait to see what the future holds."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treat for the freaks!","review":"It was Monday that I got Hau Ruck in the mail. As soon as I popped it open I slapped it in the stereo and blasted it for all to hear and enjoy. And enjoy I did. The rhythms were fresh, the lyrics were very true to life, and as original and in-your-face as ever. I have to say, for all the die-hard Legioneers, this was the best album yet. Lucia, Jules, Sashca, Andy, and Steve all performed at their personal bests, and seeing this album performed live might be the best concert experience yet. For al those who haven't bought this jewel, please do.

Great guitars and that lovely Ultra Heavy Beat give you that heave ho' the Kapt'n wanted to deliver.I feel that since this album has come together so well without all the original members (and Watts... who is missed) that KMFDM once again prove they're the best.Any review that states this cd is the worst in KMFDM's ever growing catalog (May 9 of '06 we will see the release of Ruck Zuck) well that reviewer has never heard ADIOS... or has heard it but deliberatly forgot every track but DIY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet CD.","review":"I liked WWIII and hated Attak but love this cd.

The songs are interesting. I've never heard another singer write or sing songs like these. They are like little stories that she brings to life. This is a worthwhile compilation worth seeking out as it contains her albums JOSHUA and COAT OF MAN COLORS. Both are from 1971 and they contain songs that are very singer/songwriter, even though she writes most of her music, there's something special about these songs.

It sounds like a really bad slayer rip off. And it doesn't seem like it bears any likeness to thier original swede-metal sound that is still existant on Uprising. Alot of people will enjoy the polished sound of the production here but really it doesn't suit this album because the songs are so redundant and generic by this band's standards. Because the sound is so clean here it makes the music not seem so heavy. Morning Star does offer a more 'metal' sound of material here than their other most recent albums (Same Difference, Uprising.) Still, this is the worst Entombed album I've heard. I suggest you buy THE HAUNTED 'ONE KILL WONDER' or even one of the new SLAYER albums ... instead of this uninspired [garbage]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard...","review":"The production is too polished here making the album sound more 'metal' but the songs are too redundant and generic.

That album is what Morning Star should have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of emtombed","review":"This album has a unique death metal energy.It is the best album that Entombed every made.It is very jokery satanic.

Now, they are more of a Stoner Type Death Band, or as they call, Death Roll. This format has worked on some of their albums such as Uprising and Inferno, but they have all had their share of filler, and have fallen short of 5star efforts such as the first two masterpieces. \\"Morning Star\\" is a much more brutal force of Death Roll, and even though its not quite the same sound as Left Hand Path and Clandestein, it still manages to kick you in the teeth almost the whole way through. I only found myself skipping over one or two tracks, and the rest is a sonic blast to the skull. I dont think that they will ever be able to top this 2002 effort, nor will they ever return to the format of pure death metal, so this one is a keeper..ENJOY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I strongly recommend this cd to anyone that is a fan of Jeff Foxworthy.

I loved the way the characters and their interactions were developed throughout the story. Although not a lengthy book, the author achieved real depth quickly and easily with her narrative. The Last Days of Dogtown simply did not have the same depth. The story seemed very disjointed; there is no real beginning and no definitive end. Although some of the vinettes of the various characters were interesting, the compilation of the whole was somewhat pointless.

However, I can't help but be disappointed in The Last Days Of Dogtown when I remember how much I loved The Red Tent. While the latter contains so much depth, so many layers, The Last Days of Dogtown is quite shallow and ultimately unsatisfying.

This is tuneless -- in fact, the songwriters seem to have this in common with their peers, in that they do not know what a melody is or what it is supposed to do. Fortunately for them, neither does one in a thousand listeners. What a sad state to which musical culture has fallen, when this is championed as something rare and special. but then again, what isn't these days?

It vibrates and leaves a nice space in your head when it's over. I've never heard them before and don't listen to indie music (if that's the category this falls in). To tell you the truth, I'm 45 and don't know what to buy anymore. If I had to describe this album in 3 words i'd say: intelligent, hopeful, and happy. I liked it straight out of the box and it continues to grow on me. Some of the songs are like breathing, they just fill me up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trying to make it last for hours","review":"This album is a married man up at 3 in the morning staring at photos of his coworker's sister on Facebook without feeling particularly bad about it. It's one of the most mature, romantic pieces of pop music I've ever heard -- not to go all High Fidelity on you, but I guess everyone has theirs -- and I don't even like the rest of the band's output all that much.Half the album pretends not to be building towards their cover of \\"You Can Have It All.\\" The other half helps you relax afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disappointing...","review":"I admit, after hearing 'From A Motel 6' (on the Painful album)and 'Madeline' from this one, I was seriously anticipating getting aCD from this band. Needless to say, since I was somewhat unfamiliar with this band (...)..I hoped that this was not one of those bands where that 'one' song would be the best one on the CD. Well unfortunately, it was.However, I do not think that this band does not have promise. They do. I have a sense that with this band when they are hot..Ouch! when they are cold..Brrr! I would also like to say that it is quite possible that Yo La Tengo is the type of band where one album wouldn't agree with you and that another one of their's would. Hit or Miss. Geez, they have like eleven to chose from anyways, right?So if I ever find myself with (enough money) again (She says with \\"bunny-ears\\" from her pockets), then I will take another chance on this group. Possibly with 'Painful' because it seems to have a sort of direction and mood that this album lacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"bitter sweet but not the best","review":"YLT has delivered again.

I felt he rushed thru \\"Polk Salad Annie\\", but I think he sometimes may get tired of playing that, but his audience expects it, and I think he wanted to, in a way, get it over with and play some more intracate guitar songs.

It reminds me a lot of both \\"Kristin Lavransdatter\\" by Sigrid Undset and \\"An Independent People\\" by Haldor Laxness. Both were outstanding, award-winning books in their time. Another of my favorites that comes to mind is \\"The Greenlanders\\" by Jane Smiley. That puts Solveig Torvik in outstanding company. I think of all of these as Norse sagas. That's probably not technically correct, but you get the idea.These and \\"Nicholai's Fortune\\" are all historical novels which depict the struggle to survive in very harsh social, economic and climatic conditions.

The narrative was interesting, but often I had a hard time connecting with her experiences and translating them to my life. The exercises at the end of each chapter, however, were very useful and thought-provoking.

I loved Latin American cooking and if I ate in my adulthood as I did as a child, I would probably have died of a heart attack by age 40.

The psychological drama involved is enough, in and of itself, to discourage any involvement in the lifestyle, if it is a true representation of events. The video had sub-zero sex-appeal, and did absolutely nothing to touch on the deep fantasies surrounding swinging.What a sorry excuse for a documentary!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best example","review":"Whereas the events being portrayed are obviously happening and while its quite certain that there are, undoubtedly, many people who use sex as a means to harm others, I found the couples being focused on FAR too mentally/emotionally messed up to deal with the issue at hand - swinging.Swinging becomes the backdrop for the distorted view of a few, odd, practitioners. If these sorts of people were a \\"type\\" that dominated swinging, nobody would ever take it up.This DVD is ineffective as a view into the lifestyle and even less gratifying as sexual stimulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Swinging Couples","review":"James and Theresa are enthusiastic seekers of sex with as many different people as possible. They seem secure in their relationship and happy with the \\"alternative lifestyle\\" they have chosen. In contrast, Calvin, Julie and Sara are a diaster waiting to happen. Jealousy is rampant and Sara obviously feels like the \\"third wheel\\". In the case of the third couple, Gerard seems happy with swinging. But Shannon worries about it being immoral and setting a bad example for their son.This documentary is neither promoting swinging nor preaching against it. Rather it's a non-judgemetal attempt to show the real life effects of having multiple sex partners. In two cases swinging clearly has some negative consequences, while in the third the couple seems to have found a way to fulfill their sexual fantsies while maintaining a stable relationship.I found it to be a fascinating look at love, sex and relationships which is both entertaining and insightful.

If you are among those of us who like to get off the Interstates occasionally and don't believe your regular map is good enough, pick some of these up. This got used during a recent trip when the uncle wanted to hit Ohio of all places. I have family in Cincy and he wanted to come back through KY. Good thing I had this.

I found this Kentucky map to have a lot of roads not listed were there and roads listed that weren't there, especially in the Daniel Boone National Forest and Big South Fork areas that I visited.

Great release for lovers of Underoath when they were hardcore."},{"rating":"2","title":"underOATH does it again...","review":"While not as heavy or as abrasive, or even as good as their previous works, this is still an amazing album super charged with emotion. underOATH shows that they can do emo-core just as well as black-core. Emotionally powered hardcore has never sounded this good. This is better than Dead Poetic and Beloved. This is definately a must have for hardcore, emo, and metalcore kids. A must BUY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what?","review":"I thought Underoath was a metalcore band... not Jimmy Eat World with distortion and screaming. Ohhhh, they lost the most talented member (ex-guitarist now) and they went melodic. I wanted to like this record, i really did. But after listening to it numerous times, i cant find many good factors about it. His vocals arent quite the same, i guess him getting older changed the depth and tone of it a bit. He also does WAY WAY WAY too much speaking. and what? They only play cheap ripped-off emo parts and octave chords? Like i said, the talented guitarist left the band. The drumming is still solid, but the keyboards are so annoying they cant be redeemed. The one and only thing i can truely say is good about this cd, is the drummers clean singing in the first track.

In a nutshell, for those of you who don't know about the show, it was about 2 cousins and a friend who re-claimed antiques that were cursed and sold by the cousins' mad uncle Lewis Vendredi. Sounds cheesy, but it was great! And the music was really cool! Fred Mollin does music for a lot of other Canadian shows (i.e. \\"Forever Knight,\\"), and he's really talented. I listen to this CD when I write sometimes because it helps me tune into a certain mood I sometimes look to convey in a story. If you're a fan, what are you waiting for?? If you're not a fan, you'll probably like the music a lot. It's unusual, but certainly not at all boring!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordinary book","review":"This has got to be THE best non-fiction book I have ever read. Truly a work of genius. I could not believe how much Mr. Graham had gone through making this trip. I espesially like how some of the most frivilous things and thoughts and Ideas were left in the book, it just made the mood even more enjoyable. Being a sailor myself, I really understand the technical aspects, and my girlfriend loved it even though she is not a sailor, truly this is a book for anyone with a mind for adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I first read this book soon after its original release in the 1970s. It inspired me then, and was equally inspiring when I recently reread it before passing it on to my teenaged daughter.

The \\"meet Patti, in love, go sailing, miss Patti, at next port write to Patti, still miss Patti, at next port meet Patti...\\" theme is a bit repetitive but realistic for a lonely romantic teenager. More details of personal conflicts and thoughts would have been good, as would more technical detail. But all the same it is an inspiring and interesting read, and Robin Graham is to be congratulated for sharing his story with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"My son was bored to death by this book. He had to read it for his summer reading requirements at school."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was ok","review":"I am in a 7th grade interdiplisenary class and we read the book DOVE. I thought it was an ok book. i can understand why it is not so good though, this author was not experienced. I am not very in to auto-biographies, so that is why. But other people's opinions differ and a lot of other people say it was a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boy who sailed around the world alone on Dove","review":"I'm in 7th grade and i read this book for my ID (Geodraphy & L. Arts) class. It is a very fun class and my teachers are very nice. This book is about a boy that is 16 yrs old and he sails around the world in a sloop named Dove. I only recommend this book if you like sailing and storms. These are the reasons why I don't like this book that much. My teachers love it. Each table has a chapter to do a project and our group did chapter 7. I liked the culture of South Africa. It is cool"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dove","review":"I found Dove, a memoir of a 15 year old who travels around the world in a boat, an extremely poor-written, dull book.Of course memoirs are not the best books on earth, but the author's writing style was dry and immature. For example, Graham uses the word \\"weird\\" about three times in one chapter. There is almost no emotion in this book; the author for the better part of Dove tells about where he went, what the scenery was, and about the natives of each country. The only central characters in the story are himself and his young love, Patti. The love story between Robin and Patti seemed to me very drawn-out and surprisingly dull. All the while, the author still could not tell his story in a way that might make me care about him and Patti.If you are interested in reading a book about a boy's naive, incorrect views of the world and about some so-and-so girl he meets, read this book. If you're interested in something well written, steer clear of this memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, captivating, great youth book for both boys&girls","review":"The emotional challenges, and the physical adventure that Robin Graham lived are extremely well told and captivating. What makes it even more special, is that it is true. I would like to order this in German for my cousin."},{"rating":"2","title":"great adventure story of courage and independence","review":"Many people fantasize about a fantanstic adventure yet very few have the courage to follow their heart and actually embark on the journey.

Buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very special regional history","review":"The collaborative work of Bill Beck and C. Patrick Labadie, Pride Of The Inland Seas: An Illustrated History Of The Port Of Duluth-Superior is a very special and enthusiastically recommended regional history that begins with coming of the French-Canadian voyageurs who struck inland from Lake Superior to engage in the fur trade of the 1600s, down through three centuries of political, economic, technological, and social history of what would become the Duluth-Superior twin-port communities as a maritime gateway to the iron ore, coal, grain, and timber of the upper midwest. Superbly enhanced with a profusion of photography, authors Beck and Labadie lace this unique history with the personal stories of the entrepreneurs who were to forge the Great Lakes commerce into the fabric of American economic and westward expansion history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must if You Like Ships, the Great Lakes, or US History","review":"A wonderful find. This is not a dry history book and it's not just for those who are interested in Duluth and Superior.If you find yourself awed by the ships you see on the Great Lakes, you'll love the book. If you're interested in the stories of the mining, lumber, fishing, and shipping industries, you'll love the book. If your family has a history in the Northern MN or WI area, the book will add a personal depth to your knowledge of what times were like back then.Just looking at the photos (some of which are very unique and must have been very difficult to find) and reading their captions is very interesting and worth the price of the book. The short one or two page snapshots of a certain person, ship, etc. that are spaced throughout the book are great, too. And the text itself is informative and not the typical slightly boring stuff you find in \\"History of ...\\" types of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disapointing Sequel","review":"Although this sequel was eagerly awaited, it did not live up to its expectations. 'The Ocean Within\\" chronicled real human emotion, but Tides existed merely to point out that families break up. Caldwell failed to portray her characters as realistically as in the prequel, and was often sidetracked by her theme of environmental conservation. All of this detracted from the substance of the book. However, I'm sure we can expect better works from this author in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"elegant and lovely","review":"Just like the title, just that i wish i could move the main part because the necklace can look crocked easily if its not hooked in the right hole...but great investment and very lovely box"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good 1925 Jazz story","review":"Although not extraordinary, it is a pleasant simple story of a group of Jazz players trying to surviveduring the \\"gangsters\\" period.

Webb loved 20s jazz and that is reflected in the terrific soundtrack and meticulous attention to period detail in every frame (wonderful Cinemascope production design!). Ella sings as only she can and acts as only she couldn't; Peggy Lee's heartbreaking performance as a torch singer on the skids was rightfully nominated for an Oscar (and oh yeah - \\"she sings\\"). This was one of the ten top-grossers of 1955, just behind \\"East of Eden,\\" and its not available ten years into the DVD era?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"American midwest roadhouse heaven","review":"Jack's the greatest. If you are not an American, Jack's your American icon, circa 1955. And you can't really argue with his friends Peggy Lee, Ella, and Miff Mole (it's his band that's featured). Other viewers and critics remark upon the versimiltude, but this misses the point; Jack captures the jazz myth. I don't care if this is the way it was; it's enough--more than enough--that this is the way I imagined it was. Jack reached into my imagination and put a part of it on screen. Wow-ow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A fizzler","review":"I liked the beginning of the book but felt it fizzled out half way through. Nothing really made sense and I felt the ending was very trite.

He keeps a mistress, and makes appointments with his 'lost love' and she accepts everyhing. He seems to know how satisfy a woman but doesn't care to use this knowledge with his wife. You call this romance?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is a well written book with wonderful photography. The selection of jewellery owners for each of the categories specified was thoughtful with some less well know, but nevertheless interesting collectors, included. The only shortfall was the absence of collectors from the Orient and the East - this would have been unique and given the book an extra star.The book is a good complement to John Traina's hard to get \\"Extraordinary Jewels\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo, Berlioz!","review":"This is a cute little story. Berlioz is late for a concert and having trouble with his double bass to boot (a strange and unwanted buzzing noise accompanies his playing). The bandwagon gets stuck in a pot hole and the draft donkey just won't budge. A series of animals in increasing order of size and strength--from a rooster to an ox--think they are the solution, but all fail to move the donkey. In a surprising twist we discover the source of Berlioz' bass's buzzing and the donkey suddenly finds motivation. As a result, they make it on time and we learn that the ability to effect change does not always depend on size and strength. Very nicely illustrated. Each lavish page is framed with marginal drawings which show you the country folk gathering at the village in preparation for Berlioz' concert. This is a nice touch and heightens the drama. There's something almost Aesopian about this delightful book. Highly recommended; a great bed-time story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darn Good Illustrations and a Nice Story Too","review":"I've never heard the name Berlioz before reading this book. Oh well, that's no big deal. Berlioz proves to be a likeable guy, even though he doesn't really do anything. He doesn't come up with a great plan to save the day or anything. In fact, he CAUSES the conflict of the story. You see, he's all worried about the performance he and his band have to give and he's not paying attention to the road. He's lucky he doesn't run a stop sign and get hit by a train. Instead he get stuck in a pothole. A bunch of folks offer to help pull him out but no one succeeds. Then a little bee ends up saving the day. And that seems to be the story of Berlioz the Bear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works and it's sturdy","review":"The does the job, and it's tough enough to just toss into a back pack, camera bag and won't get creased. It's almost like a plastic and with it's size it fills the frame on my D50 when I hold it at arms length. Comes with a lanyard that features a clip, which I don't use. I use the card, and throw it back in the bag don't know why anyone would want to cary around their neck. Nice thought, though. I'll probally use the lanyard for something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Classroom Use","review":"I've been using this map (multiple copies) in my classroom during my class' New York City unit for the past several years. It is perfect for our needs, though it only shows half of Manhattan on each side, so it is not great for display purposes. We also take it with us when we visit the City on our class trip and it is perfect for walking/riding around - very clear and easy to read.Good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!","review":"New Author Nedra M.

He's the type of guy I would want to have in my life in the future.I also liked the relationship between Shelby,Kyme,and Tracie. They always supported each others' drama by keeping it real.

The ending is profound and was utterly sad and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster","review":"The DVD came to me into a broken case and al the special features weren't subtitled.I'm thinking of the poor people with hearing problems.The movie was very good but you cannot pack it with so many gifts it these gifts cannot be unwrapped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believer in Brilliance","review":"Powerful and profound, this character study of autophobia is superior stuff! As the ultimate self-hating Jew, the protagonist plunges himself into the slime of nazism while enduring the throes of a spiraling struggle with his Hebrew heritage and Orthodox upbringing. Desperately seeking some outlet for his frustration, he moves from respectable society to the fascist elite to the scum of the skinhead underworld--and the result is a movie of mesmerizing dimensions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Believer changed my view of myself and Jewishness","review":"I've never been involved in Judaism or Jewish affairs. But The Believer has changed that. I'm not suddenly a convert and The Believer isn't prosyletizing. The movie simply explores a character who is deeply troubled, untangling his binds and asking how they turn him back to ideas he once renounced. Though the background and renunciation are particular and extreme--a Jew who becomes a Nazi--the essential struggle is not. Anyone who feels themselves a host of paradoxes and incosistencies could find in this movie a character to sympathize with."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing film","review":"this movie blew me away.....i didn't expect the mental and emotional anguish that was so very raw. (does it get more raw?)the exploration of Danny's wrestling with G-d, Jewish history, and loathing (personal and social)in the context of white supremacy was incredibly profound. Ryan Gosling truly nailed the part. I found myself knowing very well the questions with which Danny struggled and the earnest and visceral search for resolution. Danny is very cerebral and very visceral. How amazing one can yearn for integrity filled with intense disdain and loathing.

It's refreshing to read a travel memoir that gets past the stereotypes to relate what's truly special about Ireland and its people.This book is a must read for anyone who has ever longed to leave the familiar to take on new challenges and adventures.

The book makes me want to get back there soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your lucky enough to be Irish..your lucky enough!","review":"For those who treasure their Irish heritage, Jaywalking with the Irish is a dream come true. David Monagan describes his families life in Ireland and their first hand experiences with the changes in the Irish standard of living, and the \\"Celtic Tiger\\".

Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story of Americans in Ireland","review":"What can I say? I like Ireland and I like travel literature, and I liked this book! I did think that the family must have been well-off financially, because many Americans who make the move overseas are unable to live as this family does, in a interesting, large home--not a mansion, but definitely a comfortable, well-located house.

I have augmented the kit with a few thicker, more absorbent pads for bad cuts and a couple of hemostats. The tweezers and scissors that come with it lack some strenght and dexterity, but some items from your local superstore can bump this kit up significantly.

Yes, super glue, learned this little trick while in the Marines and it works great for closing small cuts.I like the soft pack, easy to stuff it inside a bag or in a vehicle compartment.

This CD is up there with \\"Celestial\\" and \\"Oceanic\\"(although they are more epic and groundbreaking, and should be listened to first), and, as an ISIS fan, I really don't know any better music than this.

I'm sure Franklin intended the orgy of blood, violence, perversion, sadism, etc. etc. to make a larger point, ... I just missed it.To me, it was like a really bad B-movie, maybe like the \\"chain saw massacre\\" thing, just not as clean, wholesome, or compassionate.According to the list of positive reviews listed inside the cover, a bunch of critics apparently hailed this as fine, cutting-edge literary something. I thought it was preposterous. I might have felt differently if there had been a shred of plausibility, but this was all so over-the-top, I couldn't really buy into any of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and warped","review":"After I read a short story, 'Poached', by this author I was so impressed with how he described living in the rural South, I thought I'd investigate His novels. Smonk is an unusual anti-hero, a warped creature who exibits psychopathic behavior and has no belief system. He does exactly what he pleases at all times without any reguard for societal constraints. Strangely likeable for all that. I like Franklin's writing style because he makes me beleive the Old West was exactly as he depicts and makes me grateful I can experience it through his writing and not personal experience. The Old West seemed really crummy, peopled with lots of Smonks."},{"rating":"2","title":"different","review":"I kept wondering where he was going.

I found this book to be disgusting. I am by far no prude. This book was foul. Franklin tried to rely on shock value to entertain and in that he succeeded. I read the preamble before I purchased this book on my Kindle. I found this review to be highly misleading. I like blood and guts and graphic description as well or more so than most. But there was no rhyme or reason for Franklin to be so sickening with his descriptions for it added nothing to the story. I deleted it before the fourth chapter.

For any of you who love Giuffria, this is an absolute must! It is like finding a 3rd Giuffria album. All but 4 of the 13 tracks are done by the band from the \\"Silk and Steel\\" album. It even encludes a few tracks from the 1st House of Lords album that was slated to be the 3rd Giuffria release before Gene Simmons forced David Glen Eisley out of the band. Now you can hear how these songs should have sounded. If you have never heard this or his \\"Stranger\\" CD, you need to check them out, they truly are amazing. I could not recomend them more!

Beginning with an chapter on why there is disagreement on the nature of Fascism, Thurlow proceeds to give paragraph-long descriptions of some major theories on it. He seems to lean towards Fascism as a \\"stillborn revolution\\" whenever he discusses the fascist aspects of of Italy and Germany, but this is the least satisfying theory of them all. Thurlow does not distinguish between Fascism in theory and Fascism in practice, and thus has a great deal of difficulty saying anything about it. This book seems written in order to round out the series, rather than to actually be used by anyone who knows enough about Fascism to be interested in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not receive the pakage","review":"I ordered the dummy knob and i think they shipped it to the wrong address and they wont admit it and i'm too busy to follow up.Bad experience with this seller (KB Hardware)"},{"rating":"1","title":"useless junk","review":"It doesn't work.

It still have some good joint on here though, like \\"Celcius\\" and \\"Mizery.\\" Another thing is, is that this cd is VERY rare and out of print, so the best bet is to order it off the internet, but of course it's gonna be at a hight price.

This CD is really hard to find, it's not on the shelves hardly anywhere, but if you can find it definitely get it.

If it wasn't for the track \\"questions\\" on Calm Before the Storm, I would make this one #2.

Even better was on page 448 when \\"Hugh le Despenser and William la Zouche had allowed their horses to slow down so that the ladies were astride them.\\" My, my. I guess it kind of works, if you use the definition of \\"astride\\" as \\"on either side of\\"; but it's a little startling when you first read it. Would I read it again? No. Would I recommend it?

I do not mind when novels are historically inaccurate but my issue with this book is that it reads more like a history book than a novel. The characters are completely one dimensional even the main character, Eleanor. There is nothing new that I learned from this book, nor was there an attempt at explaining any of their motivations except to use the stereotypical Thomas of Lancaster was an evil bully, King Edward was weak and silly, and Queen Isabelle was the \\"She-Wolf\\".It made the entire time period, so rich with potential, dull!

Though it contains the bulk of historical fact from the time period, that is the only positive thing I can say. The fiction part of the book is unbelievably juvenile, with characters making unlikely speeches and/or abruptly changing attitudes or personalities with no explanation. It seriously undermines the work and makes it intolerable to read through.

Between a king and his male lover, an incestuous relationship and a woman supposedly married to two men, readers will be left wondering how so much could happen to just one person.Lady Despenser, the main character, is portrayed as naive yet strong.

I could not stop reading, my husband was lucky to get fed. Telling us about Edward and his many relatives from the point of view of his beloved niece, Eleanor, was brilliant. Even though the book was quite long, I was never bored and felt that the author had tirelessly researched her subjects and yet she made everyone come beautifully to life.

I do enjoy historical fiction, which is why I chose this book to begin with, and it seemed the author did her homework. However, the first half was so difficult to muddle through that I was very very close to drop it and stop reading. I found the writing did not flow. There were a lot of characters that seemed superfluous and all the similar names made it confusing to follow. I thought that her transition between events was choppy and many times I wondered why that section was in there in the first place. I enjoyed the last half better, as Eleanor was going through more events that made her character grow slightly, and as I didn't have to read about the King and Hugh moving from one place first, then another, and then another.This wouldn't be a book I'd re-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID NOT FINISH IT - NOT A GOOD READ","review":"I love historical fiction like so many of us and was really looking forward to reading about a time and king that I knew little about. But this book turned out to be a thinly veiled, poorly written attempt to put sad, ineffectual characters in some kind of good light - it seemed the author worked way to hard to make Hugh's wife seem like not such an idiot and while I have no qualms about homesexuality, there was so much in the first part of the book it made me not want to continue. None of the characters were believable or endearing which made the history in the book uninteresting. I sure hope there was never a female really as blindly stupid as Hugh's wife.

A couple years ago, this set was one of the best you could buy and came highly recommended by many of the gaming sites I visited for comparison shopping. I have recently purchased a system that's completely top-notch with a Ghz processor and needed a great set of speakers for a low price. These perform beyond my expectations.I haven't had any problems with radio interferance, but as a few others have reported the problem it's something to keep in mind. Also, the bass isn't the best, but for everyday uses such as watching DVD movies, playing games, and listening to music (which I do for hours daily) these speakers do a fine job. I personally love the sound quality coming from such small speakers, and for this price you won't find anything this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Value speakers at this price","review":"Well too be honest these speakers are a pure bargain at this price and are probably better than the more expensive products.

I figured anything would be better. Well,these are better sounding,but just added new problems. First off,I knew these would not be audiophile quality,but the first MP3 I put on to test them,showed the subwoofer can not handle much bass. It was popping with the volume low. Terrible. The other problem I had,is the volume control. I can deal with the stupid design,but it has a short in it,and I have to keep wiggling it to get sound from both satellites. If you are looking for just a cheap pair of speakers,these are the ones to get. For the price I paid,it is not really worth the time and effort to mail em back,etc.. I'll just have to deal with new problems after dealing with the old ones.. I'd shop around."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"Pros: low price, decent sound, unobtrusive, easy to set up. Unlike some 3 or 5-piece systems, the PC Works bass unit is shielded, in case you ever need to put it close to your monitor.Cons: though it seems a bit silly to complain that a $50 set of speakers offers less than perfect sound reproduction -- heck, I've spent far more than that on speaker wire -- the \\"subwoofer\\" in this set is not really a subwoofer at all. It's a woofer, and exhibits a rather uneven frequency response. Still, the sound is fine for games and most Internet music content.As long as you aren't expecting them to sound like a good pair of living room speakers -- don't believe the hype on the box -- you probably won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Secondary System","review":"I have these speakers in my kitchen hooked up to an old Sony Walkman CD player (the one that weighs about a pound and has a remote control). It sounds fantastic. I listen to a range of music from Kate Bush to Mozart's Requiem to Squirrel Nut Zippers and they all sound amazingly good. I don;t think you're going to find anything in speakers anywhere near this price that will compare. Placement of the woofer is important, and don;t be afraid to LOWER the woofer output a bit, especially at louder volumes. As I have this in my kitchen it is used for background music, but I have played them loud enough to really fill the room.

As far as sound goes I thought they were far more than serviceable.

Great price, nice sound, ugly packaging, but a definite recommendation overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent \\"Value\\" Speakers","review":"I give these speakers my strongest endorsement. While the maxim \\"you get what you pay for\\" is generally true, I felt I got *way* more than my money's worth with these.The sound quality is amazing, especially for the money.

It is not even a station I like! The tech people sent many suggestions, none of which have helped. Essentially, there are too many wires, as the volume control has a seperate loop all to itself (as opposed to being part of one of the speakers). Too bad, because the sound is excellent for the price. Unfortunately, it has to compete with a loud, scratchy radio signal which ruins the effect. The tech support people seemed to know about this - makes one wonder..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these speakers!","review":"Everytime the speakers are plugged in and the power is on, I pick up distortion -either a small crackling sound or a low level radio signal. So anytime I play stuff with these speakers, I can still hear that low level sound. I had to completely disconnect the left speaker because it was picking up a radio station even when the volume was at its lowest. These speakers are NOT Cambridge Soundworks quality.

There is a very useful section at the back of the book about 'hurricane facts'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting","review":"I bought this novel in the same book as 'No Man's Mistress', and let's just say i'ts going to take alot for me to get to THAT story. I couldn't find anything to like about ANY of the characters in this book - they were all just blahh... I found myself skimming the pages at the end of the book because it was just silly. Now i'm all one for the big drama at the end - hero feels betrayed, mentally hurts the heroine, hero begs for forgiveness, heroine makes him sweat.... then happily ever after... but it just didn't feel heartfelt, like it was written without any thought... Makes me wonder if I read the same book as everyone else. - My verdict... don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Regency ...","review":"The story is interesting, recommended if you LOVE regency or this author. I just found it to be typical regency.When the couple got together they were corny. The 1st love scene was so tacky -- with paragraphs of dialogue and mumbo jumbo breaking up the lovemaking.

The heroine is likable, but the hero is so cold that it makes you think who would want to end up with him. I even wanted Jane to end up with one of his friends.

I paid much more for the wrap around filters as well. I found that in my particular coffee pot (Farberware Yosemite) these disc filters are superior for both simplicity and price to the wrap arounds. 2400 pots of coffee at less than a penny each pot for the filter works for me. You might see a few grounds in the pot depending on the grind. I grind my beans fairly fine from whole bean, and I use a coffee strainer for the pour.

Even with less coffee, only 4 scoops, the brew basket overflowed and washed a lot of the grounds out the top. With other pots they may work but not the Presto 12 cup. Too bad - the wrap around filters are a pain.Amazon only sent 1 pack of 100 filters. When notified they refunded the money for the filters they didn't send. This worked out in my favor because of the above. I am glad I don't have 2400 filters that don't work in the pot - 100 is plenty.

Unfortunately the author uses repetition to drive home a point which could have been easily deduced from reading the title of the book. Each example is portrayed as a deviously crafted plot by either management, the banks or both to deliberately enter into the 'safe haven' of the Bankruptcy Courts. No regard was given to the high probability that each of the companies would not have survived as a going concern. In fact the author offers up economically impractical solutions that each company could have implemented to avoid bankruptcy. On the plus side, the middle three chapters offer a good historic overview of the Texaco, John Manville and Continental filings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"The author should have stuck with sociology or at least taken an accounting class before writing this book.

They cost less than many speaker sets you'll find that don't even include a subwoofer. The only thing I don't like is that they don't have rubber pads on the bottom to keep them from sliding around.

I get a constant BUZZZING sound coming from the subwoofer/amp. I've been able to reduce the noise by fiddling with the bass adjustment but this doesn't completely eliminate this annoyance. Unlike with another reviewer this problem is unlikely to be fixed by adjusting my sound card properties since it BUZZES even when I disconnect the speakers from the sound card output.

The setting them up was a breeze. The sound is good for listening to MP3s and playing games.

Alternating between different voices, the characters chart their lives, the mistakes they've made and the pain they've caused one another. Mixing in age-old Irish myths of the sea and the mermaids who dwell there, the author weaves a moving and highly entertaining narrative that had me pressing this book upon my friends and family and longing to be by the sea. An impressive debut novel, I look forward to watching the author's growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but disappointing","review":"I loved _In the Country of the Young_, and expected a similar tale of magic, ghosts, and love to be found in _The Mermaids Singing_. Instead, this is a book with beautiful writing and almost no plot. It consists mostly of the reminiscences of three generations of women who go around acting nasty to one another, and seeking meaningless sex. I couldn't connect with any of the characters or make myself care about their situations.

I look forward to Ms Carey's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Myths Just Aren't Enough","review":"The Mermaids Singing had so much promise. The author is a poet at heart, using language skillfully, but needs help in character development. It was really hard to see where one character ended and another began. Grace and Grainne were so focused on sex that their lives became meaningless and self-centered. The images of the sea and mermaids was beautifully done, but one wonders why the author didn't take more time in adding depth to the characters so that they were believable. The book did not live up to its promise, even with all the lovely images."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this book was captivating and extremely dramatic!!","review":"The Mermaids Singing was an excellent novel, one of the best I've read. Lisa Carey, a new novelist, has definetly proved herself a good writer. From the time I picked up the book I could not put it down, that's how good it was. I love the fact on how detailed she was with the event that went on from the memories, to the mermaids voices, the the extremely sexual scenes. Being a 16 year old I recommend this book from any age group above 13. I almost cried in this book it is almost so real to life but at the same time so mythical which think is fascinating aspect in any novel.

I think that it's a really touching story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and dull","review":"What a dissapoinment! I purchased this book because of the comparison to Cold Mountain on the back cover. The fact that both books are first novels for their respective authors is the only thing I can find to compare between the two novels. The prose is elementary when compared to that of Charles Frazier, completely lacking in the imagery I expected. I agree with other reviewers in their opinion of Grace, but would take it one step further. None of these women seem to know what love between mother and daughter is all about, much less how to express it to each other. The only character I found worthy of my time was Seamus, whom I didn't get to meet until the last 3 chapters or so. The sexual innuendo was trite and unneccessary, an overall detraction from the story, which I found to be very predictable.

Alas, it was not to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much promise big let down","review":"I wanted so much to like this book.

Its sequel recaptures some ideas from the original but this time we\`re in for a bigger,louder and more sophisticated experience. While it seems that the producers wasted more money here than in the first, the overall result isn\`t as exciting. The first one had a claustrophobic atmosphere, yet \\"Hypercube\\" doesn\`t have that same feel and mood and ends up being less suspenseful and gripping. The characters are stereotypes and don\`t make us care much, and a couple of twists in the plot are quite questionable. All in all, not a terrible and lifeless sequel, but not a particularly exciting one, either. It\`s a somewhat entertaining piece of sci-fi, even if it doesn\`t bring nothing all that new or unpredictable.Average, worth watching once."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth seeing","review":"quality must always be inversely proportional to the amount of moneyinvolved, so you have to excuse them to some extent because of lessfreedom they had. it's not that bad as it could be given how much moremoney was involved compared to the first part. it doesnt mean itcouldn't be much better, it means it could be much worse. the actorsplayed just fine for their parts. as to the plot, a global controla'la m$cr*s*ft is much exaggerated IMO (by the time such things arepossible people dont follow fashion like long hair in females andfancy beards in males) but i do like the anti-commercial point. it isless that the terminator2 was to the terminator1, but it is more thatt3 was to t1 (and t2); it is just what the matrix reloaded is to thematrix. good music and desing by the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"The First One Was Great, But The Sequel, Like Most....","review":"I am a huge fan of the original Cube movie.

It certainly has a better production value.This movie just didn't pull it off. The first one was all about people, not the characters. It had no star or hero. It was simply a story about the interaction of humans with eachother in a stressful situation.This movie is all about the conspiracy theory, X-files style, and its weak.

Special effects alone (and they *were* more than acceptable) can NOT save a film.Take a pass on this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was Awesome","review":"You know what, this movie really makes you think if there is an alternate reality or another dimension. The characters I would like to know more about, that can only be done in a miniseries which would be cool. So many gaps unfilled. Thats what fustrated me. Know there has to be a three for 2 reasons: to explain EVERYTHING and at the end of this movie, some general of the government said something about phase 2 is complete.......cliffhanger,hello."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"In fiction, there are many places where it is okay to bend the rules of reality, but there are certain places you just cannot. There is nothing wrong with a fictional universe being different from reality, as long as its premises are consistent. In Cube 1, the plot was consistent. In Cube 2, ideas such as parallel universes and time distortion are being played around with. While somewhat interesting, there is no logic to them, it is just an amorphous plot device. And the plot is predictable from the start.Also, the film went wrong by giving too many details, such as a military procurement corporation that is behind it all, where it should have been open enough for each viewer to give their own interpretation.It's illogical and is devoid of intelligence, unlike Cube 1. But it is somewhat entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"messes with your head","review":"I would have given it 4 stars if it had a smart and decent ending. It had a lot of Stephen King like qualities to it. It's suspenseful and enjoyable, but then you start to bond with the characters only to be jerked around in too many directions. The end was a huge let down! I wanted something smart and a relief from all the tension, but all I got \\"was a WTF was the point of that\\" moment. It didn't make sense and you feel awful for hours afterwards trying to figure out what happened. It was a smart movie and could have been great if it wasn't for the end.In an odd way it messes with your head. For some reason I kind of related it to my own life in that certain aspects of it are one giant cube that I can't escape. If that was the point of the movie, it was a real bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure waste of time","review":"This is by far the worst movie ever made....dispicable waste of time.

I thought at that time it was just a Sci-Fi made movie, which explained for the peculiar sets and the strange goings on. I caught it about halfway through, and for some reason continued to watch. The ending had me scratching my head for days. I forgot about it until I found the original on a top horror list site. Then I came here to \\"scope it out\\" if you will just as I do most movies before I buy them. It was then that I was reintroduced to the Hypercube. I went out and bought all three Cube movies and had a marathon. This one is more high budget than the first, but still an interesting entry in the series. It takes on a more Sci-Fi feel than the sheer terror and unease of the first movie. It's definitely worth a watch if you want something a little different while slightly warped and far out.I say one thumb up for oddly enough holding a memory for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sequal but no CUBE","review":"This is a great sequal to The Cube but like most sequals it falls short it's predissor.

Dont bother with this one, just watch the original classic instead for a good horror/sci-fi thriller..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well made","review":"I thought the first cube was a great movie. Very claustrophobic and creepy. This was is far from it. There are no jumps or scares in this movie at all. The cube is hardly dangerous and seems to only have two or three booby traps, all of them very bad CG. Characters die with no explanation, the camera doesn't stop moving at all during some scenes making the viewer very nauscious, and the acting is quite sub par. It's got some interesting ideas and scenes, but really isn't worth anyone's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"the cube 2 - lost in space","review":"Total dissapointment. Some effect's are nice done (parralel worlds, time shifting, some booby traps), but there are only few of it. Cube 1 was much more better, the sequel looks like nothing compared to the first one.In fact is was borrowing, and I suddenly was really waiting for the film to end looking at my DVD-counter.The end itself I totally didn't get. What should be the clue here ? It didn't explain or clear things up, Who where those people, what kind of experiment was it, ...? Why did she had some kind of recording device ? I'm really lost here.All in one: don't spend time looking at this one. Try another movie instead, or see it if you can't sleep...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Cube 2:Hypercube,","review":"What was it on that fateful August afternoon, that made me choose you out of thousands of other movies about cubes. Well, mostly it was my friend Brandon, who had seen your not so distant relative \\"The Cube\\" and was midly impressed. Granted, I am no geometry wiz, but if I had a choice between cutting my balls off and seeing you again, I'd probably see you again. But only cause I like my balls, which are more eliptical than cubical. However, there are many other things that are quite unpleasent that I would do before seeing you again. For example, drinking some milk that is just past the expiration and smells a little off. If you want a solid cube movie, see Jurassic Park. I love it. Overall, Cube 2: Hypercube is the greatest movie I have ever seen. I love you hypercube. Call me."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 hours of my life lost to the hyperdimensions forever!","review":"Preface: I have not seen The Cube.Body: This was the most dreadful waste of 2 hours of my life next to be being snowed into Chicago O'Hare for a day. The bad acting can be forgiven. It's a B movie. Ditto the dialogue. But c'mon, 2 hours without a set change? Yawn. This movie is not so nearly as clever as it would like to think. The Hypercube idea has lots of potential, all wasted. The movie makes no sense. We learn:A)Everyone who is in the Cube had something to do with it's making.b)The Cube kills you.So what?Conclusion: Go read Alastair Reynold's Diamond Dogs and give up movies entirely. If you insisnt on brainless tripe, see the original 1970s Phantasm, or even Zardoz, they're a lot cooler."},{"rating":"1","title":"HyperDud","review":"This movie sets out to answer questions left from the original, but only throws you scraps. About the only answer we get is the name of the company behind the experiment.The original had graphic gore scenes that have become classic and reproduced in newer films, where this one does not even attempt to impress us with any such scenes. They have pretty much skewered the first films plot and candy coated it into this slop.As a horror fan, i am dissapointed. As a sci-fi fan, i am unimpressed. If the rumors of a third film come true, lets pray they try and raise the bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie EVER","review":"What was the point to this movie? Everbody dies. In this movie, a group of people are trapped in a hypercube (as if it can be physically constructed with current technology), trying to find a way out of the cube. This movie had unknown actors, bad acting, and a pointless ending. The paltry special effects could not have saved this movie. I would rank this movie down there with other recent duds like Battlefield Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"more painful to watch \\"hypercube\\" than to be in one","review":"this film is crap.for a far more entertaining time sit down and read the 53 other reviews left by other people, they are wittier and more exciting than the movie, have more plot twists, and you get to see the characters develop a lot more...ps i'd give zero stars if i could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say No","review":"I am writing this over a year after actually seeing CUBE 2: HYPERCUBE, because it was the first time I could stomach to remember it. I am a hard core indie-scifi freak (well any good scifi really) and I must say this movie was a train wreck. I couldn't believe the film makers sheer lack of understanding as to what made the original CUBE great- all white rooms, street clothes, time traveling canabal, I'm saying. I considered CUBE to be up there with the greats (Donnie Darko, Dark City, blah blah blah), CUBE 2 just cheapened it. If you really need more Cubedom see CUBE ZERO the prequel tney recently made, it's at least decent. But to this monstrousity just say no!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Taxpayers Held Up In All Five Dimensions...","review":"Unintentionally funny flashback to the truly bad Canadian tax shelter films of the 60s and 70s, this is the worst film I've seen in years.Perhaps that's a little harsh - if you are seeking a truly pretentious film that marries theoretical physics with horrible acting, this is your best bet.Note to the domestic film industry - if this is how you're spending my money, please quit. Retire to your cottages on Lake Telefilm and do not film again."},{"rating":"2","title":"tis quite nice","review":"I bought it thinking it would be a bit harder and faster, but then again I listen to Cradle of Filth.

I was really expecting to find a great album that mixed Metallica's awesome lyrics with some very cool modern industrial. Instead you get an album that that doesn't cross the industrial line at all.

Metallica songs!","review":"It's hard to find people who don't like Metallica, but it's hard to find fans of true industrial music. If you consider yourself both of these things then this CD will make your day! There are so many heavy hitters on here, like Die Krupps, Apoptygma Berzerk, Razed In Black and In Strict Confidence that it's a real kick to hear each band pay their respects to the most influencial and controversial band in metal. 13 total tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whiplash","review":"The song Whiplash is not from Metallica there.

I saw this new book listed here in Amazon, but who wants to buy a photography book without looking at it? Even if you trust the photographer, what if the reproduction's no good? So I found it in a bookstore and looked. It's more abstract than his earlier work. There are few people; there are roads, rubbly sidwalks, a broken concrete statue of Lenin on a barge. The cropping and grouping of the images are intense and strange. It is awesomely beautiful. The reproduction is fine by me. If you like Koudelka and you buy this book, I think you will be very glad you did.

A better choice would be the Complete Guide to Oracle.I made the mistake of buying it at a Bricks and Mortar store after a quick look at it.

This shows why reader comments at Amazon are so useful, had I read them I never would have wasted my time with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like Oracle for Dummies","review":"I bought this book because I needed to learn Oracle quickly. I had to read through pages and pages of junk (jokes, tidbits, etc) and still there wasn't much content. Most of the examples are on NT which leaves out many of the hands-on features of Oracle.

Try \\"Oracle Design\\" or the other books by the O'Reilly Press if you are trying to use the product in a development environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Embarrassment - DON'T BUY.","review":"Clearly the authors/editors did not take the time to peruse the book for TYPOS, ERRORS IN THE SAMPLES, INCORRECT PASSAGES, etc. As a beginner I spent hours reading and re-reading the samples given in the book and asking my co-workers to clarify only to find out that I had been mis-lead by errors in the text. And the book is replete with errors! You would think the authors would be intelligent enough to stay away from using GLOBAL SEARCH & REPLACES when editing the book, let alone run a simple SPELL CHECK to catch a myriad of typos. The book also contains more advertising for Oracle Products than it has useful information. A definite disgrace for both ORACLE and the authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book....","review":"This book is definitely not for a beginner.

It does help if you know a little of SQL. But, that is not needed to understand. The information is presented in a clear manner and is done in such a way that it builds on the previous chapter slowly. I think this is the BEST book to start with to understand what Oracle is in general and what Oracle 8 is specifically."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start in learning Oracle 8.","review":"This book covers all the topics, often in some detail. Lots of helpful anaologies to clear up the concepts. Quite a few examples. On the negative side, I do find the writing quality a little spotty, there are some tables that are messed up (minor complaint), and some of the material isn't always clearly explained.

Don't be supprised to see that the result of a query shown in book is different from what you get from running Oracle SQL*Plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"For general reader only","review":"I feel quiet disappointed reading this book. It's in general written for people who want to know what Oracle is all about and not as an introduction to Oracle 8 database.There are too many things to be covered in this small book. From NT to UNIX and all the way down to Personal Oracle making it difficult to concentrate as a begineer.The example doesn't provide a starting ground. I sometimes have the feeling that the authors has assumed the user has read some of the Oracle documentation already. Also, some of the topic are not in the latest version. For example, Oracle Form 4.5 (oracle 7) is more focus then the new Form 5.0 which comes with Oracle 8If you just want to know generally what Oracle is all about then this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Authors spend more time fawning over Oracle then teaching","review":"Very poorly organized, introduces complex topics before basics. Code examples almost always include the copyright notice presented when SQLPlus is activated which only serves to hide the actual example. Use of a different font for code examples would be a big help. Examples are disjointed, not consist with text, not done in a building block approach.They waste an entire chapter presenting the installation screens for different platforms without adding much of value beyond what the screen tells you anyway.Biggest problem with book is authors spend about 10% of their time praising Oracle for all the wonderful things they have done. This gets very tiresome and adds nothing to learning Oracle.As another reviewer indicated, it may be useful as a quick reference book, but falls short on being an introductory text."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic little book....","review":"Don't waste your money.

If you have yet to read this book, then you have probably missed one of the most important and most articulated little books on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by Packer","review":"Packer has written an excellent text on evangelism alone in this book. That he deals with the intersection of the practice of evangelism with the concept of a completely sovereign God is a bonus.Though he's not a C.S. Lewis, Packer does write very well and is very readable, though sometimes his notations and quotations seem more along the style of a half-century ago. But the issues and mindsets which he is addressing are active and attractive to many in this day, and thusly this work is very relevant.I recommend this to all Christians, but especially pastors and those who have any questions about evangelism. This isn't a 'how to' book, and it doesn't really have a practical application section - but what Packer is dealing with here is more theological than anything else.And it is a great encouragement and challenge to spread the Gospel. It's not too long and the reading isn't too heavy, so it is accessible and understandable by most anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful gardening source for urban dwellers","review":"Being someone who lives in the city but still enjoys seasonal flowers, I like this book because it appears to take the guess work out of what plants work well together in containers.

It covers everything from shade to full sun and shows a wide range of containers. There are your basic colorful flower pots of all sizes and then they show alternative conainers such as metal pails, iron baskets, using old garden boots for planters, even old wooden chest of drawers can be used with the drawers pulled out to differnet levels and planted with things like Wave Petunias, Creeping Jenny, and other plants that trail down and look very dramatic. There is also a huge range of color combintions that you can use. This helps you stay with similar shades to wild combinations of chartruse green and hot pink and orange.You'll have the most colorful porch or patio in the neighborhood for all four seasons if you follow their many pages of advice.

This book is only good for people who don't know anything about tcp/ip or atm. (In that case, one would not buy this book). The book starts with overview of tcp/ip and atm(using 2 chapters). Then, it use one short chapter to talk about how ip is over atm. Then it talks about other things like snmp, ip multicast, etc... which I don't really interest in.

I have a relationship with the Holy Spirit and have visited many churches, denominations, and religions. Though many churches have preached the gospel and spoke of God's grace, none have compared or grasped the understanding that Philip Yancey has seemed to capture in the book titled, \\"What's So Amazing About Grace?\\" It will not only make you truly understand God's Grace, but it will help to heal you from much pain and guilt, you yourself, other poeple, or even churches have placed on you. Too many churches preach the hard law and forget the whole point of the gospel...God's amazing, underserved grace! Oh, how refreshing and enlightening! Moses brought the law, Jesus brought truth and grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"This was the second Philip Yancey book that I read (after The Jesus I Never Knew), and it is, by far, his greatest work. I have read this book almost a dozen times. The book explores the subject of grace in an example-driven, practical way that only Philip Yancey could write sucessfully. In response to criticism because of its controversy, I only have to say that the Bible is a very controversial book as well.This is truly one of the greatest books I have ever read. I highly recommend this book for everyone who wants to learn more about God's amazing grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Examine your life.","review":"As I read this book I have had to stop many times and find a highlighter. It contains many \\"nuggets\\" that I want to remember and share with others. It has caused me to think deeply about my own life and actions toward others and examine how I love, and how I show and receive grace in my own life. If you want a book that will cause you to really examine how you think , act and feel about grace, this is the book! If, like me you have never thought deeply about the wonder of grace you should! You owe it to yourself and to God to consider the grace He bestowed on all of us through the life, death, and ressurection of Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grace, Bland and Boring?","review":"My least favorite book on grace that i've read so far. The Ragamuffin Gospel by Brennan Manning packed a far more awesome emotional punch, completely and utterly changing my entire way of living out my Christian life, and The Grace Awakening by Chuck Swindoll brought home the point theologically and gave great insights on how to act towards others with grace.What's So Amazing About Grace rarely mentions grace, with almost entire chapters going with nary a mention of the word. Yancey has an excellent chapter on Christians not being involved in politics, but it's out of place, like the rest of the book.Guess you can't please all the people all the time. *shrug*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple reading on a complex topic","review":"I love this book. I am recommending it to everyone I know who is of faith. I particularly enjoy the deceptive simplicity that Mr. Yancey employs as he draws out various aspects of grace and of Christ's presence in our daily lives. It was recommended by a friend, and I'm very grateful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phenomenal concept, horrible execution","review":"\\"What's So Amazing About Grace\\" is a life-changing book, and this edition is brilliant in its concept of visually enhancing the book's written message. However, notice the book's dimensions: 6 inches by 5.5 inches. This is FAR too small for the pictures to have the necessary impact, and much of the text is far too small to comfortably read. This design yearns for a large format (maybe the hardback was bigger?); a 6-inch square cannot do it justice. I caution people in buying this book simply because I found it too small to enjoy/appreciate/study, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was sent wrong book. :(","review":"I actually LOVE the book What's So Amazing About Grace, but it wasn't sent to me. Instead, I got some totally unrelated book, which did not meet my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring words","review":"Inspiring words on a little understood topic. Christians talk about grace, but few of us really understand what it means. I thank Philip Yancy for helping me to fully understand this great gift. Read it. You will be abundantly blessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philip Yancey Is Amazing!","review":"Author Philip Yancey offers a refreshing viewpoint of grace in his spiritually challenging book What's So Amazing About Grace? He effectively uses the scriptures as a lens to focus on the life we lead today. His illustrations help the reader to turn that lens on himself or herself - not in a critical way, but in a soul-opening way. He has chosen some of the most startling and effective illustrations I have ever encountered. This book, already being used in our Christian colleges, needs to be required reading for anyone who takes his or her Christian life seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too political, too conservative, a disappointment","review":"I read this book for a church book study class and was greatly disappointed in its political, rather than spiritual focus. I also take exception to the frequent use of the phrase \\"hate the sin; love the sinner\\" to describe a supposedly \\"Christian\\" way of dealing with prejudice against homosexuals and women who seek abortion. Who are we to declare that they are \\"sinners\\"??? I wish I never read this book. The author's constant negative examples of churches and people was a real downer. There is so much beauty and positive energy in the world, especially in churches and people, why constantly tell stories about the negative?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Wing Betrayal of Jesus","review":"This book is a betrayal of Jesus and all he stood for. No, Jesus was not a bigot like Mr. Yancey, nor a literal-minded fundamentalist who became so consumed with minutiae that he lost sight of the big picture. Mr. Yancey pompously defends his stance against Mel White whom he calls a friend. With friends like Mr. Yancey, who needs enemies? Not Jesus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable Attitude Towards Grace","review":"This book exemplifies the questionable attitude that what ever you do, you can be forgiven if you ask for grace. This means that if Adolf Hitler, in the last nanosecond of his life sought grace he would go to heaven despite all of his horrible crimes against humanity whereas a Jewish person who had no need for Jesus would automatically go to hell despite his myriad good deeds. This attitude seems to be a case of all-or-nothing thinking, an elementary cognitive distortion that seems to be rampant with fundamentalist Christ-ians like Yancey.Jesus never claimed divinity it was only when Saint Paul and some other followers decided to promote him as such. It was a sophomoric effort to dumb down the religion (Judaism) to attract the most followers. By resorting to hocus-pocus, Christianity became Christ-inanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's so amazing about grace","review":"Christianity is set apart from other religious because of \\"grace\\" - receiving unconditional love from God just as we are. Perfection doesn't happen to human beings and that makes for a priceless gift given to us through Jesus' suffering of great price.This book reminds us of what it's all about and assists us in being \\"grace full\\". It's amazing! A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TO THE POINT?","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning of Yancey's book. The principles, message, and warnings to the church were insightful and indicting. I grew, however, tired of the style as the book continued. For me, there were too many anecdotes and examples. I find that style of composition tiresome in both writing and preaching. My eyes skimmed whole pages and even sections, searching for the kernels of truth. Yancey did not have to convince me of his points, just state them susinctly. While others enjoy reading all the little stories, I thought the book could have been shorter and sharper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Phillip Yancey again cuts right to the core issue of this misunderstood concept of Grace. I've given this book to scores of friends who question what it means to live a \\"Christian\\" life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong title for the book","review":"This book would be wonderful if it were called \\"What's so Amazing about Mercy? or \\"Whats so Amazing about Forgiveness\\". Yancy is very limited in his explanation of the grace of God. Actual grace is jaw-droppingly good news, even to unbelievers. This is just good information. Trust me, this is NOT the message that God went through so much and paid so dearly for us to grasp. This is NOT the message that Jesus bled and died for. God's way more in touch with reality, and with what people would actually consider good. To better understand grace, I recommend (among others) \\"Destined to Reign\\" by Jospeh Prince."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yancey Does NOT Understand God's Grace","review":"Yancey doesn't understand God's grace. He just spouts popular mumbo jumbo coming out of Christianity Today, which has no respect for the Word of God or the Kingdom of Christ. Yancey needs to understand that to understand grace, he needs to undersand the nature of sin and the predicament of eternal damnation in Hell. If he doesn't understand this -- and he doesn't seem to -- then he cannot understand grace. This book is just a popular collection of ideas not founded on the Word of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distortion of Christian Theology","review":"This book is definitely out of sync with modern Christian theology, specifically Hans K!ung. It is poorly written and lacks adequate documentation. Yancey possesses not even the most rudimentary reasoning skills. Only a confirmed believer could agree with everything he says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pastor","review":"I was not pleased because it was said this book was new. The previous owner has written a testamony on the inside jacket. The book is in good shape but it is not new and should not be sold as new.

The graphics and type fonts in this little book are difficult to read and view. I couldn't stand looking at it and returned the book. (Perhaps this is supposed to appeal to teens?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible book","review":"This book helped me understand the concept of grace. In a results-oriented society it is almost impossible to fathom being loved and accepted freely, without having to earn it. The best thing about a Yancey book is he is not afraid to ask the tough questions, and openly admits he does not have all the answers. If you really want to understand the concept of true grace, being loved unconditionally, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best book I have read in a long time.","review":"Let me say I am not a christian, I was raised as in a Lutheren Chruch , married a Christian women but still resist the \\"call\\". I was throughly impressed with Mr. Yancey's book. Not only was it entertaining and well written but it disscussed topics that are a big stubling block for nonchristians. i.e. legalism, inflexibility,judgement and on and on. If all christians read this book and took a good look at them self they may discover why people are turned off when people hear the word christian. I would say it is a must read and have already lent it out to friends with excellent reviews back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Grace","review":"This is a wonderful book. I used it recently as a basis for a Christian Motorcyclist's Association meeting about God's Grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a So-So Effort","review":"Please, don't shoot the messenger. I am a Christian and not some anti-Christian trying to write a bad review. As for this book, I was immediately taken in when I read one critic on the back cover of the book state that it was the best book that he had ever read. Well, since I had read Yancey's \\"The Jesus I Never Knew\\" (Which I consider to be the greatest book ever written), then I was excited to read this book. Needless to say, I was disappointed. The book had its interesting moments, but never came close to living up to the hype. Just an average book. I love the concept of Grace and all, but this book didn't really do much for me. Yancey kind of lost his direction half way through. I finished the book only because I wanted to complete what I had finished. I'm not trying to offend anybody, rather, I want people to have a candid review."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Grace' and 'truth' came through Jesus Christ","review":"The author raises some very good questions, however, he is only restating what others have said. In a nutshell he believes the problems in the church of Christ exists because there is a lack of 'grace' being practised. If there is a problem in the church we look for some place to put the blame so we can explain the discrepencies between Christian teaching and Christian behaviour. This, however, puts people on guilt trips as they try, once again, to catch that elusive life of grace. Could it be there is a lack of grace because there is a lack of Christ? Scripture says 'grace' and 'truth' came through Jesus Christ. The two go together, you cannot have grace unless you have truth and visa versa. If there is a lack of 'grace' in the church of Christ, it must be that there is a lack of 'truth'. People's behaviour is based on what they believe is right. Therefore, wrong teaching must be the culprit and not wrong people."},{"rating":"2","title":"secret to happyness","review":"I just read the first chapters but this book has really touched me inside. The gospel is not a story about how to go to heaven or how to avoid hell. The gospel is the most beautiful love story ever told, about how God, being God, denied himself everything for our sake. And now, being totally acepted in Him, we are not left with the rest of our time on Earth to only daydream about heaven, but to enjoy the privilege and happyness of sharing God's love and grace with one another in this world. God does not want us to pay Him something back, He has everything He needs, He want us living close to Him, enjoying His company, His love, His grace, happy to be with Him and being a channel of His love and grace to the people around us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Shabby","review":"At first, I was a bit put-off by what I perceived to be Mr. Yancey's exaggerated whining about his childhood experience in an evangelical church. Though I continue to doubt that it was as bad as he made it out to be, this book is a remarkable testament to the power of grace and forgiveness. It will challenge your notions of proper Christian behavior in the face of sin, and it provides wonderful illustration and practical teaching points on the subject of grace that ministers and other church workers will find helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"An excellent introduction for the new Christian, or a refreshing exploration for those who have been 'in it' a while. Very popular from what I can tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good balance","review":"When I first started out with this book, I thought I was going to be in for one of those feel good, story driven books (aka Max Lucado style)... which are good, but not too substantive.But about halfway into the book, Yancey writes more analytically and I started to immensely enjoy the book. Yancey even gives a section on why the stories are there despite his wanting to dissect grace... that one can't dissect and systemtically explain grace. This is my first Yancey book and I have a feeling I will be reading many more of his books. BTW, Christianitytoday.com has monthly articles written by Yancey which are an awesome read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now meet Someone else.","review":"By now, you've probably already met the Jesus you never knew.

I am re-reading it because the content is so compelling.The Jesus I Never Knew is very good as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best work","review":"After reading Yancey's incredible \\"The Jesus I Never Knew\\", I could hardly wait to read \\"What's So Amazing About Grace?\\". Sadly, while the book has it moments, it carries nowhere near the power of his earlier work. When the book investigates the concepts of grace and forgiveness in the Bible, it is strong writing. When Mr. Yancey extensively writes of disappointment with the Church in the areas of politics, homosexuality and racism, he seems to exude some of the \\"ungrace\\" that he warns about. Many of the points are valid, but the focus on them seems to dominate too much of the book. I guess it is always hard to criticize with grace, which is why these issues are still so devisive. Unfortunately, I think they take away from what could have been another master work.As it stands, this is still a good book, but if you are going to prioritize, \\"The Jesus I Never Knew\\" is a much better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Message of Love","review":"Phillip Yancy displays his brilliance at exploring the words and life of Christ through this awesome book. His parallels to contemporary life give further strength to the power of grace. He further goes on to dive into such controversial issues as abortion, homosexuality, and the lives of our leaders, displaying how grace is ceratinly intertwined in these issues. His message of love reminds us all why Jesus gave His life for us, and why we must never cease to be amazed at this amazing and undeserved (yet given) gift. To fathom the love of God as Yancy writes simply will leave you speechless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stopped me in my tracks!","review":"I thought I knew about grace, and I thought I was graceful because grace is a word that all we Christians know so well (ha, ha). Philip Yancey quickly cut the rug out from under my feet. I never realized how ungraceful I was. It took a long time to read because I had to stop and pray after every few pages. Every Christian needs to read this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Yancey","review":"This is one of his best.

A real understanding of grace can be difficult to acquirewhen you're as blessed environmentally as most of us are. This book is a great help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"One of the best books I have read in my life!

Any fan who purchases this soundtrack will not be dissapointed. The album loosely follows the plot of the show, as many of the tracks actually begin with audio clips from the show before playing the song (Which can get a bit annoying after several listenings. Thankfully, they never speak over the actual song). The majority of the disc is the background music featured on the show. Only two or three songs actually contain vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, practical direction. My current favourite.","review":"Francesca de Grandis is to be applauded.

After starting the work with \\"Be a Goddess\\" I realized she had been with me all the time - was I so blind? I remember myself crying hard to feel her wrapping her arms around me and just didn't realize she did...all the time! Working with that book is highly recommended. The pace of the lessons is quite good. One can integrate the work on the book perfectly into a busy everyday life.Thank you, Francesca de Grandis!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid!","review":"This is an excellent 11-dollar course in magic, goddess-worship, faerie lore, celtic shamanism, and earth spirituality.

The series Trial & Retribution was written by Lynda La Plante.She is a Bafta award winner for her detective stories. I loved the series especially the early ones. The series is well written, good acting, and difficult to stop watching. The lead detective DCI Mike Walker (David Hayman) does a excellent job of convincing the audience that he really cares about each victim and he isn't going to stop until he finds the perpetrator of the crime. Each set within the series is interesting and diverse. It is a great fine for and American audience. If you love Inspector Morse and Prime Suspect you will love this series also."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"This show was insanely good. It's not like any other crime drama I have seen in that you get inside the lives of the victims' loved ones, of the police trying to solve the case and of the attorneys representing the accused.

They use a lot of language about business finance that may not be familiar, or comfortable, for the average household. While its advice is sound, and the book's \\"heart\\" is in the right place, I found the language and metaphor a little difficult to digest.

The actors are fine, but lack the charisma of past leads.Most depressingly the entire soundtrack, normally a highlight of Italian horror productions, is cribbed from his earlier, better films.If you love the director's earlier films you'll probably get around to watching this anyway, so rest assured Blue Underground has created the best DVD possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Lucio Fulci movie I've seen yet!","review":"I admit, the last four years, I've been buying a lot Euro-horror titles and I enjoy most of them.

If you watch the extras on the DVD, the director even admits they had a hard time completing the film and that it didn't turn out like they had planned.

The main factor seems to be a genuine listenability - a pleasant blend of roller-disco pop and melow synth ballads that just seems to get more charming with the passing of years. Maybe the 70s weren't, in reality, a more innocent time, but you can't tell from this batch of winning songs. From 'Melody' to \\"Fool for a Night' and, yes, \\"Shadow Dancing\\", Andy runs the A to B of teen emotions.

For diehard Maxwell fans, this book is not going to tell you anything you do not already know, but it serves are a great reminder of those principles that separate successful leaders from the also-rans.To be sure, there are some who see such works on leadership as circumventing the leading and power of the Holy Spirit, but they are wrong. Good leadership cannot make up for the lack of spiritual depth, but put the two together- leadership and spiritual depth and you have an unstoppable situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership","review":"This is the book. It's a quick read with wonderful and meaningful examples. The truths of leadership are right at your finger tips. Don't pass this one by...it should be in everyones library (no matter who you lead - from the CEO to the Scout Leader)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deceptively simple","review":"Do not let a quick read of the 21 Laws fool you. This book is worth careful study. As a pastor, the Laws of Leadership have transformed my ministry and my family. I highly recommend a quick read followed by a detailed study of what will be a leadership classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"All but useless","review":"This book is written in a weird hybrid style of sermon and ineffective lecture. Each \\"Law,\\" which is actually a fairly truthful insight into leadership, is a chapter. The expression of the law is followed by a tale to help clarify what he means by each law, much in the way one might expect a sermon to proceed... then follows another story, then another, then maybe several illustrations. By the time this process is all over, the reader knows exactly what the law means, but has no idea how to be the kind of leader that doesn't run afoul of it. And so it goes, chapter after chapter, all illumination and no explanation. I definitely had the feeling that the author wanted me to buy or reference another of his offerings to get the \\"how to\\" part, but Mr. Maxwell will not have another penny from this reader. My advice to anyone who reads this review: spend your money on something by Covey."},{"rating":"1","title":"21 Laws of What?","review":"This book is full of nice little ancedotes and repetitious references to Maxwell's personal history at Skyline church but doesn't illuminate the reader on how to be a better leader. Mostly it's stuff like \\"let's consider the Law of Magnetism... you attract people who are like you.\\" Wow! Great! and how do I use this Law? .... and how do I learn Magnetism?.... how does this work in leadership? ..... \\"and now for a little story about Abraham Lincoln....\\" So what do we learn from Mr. Maxwell's book? Not much unless you yearn for lots of nice stories about Henry Ford, Jack Welch, various NBA and NFL coaches ad naseum... oh and as the other reviewer mentioned some really dumb graphs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leadership Lite - Harriet Tubman?","review":"The book is very much oversold with all the 5 star reviews. I was very disappointed when I found it short on real application (how to's)and developed examples. If you want a taste, read the beginning of chapter 7, The Law of Respect, next time you are in the book store. You'll leave wondering what it was that made Harriet Tubman so wonderful and having no idea how you could begin to model any of her characteristics. In a word: OVERRATED."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 21 Laws of Politics?","review":"This book is very superficial, and has no practical application.

Will help anyone in any situation whether at work or in your personal life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great listen","review":"I love to hear Maxwell and anyone who is a leader or wants to be a leader needs to listen to Maxwell. His words of wisdom resonate today and will provide greater performance as a leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book and Product","review":"I ordered this book used and it was in perfect condition, reasonably priced and an overall great long term issue in my library at home. The seller was prompt in sending and would buy again. The book itself is a great read for anyone who may be working on a PIP in their career or looking to improve on their overall leadership skills! Would highly recommend!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have heard John Maxwell speak and have been overwhelmed by his insights. However, this book leaves me cold. Maxwell enumerates the qualities and illustrates them with many historical examples, but fails to spend much time in detailing how to personally apply and develop the 21 Laws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure steps to great success!","review":"This is the most awesome book! A true inspiration! There were some points I felt I had down pat, and then some areas that I'm working to change in order to come up higher and reach my desired goals. I thought it was awesome how John Maxwell explained the why's and how's. I have recommended this book to anyone with the slightest bit of leadership ability, and told someone yesterday, \\"When you are a multi millionaire then don't forget some babbling woman told you about this book!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Alternative to a Sleeping Pill","review":"A horribly boring book.Maxwell's books are not LAWS!! They are his personal opinions and/or theories. He needs to stop trying to be the Einstein or Newton of Management & Leadership.If he wants to truly find out about leadership, he should attend a military leadership school for the full amount of time (anywhere between two weeks and a year)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very refutable","review":"This hugely popular leadership guru has an ego to match, telling stories about how great he is at creating new leaders and inspiring people at his conferences. And when he's not telling stories about himself, he's telling stories that have very little to do with the laws they are supposedly propping up. During the second and third listen through the tapes, I kept thinking, \\"That has almost nothing to do with what he's saying.\\"Perhaps he deals with it in other books, but Maxwell never lets on to what leadership really is. He claims it's \\"influence,\\" but why not just talk about influence then? And what are the goals of leadership? By not addressing the goals of leadership, Maxwell merely feeds on the narcisicism of his readers, who long to be \\"leaders\\" themselves because being a leader is cool.Stick to Max De Pree's Leadership in an Art for some truly thoughtful and humble reflections from a man who really was a great leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Leader of Leaders","review":"John Maxwell has established himself as a leader in the field of leadership. This book is typical of his work in that it is well written and concise. Maxwell doesn't waste pages on unnecessary verbiage. He gets right to the point and does so quite clearly.When you think about what you read in this book, anyone who has served in a leadership capacity, or more importantly, who has worked at developing leadership in others, knows these principles, or 21 laws of leadership, already. But Maxwell does a fine job of bringing the thoughts and knowledge together in a fashion that is both comprehensible and applicable.If you're not familiar with Maxwell, this book is a terrific starting point in developing your own personal leadership traits. If you are familiar with Maxwell's methods, but haven't read this book, add it to your collection as you are sure to benefit in your quest at developing leadership in yourself and others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of quotable lines, but little substance.","review":"I was prepared to really like this book, and I did, but not as a guide to learning how to be a leader. It's a collection of anecdotes designed to demonstrate each of Maxwell's laws of leadership, and it's interesting for that.But if you're looking for a book with some good advice about how to develop and refine your leadership skills, look elseshere. At no time does Maxwell provide insight as to how the skills he describes can be developed by the reader.Bottom line: An entertaining and easy read with some interesting stories about people you've heard of, along with some sound advice, but no real meat to help you grow as a leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book for Keeps","review":"though im in my twenties. i realize some of the ideas or \\"laws\\" may not be very new. but the author neatly compiles all those things that make leaders what they are for those of us who wish for something more or aspire for something better. quite simply, he points us in the best possible direction. idiosyncrasies, if any, cannot be avoided. the guy is still human anyway. however, its best to just take the book with a grain of salt and try to make the best use of the \\"laws\\" for perhaps better outcomes in your group or organization. in all, its a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe too simple for some, but applicable to many...","review":"I will tell you that I read some of the reviews here and thought that this book was nothing more than kindergarten drivel. Interesting enough to the contrary, Maxwell makes the complex very simple. There are two chapters that have given me direct understanding of a situation that was a mystery to me before. The concept of an appointment to a position of authority only buying you time to build relationships and influence is one that I will never forget for the rest of my career. His examples may be simple, but the reality is that this book is full of real wisdom on the topic of leadership. Maxwell doesn't take you into the spiral of matrices and concentric circles of influence type of jargon; just real life. Read this book and start on the path to honing your leadership skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"As informative as it is inspiring","review":"John Maxwell's The 21 Irrefutable Laws Of Leadership: Follow Them And People Will Follow You is a superbly written guide for those seeking to influence and inspire the men and women who work and live around them. A collection of lively stories about the foibles and successes of Lee Iacocca, Abraham Lincoln, Princess Diana, and Elizabeth Dole are as enaging as they are illustrative regarding core attitudes and visions of corporate and managereial leadership. Witness the example cited of Princess Diana, who even after she was stripped of her title, was still able to lead a global effort toward banning land mines because of her sophisticated ability to influence others. As informative as it is inspiring, The 21 Irrefutable Laws Of Leadership is also available in an abridged Audio Cassette format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to apply. . .","review":"A majority of these \\"laws of leadership\\" are beyond our control or ability to influence. There is no practical application to making them work for you. I also found that some of his laws seem to contradict. For example, one law talks about developing leaders around you, but in another law he explains that he took over a position and replaced an entire staff of 40 people (with the exception of two) because they were holding back the organization. So do I try to develop those around me or fire them and bring in new ones? I didn't find very much of the information helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing product of John Maxwell","review":"The table of contents gave me some hope that this would be a useful and practical book on developing leadership attributes. I was hoping for sophisticated discussion from an accomplished leader-teacher. Instead I found one anecdote after another, with very little useful analysis and very few practical points to apply to my organization. I'm sure Mr. Maxwell knows more than this book reflects; I just can't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lightweight overview of leadership traits","review":"Like many books in this genre, Maxwell provides a lightweight overview of the traits of leadership. He \\"proves\\" his rules with one or two examples, a method that is logically incorrect, and the only reason he gets away with it is that most of the rules are pretty obvious.What the reader won't get is much content. The frustrated reader will ask, \\"OK, this is a trait of a good leader. How do I get there?\\" This book does not provide an answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This book has helped me to become a better leader. I have purchased it for a co-worker and ministry leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet: 21 principles of leadership","review":"Frequent motivational author John C. Maxwell, a former pastor, squarely based these 21 laws of leadership on enduring values. These guidelines are meant to inspire, not innovate, as they offer techniques to make leading by principle a practical reality. Maxwell's straightforward, insightful rules are well worth the time you will spend reading them. We recommend this gem of simplicity as a game book for building stronger teams and becoming a better leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost \\"incredible\\" book of timeless wisdom in leading.","review":"John Maxwell has surpassed himself with \\"21 Laws\\". For anyone wanting to become a leader, this book is a must. The presentation is extremely easy to follow and the illustrative stories seal the lid on each law. Timeless, persuasive, undeniably one of the best all-time leadership books."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE TERRIFIC BOOK...","review":"\\"The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership\\" is an excellent tool in mastering leadership and inspiring others. Based on sound advice, the book is well structured for easy reading, organized and factual. Whether you want to increase your leadership abilities as a business person, volunteer organizer or simply for personal reasons, you will benefit from this book. Having top-notch interpersonal relationship skills and organizational ability are a must in strong leadership. Regardless of where you are in the life cycle, a young person starting a career, or an experienced prefessional, the principles of this book will give you insight and wisdom on developing, or reinforcing, strong, positive leadership skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrefutable? Laws?","review":"It is ridiculous to claim to present \\"Irrefutable Laws\\" of leadership.Maxwell presents some leadership ideas, principles, and insights based on his experience and knowledge. It would be more appropriate and honest to present them as such.Read at this level, perhaps this book can be beneficial in leadership development."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most concise and applicable book on leadership","review":"This book is the best book on leadership i've ever read. It seems to me that the negative reviewers of this book misunderstood this book. The book is not meant to go step by step through all 21 laws. The book is meant to tell you what the laws are of leadership, it's ur responsibility to find out how you can use these laws in your life. Honestly the laws are practical and simple and they can be implemented as soon as u understand them just by the way u speak , how much u read, how many seminars you attend and audio training material you listen to. All those things will help increase your lid of leadership but that won't happen until you know what u need to work on and this book pinpoints what a true leader is and does in the world as we know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No enough meat just pointers on what leaders need","review":"I was very disappointed in the book. He is one of my favorite authors. However, I feel I was robbed when I bought this book. I would read a chapter and then say to myself \\"that is it\\"? Great ldeas but no practical application. It would be better to purchase \\"Lincoln on Leadership\\" by Donald T. Phillips then this book. At least this small paper back describes how Licoln applied his leadership skills while he was President. From standing in the rain with the soliders to the words he used to unite a nation. This book was just a warm and fuzzy on why leaders need to obtain the 21 laws how I have no idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not trash but disappointing","review":"The writing was decent and the stories were entertaining but I am not sure there is enough meat in here to satisfy. First, Maxwell assumes anyone with a succesful past is automatically a great leader. He uses their success to justify his Laws when the connection at times is not apparent. I don't think Mother Teresa was concerned about leadership as much as being an example of Christ and Christian living. A topic by the way this man of God did not bother to pursue when the greatest example of leadership in my opinion is Jesus. I do not want to be judgmental but will say I was disappointed that a man who teaches leadership and has been a Pastor of a number of successfull churches, did not provide ANY spirtual guidance for other church leaders and ministers of the Gospel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leadership 101 at best","review":"A good book for a High School student who would like to look at the very basics of leardership.

I took the trouble of getting that book, also on Amazon.com. It was really an education.

It also can be plugged in the wall and will charge your ipod fast while plugged in. It came with a giant assortment of connector pieces to fit almost any ipod out there, plus can be used with a cable to plug in a discman or MP3.

I've been listening to Dr. John for what? 30 years? Maybe more... I'd never really thought of him as a blues artist, per se, but obviously, he's comfortable within that idiom. I have always considered him as a combination of many influences, including jazz, blues, rock, R&B and all things Cajun. It's the way he amalgamates these influences yet keeps his own distinct personality that has kept me a fan. This disc does not disappoint. Many songs on it are readily recognizable as being Dr. John, but I think we are witnessing a maturing of his sound. The band is excellent, as is the recording quality. Makes me feel like breaking into the chorus of \\"Iko, Iko\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prime New Orleans Music and then some","review":"This well-crafted, wide-ranging set of 14 tracks clocks in just under one hour and eight minutes. Mac (Dr. John) Rebennack wrote or co-wrote all the songs, including four co-authored with Doc Pomus. Funk and second line rhythms are essential to the CD but, rather than being in front of the mix as in Dr. John's 'Gumbo' and 'In The Right Place' releases, they contribute to the groove that pulls together the music's other influences. The varied additions to 'Creole Moon' include sax (David 'Fathead' Newman), Cajun fiddle (Michael Doucet), slide guitar, flute as well as Afro-Cuban and Latin percussion. You can listen to this release casually or listen more deeply for the intertwined grooves and cross rhythms. 'Georgianna' is a Cajun ballad; \\"Litenin'\\" is Latin dance.

This CD, unfortunately is not Bowie-like at all and sounds more like the worst Beatles songs with background music from a broken 1940's jute box.

She later blamed this kind of hostile treatment from the very Chicago anarchists she'd introduced Czolgosz to for driving him to \\"prove himself\\" through his attentat.If you want to know about Anarchism and the period, don't buy this book.

Chris Rock, a most overreacting actor, plays a double part, Kevin Pope and Michael Turner, the first one a vagabond and the latter an inteligent and cold secret agent from the CIA. But they are twin brothers! (what a great idea!)and Mr. Turner (the agent) is killed in action and Mr. Pope must replace him for the sucess of the mission.With that premise, the movie goes on only based upon the abominable jokes and gags of Rock and some unimpressive action scenes and car chases.

I saw the previews on TV, but was not driven to go out to see it. I just thought that Hopkins/Rock was a wierd mixture that couldn't possibly create a good movie. I was wrong. I saw the DVD on sale and picked it up, as I was interested in seeing how it actually was. I was truly surprised at how good the movie was. Of course, since it has Chris Rock in it, it has some good laughs, but in general, it's a well constructed espionage flick that's well worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad company, bad movie","review":"Simply put, this is a disappointing film. From the casting to the implausible and even more impossible plot, the whole thing does not make any sense. Chris Rock although a good comedian does not an action star make. Chris Rock tones down his whole schtick in an attempt to be cool and composed but ends up looking half baked. His natural talents are sadly wasted in this movie. Anthony Hopkins who is an excellent actor is a little too old to be cast in an action role to make it believeable. If you want a young guy, old guy action movie see \\"The Rock\\". The formula does not work all the time. The entire movie is a waste of talent with a painfully predictable plot that no amount of explosions and car chases will erase. The DVD has a THX soundtrack, but barely makes up for the content. Rent this movie first.

Sadly, talent like Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock are wasted on a script that lathers on clich��s and plot holes (nonsensical is an understatement) with rusty dialog, little laughs (why is Chris Rock in this movie if he's not allowed to be funny) and regurgitated familiarity. Sure, there are some thrills, but they are far too expected and they only get you once, then you're over it. Hopkins does the best he can here, and his presence certainly gives the film a much needed facelift, but at the end of the day this is a forgettable ride. It's not offensively \`bad', it's just irritatingly \`bland'. There isn't much use for this when equally brainless espionage fare like \`I Spy' (same year, mind you) at least understands the need for humor to elevate a film that is, without that humor, devastatingly dry.This film will leave you parched."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book to read on Advent","review":"My hucband always reads a story on Christmas eve to all 8 children, and to all their children,our grandchildren,20 , and one great-grandchild.

The orchestral feeling of the stormy sea is both enchanting and furious at the same time. Cheryl Studer is magnificient when singing Senta's Ballad, and Placido Domingo does what he does best as Erik. The choir and the orchestra are in top form and the fast tempi Sinopoli chooses is well done and exhilarating.I don't know about the other two reviewers that gave this CD one and two stars out of five, but this Hollander is here to stay. And stay away from James Levine's rendition; it's so slow that you'll fall asleep right after the Overture."},{"rating":"2","title":"best Senta on disc!","review":"This is a wonderful record which i enjoy more and more. The conductor and the singers are all first rate. But especially Cheryl Studer sings the most beautiful of all Senta's on disc. She really sounds girlish and fresh, no problems for the voice at this date of recording! The most other Sentas on record sound also beautiful but not young enough. The Technics are also without fault however at Deutsche Grammophon. My recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, Passionate Precision","review":"What a truly superb and intensely passionate performance this is. I have seldom heard a chorus and orchestra perform with such precision,drive and clarity. The ensembles in particular, were the most impressive, obviously due to the impecable leadership and commitment of Maestro Sinopoli. The opening started with a line and tension that held me captive throughout the 3 Act masterpiece until the very last note. All credit for the success of this recording must go to Maestro Sinopoli for whom I have developed a renewed admiration and respect. Most definitely one of the best Wagner recordings, ever !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrible recording","review":"From the opening bars you can tell (IF you have a knowledge of Wagner and this opera) that this recording is going nowhere. Absolutely no tension or suspense whatsoever, two elements required here. And even worse this set has a bigger fault of a Dutchman with no strength or personality whatsoever. This set can be avoided. Great recordings are under the batons of Krauss, Knappertsbush, & Keilberth. None others need apply."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about?","review":"Really, I fail to see what the fuss is about regarding this recording of Dutchman. Studer has such a flutter in her voice especially when she really has to sing, and that's many times! She is no match for Voigt and even Behrens. Weikl fails to meet Morris in terms of vocal intensity and insight, although he is a wonderful singer. Domingo.....no comment - prefer Heppner! Sinopoli is the opera's saving grace as far as tempi and orchestra control. Chorus is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you sure we can't give -3 stars?","review":"The only reason I can see for anyone to listen to, let alone own, this vastly inferior performance of \\"Dutchman\\" is the fact that the best digital stereo version seems to be unavailable. That was the incredible 1981 (or '82) live performance featuring Lisbeth Balslev (who was far better than Studer), Robert Schunk (who could outsing Domingo on his best day), Matti Salminen as Daland, and Simon Estes as the Dutchman. Yes, Estes took most of his opening monologue to warm up, but once he did he was magnificent, with the power of a Schorr and the ringing resonance of Lawrence Tibbett. And Woldeman Nelsson's conducting was nothing short of spectacular. In fact, I have this performance 2 ways, on CD and video, and I love them both.Sinopoli - spare me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rather paternalistic viewpoint","review":"I have mixed emotions about this book. It does include interesting information, but- at least in the section about the Hopi and other Pueblo people- it acts as though they are a dead culture. Everything is in the past tense. Furthermore, the author described ceremonies which should NOT be discussed in a book intended for children. Especially inappropriate was their discussion of the katsinvaki, which is an initiation ceremony for children. What? Do they think Hopi kids cannot read??? I suggest that the author read the book \\"Appropriated Pasts\\" by McNiven & Russell. It is in interesting consideration of how anthropology has been used by dominant cultures. It's too bad.

After pumping the top to full capacity and letting it stand on it's own, the train will spin VERY slowly around the track only 1 and 1/2 turns before it stops and the sound effects keep going while nothing moves. If you want to watch the entire top spin, you must hold it up off the ground by the top of the pumper. My kids are very frustrated that it does not work like a traditional top. If the train would spin faster and longer, they might be able to play with it. Maybe the one I got is broken? It came with no instructions, which a top should not need, and all of the writing on the box is in German. Since my kids who love tops want nothing to do with it, I can only give it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this toy for my 3.5 yo twins for over $20, which for a top is very very expensive. But the majority of the reviews were positive, and the kids are really into trains, so I bought it. It arrived promptly, and the kids immediately started playing. About 10 minutes into the game the sound stopped working. The train does go around the field, but very slowly, and stops about 5 seconds into the trip. To push the handle down takes all of their strength, so I don't think a younger child would be able to push it down. It does not come close to my expectations for the price.

Not very stimulating to look at. The top must be pressed down very hard to get the train noise to play and then the train moves around the track rather slow and even stops before the train sund is over and the top is still spinning. If the train isnt in motion you cant even tell the top is spinning as it remains silent and there isnt any color effect to notice that its spinning. The only time you are aware it spinning is when the train moves, and that is for a very short time. The worse thing about it is that it takes alot to get the train sound effect to play. The average child would not know that they must realy press it down super hard and fast to get it to play. It isnt a very stimulating toy and I my son lost interest in it after to times....just wasnt very exciting like his last spinning top he had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"The cone base broke in just 3 months use.

Sad to say, it's also the most lack-lustre and boring. Despite a terrific cast--Patricia Morrison, in particular, as the slinky villainess--the story plods along so slowly, with zero suspense, that you wonder how this quickie passed the approval of Universal executives. The plot revolves around music boxes but the plot has nothing to do with the title. On the cover of my budget Sherlock Holmes double-feature for $5.95, you see a great poster of Patricia Morrison, clad in furs and silks, with a gun ready to fire. And you get the impression that the movie has something to do with a sharply attired gun moll. I'm glad I only paid $5.95 for this episode in the usually entertaining HOlmes series.

This Digiview edition of DRESSED TO KILL, the final entry in the Rathbone-Bruce series, is typical of the public domain lot: the picture quality is fair but watchable, with a few transitional fades missing (TV print?) and a replaced \\"End\\" title. Nevertheless, it's always a pleasure to watch Rathbone and Bruce in action, even if DRESSED TO KILL is a second-echelon Holmes effort.Serious collectors will want to get MPI Home Video's beautiful restorations of the entire Rathbone-Bruce series.

He remains the consummate screen Holmes, and I still see him in my mind's eye when rereading the stories. He conveys the intense intelligence and laser focus of Sherlock while never hamming it up; I've always felt that Doyle would approve.Bruce is his usual understated Watson, and the villains are good, specifically the gorgeous Patricia Morrison, a femme fatale if ever there was one. The story is interesting, with enough serpentine workings to keep Holmes fascinated and fascinating. My only qualm is the original print, clearly not archived well, full of scratches and flaws. But that just adds at some points to the pleasantly aged feel of the film, so it's not the end of the world.All in all, a satisfying conclusion to one of the best adaptations of any fiction series ever committed to film.

Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiny camera, small negative, great shots","review":"I've had the Elph Jr. for about a month -- and have put about 10 rolls through it processed by a Kodak lab. With Advantix 200 film the photos are sharp and well saturated. You lose some saturation with ISO 400 film, but still surprisingly grainless even with panoramic (4 x 11) cropping. Camera is so tiny you can take it anywhere (get the leather case with the belt loop). Keep in mind that the negative is smaller than a 35 though. If you get good photos on a 35, you'll probably get better shots with the Elph Jr. because of Print Quality Improvement feature of APS. If your 35 shots are lousy, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elph camera makes photography fun again!","review":"This model doesn't support mid-roll changing, but the Elph Jr. gives satisfactory results if you want quick snapshots to remember a vacation or party by. It's amazingly easy to tote around and use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine Broke!","review":"After 18 months of treating this camera like gold and being reasonably satisfied with the quality of the images (as long as they weren't enlarged), one day it just stopped working with the lens partially extended, frozen in place. All the repair shops want $100 to fix it. For $100 I could buy a new one. It was cute while it lasted, but I've bought a Yashica T4 (the original - not the awful zoom remake with the same name) instead. It's not nearly as small, but this elph is just too fragile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Camera!","review":"I got this camera as a gift, and I LOVE IT! The only problem is, I was a volunteer for a charity event and it got stolen. I'm currently looking for another one!The Elph Jr. is small, light-weight and easy to use! It has three different picture sizes, including panoramic! The APS film is much easier to use and pictures come out clear as a bell! The reason I love this camera is because it's not bulky, fits nicely in my purse/back pack/pocket and takes pictures just like, if not better than all those bulky overpriced cameras! It has a number of different language selections as well! All around, a great Camera and a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First time parents--We love it!!","review":"We got this camera when our son was three months old and we take pictures of him in every kind of light; indoor, outdoor; we even take some at night and they look fantastic!

The author quotes extensively from primary sources (with footnotes) to give a vivid description of what the prisoners ate -- or didn't eat. Rats and lice were delicacies to be fought over, and starvation and scurvy whittled away at the men's humanity. There are several recipes of the period to give the reader an idea of the delicious home-cooked meals the boys dreamed and talked about obsessively. The heartfelt letters to home are especially moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, flimsy lame packaging with no booklet","review":"Does the artwork count for nothing nowadays? Not only is the cover photo poorly reproduced, the package is an ultra-flimsy cheap digipak with no booklet. Timings and credits are nowhere to be found.

It was never commissioned in the US though. It's a nice pop album. Her cover of \\"Piece of My Heart\\" is excellent. \\"Ain't No Sun Since You've Been Gone\\" is a nice blue eyed soul kind of song. She does some great cover songs as usual, showing her skills as an interpreter. Some favorites include \\"Who (Will Take My Place)\\" and \\"This Girl's in Love with You\\". Her version of the classic ballad \\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\\" is wonderful and my favorite track here, it sends chills up my spine! \\"Morning\\" is wonderful as well. In addition to the 12 original tracks, there are four bonus trakcs including a rare track called \\"Spooky\\" and remixes of \\"No Stranger\\", \\"Mediation\\" and \\"The Colour of Your Eyes\\". A wonderful Dusty album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Flag: T.V.

It's surprisingly got a lot of depth to it. It isn't clear-cut who is the \\"good guy\\" and \\"bad guy\\" here. It shows that there's always more than what meets the eye to people.

As one critic said it was a \\"B\\" movie, but it was very good nevertheless.I really enjoyed the acting- it was very good. I loved the wife Megara, who was very good (even though she was \\"evil\\"), and Herc's mother. Herc was pretty good himself, and Leelee (his nymph) was very good, she truly stole the film.Though there was quite a few inaccuractes, (such as only 6 labors were preformed as opposed the 12), it was still a pretty good movie, albert a T.V. one.The only serious critic I would have to say is the obvious animation. It was really surprising to find that this movie was made in 2005-the animation looked like something out of one of the older Star Wars Movies.This was a really good T.V. movie.

It's visually very rough...it reminded me of old \\"historical\\" movies I saw in the sixties as a child. Leelee Sobieski, lightly clad or unclad in a classical nymph-bathing-in-woodland-lake scene, is the sole redeeming factor I discerned, and she sounds as if she knows full well how stupid the script is.I rented this thing after a day of Christmas shopping and was intent on a couple of hours of escapism and mind candy, and I wouldn't have caviled about a few deviations from the canon version of ths Hercules story, or about a great many.

There is so much more to this band than blues-rock. The only negative aspect is the fact that the BBC sessions that they recorded are not included but here you get quite a few rarities to make up for it.So this is definitely the way to go if you want all the albums from this excellent trio in one package!Thanks for taking the time to read!Later..."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Cream","review":"This box set is the only thing you need of Cream, because you get all the studio albums, the singles, the rarities and the 2 cd's of live recordings.

Although I have owned the Clapton Crossroads box set for years, I never had the Cream albums on CD before buying Those Were The Days. Of course the CDs sound way better than the old LPs or tapes I had. Cream is among the elite bands of classic rock, so that's what gets it four stars from me right off the bat. I didn't give it five stars because, as much I am a fan, some of the material sounds dated and doesn't hold up well over time. Also, I don't care for the \\"book\\" packaging because it's difficult to take in the car or to store with the rest of my CDs. The standout tracks are too numerous to list, and the lowpoints too few to make note of. Cream was and still may be the epitome of British-blues-rock, which makes their entire discography essential to musicians and fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Cream","review":"Simply put, the best part of this set is that you get everything. You get all 4 of Cream's studio albums: \\"Fresh Cream,\\" \\"Disraeli Gears,\\" \\"Wheels of Fire,\\" and \\"Goodbye\\" and you also get most of the 2 live albums plus more live stuff and outtakes/alternatives. You have this box, you got all the Cream you need. Any Cream fan should not go another day without this super collection and I would recommend this to anyone about to buy some Cream because they will end up wanting it all anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Cream box set CD of the ultimate collection!","review":"This CD has too much live track versions which I find this compilation the worst and bad when they re-issued Those Were The Days box edition in my opinion give it \\"Two Thumbs way down here!\\" Would'nt recommend at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable read","review":"I really enjoyed reading \\"The Promise of Eden.\\" The characters were well fleshed out (even those without flesh).

I'm a veteran of Trance, live and and breath the stuff. The first time I heard this, it it literally took my life down a new path. Listening to it for the first time on E may have had a little to do with it, but it conjured up thoughts of just EPIC scenarios. Battles, Love, Hate, Journeys, New dimensions. I turned to my friend and asked...what would you call this? He replied, \\"trance\\"...I said \\"I know, but this is something more, it just seems epic to me.\\" he of course laughed, but after some research we found that it was indeed Epic Trance.

Clinton especially sounds way off key, his voice ripped to shreds, singing words off mic, out of rhythm. The album has bad balance. It sounds like there's a hole in the middle of the mix, with all these brittle parts surrounding the hole that don't add up to much. I've seen the P-funk several times, but this doesn't capture the feeling of those shows. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A remarkably mediocre album","review":"Given the talent involved, I have always been surprised and disapointed at how bad this studio recording is. Kanawa is even occasionally off-pitch, and she and Carreras show little of the verve and beauty that made them international stars. I'd look elsewhere for a recording of this wonderful score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical Quality is Disappointing","review":"My wife and I eagerly awaited listening to this recording. About halfway through, we shut it off. In dissecting our attitude, we concluded that the audio mixing was very amateurish; definitely not ready for prime time. Every track had different mixing quality; compare technical quality of the Lena Horne track with, say, the \\"Tonight\\" track. And the mixing of the \\"Maria\\" track was a real hatchet job. Overall, not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the novice.","review":"This may be a great video camera -- I wouldn't know. I have had this thing for a week and have spent hours and hours trying to figure out how to video conference with it.

You would think that setting up video conferencing would be easy - but, I wouldn't know and I am about ready to toss the thing into the rubbish. I had actually hoped to use this camera, silly me. So now I will be bugging everyone I know who might know something of how to use it as the manufacturers certainly didn't have novices in mind. It shouldn't have to be so difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resolution and Low Light Performance","review":"This camera is far superior to any of the three I've owned before. I replaced a Winnov, which was MUCH more expensive. The 3Com is very forgiving of poor lighting, resolution is superb, and tint is easily adjusted. My only complaints are that the base is rather flimsy and the adjustment is stiff. This combined with the bulky USB cable sometimes make it difficult to place the camera exactly where you want it. Focusing is easy, but a little more resistance in the lens movement would prevent it from being changed inadvertantly. I found the flickering LED on front of the camera very annoying, but it can fortunately be turned off through the software. Excellent buy, expecially at the current discounts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent camera, don't waste time or money on others!","review":"I tried several webcam type cameras before getting this one.

I have THREE windows behind my computer with a good amount of light pouring in but my camera still can be dark at times. The image is NOT that clear, it appears yellow at most times, and just the overall quality isn't the best. I had a VERY cheap cam before this one and I consider the first one better.

That's just it, as historic as Salem is, you want detail. I don't understand why there wasn't a page dedicated to just Salem & surrounding towns.

Nuland also manages, however, to subtly position death's predecessor -- life -- front and center by concluding that \\"The dignity that we seek in dying must be found in the dignity with which we have lived our lives. Ars moriendi is ars vivendi. The art of dying is the art of living...It is not in the last weeks or days that we compose the message that will be remembered, but in all the decades that preceded them.

Highly recommended for those preoccupied with life...and death."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth about death, with compassion!","review":"Face it folks, we are NOT going to get out of this lifealive!! Dr. Nuland gives us a compassionate look at what isin store for us all eventually and gives us a realistic view ofof how our bodies will \\"shut down\\" when the time comes.This book takes away the fear of the unknown and gives usall the information we need without all the technical jargonthat Doctors throw at us when we ask questions.With the fear gone, Dr. Nuland gives hope to those with aloved one (or themselves) of how certain things will occur whenit is \\"our time\\" to meet our maker.An excellent book for the common folks or the professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than merely informative","review":"Dr. Nuland explains the dying process in detail, without sugar coating or sentimentality, in a way that is understandable to the general reader. More importantly, he shares his reflections on this process as a human being and as a doctor. The reader comes away from the book with information and wisdom not easily gained through other means. As someone loooking to revise his living will, I found the book immensely helpful. I should add that I was particularly impressed by Dr. Nuland's humility and his avoidance of all preaching. In so doing he credits his reader with intelligence and challenges him or her to think deeply."},{"rating":"2","title":"eminently important read","review":"A moving and detailed compendium of major causes of death, their physical causes and manifestations, and the effects on a victim's life and family.

While not cozy and comforting, it presents the facts in a wholly acceptable and honest manner.I read this after both of my parents passed away from cancer 10 months apart in an attempt to make some sense of what they endured both mentally and medically. This book provided the answers and a great measure of righteous anger at the attending physicians and their attitudes that somehow they could cure the uncureable right up until the very last moment, depriving everyone of the necessary time to say the things that needed to be said.This book will tell you that you, as the patient, must seek the truth about your illness as it isn't always handed to you by your physician. For the physician, it teaches how to tell the truth without destroying the time left to terminal patients."},{"rating":"2","title":"On my second reading!","review":"Anyone interested in physiology will love this book.

It offers a few first-hand accounts on the fact of death in medical facility, which are detailed and revealing; but then it rambles on with less and less scientific backing, for instance, about why sometimes people feel tranquility in their last moments.

The new ed is pretty much the book from the 90's.Nuland can't be anything but what he is - a surgeon and physician. He has trouble distancing himself from the medical end of life, i.e. you are in a hospital and they are going to do everything in their power/your money to keep you alive. There are times when he does stray from htese roots, but always seems to migrate back to them. Mention is made of hospices and the right to die, but only in passing. Assisted suicide is dismissed, as not an option. He only alludes to having a family physician who is willing to ease you through death.The message I get from him, is that the proper thing is to trust in the AMA even though, they cannot do anything about your certain death, the pain, suffering and costs, it is unfortunate, but just part of the process.Not a humanistic view of death."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"This is a very well written and informative book that is especially relevant clinicians and aspiring health professionals.

I would give it a 3 1/2 rather thana 4, to be honest. Some songs are great, like Crushed Like Fruit or Mosaic, but some are just filler material. It gets old quite quickly. The lyrics are sometimes unimaginative or pretentous, and deal with the same themes - death, suicide etc. But there are some moments on this CD that make up for the bad parts. Hopefully in their next album they will have matured, which will definitely improve the sound and lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant debut from the essex trio","review":"This an amazing debut album from the upcoming essex metal trio Inme. Songs such as Underdose and Firefly along with the likes of crusehed like fruit and neptune are taken from there singles.

Still, if you want to buy speakers for watching movies from a DVD, you will need Creative FPS2000 which is a package of 5.1 channel decoder (Dolby Digital, AC3, 5.1) and as it is obvious 1 main speaker, 4 satellites and 1 subwoofer. Much more powerful. Even better: the Creative's digital speakers (i think DTT2500) for pure digital sound! It is really disappointing to discover later that you can't enjoy the DVD's features in sound because of the FPS1000 speakers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOWWWWW","review":"Good things do come in small packages. The satellite speakers may be small, but dont be fooled by that, they are LOUD. The subwoofer adds that perfect bass that you need to go along with any sounds you want. This speaker set coupled with the Soundblaster Live! is just incredible. You can definitely hear the difference. And its true what Creative says: \\"Sounds so real - it's live!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Stereo for a reasonable price","review":"Compared to current surround stereo speakers like the Altec Lansing brands, the quality is quite good.I experimented by playing Half-Life (which has excellent 3D surround sound), and Planetscape Torment. The sound quality for both was excellent. However, the surround sound quality for Half-Life was patchy. This might've been more to do with my room than the speakers.The speakers are marginally less useful for playing CDs on. For some reason, the volume for CD playback is slightly lower than for game sound effects.In summary, if you're looking for surround stereo speakers and can't afford the more expensive Altec Lansing brands, then I definitely reccommend this one. Just remember that surround stereo sounds better in an enclosed room."},{"rating":"1","title":"unacceptable interference and no service","review":"What a disappointment. After reading all these glowing reviews, I get a set and they act as a radio receiver. Nothing I can do to cut the interference, a constant buzzing and the voices of dueling DJs. I've tried all the remedies suggested by Cambridge and nothing works. I have tons of electronic gadgets in the house and nothing else does this. Something peculiar in the design that picks up several local radio stations at once. I agree that the sound is terrific when I'm playing loud music that drowns out the nasty buzz. But I can't play anything quiet, and I can't tolerate the noise when I'm not playing music. I thought one set was defective, so I replaced it and the second one, although not quite as bad, is still intolerable. The service I get from Cambridge, on top of it, is snotty, like they won't believe me. I'm not lying."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Original","review":"The intersection of country, soul, and blues. What makes Young stand out is his ability to blend these styles effortlessly. Where some efforts at genre bending sound forced (Flying Burrito Brothers, for example), Young never sounds like he is out of his element. Of course, it helps that he has that voice. His song writing is evocative and uniformly excellent. \\"All Her Lovers Want to be the Hero\\" is worth the price of admission by itself. It's a classic country weeper with a twist: the woman who sleeps with the \\"men of the night\\" is not pitied, but rather celebrated for her independence and refusal to be tied to one man. His choice of covers is always spot on. Rodney Crowell's \\"Home Sweet Home (revisited)\\" is an epic tale of the new south and a welcome alternative to the simple pandering of much of the southern rock of the seventies. As Waylon Jennings (supposedly) once said about Young, \\"If he gets any better, we'll have to break his thumbs.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Get it at the library because price is way too high","review":"I agree with others that the publisher had better start lowering his prices or we will start using the library again when we want one of their books.I love Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch character but not at this price for my Kindle.Maybe I made a mistake and should have bought a Nook!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why no bundle pricing???","review":"I know that this review is not about the book itself but I do want to voice my opinion too. Why would I want to buy the Kindle version when you can get the hardcover or paperbacks for much less? I also noticed that if you buy vol. 2 & 3 together you get a better deal.

I agree...I won't buy this until the price goes down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Bosch Novels (1&2)","review":"The Harry Bosch Novels (both volumes 1 & 2) introduced me to Harry Bosch and Michael Connelly. These are great police procedural stories as well as very well done mysteries. I could do with a little less of Harry's attitude, but it plays well, too. Except that no hierarchy would put up with the extremes of the attitude. The six novels included are very much worth the money and are excellent reading.

Gordon states that he wanted to create an album which paid homage to the Big Band days using todays tech and inovations with you sitting in the middle of the band, and man I mean he nails it! The only down side is when I got to the end of the disc I just wanted more.If your system has the capability to decode DTS, then stop the auto play and go to the main menu, system setup, select audio, and choose DTS. On my system there is a huge sound improvement over Dolby Digital for this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunned And Disappointed","review":"I was feeling like a kid at Christmas when I found that the Big Phat Band had a dvd for Swingin' For The Fences. The CD is a real favorite of mine and with all the new technology and the high-definition improvements available for video, I expected another awesome gem to add to my music library. What I felt I got was a real rip-off.Some may think the music carries the dvd, but my interpretation of a quality dvd is action to go with the music. This collection of still photos as the music plays along is a joke.I'd suggest Mr. Goodwin talk to the producer of Lee Ritenour's latest dvd release \\"Overtime\\" to find out how to put out a product that will give you goosebumps because of quality music and video together!If I could have given this a lower rating, I would have in an instant! If your thinking about getting this purchase, I suggest just get the cd - the music is awesome. If you want still pictures, don't spend $25 for them.

I'm sorry, we didn't listen to the same album?","review":"*A note from Noath*This is only my opinion, so if you like this band good for you** Ok, so I read a couple of reviews about this album by Emory, and even heard a clip of it on MTV2 (I should have known then and there to avoid it....) so I bought the album. This was my mistake. I try to be open minded. I even like some of the nu-metal bands. But this falls into the wuss-rock area. This album may appeal to pre-teens or something, but for metal, screamo, or hardcore fans, be prepared to be massively dissappointed by this cd. Bottom line I wasted (...). I couldn't bring myself to listen to the whole thing, it is destined for the resale pile at my local music store, if I get $1 for it I will be lucky.

There is simply no rythm to the cd as a whole, it's mainly emo-style singing and screaming thrown in for good measure.On top of that, they use preachy christian lyrics. Yes, this is a christian \\"hardcore\\" band, so get it at your own risk.I prefer a cd with varying songs, proper singing, and without having to listen to a sermon."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY","review":"I am NOT a fan of screaming music. I love emo, but i was shying very far away from screamo. A lot of my friends are into hardcore screaming stuff, but i just kinda grimaced and made fun of it.

I was so excited to be able to go up to my friends and tell them that i had actually found a screaming band that i liked, only to find that 4 of them had bought the cd over the weekend. You can actually understand the words they're saying, i would never take the screaming out for anything, and its just awesome, beautiful, fun, awesome awesome awesome music! I saw them a few weeks ago and they are just as good live as on the cd. Definitely a must have!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can't Believe It's Not Butter","review":"I accidentally stumbled across this band a few months before the whole \\"emo revolution\\" where everyone from grannies to hipsters is singing Helena, Ohio Is For Lovers or Bat Country. God..my ears can't take it anymore. Then for me to find emo, I mean good emo..well, I just couldn't believe it! Emery is a good band from all the American emo bands I've heard before. I absolutely adore the lead singer's unique voice. It's not whiny nor nasally, and it strangely soothes me. The actual music is splendid, it's just right. There isn't a chord they've strummed yet that I do not like. I must say that the band's only downfall is the screaming.Unfortunately, the screamer/singer(scringer?) sounds as though he stuck his head in a garbage disposal. This completely ruined the experience for me, but I'm learning to accept the awful noise as I really like everything else about them. I suggest checking out 'Fractions', the best song on the album. God, why did they scream.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great one from tooth and nail","review":"this album is flat-out awesome. every song. i can hardly put it into words, but here goes. This album has good variety, good singing, good screaming, ang great guitars and drums.

This a CD you will not get sick of. Another great thing about the guys in this band s there faith in God, they love Christ which is what they share at their shows. \\"Weak's End\\" is a powerful album with awesome sreaming, singing, amazing guitar rifts, and produced very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing music","review":"This is the the music that grows on you the more you listen to it. I gave it a listen and was carried away into the most well written tunes. Don't get me wrong this isn't the fire theft but its still amazing.

Listen to Emery."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret...","review":"Emery is a great band! No joke about it. Good lrics and great music. Since it is a matter of taste, I can't force anyone to buy it.

Anyway, I absolutely recommend this album for any fans of the emo revolution. This is probably the definition of emo, but with a harder edge. I was first introduced to Emery through their sophomore album, The Question. Although I enjoy a few songs on that album, I was hesitant to give this one a chance because I was afraid it would be compiled of a few good songs and nothing else. However, The Weak's End is an all-around better album, much more liberating and painful emotionally. You can feel the emotion in the words, the voice, and the music. The Question seems to miss that element of actually believing that they feel what they are playing and singing about.This album is one to grow into loving, you must really pay attention to all of the elements it is composed of. My favorite songs are 1-7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This album is loud and soft, heart wrenching and uplifting, intelligent and catchy. They draw heavily from the recent Florida based emotional rock scene and also from modern hardcore. A recipe that you might think is being over done these days, but this album has been done right. Screams turn to beautifully sung melodies effortlessly, and break downs turn into complicated spacey riffs with in moments. This album is awesome, and from I hear, even better to see live."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've heard of them for quite some time.","review":"I've known them even before their release of this cd, i had the cd a few months before had. They actually live in the town I'm currently living in right now. And the drummer works at are local Starbucks. They are an awesome band, If you like screamo music (vendetta red, The Used, Senses Fail...etc.) You will love their lyrics with the added bonus of good flowing music. Their best song though I liked since i first heard of them was Walls, and that was even before they released this cd and before my friend gave me a copy to check out. They sound so good. A must buy to add to your screamo collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"are you listening ?!?!","review":"this band wow. they blew me away.. if you like the screaming and the singing this is the band for you. they put on a great live show and they have awesome lyrics that almost anyone whos ever been in love can relate to. they arent just another emo band they have more to them and extra something about them. if there is one cd this year to check out it is this one. its amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is BREATH TAKING!!!","review":"Emery is all that defines great music(rock genre): emotion, heartfelt, melodies, breakdowns, they have it all. I bought this cd a while ago, right when it came out, I fell in love with their music. The melodies that break into screaming are perfect, the lyrics are incredible. I can't describe how I feel about this cd, it's that good. I had the priveledge to see them live this past sunday in Ashland, OR, not only do they have a great cd, they are one of the best live bands I have ever seen. These guys will blow you away.

I've never liked the music of Jesus Christ Superstar but after hearing this CD I simply love it.Joanna Ampil as Mary Magdalena is great, she was the reason for me to buy the cd (after seeing her in Miss Saigon: WOW!). Even though \\"I don't know how to love him\\" has been sung many many times by many people, she made a whole new song of it and gave it her own interpretation, which was great. Her \\"Everything's alright\\" and \\"Could we start again please?\\" were sung in a very sweet way, which I loved.Steve Balsemo as Jesus was also great, that guy can sing! I was amazed that he could sing so high without singing false. His \\"Gethsemane\\" almost made me cry (and believe me, I hardly ever cry when listening to a cd).The rest of the cast is also very good. The guy who sings Judas (I forgot his name...) is great and so is the rest.If you haven't bought the cd yet: buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a 'must'","review":"Actually, I think they've done a good job but compared to original concept album....not so much strong.

Having an extra battery or two can really save you if you find yourself low on battery (and with the D200's big screen, you can eat your charge if you reply on previewing your shots too often).In the past, I have purchased clone batteries for my D100. While I saved about $10 at the time, I ended up regretting it when the battery corroded my D100 handgrip. I was lucky though, as I have heard stories of Li-ion batteries catching fire and exploding.Not that the original EN-EL3 does not fit the D200, but I believe this battery does work in the D100 (and other nikon DSLRs).Nikon has a good track record with batteries; in particular, they had a recall of the original EN-EL3 with information available online and at camera shops.

This is a video of a 1961 B&W film, complete with scratches and splices. If you want to learn Kendo, find another video. Gives cursory attention to basic forms; includes some history and philosophy. No slow motion, no bells and whistles. The narration was dubbed in one take, complete with stumbles and mistakes. If you are a collector of martial arts material, it might be worth the money, since this film gives you a chance to see several masters in 4th-8th dans, most of whom have undoubtedly passed away, given that they were elderly when the film was made 40 years ago.

It's almost impossible to find the power, grace, and fluidity these expert fencers exhibit in modern competition kendo which has abandoned technique and effectiveness in favor of the scoring point, the match, and the trophy.

The problems are pretty good as well.Relevant concepts are covered in the following order:1. The real numbers and their properties2. Metric spaces, basic topology, open and closed sets3. Compactness (kind of a big deal, especially later on)4. Sequences and series5. Continuous functions6. DifferentiationThis, to me, is probably the best way to learn things.

But some subjects in the book are disturbing. He covers the unlikely fusion of new age ideas with military strategies. Sometimes I thought the purpose was just to cynically use the ideas for a cover for black operations. If death and torture can be made to seem absurd or funny, the public is not outraged by it. For example, Ronson covers the musical torture of playing children's songs over and over and how one man involved with the CIA might have been killed by an LSD overdose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its not a conspiracy book","review":"If you are looking for investigative journalism or novel writing this book will let you down. None the less I did find this book very interesting to read not to mention many people on the train going to and from work gave me odd looks as I read this on my commute. The book kept my interest, it sort of veers off in different directions but then gets back to where it started. I haven't seen the movie yet, but it was a good odd read, so if you want to read something that is a bit odd...this book is the right one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Droll and on target","review":"I got this in the airport, and was vastly entertained. So entertained that I've since read two other Ronson books, \\"Them\\" and \\"Out of the Ordinary\\".No doubt the US military has plenty of more effective research projects than the ones described in the book, however, the relentless parade of howlingly funny new-age tripe and psychic mumbo-jumbo made me laugh out loud more often than any book I've read in years.I recommend Ronson's other books, as well. My confidence in human nature has crumbled after these expos��s of human absurdities."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Men Who Stare at Goats","review":"This book has a good hook. But it fails to deliver. I tried to keep interested but chapter after chapter failed to deliver anything of substance. It would make attempts to tie things together from a few sketchy details from people obviously not mainstream and I have 21 years of military experience and was very interested in the fact this was touted as a true story. While I believe that the events described are true, the vagueness and lack of detail and follow-thru left me very empty and disappointed that with all the hype this story did not deliver. This writer has an agenda and while I agree truth is stranger than fiction if you claim a true story and stake a claim fully string your fact together and make your case stick!

Perhaps because he insults his subjects, approaches them with disdain and ridicule.America has its kooks and eccentrics, but we rather like them. Ronson adopts the smug smirkiness of a David Letterman to get a few yuks.Then he decides the war on terror is a joke.I found his THEM to be engaging, mostly because he found that some of the \\"wackos\\" were just guys having a good time, and it was those who believed in the \\"Thems\\" that were the weirdos. for example, the Bohemian Club. In \\"Goats\\" the um, kid gloves are off, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio book review","review":"Jon Ronson's book is a work of genius. The film is, well, OK. The audiobook is just plain embarrassing. The book is very quirky, funny and (in a nerdy liberal way) intellectual. The narrator sounds like he's doing a voice over for a hemorrhoids commercial. And not one of the leading brands. I've never heard such a lack of inflection outside of a Philip Glass opera. On the plus side, he does manage manage to pronounce most of the one of one and two syllable words correctly, but more than that and it's a bit of a crapshoot.

This was just awful. The writing was a bad choose-your-own-adventure novel. The plot, if you can call it that, was aided along like a trashy TV drama that uses the theme for Jaws every few seconds to keep readers interested. The characters were less formed than the results of my Montezuma's Revenge. Perhaps this style works for those who can stay amused by the piece of paper with \\"For a big surprise, turn this over!\\" written on both sides.

Eventually he was \\"retired\\" because of his weirdness.Other material covers wild-ideas for weapons - eg. a \\"death hologram\\" used to scare a target individual to death, and killing a goat by staring it to death. Supposedly an alien race attached a canister containing virus to the Hale-Bopp comet - intending to drop it on earth to eat all the plant life.The material rambles, is not credibly documented, and lacks any point."},{"rating":"1","title":"uuhhh....crap...","review":"Fascinating tale?

I heard great things about it and was excited to delve into it, but I just found the style of writing too hoaky. It is an interesting topic and I wanted to understand the facts and history of it, but the author's forced jokes into every paragraph became a distraction.

For example, he quotes the Iraqi propaganda materials dropped on US armed forces members that said \\"your wives are back at home having sex with Bart Simpson and Burt Reynolds,\\" and then says that the US propaganda was obviously more effective than that.

O'Bannon has a decent track record for genre pictures, and everyone else here seems to think this a faithful rendition. Sure, the original story is relatively intact, but what about atmosphere? There is no trace of those obsessional qualities that make Lovecraft's fiction so engaging. The music is lousy, the dialogue dubbing as bad as any chop-socky bomber, and the acting basically faxed in.

Lovecraft, this one is the most loyal to Lovecraft's original story, \\"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward.\\" The other best Lovecraft films took liberty with the original short stories- Re-animator, From Beyond and Dagon. This one had some nice gore and good-looking monsters. At one point in the film, there is a graphic scene of a fat man with his rib cage opened, guts and all. What I like most from this film is it is an alternative to the utterly bland world of mainstream films. Lovecraft is cult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faithful Adaption","review":"This is the most faithful adaption of an H.P. Lovecraft tale that I have ever seen. It is based upon the novella \\"The Case of Charles Dexter Ward\\", one of Lovecraft's masterpieces. The film doesn't bring about the sense of dread and horror that Lovecraft easily manages to evoke in hos story, but it is reasonably faithful to the storyline. It is updated to a modern day setting, and some of the more doubtful aspects of Lovecraft's tale are updated (the substituion of a private detective for CDW's uncle, for example). The emphasis on the history of the sorceror who possessed CDW is not emphasised enough, but on the whole a very accurate treatment. Unlike most horror flicks, there is little extra violence or nudity added where the plot does not call for it. A very good film, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"like real horror movies used to be!","review":"wow! i can't believe anyone would not like this movie, unless you are a FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART III, and up, lover, or have no real horror aptitude. this is as the horror genre used to be, when it was tasteful. no cheesy horror comedy, which seems the dish to be served as of late. when did horror and comedy suddenly become the same genre ? horror is horror and comedy is adam sandler, and the two should not cross paths. buy this, great price!, turn down the lights, and prepare to be spooked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke right after warranty","review":"This little viewcam stopped working right after the warranty.

It has little support from the steel frame of the bench.The frame began swaying back and forth at the joint that connects the bench to the front feet after about 6 months of use. That probably was partly due to my using a little more than the maximum rated weight on the leg attachment (I used 160 lbs, max was 150).I was not impressed with the design of this bench or the quality of the materials used in it. I stopped using it when it seemed like a safety hazard to continue using.Aside from going over the max weight on the leg attachment, I went easy on the bench, trying to keep it in workable shape.

Marine? Them Hueys in the movie was ARMY Air Cav, slick! \\"First of the ninth--air mobile.\\" If you're going to dally down that primrose path, at least get it right.Better yet, drop the choppers. Most people who listen to Wagner probably realize that quality of an artistic work has a mystically inverse relationship to the number of helicopters contained in it.As for the music, it is good, but the operatic equivalent of sound bites, which may be just right for people who are new to Wagner or just can't take very much of him.

He sticks to what life was like for a junior officer in command of an infantry company - disorientating, stressful and very dangerous.On the strength of this book MacDonald was selected to work on the famous Official History of the US Army in World War Two, and produced two of the best regarded volumes in that definitive series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous view of the war through the eyes of a soldier","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The book provided a very real perspective on WWII through the eyes of a soldier in the midst of battle.

I also appreciated the feelings of dread and helplessness they felt as they were put into and pulled out of battles. I could barely put the book down. Maps are the place where this book falls short.

Almost all of the songs use the same instruments in the same manner; song after song after song. I like \\"wilted rose\\" but not enough to make up for the rest of the songs.

You have to know that when you get it. (Although you probably haven't heard of this if you don't like Barenaked Ladies).The first time through this cd I noticed a few catchy tunes and a few songs that I thought I'd never get to like, but each time I listen to it again I like it more. So, don't give up after the first listen, or you'll be missing some great music.Glitterbug is, in my opinion, the best song on the album. Short, clear and super-sweet, with some beautifully simple music.The fact that this album exists at all makes me wonder what's wrong with these songs that the Barenaked Ladies didn't want to use them, because the feel of most of the music and lyrics is the same. Maybe Stephen Page felt these were more personal somehow, or maybe the rest of the band didn't like them. Whatever the reason, it's worth picking up the cd while we're waiting for another Barenaked Ladies cd to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I'm a big Barenaked Ladies fan, so I had to check out this CD.

There is absolutely no consistency of tone, or voice. If you're a fan of Bob and David's work, you may ask; how could it not be funny? Well, according to their own website, they \\"lost control\\" of it.

For those of you who are fans of Mr. Show and the original Ronnie skit, you aren't gonna find much new here. Pretty much a rehashing of that same skit, which plays (the skit) hilarious for the ten or so minutes it was on, but not enough material to develop into a feature length film worthy of Bob and David's talents. Granted it is pretty fun to watch with other friends who are familiar with the show, but the laughs get spread pretty thin. I subconsciously hoped that the movie would somehow segway at certain points to another skit, as Mr. Show did so brilliantly over its 4 seasons. The movie's worth a view for you die-hard Mr. Show fans, but can't say I'd add it to my collection.

After many, and finally, painful laughs, I have decided that I was rewarded with what I expected: a funny movie. Nothing more.(Note: If you are a stodgy, dry type, please don't view this movie.

He risks his life and with his friend Loor, they try to save the planet.I liked this book because it was full of suspence and excitement. there were a few surprising parts and an asasination but it was very breath taking. The characters used good ideas to get out of trouble, but it always messes up so they find another way.There was a little bit of death and a main character died but it wasn't a massacer. The author left you at a cliff hanger at the end, but it catches you to read the next book.All in all it was a great book that I intend to keep forever.I loved them and I hope the author keeps writing.

I never expect the acting in B-horror to be award worthy, but if the actors can't act scared, It's hard for the viewer to be scared. One more complaint is Pumpkinhead seemed to be very limited in movements in this 2nd film. He moved like a kid playing with an action figture of Pumkinhead from the first film.

I picked up Roxxi since she's one of my favorites, but I'm disappointed with her. For the \\"lil' devil\\" of the Bratz girls, I don't like the fact she looks \\"angelic\\" in her absolutely non-traditional martial arts outfit (what happened to authenticity?) with purple eyes and softer facial makeup (I rather like the style of the original Roxxi as well as the Rock Angelz version with the edgier makeup and the kick-butt attitude of the doll.) Overall, Roxxi is cute, but she gets 4 stars for lack of authenticity (even Meygan's bowling outfit is more suited to the sport!) and failure of her designers in keeping with Roxxi's edgier look!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent concise overview of the period.","review":"_The Age of Charlemagne_ offers an excellent concise overview of the political and military history of the Carolingian Empire. David Nicolle, perhaps Osprey's top author on medieval subjects, gives the usual Osprey coverage of the military development and organization of the era, in this case the gradual introduction of stirrups to western Europe and the rise of early fighting cavalry. However, perhaps due to the paucity of historical material on these topics, Nicolle also includes a brief but thorough history of the Empire itself. The factors cited for its fall in the early 900s CE include encroachment by Saracens and Magyars, raids by Vikings, and the inability of the offense-designed Carolingian military system to adapt to a defensive role. _The Age of Charlemagne_ details the military history of this early medieval period and provides a valuable overview of the political history as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I love my new Alfi Albergo Carafe. Nice quality, liter size works well, and the tea filter is great. We have been amazed that it holds the heat as long as twelve hours on occasion. Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very happy","review":"The carafe has a plastic insert with a strong smell. There was no instruction how to pull it out (instructions were very general, incomplete and written in not very good English). I did not get any response from the factory, so I did not have a choice and had to return it. Also, for this price the outside of the top should have been plated better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price!","review":"Not wishing to spend hundreds of dollars on other Alfie products, I chose this one. The vessel is gorgeous and really does keep liquids very hot for a very long time. I've not tried it with cold liquids. I use mine for coffee service, so I removed the tea diffuser. I would recommend this product. The only negative I can find is that it doesn't hold the capacity I was expecting for the size. 8 cups? Also, unless I'm doing something wrong, it's not 100% sealed. Leaks ever so slightly from top when inverted. My original Alfi didn't do that. Still, it's a great product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iggy Pop - 'Heroin Hates You' (Other People's Music)","review":"I had a tough time finding a copy of this CD.'Heroin Hates You' was recorded at a Los Angeles gig in November, 1979. From the sound quality, I believe this may have been a soundboard recording. This is the title's first authorized release as it's been put out before as a 2-lp bootleg. So,when you get 'Heroin...', you won't get side four of the boot. Rest assure, this is still a great archive show by the Igster. The line-up for this gig included original Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock and The Damned guitarist Brian James. Who could ask for more? As for the tunes, most of them are good to hear played live, I liked \\"Real Cool Time\\", \\"Dog Food\\", \\"New Values\\", \\"Five Foot One\\" and \\"No Fun\\" the best. Comes with a 16-page informative booklet. One of those CD's that's nice to play after 2 am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sound Quality","review":"I am a huge Iggy fan. I own all official Iggy / Stooges albums and many \\"unofficial\\" or bootleg releases. The sound quality on this CD is poor. The sound is muffled throughout and you can hear the \\"tape hiss\\" during quiet sections. However the show itself is really good. I recommend this for Iggy completists and for its historical value of a recording with Glen Matlock (Sex Pistols) and Brian James (The Damned)."},{"rating":"1","title":"$475??!","review":"$475 is an insane price for this drive (PATA). Compare this price to a currently available 2.5\\" SATA drive and see why. I believe they no longer manufacture 7200 RPM 2.5\\" PATA drives which is the only explanation for the price. If you need this older style drive, you are better off putting that $$$ to a new computer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does less than 1 mile mean anything?","review":"I purchased this tube as a spare for rides. After replacing a flat, loading the CO2 cartridge to proper pressure, and setting off, this tube burst within a mile. Needless to say, I'm buying my tubes from local bike shops now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic CDRw drive!","review":"What a great drive! I still can't believe how fast I can create my own music CD's. Right out of the box it performed without any glitches. I have read alot of opinions/comments from alot of people, so I knew that HP was the way to go. Don't waste time with so called bargain drives. Get this one it's the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"better forgotten","review":"Hilda Doolittle in my view was a great poet, if a minor American poet, but one that deserves a wide reading audience. Ethereal. Her prose works, novels, memoirs, and stories are very uneven and some are far better forgotten. For example, some of the post-live writings of Hemingway published to make money for Hemingway's family and his publisher would have been far better not published because fragments, unfinished, or in some cases mere exercises for what he wanted to publish. So it is with H.D.I have not yet read his disguised fictional memoirs so I cannot asses them, ... yet. But these stories simply do not add to H.D.'s stature even if they do shed a little, too little, light on her as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP's software policy sucks","review":"I bought HP's 8GB tape drive about 20 months ago. At the time it shipped with only a Windows 95 version of the backup program. When the Windows 98 version became available 3 months later, I was informed that it would cost another $35 to get a \\"new\\" version of the software. The title for this review says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canceled Order","review":"After reading all the reviews for sony camrecorders, we have selected this product with my fiance which we will used it in our honeymoon coming in 2 weeks time. Although It was on-stock and after ordering sucessfully, I have received an email just saying that my order has been canceled, without explaining the reason. So I wrote to customer's service and they replied me that the seller of this product \\"was temporarily unable to accept payment through Amazon web site. (This can happen for a variety of reasons.)\\" They are sorry for inconvience and hope to see me again soon! I have appreciated amazon all the time and recently (just before receiving cancelation email) ordered an ipod for my cousin as well. But now I am not sure if you can see me EVER again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I ordered these rotors for my daughter's 2004 Toyota Corolla. Within 4 months and less than 6000 miles, the rotors were warped. I wrote to Centric to ask about a warranty return, but they did not have the decency to respond.The OEM rotors lasted about 100,000 miles. Centric claimed their rotors were better. Don't waste your money on the Centric rotors - buy OEM replacements when you need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Last","review":"I am disappointed because I expected more from these Centric rotors. They developed a mild warp about a year into service on my 2003 Corolla. I am careful not to run through standing water and have been easy on them. The Centric name once stood for quality, but I can no longer recommend them. The E-Coating looks good but is worthless if the rotors warp in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Speakers for the price","review":"I have owned these speakers for almost a year and have been very pleased with them. I use them for gaming, playing audio CD's on my PC, and hook them to my TV for better sound. They provide great sound and sufficient power. The Bass is truely exceptional (PC Gamer loved the sub-woofer). I love these speakers, but I might now opt for the Creative-Cambridge PCWorks FourPointSurround , though I haven't tried them."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABC - That says it all","review":"If you are dumb enough to get your news from ABC, then by all means, buy this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collection of Government Articles","review":"One should always read the product description carefully--I didn't.As far as I can see, this is a collection of publically available government documents, most (all?) available on www.fueleconomy.gov.The description clearly says this. It just didn't sink in for me. So if you want a copy of all the articles on one DVD (maybe for searching purposes), then this is for you. Otherwise, the same information is available on the web."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TERRIBLE RECORDING","review":"It pains me seriously to give Basie one star. How did this mess happen. The charts are classic with Freckle Face, Woodside, Basie and Whirly Bird. The side men are the best in the business at the time. Such stars as Sonny Cohn, wonderful Al Grey, Eric Dixon, Freddie Green (the time machine) and, even, the best drummer Basie ever had - Butch Miles - all participated. Finally by the early Seventy's Basie had matured to the point that he was a way of life with great insight into how a band should sound and had reached a level of financial clout to demand the best. So what happened? The sound engineering is awful! One could get better sound quality recording your six year old's class play. Amazingly it is consistantly bad at two different locations in two different countries. Apparently the recording engineer traveled on the bus and should have been jetisoned out the window on the Autobahn. Don't buy the record unless you really need to be infuriated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abosultely Fabulous","review":"This is a very detailed and in-depth list of the arms of the rolls existent during the reign of King Edward I.

Very Nuala Anne; definitely Greeley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Venusians?","review":"What exactly were the Venusians? It doesn't really matter as not a lot of this movie made sense, but that makes perfect material for the MST3K crew. They are spot on, but the movie feels like a snail riding on the back of a turtle (a REALLY SLOW turtle)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the kind of movie MST3K was made for!","review":"B-rate Soviet sci-fi! It may not be the best episode MST3K has to offer, it does fit the series perfectly as a film to be riffed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it unless...","review":"Don't buy it unless you can wade through pages and pages of unsubstantiated accusation and anti-american propaganda. The author has to be on the payroll of the Castro government. The bias is most transparent and quite unconvincing. He leaves a great many of his arguments unproven. Didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Propaganda Piece.","review":"The Sources on Alleged and known Activities is from The Castro Regime, So of course everything prior to 1959 was EVIL. and everything after is great. This is coming from Ocean Press which is a Known publisher of Propaganda for the Regime. They forgot to include the Castros and his adminstration in this book as they are murderous mobsters and have done more damage combined than any Meyer Lansky or Trafficante can. Don't buy into this poor myth.I read at the local library and wanted to throw it across the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst-designed, most frustrating $75- toy ever invented...","review":"This globe is absolutely horrible to try to assemble. You must own or buy an almost microscopic Phillips-head screwdriver just to install batteries. Even then, the teeny-tiny screw gets stripped, no matter how gently you engage it. Once the batteries are installed, it takes at least 2 people to attach the globe to the base, unless you want to break the ultra-thin, plastic arc holding the globe. What a waste of $75-. Definitely don't buy this, unless you're willing to take a 50-50 chance of having to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchase for granddaughter","review":"Granddaughter wanted a globe for 7th birthday.A talking globe was extra special.It's fun and educational.Too early to judge durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"This \\"remixed\\" version is better than the original.","review":"All I Need is a Miracle gets \\"remixed\\" for the 9-6. Well not really...For those of you who are familiar with the remixed version by Greg Walsh back in the 1980s (in my opinion was better), this 1996 rendition does not really sound that different. For those of you who never heard the remix, this version is pretty much it. What Mike and his Mechanics have done, is re-recorded this song basing it on the Greg Walsh's remix and now this song shines better than ever with it's additional production and extra sections.So while this version is not a remix, it is based on a remix!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my faves :)","review":"I have to say, this workout puts a smile on my face! Very calm and peaceful yet invigorating and challenging. Ellen rivals Tracy Anderson's arm toning in this one! Your arms will feel sore after this workout. In a good way! She uses light weights and big ranges of motion but also has a modifier if you would rather do the workout without weights. In my opinion, Ellen hit it out of the park with this one. You probably will feel like dropping your arms at time during this workout but that's a good thing! I love the graceful blend of strengthening and toning that is incorperated into this workout. Feel good, challenging, and wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slim Sculpt (A.K.A. an awesome workout!)","review":"This is the video I use when my arms need a good toning. I also love the results I get in my inner and outer thighs too. Ellen Barrett is a great instructor and has given me a leaner physic I wanted to achieve. The moves are simple and the pace is perfect (not too intensive that you might want to quit, but you will not get bored and turn it off). The best part about using Ellen's workouts, you might not feel sore after the workout... but the next morning you will!!! Her videos are perfect if you want to add a little something extra to your workout routine. Ellen B's videos are perfect for anyone looking to feel their every best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love The Studio","review":"I have all three Studio workouts and adore them. For me, SS is the hardest of the three due to the upper body work with weights (I only had two pound weights but will try it with one pounders). This has Ellen's signature moves: skater, second position plies, lunges, butterfly and some very unique and nice stretches at the end. I am a workout junkie, low intermediate, and highly recommend The Studio series. I am alternating all three with great results."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Makes My Shoulders Hurt, and Not in a Good Way","review":"I really dislike this video. For one thing, there is basically no cardiac effect. It is much too easy for that. But the more important thing is that it makes my shoulders and neck hurt. They don't feel worked out, they just hurt. I did this video one day, and the next day I didKathy Smith: Lift Weights to Lose Weight, and I felt really worked out and with no shoulder pain. This is the second Studio workout I've bought from Ellen Barrett and I didn't like the other one either. I like her old Crunch videos, but the Studio thing just isn't working for me. Also, on another issue, the music on this dvd is not motivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH ARMS & HARDLY ANY LEG WORK","review":"I was a disapointed in this dvd. The first three sections worked mainly the arms non-stop, and only last section \\"matwork\\" had any leg work at all. I felt it was quite an un-even workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so disappointed because the workout is boring and repetitive; the setting is so unappealing; and the music is loud, irritating and changes at random times in the middle of a exercise set. May be good for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosanna","review":"Excellent work out. Ellen is fantastic. She gives clear direction, is upbeat, and motivating. You feel energized after the workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is NOT for beginners!","review":"BE ready to workout fast and steady. This workout is not for beginners! I really like anything with Pilates added in with sculpting. I don't need any added bulk and I like using lighter weights to workout with instead of heavy weight at my age (early 50's), heavy weights hurt my joints. With this workout I feel long, lean and strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right!!","review":"I have been a fan of Ellen since I began doing Pilates. And this workout doesn't disappoint. Like other reviews there is a lot of upper body work but if you really listen to what she is talking about while you do the arm work you focus and use your core as well. She is soothing and calming through this very flowing workout. It does use light hand weights but the moves are shown without weights by another lady in the workout. I really enjoyed this workout and would recommend it to anyone who wants a different twist on Pilates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent toning workout","review":"This workout is the one I turn to when looking for a Pilates type strengthening workout. It helps me get into \\"golf shape\\" and usually feel it the next day. If I need more aerobics, then I do a short 30 minute workout prior to this one. I love Ellen and have several of her workout dvds. She's very good at cuing the next move and her voice is happy and encouraging - which makes it a fun workout. I always feel good after her workouts. If you're just starting out, Ellen shows easier levels on all moves and you progress as you build strength."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function W(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-e8451d14"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/68.md","filePath":"quotesmag/68.md"}'),R={name:"quotesmag/68.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
