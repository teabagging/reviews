You know when they have a minute of the same joke (Like when Peter banged his knee in that episode of the parody of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\"). They use it all the time now!

Good effort, but Ive seen it, I know it, I dont need to see it again.The second problem with this is the jokes.Just like the Stewie Movie, the good jokes are scarce.There is one running gag throughout involving Peter and a great Meg appearance that got me going, but other then that there arent many good lines for any of the other characters.That and a song that I could have done without.Rent it, or if your a serious Family Guy fan buy one of the dvds used for cheap, but I cant see spending real money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compared to the show","review":"In my opinion, Blue Harvest is disappointing compared to the TV show.

The movie is ok, well thought out, but the kick in the groin is the one time only download. You would think they would treat their loyal fans with a bit more respect.

Or maybe just pretentious.The jokes in this are stale, and have been done over and over already.

I own the DVDs and watch it every chance I can. That said, \\"Stewie Griffin- The Untold Story\\" is one of the least funny attempts at comedy I've ever seen. It makes \\"American Dad\\" seem funny. I don't know what happened. My guess is a contractual obligation forced MacFarlane into banging out a script over a weekend. I'd bet a good fifty percent of the material was pulled from the bag of jokes that didn't make it into previous episodes. And the storyline about Stewie and his dad/older self/brother was entirely horrendous. Sloppy, boring, and amateur.I could go on and on but I've wasted enough time this one. With the exception of one laugh out loud moment- the sexy party- this dud was limp from start to finish. What happened Seth?

It was an hour and a half of poorly written jokes and four letter words. Don't get me wrong - I wasn't offended by the language. I just think it's sad Family Guy has stooped to using crude language rather than clever jokes. If Meg getting made fun of for being boyish, Lois dropping the f bomb, and Chris yelling random things loudly sounds funny to you, then buy this. This ranks up there with Dumb & Dumberer and Saving Silverman as one of the least funniest movies of all time. Yeah - that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"i am watching this as i write","review":"yes i was watching family guy as i wrote this review. family guy is an outstanding mature animated series and stewie is one of the most unique characters ever written for a cartoon. his \\"evil genius\\" theme and constant attempts to kill lois, his mother are hilarious. giving him that odd football head and snotty british accent are bang on. seth macfarlane is a brilliant writer with a very unusual sense of humor. the writing is funny and intelligent. listen for many guest voices that pop up in pretty much every episode. this is one of my favorite of all DVD's and i highly recommend this for inclusion into your library"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Guy Presents Stewie Griffin- The Untold Story","review":"Yeah this movie has funny scenes in it,Stewie and Brian spend time together once again,But further into the movie Stewie finds the man that looks like him by himself.It's a shame I looked at it with the bleeps first but now I watch it with out the bleeps I showed two of my friends this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, yeah..not so much","review":"I am a rabid Family Guy fan.

However, after watching the DVDs of the first couple of seasons within just a few days, it wasn't too tough to figure out the pattern/blueprint for this show. Now I feel it's pretty predictable. Still, I longed for those days when it was fresh and I really liked it. Heard about this one and got it, hoping that it was something old, which had never been aired. While it wasn't that, it was a bit more creative than the Family Guys of late and I did have a few good laughs.If you're a fan, I think you'll like it. I liked it, although I wouldn't watch it again and am glad that I rented rather than bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"When this first aired, it was the first time I'd actually paid attention to Family Guy.

There was very little real satire ...most of it was just a synopsis of Episode IV with different actors and throw in the requisite amount of profanity and toilet humor. There were precious few truly clever scenes and most of them were in the trailer clips. (I did think the scene of the guy sitting in front of his trailer with a light-saber being used as a bug-zapper was quite original, though. And, as an older viewer, I appreciate the \\"Airplane!\\" reference.) And as a Christian I was much more offended by the Storm-trooper Church sequence than the suggestion that \\"the Force\\" is perceived as mostly gnostic anti-Christian. All in all, if you're a Star Wars fan, I would only buy this if you feel you must have a 'complete' collection.

The jokes come at you during the whole movie, and there is enough material to even make grandma laugh. I do think however, that if you love family guy you will enjoy this more than someone who just watches it every now and then on TV. There are some jokes that people might not get if they haven't seen Episodes I, II, and III. For 15 dollars, this movie is worth it to any family guy lover :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a Family Guy fan from its original airing several years ago, and have stayed loyal (despite the fact that the new episodes are sub-par). However, I cannot recommend this DVD, because it just isn't funny. I watched all 88 minutes of it waiting for something funny to happen. It didn't.

Or if it never comes for regular TV dvd players, at this rate i will not buy it because I DO NOT HAVE A PSP.I really hope this is released for at home DVD players, non-portable players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but only if you're a Star Wars fan","review":"As always, the creators of Family guy have made a very funny show, but unfortunately I believe it will only appeal to a limited audience.While the regular show occasionally throws in a Star Wars reference for laffs, Blue Harvest is a faithful recreation of Episode IV: A New Hope. I know a lot of younger fans for whom Star Wars isn't an obsession. While the Jawa noise, or Han Solo REALLY shooting first, elicited peals of laughter from my 37-year old sister, my 24-year old work colleague sat straight-faced and couldn't understand why I was so delighted -- and he's a bigger Family Guy fan that I am! He's much more familiar with Anakin's story from the new trilogy, so the conversation between the two Stormtroopers regarding a drill means very little to him.Overall I found it to be an excellent Star Wars homage, but only a mildly amusing Family Guy episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Guy Force","review":"Family Guy is one THE funniest animation show on TV and this Star Wars farce is another addition to the must have library. I would like to add that the special addition with the T-Shirt is awesome. Its worth the 10 extra dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny spoof at a reasonable price","review":"I saw this on TV, and when the DVD came out with the commentary material, I decided to get it (had a left over gift card from December that I had to blow).A lot of the 1-star reviews are based purely on price, and I think that's unfortunate. $13.00 - $16.00 isn't cheap for 48 minutes of animation, but it's not a ripoff either. The DVD is one episode, but it is also double the length of a regular 24 minute episode. Fans of anime have been paying worse prices for years:)Why not five stars? Because this isn't an epic must-buy in my book. It is a slightly over-priced guilty indulgence that is worth taking if you like smart spoofs and Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"I love Family Guy, so I was really looking forward to this movie. When I saw it, though ... yikes. Many of the jokes seem forced. The timing is often mediocre. Almost everyone goes inexplicably out of character at one point or another. The references to past episodes seem self-congratulatory rather than clever. And most of all, it's WAY WAY WAY TOO LONG.The middle third, written by Alex Borstein, is significantly better than the rest, but even that isn't up to the level of the best episodes. As for the outer thirds -- well, there are brilliant moments everywhere, but they're usually buried in second-rate hackery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good parody.","review":"Not bad at all.

That of course, if you're a Star Wars fan.The jokes are in the usual Family Guy style, so you know what to expect, Toilette humor at it's best. The spoof is so well done and with such detail that you could think that it was drown over the original movie frames, it's uncanny.This is the ultimate box for every collector, you got the movie and the interesting extras (for instance a couple of readings of the next episode,\\"Something, Something, Something Dark Side\\"), the digital copy, a really cool book with original designs for the episodes, a couple of trading cards and a exclusive T-Shirt with spoof of the original Star Wars poster from 1977. It's a great bag of goodies, totally worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big waste of time","review":"Wow! First off let me say that I am a big Family Guy fan and have seen every episode. So when I heard this movie was coming out, I couldn't wait to watch it. Wow I feel cheated out of my time....believe me, you will to. Sure there are some funny jokes here and there, but there were so many sexual inuends and frequent cussing, that it just messed it up.

The whole thing is just 3 modern episodes tied together. And if you read my other Family Guy review, you'd know that I'm not a fan of alot of recent Family guy episodes. And many of the great flaws and negativities of recent episodes are all present in this movie. And even worse, I did not laugh even once throughout the whole movie.

It's sad to say that, because I'd love to own it, but I refuse to buy into Fox mocking the fans.

Volume 3 had what, like 14 episodes max? Anyways, combine that with releasing half of a season (Volume 5), releasing ONE episode for $15, and the \\"Family Guy Movie\\" which was 3 episodes (also aired as the season finale last year)...

It's nice to see Family Guy with not so many non-sequitars and more straight story (although it's not original.) Using Chris as the main character of a double length episode is kind odd since he normally doesn't get much air time in normal episodes.You definitely have to be a big Star Wars fan AND Family Guy fan to find this funny...but if you are both you are in for a treat. The only thing I would change about this is that I think Adam West would have been a better Obi Wan Kenobi and was wasted in the role of Governor Tarkin.This does include some good special features which makes it unnecessary to get the collector's set unless you are really that hardcore of a fan...and want to pay twice as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What????????","review":"I was a very big fan of Family Guy.

Every song is catchy and wonderfully crafted. They're all radio friendly. Yet, somehow, it fails to be the perfect album. It all seems too easy for Damon Gough. It's almost like he's showing off, like he never breaks a sweat. 'Yes, yes, we know you're that talented. Can you push the envelope please?' I've heard everything before. It's archetypal pop. Still, it's hard to knock this album and I am only knocking it because its so good, because it feels so effortless. It's a romantic comedy of a CD starring Hugh Grant playing Hugh Grant. Of course, it's good, how could it not be? But it lacks the heart to make it great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth your time","review":"Finally! A band with a different sound, one that doesn't rely on Oasis-esque drum-licks *shudder* to further their album.

While there are some worthless tracks (Body Rap (a ... Fat Boys sound) Disillusion (an even ... Fleetwood Mac sound comes to mind), as a whole the album is excellent. One of my favorite moments is \\"Bewilderbeast\\", which calls STRONGLY to mind the Beatles' \\"Flying\\" from Magical Mystery Tour.. as everyone but me seemed to ignore that track, I'm glad to see it resurrected in a flattering (except for the last 45 seconds) form!

It is very different to the boy groups around now, and the hard rock also. I am mostly a classic rock, or new rock person, and after the rave reviews about this album, i had to give it a listen. The opening song, \\"the shining\\" has a very relaxing instrumental to start off the song, then comes in Damon Gough, voice. Overall, a very soothing song. After that, the cd DOES NOT go downhill, but only gets better. This cd is one of the best cds to come out last year. Where i live, this group has not gotten ANY airplay on the radio, and that is a shame. Because of that, unless it's played on MTV, people do not know who these groups are.

There's quite a bit of interesting experimentation going on here, but it's fragmented by long intervals of complete garbage. You get the feeling that this album wants to be an eclectic experimentation in the vein of Radiohead's OK COMPUTER, but it's nowhere near as epic or likeable. Simply stated, the production is horridly weak, the vocals are lacking and there's too much fluff (ie, too many accordion, organ, and sound sample interludes in between the actual songs)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Well, Badly Drawn Boy does it again. What a nice album, with so entertaining melodies. This is the kind of music you want to listen while traveling through a beautiful landscape. This is music to relax and to sing along.

One reviewer referred to THOB as \\"futurist folk\\", which is close, but not exact. These 18 tracks morph genres with such ease you smile at its audacity and casual command. In a way, THOB is like Gomez without the belabored mastery. Damon Gough, who is BDB, is like an old blues giant tossing one off for the simple joy of it - nothing to prove, no one to delight but himself, and his listeners, who will continue to discover pleasures after many, many spins.

But Hour of the Bewilderbeast keeps bewildering me. And I keep playing it again and again.It feels like it came from another planet; a highly evolved place where melody, songwriting and production have reached their zenith. During other listenings, it sounds like the album John Lennon and Brian Wilson would have made if they had ever dropped acid and locked themselves in a studio somewhere together.A few words to describe this must-have: Intoxicating. Fresh. Lovely. Trippy. Deep. Inspired. And, of course, I have to add \\"infectious\\" because I can't stop listening to it.

The man has an amazing imagination in terms of songwriting and production and in my opinion, this is the real prizewinner for the indie/art rock community for this year, not Radiohead's Kid A.

Who knows, maybe I'll put it in the CD player in a few years and see the light. For now it's going back in the ever growing stack of CD's that seem like a waste of time and money.

They are very sturdy and solid, and of professional quality. They can be difficult to clean when food gets burnt, but learn to love Bar Keeper's for sure. A good cleaning and they restore back to brand new. As with most pans, the area around the rivets and above the handle on the exterior are very hard to clean, so those become the dirty spots. Nonetheless, these are high quality pans at a great price. Pick these up for sure if your looking for new pans.

Based on the issues I experienced I decided to return this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooks fast, but everything sticks and can't clean!","review":"I bought this set after reading the fabulous reviews, but I seem to be missing something...Everything sticks to the pans, rendering them practically unusable! We've resorted to using our old non-stick pans because these are terrible. No matter how much oil or butter I put in the pan, the food sticks right away and won't come free. Can someone please explain what I'm doing wrong?Then, we have the hardest time cleaning these. Even if I've just boiled some potatoes in the pots, it's practically impossible to clean the residue off. The pans are even more difficult to clean.I'm really disappointed, since we spend all this money on a new set and now don't even want to use it.The only positive about this set, is they do heat up quickly.I've watched a bunch of YouTube videos on how to cook with stainless and how to clean it, I'm not doing anything differently, but yet these still don't work.Would appreciate any techniques people have who enjoy this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleaning is NOT easy! Food sticks to the PAN!","review":"The Cuisinart cookware is more like artwork, that looks good hanging up in the kitchen, but when it's actually used, it's difficult to keep food from sticking in the pan and clean-up is difficult. The cookware says to not use any steel-wool for clean-up, using only soapy water and a dish rag. If that doesn't work, Cuisinart suggests to let the pan soak in warm water or boil the stuff of the pan, returning the dirty pot to the stove (not very practical). The best way to use this stainless steel product is to place a little bit of water into the pan, after spraying it heavily with non-stick (PAM) or using a lot of olive oil. Suggestion: when cleaning of caked on food, heat up the pan and pour cold water on the pan (over the sink) to instantly remove the food ... and you'll likely still use an abrasive pad to remove some food particles. The price is reasonable ... but, the cookware is certainly not the best out there!

I will never ever ever ever order another Cuisinart product again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"useless good looking cookware","review":"I bought the set from Costco when there was a good deal ($150 + tax) and had used the cookware for about one month.

Cuisinart wants me to mail them the pots and lids at my expense, they will determine who is at fault, then they will charge me to mail the pans back. Oh yeah, and they said that the lids are not under warranty - despite that there is the exact problem with the lid handle... so I have a stockpot with only one handle, and a lid for another pan with no handle and the company wants me to be out $40 in postage costs to determine if they are at fault....

Garbage for frying.","review":"After years of use, it was time to replace my non-stick pots and pans. I thought about going stainless but was worried that the non-stick surface would not work as well for frying. After reading reviews, I was convinced that was not the case. I was totally wrong. If you are planning on using any of the pans for frying or sauteing anything delicate, look elsewhere. After you use it the first time, it is impossible to get the surface as clean as it was out of the box. I scramble egg-beaters many times per week and the entire bottom of the pan gets caked with egg. That is even when the pan is properly heated and coated. I made turkey burgers that ended up being ground turkey crumbles after they stuck to the bottom.The fit and finish is very nice and the pots/pans are solid and heat evenly but go with a true non-stick surface if you will be frying anything. I will probably be keeping the pots and buying coated pans.

Like another reviewer said about the spots is right - easily removed with Bon Ami or Barkeeper's Friend - polishes up like new very easily. With eggs, lower the temperature - this helps a lot for less stuck on egg. And lower temps in general, like instructions direct, is the way to go - great heat conduction. I braised a roast on medium heat just fine. Have water ready to pour into a pan when finished to lift off residue. Nice handles, and I have very weak arms/hands with a disability. Not too heavy for me, though helper handles would be nice on the regular saute pans. Still, I love this set. The 3 qt saute pan with helper handle - it does ping a bit upon warm up, as reported."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Bought this set almost a year ago. Couldn't be happier.

Great cookware set and well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal pitting","review":"The first time I used the 3.5 qt saute pan it pitted in two spots on the inside bottom of the pan. I was cooking onions and potatoes. Nothing reactive and using teflon spatula. I'm not taking a chance with the rest of it and returning for refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart pots and pans, multi clad pro set","review":"Over the years I have had many pots and pans, my last set was Circulon and I like these pans much better. The silver non stick was coming off the Circulon and so decided this time to get stainless steel. The Cuisinart pans are beautiful and they clean up well. The handles stay cool and I think they cook much better than any pans I have had. I would definately recommend this product. This shipment came in less than a week and I ordered in December."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at First Sight","review":"I love this set! Don't confuse it with Cuisinart's inferior Chef's Classic line, which only has the tri-ply disk on the bottom, instead of the Multclad Pro's tri-ply construction on the sides and bottom like All-Clad. Food tastes better. I compared these to All-Clad in Macy's and I prefer the handles. All-Clad lids were slightly heavier (pans were not) but the Cuisinart handles were better.It is impossible to keep them looking perfect; the bottoms are getting slightly scratched by my electric stove top. I also cook (sauté, pan fry) using salt, and I've heard that creates pock marks in this cookware if the water isn't boiling. A little Bon Ami, which I use instead of Barkeeper's Friend, takes them back to almost-new condition.I'm going to use and enjoy them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"this set of cookware was recommended as the most best overall set of cookware available, considering health, economy and quality. It lives up to its name! I particularly love that the handles don't get hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cookware at a good price","review":"I have owned Calphalon nonstick cookware for years. But nonstick isn't the right tool for many recipes and I wanted to get a set of cookware that would allow me to go farther. I looked at All Clad, and purchased a couple of the copper core pans. But the high price is a deterrent. So I purchased the Cuisinart MultClad 12 piece set.These pans do a great job on my gas cooktop. They cook very evenly. Thick stew and chili don't stick to the bottom during long simmering. The saute pans brown meat very evenly. I really like the rims--very easy to pour without spills. The All Clad copper core pans don't seem to be any better, though they were certainly more expensive.If you are used to nonstick, you'll find the cleaning to be more of a chore. I have found Barkeepers Friend to work very well to keep the pans spotless.This is fantastic cookware that I recommend highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the price.","review":"Can't beat the quality for the price. My only complaint is the handles on the lids are solid metal, so they get hot if you are cooking something for a long time like chili or pasta sause. They are fine for most applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good quality","review":"These pots & pans are very good quality. They cook evenly and I love that you can put them in the oven. They are not very heavy to lift which is very good since I have bad wrists. But they are heavy duty enough to feel tough. You should never put them in the dishwasher but that's ok they are easy enough to clean. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because they get kinda streaky once in a while and you have to use a citrus juice to clean them really well. Other than that they are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Cookware, Excellent Price","review":"I've never owned good quality cookware before, but I needed a completely new set so I did my research and found out that \\"clad\\" (aluminum wrapped inside stainless steel) was the best generic design. I looked at All-Clad and KitchenAid, among others. Still, Cusinart offered one of the best prices. I was also attracted to the brushed stainless because it would show scratches less. Also, Cusinart was one of the few brands advertised as dishwasher safe.I'm extremely happy with this purchase. Good quality cookware has made cooking a better experience for me. It really does make a difference. While I bought Cusinart because it was dishwasher safe, so far it has cleaned up so easily that I have used the dishwasher only once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookware for life","review":"Love it, love it, love it. After much research, I picked this set of cookware, and I do love it. Some of the other reviewers were right about a few things...my handles can get hot if I'm not careful and the pans are more difficult to clean to keep that bright shine. But it's still fabulous stuff. I wish I had more cupboard space because they are getting scratches from being stacked so tight in my cupboard. But that's life. Love the pans though. I'll have them forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"LOVE IT - first ever stainless steel cookware and so far it has been great. Easy to clean, use Bon Ami if I have too, but soak it after every use. Highly recommend it:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it but............","review":"I purchased the 12 piece set after months of reading reviews. I really wanted All Clad but who can afford it, I wanted a once and forever set of cookware to last me my remaining days, I am a 64 year old wannabe cook. I love the set, everything that I have cooked has turned out great and have ordered additional pieces. Clean up is super and whatever doesn't come clean, Barkeepers Friend takes care of. One problem has come up. I have only used my 8 quart stock 4 times. Light colored spots have appeared on the bottom of the inside, I have tried to clean them with Barkeepers but that doesn't do anything. Is it possible that the stainless steel layer is coming off and I am seeing the aluminum core. If so is this going to cause problems with acid foods like tomato sauces?"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 STAR!","review":"I have been using these pots and pans daily for 3 weeks now.

Very easy to clean. They continue to look just like a mirror. Great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+++ Product, have been really impressed","review":"We got this pan set awhile ago to replace the Teflon non-stick set we got when we were married as we did not feel the Teflon was particularly safe (or at least the best option) for our family. I was hesitant to move to stainless steel as I thought it would be harder to cook on and clean up. I did a lot of research online prior to purchasing on different sets and how to cook with stainless steel properly. I highly recommend the latter as cooking on stainless steel is just different than cooking with non-stick and if you try to cook with stainless steel the same way you cook with nonstick you will be disappointed.We use the hot pan, cold/room temp. oil method with the skillets and I never have a problem with food sticking. This set is nice and heavy and heats very evenly. They are easy to clean and stay clean. We always clean by hand anyway as we don't have a dishwasher. I have very much enjoyed cooking with the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"I am learning to cook and I wanted to buy some quality cookware without breaking the bank. I found this set highly recommended on a consumer site. After reviewing several options, I purchased this set. I was impressed with how quickly it was delievered. The product itself is very good as previous reviews outlined. I have also had great experience with other Cuisinart products. It does take some learning to cook with stainless steel. I'm still learning. I find things stick to it easily. But, then again, it is easy to clean. I think that with all stainless steel, typical cleaning will leave some blemishes due to soaps and minerals in water (hard water). The Bartenders friend is an important part to restore the shine. Overall, I would buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent pans","review":"These are my favorite pans. They clean easily and cook beautifully. I kept only one non-stick pan for eggs, otherwise I use these stainless pans exculsively. If you follow the cleaning directions provided, they are just as easy to clean as my old non-stick Calphalon pans.Very beautiful too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pot set","review":"This pot set is great. I was a little hesitant based on some negative reviews but I'm very pleased with my purchase. the pots are a little harder to clean than non stick but with a little bartenders keeper they come as clean as new. The only downside I would say is that it takes a little longer to cook foods and boil water but once the pans/pots are hot they are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart Multi Clad Pro Cookware","review":"Excellent set of pots and pans.

These pans are very heavy duty and sturdy, distribute heat evenly, and cook wonderfully. I love the way they look both on the stove and on the shelf. I have no problems cleaning them - simply soak big messes overnight & it scrubs right out. There is a bit of discoloration, but nothing a good scouring couldn't get off. I think it makes my pans look well-used & well-loved, which they absolutely are!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MCP-12 MulitClad Pro","review":"I would highly recommend this set. They look absolutely beautiful and are a dream to cook with. They heat up quickly and are easy to clean. I can't wait to add to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not easy on my pots and pans...","review":"I love this set. I've had it over a year now. I wanted to get away from teflon, so we went to stainless steel. The only sticking issue we've really had is with eggs, and if you do it right, it's not a problem. I use the dishwasher for everything because I'm lazy. These pans hold up. They do get discolored from time to time, so I use barkeeper's friend and they shine up nicely. The rivets are the only thing I think won't last when cleaned in the dishwasher, but if they fail, hopefully customer service will be good to replace or fix. It's a really nice set and I'm confident that it will last a long time even with my abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"I absolutely love them. I've went thru many expensive sets and they just don't last. I was worried about them being stainless w/o the non stick but they cook great and clean up easily. I did alot of research and found this set to get the highest reviews. I'm so glad I decided on this set. I've been using them for over 6 months now and I use them everyday, usually more than once, and they are holding up great. I would buy again and would highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers As Promised","review":"They do exactly what other reviewers said. I was pleasantly surprised that the aluminum cladding goes up the sides. That makes water boil a lot faster. FYI they work very well on my glass cooktop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Happy with this Cookware","review":"We've had this cookware for about 2 months now and have been extremely happy with the results. The set seems to cook evenly and is easy to clean. You'll still need a non-stick skillet for certain foods, but overall this has been the best cookware we've owned. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful & Practical!","review":"I adore my Cuisinart stainless cookware set. It is not only pleasing to the eye, it stands up to every test on the stovetop and in the oven. I am now looking to buy a couple of the non-stick pans and other pieces to complete my cookware \\"line up\\"! I cannot say enough wonderful things about the even heating, cleanup, and quality of this product. Thanks, Cuisinart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Cookware Set","review":"This is a great set. It gets some stains every now and again but a little Bar Keepers Friend cleans it up nicely. The pots have a fiar amount of weight to them so you will need to use to hands to hold them when your dishing out food into serving dishes. So if you have a problem holding heavy items I suggest you get someone to help you lift them or simply get a large serving spoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as All Clad","review":"I'll add to the list of folks who have used both and found this to be as good as All Clad. Been using for four years, and LOVE IT. Evenly and quickly heats, easy to clean, and induction ready should we ever get an induction stove. Handles stay fairly cool. Attractive design. I'm very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love these pots","review":"I really wanted All Clad but are you kidding? Not at that price. So read reviews online and was steered toward these. I have had them about a year and use them every day and love them. They are very heavy duty, and heat very evenly. Unlike pots that have the disk in the bottom, they can still burn on the lower edge if your flame is too high. These don't do that.Very impressed with the fit and finish, great cookware for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why We Went To Non-Stick Decades Ago","review":"The only positive thing I can say is that this set is eye candy. There it ends.You live and learn but this is why we went to non-stick decades ago. Plus, these are crazy heavy which adds nothing to their cooking ability. As a 6'2\\", 200 lb, Marine veteran, I'm no weakling but the sticking and weight is just to frustrating.Food tastes so much better when made with love. Love is out the window with this cookware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China","review":"Good price, but what's the cost? Buy American made products. It's patriotic, environmentally conscious (less shipping) and supports our troubled economy.

A hight quality cookware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"The pans all had permanent damage after their first time use. One pan was chosen to be sent back for replacement and Cuisinart took my money and never gave me the pan. Customer Service is horrible and I have filed a BBB report. I have been having a problem with their CS since March. I bought the set in Feb. Never again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap knockoff product","review":"This cookware is a cheaply made in China knockoff of the original Cuisinart French product. The handles are very thin and difficult to grasp and hold onto. Compared these to available store bought Original Cuisinart French cookware at HomeGoods, Marshall's,Macy's, etc and found the better original cookware available there.Always look for the word French, not Chiina when you shop for these. Cheap is Cheap -you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh heck yes! Unbeatable quality and value!","review":"I like the set that we bought when we bought Fisk Mansion East so much that I bought another set for Mansion west. Its a little harder to cook steaks and burgers on stainless until you get the hang of it, but the health benefits, and getting pan fond for sauces, make it a better choice than nonstick. The one All Clad pan I owned in the past was a paella pan. The lid warped the first time I made paella in the oven. I consider these pans to be superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to finally have a great cookware set!","review":"I have purchased several different brands and styles of tephlon cookware over the past few years. I am so excited about this new set of Stainless Steel cookware! I have had them about a month now and I really enjoy cooking with them! I am still trying to get used to using Stainless Steel fry pans, but I'm getting the hang of it.I highly recommend these pans. I am looking forward to owning these for many, many years! They have a nice feel, clean up quickly and easily, and are quite hefty pans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, REAL cookware !!","review":"First, let me thank all of those who wrote a review. After 2 years of reasearch, I selected this cookware, and I am VERY happy with my product!! By reading what everyone else wrote I was ready to \\"step up\\" to a nice set of cookware. It is everything I hoped for. If you do your homework and be willing to make some adjustments, you will not go wrong with this set. Amazon has the best price, have used them in the past, always great to order from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set of cookware","review":"I just received this set of cookware and am pleased by its performance. The only thing that keeps this set from receiving 5 stars is the size of the handles. They seem small for the weight of the pot, especially when you take into consideration the added weight of the cooked food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely as long as you know how to clean...","review":"Love Love Love my set! Are wonderful to cook on gas range.Some people have stated issues with staining but with a little knowledge, that can be easily corrected! Discoloration happens on most stainless steel cooking products. Can be easily resolved either with a little stainless steel cleaner (for serious stains)available at most kitchen supply places or by taking freshly dirty pans (aka right after food is removed)and putting water in to boil away mess then a touch of vinegar to remove impurities left by water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"I've only had this set for about a month but so far, I really enjoy the product. I've used both the pots and pans and both do a great job. I had looked at Lagostina and several other brands from the Bay and Sears but they didn't have several features that this Cuisinart set has - the oven heat rating is the highest I've found and the stay-cool handles are so amazing that I find it hard to believe no other company has followed-suit. I find that food heats evenly and quickly (make sure you follow the care instructions - Never use high heat). I do find that there is some discoloration from cooking startchy foods but I'm pretty sure that's unavoidable and, in the end, that only esthetics anyway. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family. The product was well-priced and with shipping, came to what I'd spend on sale-priced higher end similar item at a local store. Also, it was delivered only a day later than originally indicated so I'm pleased with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent cookware","review":"I bought this set on the advice of other reviews and am very pleased with its performance. It is beautiful to look at and has a great \\"feel\\" to it, solid and heavy but not too heavy to handle with food in it. It cooks even, heats quickly and is consistent. I have had no problems with cleaning (even made grilled cheese sandwiches). I intend to add additional pieces to my kitchen. Just remember, this doesn't cook like non-stick cookware, a little less forgiving. It is more \\"user demanding\\" as it heats quickly and make sure you put water in it right after you remove your food to make cleanup easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"Had been researching cookware and wanted a good set without spending a fortune! This product was a great choice. I love the cookware. It cooks evenly, I have a gas stove, and cleans up very nicely.

The pan came first. I slid it out of the box and it looks amazing. I grabbed the handle to lift it and ouch! It is flat and narrow and jabs into my hand. I compared my 7 year old 12\\" pan and the new one. The old pan is just as heavy as the new one, however, the handles on the old pan are round and fit nicely in your hand.I don't care how great of the cookware this may be, having such terrible handle design is just too painful. I'm sad to say, it is going back :(."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible cookware","review":"I purchased this cookware a couple of years ago and have already gotten rid of them because everything sticks to them including the nonstick spray even with butter!

Definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very pretty and shiney and super light weight with speedy delivery","review":"I was so excited to find a listing on a reputable seller like amazon for such low low price. Upon receipt found that they are NOT 18/10 quality. Promptly returned. This is my third attempt at posting a review for this itrm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trying to avoid Alzheimers","review":"We bought this stainless steel set of cookware because of the possible connection between cooking with aluminum and developing Alzheimers. The set is beautiful to look at. I bought flame tamers as recommended in the instruction booklet that came with the pans. Those are to keep the bottoms nice and shiny. I'm still getting used to cooking with the set because the directions also say to keep the flame low to avoid the pans heating too quickly and burning the food. So far, they are working well and clean up nicely. The only thing that surprised me was that a magnet sticks to them and I read that better stainless steel doesn't hold a magnet because of the high level of nickel contained in it. Anyway, we're very pleased with the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great budget cookware","review":"This multiclad cookware is a great buy.

But, I decided to get some updated pots and pans. First I picked up some from Marshall's. One of the celebrity chef brands. Ohhh - pretty with glass lids! They were awful. Everything stuck and hard to clean and not impressive at all. So after reading reviews I got these instead. I find that they do cook much better and stick much less. I think they cook faster too. The only thing I'd like is the glass lids - it's nice to be able to peek through and see the food cooking rather than lifting the lid and letting the steam out - but luckily I saved a few of the lids from my other pots and they fit - so when I want to - I substitute the glass for the metal lids. I like them enough that I will be purchasing the same brand smaller pot to round out my set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cookware","review":"This product is everything I had hoped.

We finally decided we had to get something and this set is great. After about 6 weeks they have turned out great, no complaints.

Anybody with good tips on not making food stick to the Cuisinart Multiclad, let's hear it. Otherwise I'm going back to my Anolon, which despite it's coating potential for carcinogenity (I get more from just walking on the street 2nd hand sniffing people's exhaust), Anolon cookware is the greatest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Food sticks","review":"even with oil on the bottom, unless you plan on standing in front of the stove the whole time you are cooking to constantly stir, the food sticks to the bottom.

So not worth all that money spent when cheap pots and pans may not work quite as these when these are new, but cheap pans still work, I don't blame amazon as they are strictly logistics, cuisinart should do a way better job for the money, yes its true that heat destroys things, but one would think that cuisinart would've taken into account that people would use them on a hot burner, that is why a person buys pots and pans in the first place, to cook with them, well \\"DUH\\", sorry cuisinart, your product is not as good as you claim it to be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love cooking with these.

I've tried coconut oil, butter, olive oil, low temps, etc. The great things about these pans, though, when I burn the crud out of my eggs, I can just put them in some water immediately, and the burnt stuff just floats off.

Given that the basic construction between the Cuisinart MultiClad and All-Clad is similar, I decided to try the Cuisinart. I love it. All of the pots heat quickly and evenly, clean up is a breeze and the stainless steel looks fabulous. As many reviews have pointed out, cooking at a lower heat and using Bar Keepers Friend for clean up are key. No regrets here - this is a great set.

The same saucepan heated water the next night, and the white splotches began to look rusty. This was a BRAND NEW saucepan. All Cuisinart wants to do is recommend cleaning products to us.

They stated that they are not aware of any problems and that the only change they made is that the pans are now 100% stainless steel and not 18/10. I researched this and found that this change is likely what is causing the problems that people are having with corrosion, pitting, rust, etc. 18/10 means that they add 18% chromium and 10% nickel, which helps with shine and, more importantly, corrosion resistance. This was likely a way for Cuisinart to save money, as nickel is expensive. Unfortunately, it makes this set significantly lower in quality, in my opinion. All-Clad is 18/10, as well as good silverware sets. I really wish I had discovered this set before the change. I would not buy now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frying with 10\\" skillet","review":"I just purchased a 12 piece set of multi clad pro and decided to test the 10\\" skillet out on frying an egg.I let the pan get hot on a medium heat on a gas stove.I tested the heat by put a drop of water in and watched it dance.Than I put about a tbsp on canola oil in the pan and moved the oil over the whole surface including up the sides The egg fried OK so I was sort of satisfied.The big squawk I have is cleaning the pan.I wiped the oil out but the big problem is the brown sticky residue that was left.I put warm water and dish detergent in it and let it soak.I than used a blue scotch brite pad to try to remove the residue but it is still there.I am not willing to spend an hour of more to clean a frying pan.With my cast iron pans I just wipe it out than put some water in the pan and bring it to a slow boil run a brush around it to knock of any residue pour to water out and dry with a paper towel.What I need is some advice in cleaning the multi clad or they will be going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set","review":"I've only owned them for a short time, but so far I would say they are great.They have a solid feel, not thin, but yet not overly heavy like some I have used.

I just wish I would have read the manual before cooking with my first pot. I didn't realize that you shouldn't leave the pan empty while heating and the reason for this is that I've never had a pan that heated so fast. Well I did that and it over heated the pan causing discoloring :( Also it says the maximum stove top heat should be medium high and to never set on high; the high heat is unnecessary and water comes to a boil super fast on medium high.

Big Cats is no kittenish collection; it's a sly, stealthy, mordant, ferocious beast - and not for the faint of heart (though I expect even girlie lit fans with open minds and appetites for the rare will appreciate it).Reinhorn's work has garnered praise from some of America's finest contemporary writers, including Pulitzer-winner Marilynne Robinson - and it's well deserved. Her stories dwell thoughtfully, relentlessly, with great care and quiet mercy, on outcasts and misfits, men and women on the verge and in the midst, at crucible moments of decision and transformation - minute dramas handled with subtlety and generosity, rendered in elegant, engergetic prose.Readers of contemporary literary fiction are sure to admire Reinhorn's debut, and look forward to her next books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, unpretentious short stories...","review":"The stories in Big Cats are few of the most fun, entertaining ones I have read in quite a while. They have an irresistible mixture of dry humor and earnest storytelling. The best part of all is that neither the author nor her work of short fiction comes across as pretentious or contrived. Holiday Reinhorn writes with an unique voice that keeps you turning the pages. The characters in this collection are quirky and struck me as lonely and with very mundane, human qualities that make them all the more compelling. They are not perfect, but they are wonderfully readable nevertheless. My favorite stories are \\"Get Away from Me, David,\\" \\"F--- You,\\" \\"White Dog,\\" and \\"My Name.\\" If you're a big fan of short fiction, Big Cats is one short-story collection that you'd want to read.

Big highlight is when Sinatra, as spokesperson for the camp, demands better conditions and when he doesn't receive them he orders the prisoners to strip and burn their clothes to which a partially-dressed Edward Mulhare(the priest) comments, \\" Sir, I take being a member of the cloth, literally.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie !","review":"I think the cast of stars was exceptionl.

With German soldiers this dumb, Hitler never had a chance.Sinatra and Trevor Howard are actually quite good but are surrounded by second-rate acting talent.

He tells of how his parents abandoned him at the Grand Canyon and his journey to find them.

David Spade suprisingly did a nice job, but the plot was horrible. Between the perverted comments and retarded jokes, Joe Dirt scores lower than dirt on my recommendations. I truly feel sorry for David Spade because this will completely ruin his image. A radio talk-show host gets Joe to spill his life's sad story over the radio. Joe starts off by him being ditched at the Gran Canyon when he was eight. The movie continues as Joe runs into: A copy of Hannibal Lecter, a country girl named Brandy, a witness relocatee (gets him in big trouble), an Indian dude, and a large collection of other completely strange things. Joe Dirt is a complete waste of time and should not be considered a choice when selecting a movie to go see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic yet good story","review":"This is the classic story of the trash tramp who turns into a big time star dude.

I am a big fan of Dennis. This movie highlights the finer points of redneck living in a light hearted humorous manner. Kid Rock is in it...you can tell it is NOT a far reach for him to display the white trash side of life, complete with early '80's Trans Am!!

I like many of the actors in it, but the humor is just so predictable or at times disgusting. I couldn't wait for the movie to end, but found the ending like the entire story, unbelievable and uninspiring, not what good comedies are supposed to be about. The movie ARTHUR, for instance, has unrefined humor (person getting drunk in public, etc.), but you believe in the characters and aren't just watching actors portraying exaggerated personalities going through the motions for a one-liner joke or to be gross out the audience. Even the scene with the dog being frozen to the porch was unnecessary and unfunny, like this movie in general. Sorry JOE DIRT, you're a mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe Dirt","review":"I would give this no stars if possible. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.

It was rated PG-13, so I invited my step-son over to watch it. Big mistake! The movie is an adventure, but one filled with a pornographic nature. I was shocked! There was a scene where Joe Dirt tells a woman \\"Show me your boobies!\\" and when she doesn't want to, he insinuates that he will blow up a bomb if she doesn't. Then, as all the men that are around gawk at her, she hesiantly takes off her shirt and they show part of her breast! How humiliating for her character and for any woman who was watching it! He also ends up having sex with his someone who might be his sister and the moaning and groaning of their sex is made very audible.

Quite entertaining 2001 comedy that finds janitor / low-life / redneck wanna-be Joe Dirt (David Spade) in search of his long lost family that he hasn't seen since he was eight years old. Radio host Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller) takes a special interest in Dirt's story - as he tells it on 'air' over the course of several days. Dirt's gal pal, the sexy country girl of a small community Silvertown, Brandy (Brittany Daniel) seems to find that 'something appealing' about this society reject. Upside is that Joe Dirt turns out to be a geniune nice guy, yet many still think low and laugh at him.

The climax might have been just a tad hackneyed, but the author writes so beautifully, I have forgiven him for this.

If it's anywhere near as beautiful as Silas House's prose, I may just stay there."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dud.","review":"JUST PAST MIDNIGHT has a great concept - erotomania, a subject not tackled in other \\"stalker\\" books. Unfortunately, it is a slow-moving book with two-dimensional characters that leaves the reader wondering why they wasted an afternoon on such a dud. While the writer does make it difficult for some readers to figure out the identity of the stalker, she fails to build the tension between Richard and Darian. One minute they are rivals. The next, they're in love. What happened in between? We'll never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why America should fight the Nazis","review":"A damaged U-boat is stranded in a Canadian bay in the early years of World War II. The Fanatical Nazi captain and his crew must reach the neutral United States or be captured. Along the way they meet a variety of characters each with their own views on the war and nationalism. In this film Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger show their ideas of why the United States should join the Allied fight against the Nazis."},{"rating":"2","title":"49th Parallel","review":"Also known as \\"The Invaders,\\" and co-scripted by Powell's longtime partner Emeric Pressburger, this clever, rousing anti-fascist war thriller was one of Britain's boldest and most memorable propaganda pictures. Portman is mesmerizing as the wicked, hate-spouting Lt. Hirth, Walbrook, Howard, and Olivier (despite the heavy Quebecois accent) are uniformly excellent, and the distinguished Raymond Massey is also on-hand playing cynical AWOL soldier Andy Brock. Powell even brings a documentary-like intensity to the sequences filmed in Indian and Hutterite communities. Absorbing on many levels, \\"Parallel\\" is a soul-stirring drama that recaptures a tumultuous time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great war time movie","review":"Had this movie on VHS so I decided to buy it on DVD.

What Evola means by the spiritual quest is not the stuff of New Age fantasy or the gooey sentimentality of religiosity.Evola's prose in these essays is clear and direct. He manages to give us a glimpse into a harsh and rarefied world of transcendent beauty.

Not to mention the nauseatingly awkward sexual references which I'm sure were thrown in only to garner a more mature rating.

If there is zero star, I would rated that"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I thought this movie was aweful. I love Natalie Portman (Star Wars Episode 1 and Where the Heart Is), but I thought this movie was terrible. My Mom and I watched it together, thinking it would be a good monther-daughter flick, but it left us feeling depressed and we couldn't believe that we had even wasted our time. As a matter of fact, I sold my copy...!The story is about a very irresponsible mother who drags her daughter all around the country from one so-called home to the next. Natalie Portman, who plays the daughter has to act as the adult because her mother can't be responsible enough to pay the bills or hold a job. It was depressing and really downright irritating to see such an irresponsible Mom in the spotlight. The story-line was basically non-existant, it just dragged on forever, it seemed like. If you want a real feel-good movie watch Where The Heart Is, in my opinion Natalie's best so far. If you really want to be depressed then watch Anywhere But Here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful acting, but relatively empty otherwise.","review":"It's been said many times already, but another 2 cents' worth: wonderful acting, mediocre story. The casting and acting are both flawless, and the chemistry between the two talented leads is wonderful, but I still found watching it to be somewhat empty and depressing. The film is, in essence, a couple of hours spent with a dysfunctional family, and there's not nearly enough insight or redemption on the whole to make it a worthwhile visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natalie Portman show us her talent!","review":"Well, i only will say: the acting here is top level. Susan Sarando is a probated actress, we know, and for te people who was not sure about Natalie Portman (my always beloved girl!), well, The Portman Lady show us her level... Oustanding acting... Natalie Portman is one of the most talented actress, its seem to come since The Professional, now... she probed complety...!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am Adele","review":"This movie totally opened my eyes. I have watched it two more times and am becoming more and more humbled each time I see it. I drive the old Mercedes, I carry the fake Chanel purse, I hang out at trendy restaurants, I send my kids to private school (even though I cant afford it), I wear the fake jewelry and say it's real, I am very interested in men who are Dr's, Lawyers, business owners, I ask questions that are out of my league (for example: Adele and Ann go to a posh Bev Hills hotel when they get there....Adele asks what the rate is....$1200 a nite...She then asks, \\"Do you have any suites? No? That's too bad.\\" The next scene is them pulling into a roach motel) My daughter hates me. Why? Her friends all have credit cards and money in their pocket. I cant afford to go to McDonalds some nites. I see how foolish I am. I have brought this on myself. At least I didnt move to Bev Hills!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The model \\"chick flick\\"","review":"If it wasn't for Susan Sarandon this movie would've been about ten times worse than it already is.

Who cares about these people? Not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikeable","review":"Unmemorable except for the fact that I remember it was depressing without being introspective, very meaningful, or even likeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"not serious","review":"don't take this movie seriously, not even a serious comedy. It had some fun moments - not worth dedicated time - but to do other things at same time it's a nice background light entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"good thing I saw it for free...","review":"What do you do with a couple hours to kill and a movie on tv? This movie was about as pointless as they get. Susan Sarandon plays the same absent-minded flightly woman she seems to play in most of her movies. Natalie Portman is a great actress but even she couldn't save this movie from being as lame as it was. It's the kind of movie where you debate whether to (and almost decide to) turn it off and get back to cleaning the bathroom the entire time.Not for me. Even though it's a mother-daughter show, I tried to watch it with an open mind. Nope. Not ever again. And I can't recommend it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikable and annoying characters","review":"A mother/daughter story has potential to demonstrate some sort of conflict and resolution between parent and child. Or even demonstrate acceptance of one character's inability to change the other.However, this movie just stumbles along without a suitable resolution. Susan Sarandon's flighty self-absorbed demeanor gets increasingly annoying and Natalie Portman's numb portrayal of a daughter dragged along for the ride inspires little compassion from the viewer. If I couldn't find something to like about at least one of the characters, why would I care what happened to either one of them? By the time the movie came to it's inevitably predictable conclusion, I was unclenching my jaw in relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mother and Daughter Movie!","review":"Anywhere But Here is a great movie for mothers and daughters. It stars Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Portman plays a 14 year-old girl moving with her mother, Sarandon to Beverly Hills.

She is bound to be better in the future... unless you have junior high aged girls. My one daughter liked this movie, but when I asked her if she wanted it for a gift, she said no.

I went simply to satisfy a schoolboy crush, but was also treated to a movie that brought a light of joy to the pains of growing up. I like to be lengthly when I describe things, but the best review is a short one so: I laughed, I cried (a little), and I stayed interested till the end.It was worth the ticket fare then, and it's worth the spot on the movie rack now.

Over the four or five years the film depicts there are highs (not many) and more lows (such as Adeles nephew Benny dieing and her mother having a stroke) and alot of attitude for Anne about how much she does not like her mom and how she wishes that she were anywhere than where she was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Highly Readable and Informative Work","review":"This is not a dry and antiseptic treatise, but rather a highly engaging and informative work that grabs you early with a provocative foreshadowing of its premise and keeps you hooked right to the astonishing end. The authors build their case with logic and sometimes shocking detail taken directly from the national archives, making you wonder what other \\"smoking guns\\" may still lie waiting for perservering sleuths such as those who worked behind the scenes in researching this fascinating book. A \\"must read\\" not only for Kennedy conspiracy buffs, but for anyone interested in a candid and unflinching historical view of the Mafia, the French underground, heroin trafficking, the underbelly of American politics, and the events leading up to the Vietnam War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"The neverending stream of books that purports to tell the tale of the assassination of JFK continues, and I could not get past the first chapter. The quick overview of Kennedy'd life could not be more full of errors, etc...Kennedy \\"Liberal\\"? Kennedy criticizing the McCarthy fiasco? Hardly. There were many other erors, including the ongoing myth behind PT 109...Maybe someday somebody will get the biography of Kennedy correct, and perhaps then we will see that his death was nothing more than a senseless act. Kennedy was not the great leader that so many want him to be...He was inspiring and insightful, but still growing when he died.

When the book arrived, I eagerly tore in but soon discovered that the book is replete with obscenities and indecencies. It is so bad, in fact, that I had to slip it into the garbage before my children (eager readers) noticed it. A skillful writer should not have to resort to smut, especially when dealing with such a vast topic as African exploration. Alas, Mr. Boyle reduces the human race to its lowest common denominator with his \\"wise guy\\" style of prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fast shipping on an older book.","review":"Love the book Water Music.

The game mechanics are plodding and riddled with so many rules as to bog the game down to the point of giving up. Even the book itself is horrible, with poor color mixing and font placing. The worst of it though? That would be the abysmal artwork throughout. Rather than take images from the SFX awarded show itself, a small child was given a crayon set and told to draw \\"stuff\\". I cannot say enough bad things about the Babylon Project. If you are like myself and a fan of the show, avoid this as not to cry in your drinks at the casino.

This album isn't one of Alex' that gets much attention, but it should. Sr. Fernandez actually outdoes Javier Solis with his interpretation of \\"Mentira.\\" As on all of his albums, the instrumental accompaniment and arrangements are top-notch. This is a very smooth and romantic listen. It's amazing how strong and confident Alex' voice is here; He was in his early 20's when this was recorded, but his mastery of technique, epecially the way he conveys emotion and meaning with the lyrics sound more like the accomplishements of an artist at their peak. I know persons who don't speak a word of Spanish who have been seduced by the power of the voice alone. This is a natural and gifted talent. If you like Alejandro, you should have this album. If you haven't heard him yet, get \\"Que Seas Feliz\\" first, but do buy this one if you like that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Augustine","review":"The book is fine, but the pages were bound in such a way that the first time I turn each page, it falls out of the binding.

I read a review that compared this series to Dara Joys books, \\"Rejar\\", \\"Mine to take\\" & \\"Knight of a trillion stars\\". There's nothing alike!!There is no sensualness, no heart. Just sex/intercource/porn(?) always, with everyone, same sex or opposite - no big deal, in public - Why not!!You dont get to know the characters and they dont get to know eachother. There is no new world and culture to dive into, no new species or magic to speak of.Everything is about sex, men wanting it and having none stand in their way. Every culture in the book evolves around sex. Sex can be fun, playful, sensual. Here it just gets BOOOOORING, and well discusting. You can rent a pornmovie and get more out of it. The plot might even be better...and this goes for all the books in the series..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed","review":"I got this book thinking although it's not my normal reading style, I would enjoy it. I couldn't even finish the book I was so disgusted with it. I get the whole kidnapped thing but the charaters in this were awful. Kyra drove me nuts from the beginning. How any women in her right mind would be able to handle getting kidnapped, fondled by everyone it seems, given to another by her \\"sacred mate\\" and then decides hey I love him so it's okay? Not to mention the whole every female has to be naked or mostly naked seems to run in Ms. Black's books and I can't understand why.

This is the second book I tried by this author and I won't be trying any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"A bounding pace by itself does not a story make. I found the pace more jittery than bounding, actually. This kind of story doesn't call for intricate layers, but some justice could be done to characters even so.

Above all, why pay the price of two good books to get this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"ZOR A MAN TO DREAM OF","review":"The story was very good it wasn't hard core but that's the way I like um.

I enjoy a good alien romance, knowing that it is meant to be fantasy. However, I need it be somewhat plausible. About 80% of the way through a far fetched and absurd plot, paired with mechanical and predicatable love scenes, one of the \\"warriors\\" comes across a scene where a child was raped and murdered and a little boy sodomized then also murdered. Though the author doesn't go into great detail the thought of the child's \\"broken body\\" was a real turn off for me. It was the icing on an already poorly written book with plenty of typos's and errors, written with less than admirable attempts at humor and drama.Jade Black really needed to sharpen her pencil and team up with a good editor before publishing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun story....a little to much sex for all","review":"Fun story, hot alpha male, but to much sex with everyone for my taste.

What I don't get is that there is a whole series here."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is an excellent erotic romance","review":"This is not a book for the prudish or the easily offended, but if you're looking for an excellent erotic romance book get this one. It's an ebook and it comes on CD and its about as long as a regular novel in print. I saw this book mentioned in Romantic Times magazine as a favorite for women's erotica and I can see why. It is sexy, it has an engrossing plot, and it is fall off of your seat hilarious. If you get offended by erotic situations you might not want this book, but if you enjoy reading steaming novels get this one.

Strangley, Alsop bills herself as a Bersntein protegee -- did she bother to hear his riveting performances of Facsimile and the Serenade after Plato's Symposium? Every rhythmn is smoothed out and flattened. The exuberance has been drained out and replaced with soggy respectability. Alsop's Bournemouth forces are clueless about the American idiom, and if you take a cursory listen to readings of the Serenade done by Perlman and (especially) Isaac Stern, Philippe Quint seems like pretty weak tea.In short, the positive reviews below seem incomprehensible to me.

Thirty years later I bought the VHS out of a bargain bin and found that the film was just as good as I remember it. Needless to say it is one of George Peppard's finest performances, supported by an all star cast. The movie has a good storyline, but the flying and dog fighting scenes are what really make the film.

Then we'd have the best of both worlds.If you are after the music only, this is great. But for those who recall the wonderful original soundtrack, you'll have a bit of a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality sheets","review":"The sheets are of very good quality just as described by others' reviews.

As other reviewers noted the sound quality is typical to similar devices - not great, but for audiobooks it doesn't matter. I have had the Irock for several months. There are two minor defects that I noticed - sometimes it 1. refuses to turn on and 2. when turned on it configures itsef to work on the very first FM channel, not the one it was tuned to before.

This transmitter is so low powered it was completely overpowered by any local stations. The sound, when you can get it, is completely awful, unlistenable, full of static.

Everyone seems to be saddened by this, except for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run, don't walk, away from this horrible flick","review":"I have never watched a more pointless and predictable movie than this one. I watched it with my wife and sister-in-law. My wife couldn't stay awake. My sister-in-law and I stayed amused at predicting every scene that took place. The worst were the slow shots of Klein staring sideways at the ground and slowly turning his head to meet the gaze of the lead actress. It was comical. I think they tried that schtick about three times during the movie, maybe this movie was really directed by staff from the World Wrestling Federation. If you see this movie, you will never get back that hour and a half you lost. That's the one lasting impression it leaves you with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, BOR-ING, wooden acting","review":"I gave it two stars, because in truth, I have seen worse movies (how about \\"The Wedding Planner?\\" Sorry, I digress)--BUT NOT BY MUCH. I am not immune to the charms of good teen movies (witness \\"Clueless,\\" \\"Never Been Kissed,\\" \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\") but this movie was beyond even my sap-intake level. I thought Lee Lee (sp?) Sobieski was so vanilla that it was incredible either of these guys found her interesting, far less worth squabbling over. You saw (Ending Giveaway Alert) the demise of her character a mile away (more precisely, at the beginning of the movie), and the whole Kelley character's (no to disrespect intended) deceased mother/standing in the rain scene was nauseating. Spend some quality time with an amazing love story, acted to perfection, and invest in BBC's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"--also the inspiration for \\"Bridget Jones' Diary,\\" for those of you who might otherwise dismiss Jane Austen's inestimable charms!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad, but not heartbreaking","review":"The more I watch this movie, the more I like it. But I have to agree with some people: they don't show enough Josh Hartnett and I wouldn't pick Chris Klein over Josh Hartnett.The thing that makes me mad about this movie, is that while Jasper (Josh Hartnett) does the reasonable thing and move aside, it breaks my heart that he's hurting and nobody is there for him and asking how he feels. He's most likely hurting more than Kelley (Chris Klein).The movie is good, but I wish it could've involved Jasper's feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie was refreshing, it held my interest for the whole length of the movie.

(cancer, suicide, car crashes) Although JOsh Hartnett shined as usual, his character was written badly, and LeeLee Sobieski and Chris Klein were terrible. Sobieski was anorexically thin, extremely dis believable and it made you wonder why Hartnett and Klein wanted her so badly. The plot was such a cliche story and although with different actors cast in Klein's and Sobieski's roles, it might have been a bit better, the overall result was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"bah Humbug","review":"Ok I guess this movie would be ok if the hot guy got the girl, ...

And all I can say is....Good God what a waste of his good acting talent. Were we supposed to hate his character for getting in the way of Leelee Sobieski's and Chris Klein's? If anything, all it did was make those two look like jerks for hurting the other guy. Maybe I could be more sympathetic if Sam(Sobieski) was in love with Kelley(Klein) and Jasper(Hartnett) treated her like crap. But Jasper was nothing but sweet to her and she walked over him. And comparing it to Love Story? Nope, don't think so.I know quite a few people liked this movie, but I don't. If you're a Josh fan, you'll kinda be disappointed. A Leelee fan, I recommend Never Been Kissed, and a Chris fan, Election. Not this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here on earth movie","review":"The movie Here On Earth is a great movie but it is a really big heartbreaker. I watched it for the first time and it was the most heartbreaking movie I have ever seen. I think that this is a good movie but you have to be ready cause it is a real tear jerker. I always like to see the movies but I know that some of them are going to be sad but I still always like to see them. This is a great movie though and if you want to see a very sad movie I would suggest it but if you dont then you would not want to see it because it is a very,very sad movie and it would break your heart by watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love's Destruction","review":"This heart wrenching story shows us just how sad love can be. It's reminiscent of Bronte's Wuthering Heights."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Single Worst Movie Ever Made","review":"Watching this movie was one of the least pleasant experiences in my life. The plot and dialogue were so cliche-ridden and horribly presented that it was, at times, laughable. There were at least 5 or 6 times during the course of this drivel that I thought to myself \\"Wow - that was the single worst line of dialogue I have ever heard in my life.\\" The plot has been done over so many times, and is so predictable and utterly insulting to the viewer that I will not waste my energy attempting to describe it here. Before seeing this movie I thought that Chris Klein and Lelee Sobieski had some talent as actors. I was proven wrong. This movie is not only insulting to you as a viewer, it is insulting to you as a human being. Do not, I repeat DO NOT, under any circumstances, ever see this movie. Please, heed my words and avoid this mindless drivel at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful..","review":"This movie is awful, I cannot stand LeeLee Sobieski as an actress, she makes me feel like I am going to be sick.. She always delivers her lines so forced.. Like you can tell she is reading, she just is very annoying and gets under my skin BAD, and therefore watching her only makes it worse. I am sure she is a great person or whatever, but she does not need to be an actress. Chris Klein was also VERY disappointing in this movie, Josh Hartnett was pretty good though. I definately do not recommend this.. but hey every man to his own, maybe you will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SERIOUS RIP OFF OF LOVE STORY","review":"My title pretty much gives away what happens in this movie. If you are a fan of Chris Klein or Leelee Sobieski, you are so much better off renting Election and Never Been Kissed. This movie is so bad. I wish I had read all these reviews before deciding to waste my time. I'm so tired of badly written movies making there way to the big screen. This one is one of the worst, It makes me much more confident than I could also have my screenplay made into a film, It couldn't be any worse than this stupid movie. And just who are we supposed to like here? I found myself feeling sorry for the boyfriend that Leelee jilts. He is played by Josh Hartnett, and he's so cute and charming. She is just pure evil, sneaking around on him with Chris Klein. and then the whole \\"cancer\\" thing. I will admit I did cry, but I think deep down I was crying more for Josh. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!! at least Love Story was original at the time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"I watched this movie on VHS and found it amazingly slow and dumb. Fans of Chris Klein will only be disappointed by how miscast he is as an angry rich kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"This movie is awful.The movie took some of the most talented young actors in Hollywood and wasted their talents in this dreadful teen romance.The movie is about a private school prep that crashes into a diner and has to spend his summer re-building it.While he is re-building this diner he falls for LeeLee Sobieski,who is dating Josh Hartnet.Yeah rich prep and poor sick smalltown girl fall for each other and she dumps Josh(why?why?)for this rich prep.Oh and she is dying as well.This movie is horrid.Chris Klien,LeeLee Sobieski,and Josh Hartnet wasted their talent for this awful movie.The movie is so predictable it's just not even funny.Don't even waste your time.If you want a good drama get A Walk To Remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Movie","review":"I just saw this movie last night. It is a really cute movie. This movie stars Leelee Sobeski, Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein. This is a very cute romantic movie about falling in love. Ignore the negative reviews and watch this movie. First of all this movie is about a rich guy (Kelley) who falls in love with a girl(Sam) from \\"the other side of the tracks\\".This movie starts off when Kelley comes to town. Sam's boyfriend gets mad at Kelley and they both get into a car race and end up burning down Sam's family restaurant. As a punishment they are both forced to help rebuild the restaurant. Sam eventually falls in love with Kelley. Sam's boyfriend then finds out about their romance. What will happen next? You'll have to watch to find out. I highly recommend this movie and I am sure that teenagers and pre-teens will enjoy it.RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommend....","review":"The movie realistically portrays the relationships in the modern days, which is unconventional to most of the Hollywood love fairy-tales I've seen.Nice for a change.Not mentioning most actors in the film gave solid performace.However it's disgusting to see what the movie is leading us.The movie seems to put emphasis on encouraging couples to jeopardise a health relationship to sneak out and seek for a new partner.What's it going on guys???Was the filmmaker probably initiated into making the filmfrom a past experience similar to the behaviour of the characters in the movie? Or when has immorality of this world become norm rather than exception?In my view, you can safely skip this movie and choose other title,and would most likely turn out to be a better choice than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 For Josh 2 For Chris","review":"Hello Hunks!! I mean honestly, I dont think MOST (yes there are exceptions out there) guys would go for this movie, it IS the ultimate chick flick, and that's what makes this movie so successful..mostly girls go the movies (and they then drag their boyfriends along). It's every girls fantasy having Josh Harnett as the boyfriend..living in a little town, everyone knows everyone..boom another hot guy comes walking into the little dinner's door, he likes you, then boom!

Sure Chris Klein's character didn't fit in but it also showed how she had to fight being sick. So it's just not your average movie where the kids don't fit in.

TRUST ME."},{"rating":"1","title":"see this film and you'll wish you weren't here on earth","review":"Here on Earth is so trite and NOT worth seeing. The plot is riddled with endless cliches and the performances and dialogue are hopelessly stilted. It's too bad half-way decent actors were saddled with a script this wretched. Leelee Sobieski's character is annoying and only takes an avid interest in Chris Klein's brat of a character when he takes off his shirt to reveal a perfectly chisled chest. Better movie buys featuring Sobieski, Klein, and Hartnet would be \\"Never Been Kissed,\\" \\"Election,\\" and \\"Virgin Suicides.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the ending music saves this one","review":"If it were not for \\"Where You Are,\\" the love song from the film sung by Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, this movie would be a complete waste of precious time. So predictable, so done before a million times, corny as a cartoon, with completely predictable story lines. How many times do we have to watch a rich, spoiled kid (Chris Klein) steal the girl (Leelee) away from the true Knight in Shining Armor (Josh Harnett). Perfect example is A WALK TO REMEMBER with Mandy Moore as the terminally ill babe who falls for the no-no bad guy. Same story here, just different actors... And anyone remember Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, or for that matter, any other Molly Ringwald movie back in the early 1980s?? At least Molly was quirky and a fun actress to watch. It's all been done before, except this time the actors are very unlikeable, their performances unmemorable. The only 2 stars I give this film are for the pretty song, otherwise this is a big dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give negative stars if possible","review":"I have read alot of reviews written here that says this movie will appeal to preteen girls. I like to think that even pre-teen girls have more sense than to like this dreck.First there's Harnett playing a slack-jawed yokel. I think the emotion he's trying to convey is his undying love for Sam (Sobieski's character), however, he just comes across as a rather dim bumpkin. Although Chris Klien has an awesome physique, he seems to be capable of only two facial expressions. And Sam (Sobieski) is a typical Mary Sue kind of character with long luxurious blonde hair that looks great regardless of the circumstances and who is nauseatingly sweet and dewy eyed throughout the entire movie. She is simply too good to be true. The writers of this movie should NEVER be allowed to inflict their \\"skills\\" on the movie going public ever again. The only saving grace I felt toward this movie was that I saw it on TV and did not waste money on a ticket to see it in a theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where to begin.....","review":"What a HORRIBLE, HORRILBLE film! Seeing some of the previews for the movie, I figured I'd watch it to see a nice chick flick. The only reason I didn't stop the movie in the middle was because all the cliche diologue and stage action was much to humorous. Anyone who describes this film as \\"moving\\" obviously lacks any intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Enough Josh!","review":"The movie was really good, unbelieveable, but good. It's about this rich guy ( Chris Klien) who's sentenced to community service in a small town. While there he falls in love with a hick's(Josh Hartnett) girl(Leele Sobinski). They have a unbelieveable romance and she ends up with some disease. Hartnett's character steps out of the way so Klien can spend the last days with her. All this time he (Hartnett) actually loves her. It really was a tear jearker. But are we to believe that any girl would fall for Chris Klien when she could have a hottie like Josh? oh and one more thing they don't show enough Josh! How sad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TIME TO BE LOVED","review":"I liked it. A very sweet and romantic film with a dramacit twist, as many would call a tear jerker. Yes, it makes us smile, cry and learn some lessons, lessons of love, and making what is right to amend what had been damaged. I thought the main couple was fine in their interpretations and chemistry. Even sadly, love always win! Think about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A problem with this CD","review":"To my surprise this is the only CD among a large collection that will not play in my main CD player, a Rotel RCD-06 SE, although it plays in two old boomboxes I have.

Stanton explores complex questions of heritage, tourism and public history detailing how the past shapes the present and the present shapes the interpretation of the past. In addition, she unveils the many challenges and limitations public historians have being both interpreters and contributors to history at historic sites. Stanton's writing is smooth and graceful filled with thought and detail. I would highly recommend this book for both graduate courses as well as readers interested in the politics of historic sites. There is no wonder this book took home the National Council of Public History's book prize, for it is truly a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tackling blind spots in public history","review":"Stanton's book richly deserved the National Council of Public History's annual book prize, because, leveling a anthropologist's gaze at the public history profession, she exposes one of its most serious blind spots -- the question of why and how history could matter in today's public world. Stanton's exceedingly provocative study looks at the way the habits and ambitions of public historians combine to create distance between what we know about the past and the questions that knowledge could prompt us to ask about today and tomorrow. As one of the landmarks of 20th century public history, Lowell is a great laboratory for Stanton's ideas, and she renders it with memorable texture and detail. An excellent book for graduate courses and for the bookshelves of anyone interested in why historic sites languish while public appetite for history grows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Gift for a Girl","review":"I bought this for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas and she was thrilled with it.

But I read another novelle too and I liked Fancy free\\" best (5 stars). A mad earl's bride\\" was quite difficult for me because of many medical words (I give it 4 stars) and I found Promises\\" a bit cliche - but at least it was written in easy English (only 3 stars).

Well you get what you pay for...the cabinet was hard to put together and feels cheaply made. The screws are well concealed, but it made putting it together a huge pain! It took us well over an hour to secure the ten screws that hold the thing together!!In general the cabinet looks ok, not like a fine peice of furniture by any stretch of the imagination.

It took a total of 52 minutes to unpack, inventory all the pieces and assemble the cabinet. There was one spot where a back panel did not slide in easily and a quick scrape with the screwdriver provided enough clearance to fix that problem. The last bolt requires that you reach into the back of one bottle slot to secure it but the hex design and allen wrench means it can easily be done without being able to see it. The allen wrench is provided with the kit and the only other tool you need is a screwdriver. My only complaint is that there is no stop on the drawer to prevent it from being pulled completely out. For the price that seems like a small problem and one I can easily over look."},{"rating":"2","title":"wine cabinet","review":"Very nice product.

I called Winsome and they requested proof of purchase. No problem. They also requested an itemized list of the damaged pieces which they ironically had room for on their instruction sheet. That should have been my first clue.It took ten days to get the new pieces which arrived in good condition. But,I was not happy with a handwritten note that said \\"to avoid scratching the top piece ,apply on a soft surface\\". Now all of a sudden,this was my fault? Some things are better left unsaid. An apology for the inconvenience would have been a little bit more appropriateI was more then disappointed with that comment!

After doing a lot of research online and in the stores, I thought this was one of the nicest. I was worried about damaged parts after reading the other reviews and because this was a gift for a family member... Except for a small nick (unfortunately in the front, top piece of wood), everything was in a great shape. I decided not to return it because it's so small. I would recommend this because of its simple, sturdy design and rich colored, real wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality and Parts missing","review":"I was hesitant to buy this product after reading all the comments but decided my luck and ordered it. It arrived nicely packaged and all the parts seemed to be included, well after spending more than 1 hours putting the screws and assembling the boards that make up the squares to put the bottles discovered that the parts were too big and does not fit the space where they need to be. I had thrown away the box and could not return it. If you are looking for a quality cabinet move on don't waste your money and efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful product. Terrible company.","review":"Should have known when I opened the box and the first thing I saw was an inventory list to order missing parts that I was in trouble. Sure enough I had duplicates of two parts with two others missing. I sent in the inventory list asking for replacement parts and they were processed and shipped quickly but one of the parts (the most important one) was still wrong. Out of frustration I built the wine rack without the back panel since Winsome is incapable of sending a correct \\"middle\\" shelf with the proper notches to install back panel. Piss poor job of getting me the product I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for the money","review":"The cabinet met my expectations. For the money spent, it was a good value. Easy to assemble. One piece was marred, but we were able to position it so that it did not show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winsome Wood Wine Cabinet, Walnut","review":"The original mfg packaging for the cabinet is inadequate for shipping. The box appeared to be in tact when it arrived but upon opening there were several pieces that were either dented or scratched. While the instructions are pretty easy to follow we had more than a few problems with assembly either because holes for the pegs were not predrilled and the insertion & tightening of bolts with the provided allen wrench should have been moved up in the assembly steps instead of as specified. After assembled the cabinet wobbled due one of the side panels being produced off set. Not worth the price but also not worth the hassel to return/exchange. I would not buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic for the price","review":"I was looking for a wooden wine cabinet that could be used in a small space. This one fit the bill. The frame is solid wood, not pressboard, like so many others. The styling is simple, so it can fit nicely with many styles of furniture. Assembly was fairly simple with good directions. As another reviewer mentioned, the back piece was a little tricky to stay in place while tightening the screws, but sliding it in with the edge of a butter knife (creative???) did the trick. Once the back was in place, I recruited another pair of hands to work with me to keep the back in the groove while I tightened the screws. Beyond that, assembly was fine.Looks far more expensive than the actual cost. A winner!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to assemble","review":"The assembly instructions contained no words, only pictures, making assembly very frustrating.

It keeps warm water warm and makes cold water warmer. Water level suggested for use (there are lines inside the foot spa indicating minimum and maximum water levels recommended) is adequate for covering the entire feet, just right up to the ankles. The foot spa can accommodate feet as large as size w11. However, the bubble feature can sometimes make some of the water splash out.

Eventually I got around to remembering it, and what a pleasure it was to find a simple paperback copy rather than the huge hardbound I dragged home from school. And yet all the information is there, and to that I am more than grateful.What makes this a supurb collection is its expanse. While I'm sure Mr. Cohen couldn't throw all research into this work, what remains is still impressive. He does not go into all detail, but gives the necessary-yet-fascinating summaries of these ghosts, events, etc. It certainly fits the encycledia format, including the handy \\"see also\\" notes.It can be used as simply a spooky book of ghost stories or as a springboard to more research. Definitely a must-have for those interested in all things supernatural, whether serious or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"It creeps!","review":"A wonderful book of paranormal collection, focusing on the subject of ghosts. Daniel Cohen's objective approach helped a lot in the accounts that are contained in this book, which is neither critical nor imposing that the stories aren't hoax whenever not proven as false. A fine little resource material for research in the study of the most popular cases of poltergeist, hauntings and phenomenons in the 'Spirit world', written in a concise and neat manner.

The cords are not very long either, so you can't move the receiver very far from the karaoke machine either.Too bad, affordable wireless microphones are hard to find (outside of the low-quality ones offered on ebay).

It is very 'tricky' to tell such a serious story, that carries such deep meaning, to a 6 year old. But it worked! I have had to read it a few times to my daughter. I like books that open doors for children and that encourage them to ask questions about real life things. Like: \\"Why did the 'bad guys' take them away?\\", and \\"Will 'the bad guys' always try and get the Flamingo?\\". It has shown my daughter, the price that freedom sometimes has.

She says she was a mall rat in Southern California until she went to the Rhode Island School of Design. I think her high school teachers could not figure her out, and told her she should go to cosmetology school or something like that.She just naturally has these ideas that she followed through to their fruition.A true polymath: vehicle design, home design, food design, clothes design--she makes me question everything, well why can't we do it some other way. One example is her tables that have bowls carved into the surface. Another is a well designed outfit that one can wear every day for six months straight. Why have variety?Designer or performance artist? Very difficult to categorize because her ideas are wide ranging.High quality print reproductions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid quality","review":"Excellent quality, large French helix snails at a reasonable price.

It is well acted and cleverly scripted, with dozens of situations and conversations that are very funny. Of course, disaster threatens at the end, but, because we know this is a comedy, we expect that it will be avoided in some way, hopefully in a surprising but fairly plausible manner. Although viewers who pay attention will be able to guess the actual happy ending correctly, this ability will not detract from their enjoyment any more than it did if they correctly foresaw the ending to the film DAVE. For contrast, this film is far more enjoyable than HEIST, an unsavory happy-ending caper movie starring Hackman and DiVito."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good movie","review":"I didn't think I was going to enjoy this movie, but I did. It has a lot of funny parts. The bandits sleep over the bankers home the night before they rob the bank. They are know as the sleep over bandits. They are always polite to the people they rob. One of the funny parts is when they go to a lady's home. She opens the door and say's, \\"O My God, your the sleep over bandits. I heard all about you on tv. Well lets get started come on in\\".... lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOL Hilarious romance comedy","review":"Although this was bought for my sister-in-law, who found it LOL funny, it is one of my favorite comedies of all time. Billy Bob Thorton's hypocondriac character is played perfectly. What a great performance! It is not only hilarious, but the story line is fantastic. It's a fast paced adventure about bank robbers who take on a \\"kidnapped partner\\" (Cate Blanchett)who has a husband who is more concerned about himself, and his job than his wife. Bruce Willis, gives a wonderful performance as the ringleader of the \\"Sleep over Bandits\\". The ending was surprising, so I won't give it away...but this is just one movie that I can watch over and over and laugh every time! Highly recommend for those of you who enjoy a great comedy, great adventure, story line and LOL comedy. The word \\"drama\\" doesn't fit this movie, unless you consider Billy Bob as a drama queen. Grab the popcorn and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off good but then fizzles","review":"The movie stars off decent enough with the story off two cons who make a daring escape from prison. They then go on an interstate crime spree robing banks under the moniker \\"The Sleepover Bandits\\". There are some amusing moments, but as soon as they hook-up with a female accomplice the movie spirals into a tedious love triangle that should have been shortened in my opinion. The ending is clever and it should satisfy, if necsesary fast-foreward to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Bandits\\" thieves your valuable time","review":"Despite the inclusion of the U2 hit \\"Beautiful Day\\" in the movie trailer, there is no daylight in this confusing, silly farce of a movie.

Unlikely scenarios collide with plodding scenes to reach an absolutely stoopid ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF INTELLECT","review":"Holy Cow was this a bad movie. If you liked epic dumps like Bull Durham or Get Shorty, you might think this horrible film is hysterical. For the rest of us, here goes: the movie is about two bank robbers out for (you guessed it!!) one last crime. Then enters the wacky, indecisive woman that comes between said bank robbers. Comedy is supposed to ensue, but man oh man does it flop. Billy Bob Thornton will look back in repulsion over this one, and Bruce Willis had better character development in \\"Blind Date.\\" As far as the female lead, well, if you just loooove Julliane Moore, this woman is your style. Bandits delivers as many laughs as witnessing an electrocution. I would suggest either version of \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" for anyone looking for a funny AND well written movie along the same lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzz...(snort)...zzzz","review":"Rare is the movie that manages to make me stop watching before its conclusion, \\"Bandits\\" however managed the feat quite successfuly.

The whole movie's that way","review":"This is a crime story that could only come from the minds of people who spend most of their time in Beverly Hills and Malibu, contemplating how the rest of the world manages to live without the most expensive privileges on earth. Instead of real characters, it gives us itemized lists of neuroses and life issues that never gel into real characters. The humor in the movie, such as at is, derives entirely from these unbelievable quirks.Too bad. Barry Levinson was at one time one of the great creators of unique and memorable characters, such as in Diner, Tin Men, Avalon and Rain Man. The characters on Homicide, the TV show he executive-produced, were vivid and memorable. But this movie's characters are unplayable, and the actors involved cannot make this come to life. Even the usually amazing Cate Blanchett seems lost here. Bad bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not prepared for how bad this would be","review":"Bad hair, bad Bruce Willis smirk, bad dazed Billy Bob Thorton expression, bad use of Cate Blanchett (who before this seemed incapable of a bad movie), bad jerky cinematography, bad narrative pace.

Not that it's bad, but it's definitely a chick flick and I wasn't in the mood. Similar to \\"Pearl Harbor\\" in the sense that two men are fighting over a woman, so women will enjoy that fantasy. Bruce Willis has the same expression on his face the whole time. (Normally he's able to switch between all three of the expressions that he's mastered...all smirks.) Major releases are beginning to get more irritating in the sense that the men are always sheepish dummies and the women are the tough geniuses. Molded straight from the Hollywood cookie-cutter.

They stole my [money]!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The worst comedy I've ever seen\\"","review":"Bandits, to simply put it, is a boring unfunny movie with an Ok cast.

I felt that they tried to throw in a that twist (which I won't ruin it for you if you haven't seen it... even though I would recommend to watch Die Hard 1 again if you want to spend 2 hours...)... well I was mentioning the twist at the end, which felt forced... the movie is told in a nonlinear way... another method to make the story more interesting... so basically what I'm saying here is that the script [is not good]... the actors really do try to save the movie... even though I hated Billy Bob's role... Bruce Willis was so-so... Cate Blanchett stole the show... when we see her cooking hahaha! I don't think I'll ever watch this movie again... The only movies that I've liked from Barry Levinson have been Rain Man (of course) Good Morning, Vietnam (but here it was mostly because of Williams) ... maybe with one more rewrite and a different director, this would have been a very enjoyable experience"},{"rating":"1","title":"Robbed me of 2 hours","review":"This picture is awful. The story quickly becomes implausible and silly. Willis is in full smirk mode as if he thinks this passes as acting. Thorton's hypochondria is a waste. It's like the script writer was saying, \\"we need to give him some quirk, any quirk, to make him colorful.\\" It made him annoying. Perhaps my biggest complaint is for the stuntman/getaway driver character. If a movie has to rely on an unbelievably, excessively stupid character to drive the plot forward then it's in trouble. This picture isn't worth renting. If it's on cable, watch it if you feel the need to punish yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"First step check out Barry Levinsons other films, and youll see where your heading with this. Essentially this is rainman with a pair of cons, Thornton plays Dustin Hoffmans part almsot exactly, trying a bit too hard in fact.This is a film which is pure 80s, there is no action, and little of anything, in fact imagine rain man all over again.A few comedy wigs do not make a movie, Bruce Willis appears to be on autopilot.If your into Barry Levinsons other movies this is probably your sort of thing, but ill take a real film over star vehicle anyday.Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand how people can like this one...","review":"I consider myself a reasonably open-minded person, but I can't grasp how people could actually enjoy this movie. I saw this movie on the plane to South-Africa, and boy, was it boring. It was so boring I had to ask the flight-attendant for a parachute.The acting in this movie is pretty good, as always, but the characters are totally unlikable : one is an annoying hypochondriac, the other is one of those strong and silent types. The script was just BAD, BAD, BAD !!I can't understand why this movie is promoted as a comedy. There were 2 scenes in the whole movie that made me smile. No one as laughing during the entire movie. I think it would have been better it they would have advertised it as a romantic crime-drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time.","review":"This movie could have been a lot better. There could have been a concise, fast-moving plot, and everything!There wasn't.I laughed TWICE throughout this thing, and both times were thanks to Cate Blanchett: the first, when she was dancing around in her kitchen to 'Holding Out For A Hero'; the second, because one of the wigs she wore in a disguise reminded me of Agent Spalko from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.The framing device of flashbacks (Bobby Slayton? Really? REALLY?) added too much time, as well as nothing to the 'surprise' ending (who REALLY thought our beloved angry Joe and hypochondriac Terry would get it in the end? C'mon, now).Basically, if you're thinking about renting this, make sure that you have absolutely NOTHING else you want to do with 123 minutes of your life.

This movie takes two hours for an overly simple plot to develop while having to endure the irritating and extremely campy portrayals of two of the three leading roles. The Terry Collins character tried to come across as a nonchalant, clever, yet paranoid sort of guy, but Thornton's acting was annoying and un-endearing. Blanchett, as 'poor me' Kate Wheeler, wants to claim a sense of pity from the audience, but never manages to pull you in and doesn't seem to be much more that a shallow-thinking ditz. This role was not worthy of her talents and was disappointing to watch. Bruce Willis was the only positive aspect of this movie. His well-known suaveness and coolness were conveyed very well through his character, but it was not enough to save this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A garbage.","review":"Nice try with unmatching 3some, but still a garbage. Willis is queasy and Thorton is itchy. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharing profits & love","review":"Given that the film had a rather eccentric bunch of characters (afterall, they were supposed to be outlaws) & the said characters had a rather eccentric relationship with each other, the movie had its own moments. Terry's imposed medical condition, Joe's irresistible charm & Kate's indecisiveness (...there is no perfect man or Mr. Right!!!)had its own allure to the viewers.It's not a good idea to ponder though that robbery is justified in this film & that the criminals get away with it. Much worse, is, what they do after their big get away!A good entertainment film...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprises in store","review":"Prepare to be set up. I don't want to give anything away, but to explain somewhat what I mean by being set up - the way the movie unfolds, it will seem like you are being led along one lonely country road only to blink and find yourself whizzing along a busy freeway... this movie has some surprises in store for you! Parts of this movie seem to drag (yes, there are some funny parts, and Cate (Kate), Bruce (Joe), and Billy Bob (Terry) seem to work very well together, but there's a lot of repetition and not a lot of action until the second half of the movie) and I was bored, but I felt rewarded for sticking with it when the movie was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious!","review":"This movie is great! It is losely based on a true story about 2 bank robbers who escaped from prison and began sleeping over at the bank managers houses the night before they robbed the bank so that they could get a meal and a place to sleep. That is what Joe (Bruce Willis) and Terry (Billy Bob Thorton) do - sleep at bank managers houses and then rob the banks the next morning before the banks even open. Along the way they pick up a stunt man who drives the getaway car and a mentally unhinged woman on the run from her marriage (Cate Blanchett). Billy Bob Thorton is hilarious! Probably the funniest role I have ever seen him play. he plays an obsessive compulsice hypochondriac with a scroll of diagnosis'. Great date movie since guys and girls will find it funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely, DEFINITELY a must-see film!","review":"In the vein of \\"Amelie\\" and \\"O Brother Where Art Thou?\\" -- this is a completely over-the-top, brilliantly funny film. Be prepared for non-stop amusement as you follow the antics of Bruce Willis, Billy Bob and Cate Blanchette. These three have previously demonstrated a remarkable range of acting talent and they all feed off each other throughout the production. They are equally entrancing and it is quite a remarkable thing to have your attention ricochet back and forth among these three. They are unfailingly deft in creating rather unique and well-fleshed characters.My exact rating for the film is four-and-a-half stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining movie","review":"This movie was very funny, and entertaining.The cast is great, with Bruce Willis, Cate Blanchett, and Billy Bob Thornton.The highlight of the movie is deffiantly billy Bob Thornton.He works magic, and is laugh out loud funny.I rarely laugh at movie, but i laughed very much at this one.The ending has been used before, but it still works well.Bandits is rated PG-13 for LANGUAGE, VIOLENCE, AND SOME SEXUAL CONTENT.If you want to laugh, go see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like blandits............","review":"I personally did not care for this movie. I couldn't tell if this movie was supposed to be a comedy or drama or action or what there is just no consistency to the plot. A movie with a little of everything is refreshing from time to time, but by the time this 2hour 5minute movie is over you might need to be revived! They are robbing banks and staying at the bank managers houses and stealing cars and just being bad people with attitude. That is the premise of the movie. I mean if you are a die hard (no pun intended) Bruce willis fan that has to have every movie he makes, buy it. Same if you are a Billy Bob fan. Otherwise don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Cute and Funny Romantic Comedy","review":"A great movie that has to be seen!

Looking foward for the release date of the DVD, definitely going to buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at Best","review":"After reading all the glowing customer reviews for bandits (they must work for the movie studio) I felt compelled add my opinion. I would rate this movie as fair. Bandits wasn't horrible, but it wasn't very good either. It has maybe five good laughs for which you're subjected to a great deal of implausible and boring filler. Wait for it to come to HBO. I bought into the hype and saw it early, big mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie of the year so far","review":"Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton have both acted their guts out in this movie. It was hilarious from start to finish, with a brilliant, non-cheezy ending to match. When you start off this movie you think you know how it ends, but you don't! Anyway, that aside, the acting by all of the characters, Cate Blanchett included was brilliant, and the story line was intelligent funny, and kept you hooked all the way thru. Plus, I think I'm in love with Cate Blanchett after this movie. She was just brilliant too. The funniest robber movie I've seen in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solidly entertaining","review":"Bandits is a goofy, yet solidly entertaining film. Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton brilliantly play off each other, making the humor in the film seem, for the most part, believable. The movie, however, does slow down and lose some of its charm when Kate Blanchett enters the picture. While her character is at first interesting, the love triangle that develops between her and our intrepid bandits seems hollow and forced.I definitely recommend this as a rental if you're not sure what to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching this is like talking to someone with bad breath...","review":"Plain and simple... pay attention, now; This movie is GREAT for people who either have and eighth grade education or own a bathrobe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really BORING","review":"I Heard that this was supposed to be a really funny and action packed movie well its no except for maybe 2 secenes it is really boring and lacks a good plot do not buy this it is a waste of money!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!","review":"I have seen the dubbed and subtitled versions of Magic Knight Rayearth.

My sensitive skin gets pampered by this soap, and the scent stays on my skin long after the shower. Definitely a 5-star soap, but I had to give it 4 stars because it melts away so quickly that the thrill doesn't last.

Perhaps one should say that few politicians today have thoughts as sophisticated and well organized as those of Cicero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"He's described as a great writer. He's not that interesting to read though, and the reason becomes apparent when the author explains that the reason Cicero is so highly regarded as a writer is that he had a brilliant grasp of upper class and lower class Latin as well as Greek, and switched between the three, sometimes in the same paragraph. Of course all that is lost in translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cicero Selcted Works","review":"Absolutely superb in all respects, both the main texts and also introduction, footnotes etc. It is a classic and a renowned publication for modern readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tire for the price","review":"Been using this tire on my converted 29er bike and it works great.

Nick Nolte, Gene Hackman and Joanna Cassidy. There is action but the action punctuates the plot and character development as opposed to being the point of the film.

Nolte is excellent as Price, the rugged veteran who experiences a change of heart behind rebel lines, while Cassidy, Hackman, and Ed Harris, playing a steely soldier-for-hire, add further fuel to this \\"Fire\\" with gutsy supporting roles.

Just going through these exercises and then playing them on the guitar gets the information into your brain and your muscles. Basic fretboard knowledge comes right along with it.

The portrayal of her rich cultural heritage as a native Alaskan is fascinating. The descriptions of Alaska are beautiful and the story well scripted and exciting as the adventure unfolds. There ia a real connection between the main characters -- Kay, Lela, Steff, Russ and Grace. Grace, Kay's boss, is a real hoot and Russ, Kay's colleague, is a riot. He has some great lines. And that stuffy oil company PR guy is also comic-relief. Young has a dry sense of humor that you learn to appreciate. And Kay's growing love for Lela is wonderful and unfolds nicely.

Other than some useful tools a social worker could use in family social work detailed in some sections of the quantitative and qualitative chapters measurement chapters, I found this book to be a reformulation of ideas co-opted from better-written family therapy texts.

If you've played Alpha Centauri and have the expansion set then you already have all the information you need to set up a great GURPS Alpha Centauri game. If you have the hint book, then you have everything provided in the GURPS book and more. NOTHING is elaborated on and therefore in my opinion nothing is gained in buying this book. Perhaps SJG was bound by contract not to elaborate on anything, and we have Firaxis to blame for this debacle.

I don't have the heart to pass it on to burn someone else. As much as I dislike ironing, the time I wasted trying to use this thing I would have been better off getting the board out. I'm not a skilled iron-er, but I can still do a dress shirt the old-fashioned way in under 2 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning it","review":"I just purchased this model for about $35. For an inexpensive steamer it takes out the wrinkles ok. However, I am returning it because it spatters water everywhere and burned my hand. Not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"This product is a massive waste of plastic. I followed all the directions very carefully and the result was a pathetic amount of steam, a 1/2 hour wasted carefully going over one pair of slacks, and WRINKLES no matter what. This thing made me appreciate the \\"speed\\" of ironing.I am now waiting on delivery of another steamer entirely and still have high hopes of finding a product that ACTUALLY STEAMS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Looking and Long Lasting but Inconsistent","review":"I've had this scale for years, and it's still working. I've never had to replace the batteries. The readout is large and easy to read. The problem is that the readings are inconsistent from minute to minute by as much as five pounds. I put a footprint for the scale on a level spot on the bathroom floor with electrical tape, and that's helped. It also seems to be sensitive to where you step on it, i.e., in the center or towards the edges. This scale drives me nuts!!! I've kept it because it looks nice, keeps working, I don't weigh myself that often and I'm cheap. But now that I'm seriously trying to loose some body fat, this scale is destined for in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stylish Reminder of How Far You Have to Go","review":"TheWeight Watchers WW42R Glass Platform Scale, Chromeis a sleek reminder of how well you've kept that New Year's resolution -- or not. It's adjustable to display either the English or metric system of weight and doesn't come with the annoying chuckle that some other models blurt behind your back. There were some initial problems with accuracy -- fluctuations by as much as 10-15 lbs -- but those went away pretty quickly. Keep it out of the walkway, too -- sharp edges make it murder on the toes if you're walking by fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weight Watchers Glass Platform Scale","review":"I love this scale, it registers and does not go back and forth in the weight, it just gives you one consistent number.

I had put it away and took it out recently to start using again. It is not accurate at all now. My weight flutuates 10 to 15 pounds from day to day - up and down. I'm glad I read the other reviews - I thought I was crazy! I've also had the problem of my weight being different depending which room I was using it in.I'm really disappointed. A scale should last longer then this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this scale","review":"I have to disagree with the bad reviews I have seen thus far. When I started WW 3 years ago, I bought this scale. After I learnt to tap it on the top instead of in the center of the scale, I was ready to go. I love this scale. As far as not receiving accurate measurements, that is so untrue. The only time I have ever received a measurement that seemed off was when I placed the scale on carpet or on an uneven surface. WW does not recommend using this scale on either of those surfaces. I guess one should expect bad reviews from those that fail to read instructions and fail to do research on the product before they buy. I also read, whilst researching this scale, that you should wait a minute after dismounting the scale before you get back on for a new reading. I only gave it four stars because I hate tapping my foot on the readout to get it on instead of tapping in the center."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I chose this scale mostly because of the 10 year warranty it carried. It quit working after about 15 months and when I contacted Conair, the maker, I was told to package it securely and ship it to them...with the recommendation that I insure it.

Like not having the scale level, or moving around too much. I should have heeded the other warnings. I can step on the scale, get a reading, and step back on and gain .4 lbs. Today, I weighed myself, went straight to my Weight Watchers meeting (wearing the same clothes) weighed in there and weighed .8 lbs more. Bottom line, the scale is not reliable. I regret buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Scale w/ Weight Watchers Name!","review":"First of all, finally a scale from the leader in the Health industry!

However, my husband kept telling me that his weight would change by 5-10 lbs within a minute, 5 minutes, etc..Finally it happened to me and I realized he was right. I got out our old scale that is not digital and weighed myself. I was 5 lbs lighter on that one. To make sure that one was accurate I put my dumb bells on it and it read it exactly, then I added other items just to make sure. SUre enough, our old $10 scale was right. I think most of the digital scales are not going to be very good. I am going to stick with our non-digital scale from here on out. Don't be fooled by the technology and the sleek look."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Like other digital scales, this one is unreliable and doesn't work after a while of use.

I do not know why I put up with it's crazy readings for the last 4 years. Every day I would weigh 5 times and all five would be different (within a 5 minute period). Big differences, like 3-4 pounds.

Mine is incredibly accurate and in an effort to test it, I have stepped on and off of it several time in succesion and it always reads the same for me. I have weighed bags of sugar and flour and similar items and not had a problem. I would recommend, although obviously others do not feel the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"very futuristic....looking","review":"The reason why I paid 50 dollars for this scale was because 1. I thought it looked very cool and 2. I thought for that kind of money I would be getting something very accurate, after all it does weight to the tenth of a pound. I did read the other reviews about its inaccuracy, but chose to ignore them. Don't make the same mistake I did. I can go on and off the scale 10 times in a row and never get the same reading, not even close. I get extreme weights from 130lbs to 155lbs. Last I knew my weight was around 140lbs but I'll NEVER know with this piece of crap. I thought maybe it was just my slight movements that was throwing the numbers off so I weighed objects and still got varied results. But I must say it looks really cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"just for looks","review":"Although, the Weight Watchers ww42 scale may look nice on your bathroom floor, its measurements are terribly inconsistant.After zeroing the scale and paying close attention to my foot placement, I can get off the scale and back on the same way with almost a 5 pound differance in weight reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weight Watchers WW30","review":"This is the worst scale that I have ever used. It is not accurate.

I noticed however that depending on where the scale was located I would weigh different amounts, which didn't make any sense. But if I put the scale by the window which is near my stereo, I actually weigh less, than if it's sitting on the other side of the room by the closet. So I initially figured the floors are messed up, but as I moved it throughout the house, I noted the same thing different weights same time of day. So I joined curves to go along with my new life style and found out the scale was totally out of whack by more than 40 pounds!! So I guess this is just going to go in the trash a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality.

I've seen Field of Dreams, and that was a great baseball movie and even though it was a fantasy, I liked it. A League of Their Own, yeah, I liked the story, and really liked Bad News Bears.

On page 35 there is this wicked diagram of some intersecting hyper-planes, but little did I know that the diagram was mislabelled because as we all come to know in linear algebra, when the number of linear equations is equal to the numberof unknowns in those equations, and if the rank of A equals the number of equations, then the system has infinite solutions, not a single one as indicated by the intersecting planes.

It gives them enough support, and more importantly, enough constraint.We bought one for our first child, and then another with our second. Much lighter than a double stroller, mom and dad found the ability to head off in different directions at the store a great feature.The other feature I would like to point out is that it is lightweight to carry. Let's face it, after a certain age, kids don't want to 'sit' all day. They want to run and carry-on until they get so tired that they NEED to sit. We didn't mind toting this stroller about until it was time to use it.Four stars. Very versatile.

My child weighs in at an astoundingly obese 45 pounds at age 2, and this stroller carries him with the ease of Ricky Williams carrying a football. The biggest concern most parents have with strollers today is their safety, both in holding the child properly and the brake system. Luckily for the consumers of this product, Kolcraft has been in cahoots with Toyota and has implemented an anti-lock brake system perfect for the stop-and-go stroller pushing lifestyle of modern America. As if these safety features weren't enough to push you over the edge and order one of these immediately, they've even added a wildebeest laden sun visor so your kid can feel like he's admist a real African safari on those hot summer days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stroller \\"No Show\\"","review":"I can't rate this item because after following the instructionsduring my purchase, I was unable to verify that the recipient ofmy purchase would receive the Safari Umbrella Stroller as a freeaddition with my purchase.

The longest capture I have managed so far is 15 minutes, but most range in size from one minute to six minutes. After spending a day splicing together the fragments of a VHS tape I converted with the 350 and which I then burned to DVD, I discovered the quality of the image far below DVD quality. It is far below video tape quality.I am willing to spend some real money on a good video capture card but it isn't the WinTV 350.

Otherwise, you'll get an error, \\"Failed to create TV Window. hTV=0x3fa1f8 Err=8\\". Your hex address might be different than mine.I hook up a VCR to convert VHS into digital as well.The only negative thing about this card is the picture gets super white when content is bright in a large area. Watching ice hockey would be an example since the ice is really white, the details such as the puck and players would get \\"brighten\\" up as well and blend into the ice.

Hard blues flavored rockers, straight rockabily, hillbily, doo wop ballads, and more. In my opinion, Setzer is strongest when he stretches his musical boundaries. The strongest songs on this cd don't fit into the usual catagories most people associate with him. Songs like St. Jude and When the Bells Don't Chime sound fresh and remind me of career high points like Boulivard of Broken Dreams and Broken Man respectively. For a Setzer CD that breaks new ground and also contains his signature rockin' sound -- grab this one.

Gone is the witty lyrics of 68cbs and are placed with dull phrases such as, \\"I think the bar next door is gay.\\" Gone is the mind-boggling guitar work we know he is capable of and the swearing seems out of character and a bit unnecessary. The record seems very raw and if I remember correctly, these tracks were cut a few years before they were actually released.

Sadly, neither of these actresses were wearing masks in this film.What in the hell happened to Kelli McGillis? Don't expect to see anyone even closely reminiscent of the sensual Top Gun actress of long ago. McGillis is simply wooden in this role. Susie Porter is somewhat of a toad who appears to be wearing the same outfit throughout the movie's entirety. The acting is poor, the frequency of obscene language is distracting, the storyline is silly and the actresses chemistry is as romantic as a mud sandwich. Don't waste your time with this one or you'll end up feeling like a monkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly Awful","review":"How can a movie with Kelly McGillis naked in it be unwatchable? I didn't think it was possible, until I saw this. Mind you, it was free for me, since I have an Amazon Prime account, but even so, I couldn't finish it. First, the dialog is cringe-worthy. I can't remember when I've heard worse. Secondly, this is a murder mystery, and I don't really care who killed the girl who wrote the bad poetry. The detective, although a lesbian, is a caricature. She and McGillis get naked together, and we get to see lesbian bed death in action. Seriously. There is no chemistry whatsoever. Nothing. Yawn. Whoever thought it was a good idea to have the detective's thoughts as a voice over throughout the film should be shot. The only remotely interesting thing about this film is the mystery of why Kelly McGillis agreed to do it. Why, Kelly?

Rather than simply look at that if you just watch this film as an erotic thriller similar to Basic Instincts then you have a serious case of the yawn factor.The film simply does not get going, for a suspense thriller you need well, suspense! The characters are just so dull you get the impression even the actresses are bored and are just praying for the director to say \\"Cut\\" so then can go home. The film just drifts along at a walking pace and no sorry, just because the main characters are lesbian is not going to convince me the film is any good.A poor film that if you can sit through to the end you will be probably kicking yourself you just wasted and hour and a bit of your life when you could have been watching paint dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"DateNight","review":"This is a decent movie.

The characterizations were comic, sterotypical and shallow as if they had been fleshed out by one Kelly McGillis' \\"bohemian\\" students. And no one really looked good, as if they had already gone overbudget paying Kelly and couldn't afford enought make-up to cover all the actress' blemishes. Finally, the erotic scenes were odd, awkward and uninspired with absolutely no chemistry between the two principles. Susie Porter actually had more chemistry with Kelly Mcgillis' husband and seemed to enjoy her intimate moment with him more than any other in the film. One final note: There is an offensive moment that attempts to give credence to the notion that lesbians are predatory: When the Susie Porter character has a falling out with her lover, she goes to her lesbian friend for support -- the friend takes this as a nice opportunity to fondle Susie's breast......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Movie","review":"The Monkey's Mask is about a private detective who is searching for a missing girl.

I don't think it mattered too much if the detective was a lesbian, but she falls for a self absorbed bi-sexcual married female professor, Kelly McGillis. The story revolves around finding where and if the girl was murdered. Kelly McGillis was so unattractive that I couldn't concentrate on the story. I'm straight, so I might have spent too much time thinking why the dectective, Susie Porter was attracted to Kelly McGillis and it could have ruined the film for me, but I came away wishing I had not wasted time on the film.

The only reason I didn't give it that fifth star was my disappointment in the ending.

It will go down right away, but it just caught me off guard the first time it happened. Other than that - I love it.

I have used a Chi before (my sister-in-law's) and I loved how straight and silky it made my hair. After I bought this one, I tried it at home right away and thankfully it worked just as well! The tourmaline plates help prevent humidity from frizzing your hair...my hair is still straight and silky even after taking a shower. I highly recommend this straightener!

If I had a chance to do it over, I wouid buy a giddle pan to use in place of the combo cooker top. I have used new Lodge skillets and find them favorable to others now available.

In my teen years I was dealing with cast-iron a lot, that's was what my family cooked with, so I'm not new to this. However, the food started sticking to the bottom of the pans from the very beginning, even with oil, and after two uses both pans got ugly rust all over them. The handles on both sides are different in shape and holding angle, with makes it hard to handle this heavy pan. To crown it all, the handles are hot (I know that's how thew cast-iron supposed to be, that's a remark for those who are new to cast-iron cookware), and the more shallow pan is quite impractical in terms of using it as a cover for the deeper one. My overall impression is that using these pans has been the worst cooking experience in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad quality","review":"Bought for friend.

I cooked fish, veggies, burgers, pancake, and more, all turned delicious! For the first use, the food got stuck on the surface, but after that, I haven't had any problem. If you find the food stuck, let the pan cool down a little, then slowly scrape it off. It works for me.My favorite food was fried potatoes. Wash well and cut potatoes with skin on, cook slow with a plenty of oil (but not deep frying amount), season with salt, pepper, and any desired dried herbs... yummy... a big difference compared to frozen french fries!I was scared of using cast iron pans coz I have a glass stove top. So far, I have no problem with a caution. I usually like to shake the skillet when I stair fry, but cast iron pans are too heavy to do so in anyways...

The factory seasoning was not quite to my liking but this was not really a problem as it worked well enough that nothing stuck but after seasoning it again it is working perfectly.

This was the first combination we purchased after we cleaned up on old cast iron skillet from the back of the cupboard. What a great combination. The \\"cover\\" is a wonderful shallow pan, by itself. The bottom is really a chicken fryer, a deep pot, or a three-quart dutch oven. A standard 10.25 glass or cast iron cover will fit the bottom just as easily as the enclosed \\"cover/skillet\\" if you need it. The versatility of this combo is amazing. The seasoning was pretty good -- a bit of sticking and a couple of uneven spots, but with a bit of use it worked out.The day we unpacked it, we used the bottom as a chicken fryer (it is the Lodge CF pan, according to the markings on the bottom). It was the best fried chicken we've had in years. I love the pans. I can't wait to see what else I can do with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cast iron pan","review":"This is a great set of cast iron wear. Frying pan fits as lid.

Extra benefit is that it helps with anemia as the cast iron gives you a bit extra. Alos it was pre seasoned which is a nice plus.Would recommend to anyone.

Taking the uncertainty of the human situation to the edge, Beckett summarized his views at his deathbed \\"What did you find to enjoy about life?\\".....\\"Very little.\\" (approximately)As such, Beckett's repitiveness shows the monotony and boredom of existence. Some people, who find his plays painful, would be in a state totally akin to Beckett himself. I get more enjoyment out of reading the plays than watching them performed. They are too slow and devoid of action to be filmable. The sense of humor is not redemptive to life, but merely shows the bleakness more sharply by contrast. I personally prefer Camus to Beckett, who at least has a slightly more balanced view of life, if not more meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know it's a classic, but...","review":"I know this play is suppose to be a classic and a master of it's genre. But if this is the best this genre can produce, this genre must be worse than \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\". The play is trite and cliched. It's whole meaning is that everything is meaningless. Is it just me or is that a bit ironic? Unless you have to read this play for school, don't read it. If I had gone to see this play in a theatre I would have walked out after 5 minuntes. Why can't people write good and decent plays like Shakespeare or Sophoclese. (I know I spelled them wrong, Sorry.) This new genre of pointless dialogue is, well, pointless. I wonder if all of these playwrites are writing these plays and laughing at the fools that think they are good. Beckett is probably laughing in his grave because he is still fooling people.

For it to learn the codes from your current remote, another 10(TEN!!) steps. None of the codes provides worked with my brand new Westinghouse TV! This worked, but 25 buttons by hand was horrible!Next I programmed my roku box by code, once you find the right code ( there are several, though non under web tv), aux, it worked fine.

Given how long it takes to program this remote, I consider that an EPIC FAIL! I have since bought a Logitech Harmony 700. Instead of spending many hours programming & learning as I did with the RF20, I simply hooked the Logitech up to my computer and used their software to set it up.

The physical features that made the URC-200 one of the best remotes ever are gone. The RF-20 works pretty much the same in operation as the URC-200 but it is more difficult to use because of the physical changes (e.g., the navigational pad's redesign is not as responsive and hard to use). The buttons are also not of as high quality and the overall awesome feel of the URC-200 is gone.I'd recommend getting the URC-200 or looking at Universal Remote Control's professional remote selection to get a design more like the URC-200.

If you don't manhandle it (I broke one pretty easily first time out) you can store 4 mens slacks and 2-3 jackets. THE ZIPPER IS THE PROBLEM HERE. Its on the side not the front and doesn't go all the way up. Theoretically the side zipper would afford you easier access to your clothing and allow you to pick an individual garment more easily than a front zipper. The fact that it doesn't go up all the way negates this advantage. (Does anyone test these things in real life circumstances?) The 3/4 zipper makes getting your garments out a chore and a pain.

Honey West lies somewhere in between light-hearted Gilligan's Island and the totally serious Mission Impossible series. The plots are always serious at their hearts, but the whole show is somewhat tongue-in-cheek. As we've grown more accustomed to serious shows of destruction, explosions, and death, viewing this series will remind you of a time when America was more innocent. Honey West is somewhat like a ten-year-old's attempt to describe really serious events. The episodes involve a potentially serious situation but go on to treat it with an optimistic, childlike solution. It's cute, and it's old-fashioned, whole-family-can-watch-it entertainment. Even if you're a guy that has grown to expect Hollywood's current action thrillers, you'll still enjoy watching Anne Francis. She's hot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Francis","review":"I remember Honey West when it was on in 1965 TV. She was great to watch, fearless detective who could throw the bad guy with karate moves.

And Anne Francis goes right up there with Raquel Welch and and Ann-Margaret as one of the most charming and gorgeous stars of the Sixties.

If you are a person that enjoys old TV series perhaps you will like this set but I doubt it. I don't think that it is something that even a person in their 40s would sit through for long.

First of all, the USB connection from the product will simply disappear while I am capturing video (and this is after the 10.5.2 version is installed). Then, if I get lucky and am able to capture any video, the DVD creation fails every time. Of course there is no error message or troubleshooting information to explain why the DVD creation fails. This isn't to mention the extreme slowness of the application.

However, it has proved to be dependable and reliable has no shorts tranfers same quality as tape.It comes with Studio standard 10 w/bonus CD which is completely out dated and not much more than a demo. I purchased a copy of Studio 11 plus w/ ultimate upgrade which is the current. I get you get what you pay for and I got what I paid for. I paid for an adapter and that just what I got.

Finally I decided to go with the goggles and to use a red dot scope. This way I can continue to see in the dark without having to look through a scope, and at close range all you need is a red dot on the target anyway, no need to scope it. I was sceptical about the fit and use of the goggle head-harness but it fits pretty securely and comfortably. The harness is padded, adjustable, and comes with a chin strap. These goggles really work. They allow the wearer to see fine in complete darkness. There is a bit of fisheye on the fringes of the view but I guess that is standard in NV equipment. The focus ring does allow adjustment to view out to a distance but does not magnify the object. Overall I am pleased with these and plan to stock up on extra batteries. P.S.

The other bag is for our valuables (cell phones, GPS, wallet, keys, etc) when we go canoeing. Last year we went canoeing down a flooded unnavigable river, flipped our canoe, almost lost our paddles, did lose our fishing poles and almost everything in the canoe, but everything in the bags was safe and dry. When the canoe flipped it wedged under a downed tree that was underwater so the bags were submerged for a while until we could free the canoe. The bags were buckled to the canoe so didn't float off with the rest of our supplies.

The first trip it rained and it did feel like there was a lil moisture inside, and later I realized that I didn't seal it up the correct way. My husband went on his canoe trip and got back today. The river was at flood stage when they went, and they flipped the canoe and had to float holding on to the canoe for a while. The bag stayed afloat under the canoe and everything was completely dry.

I knew from the second he auditioned he was going to be my favorite - the one I would root for through the whole show. It still baffles me to this day he didn't win A.I. - he rocked - and every song he put down was awesome. He has an amazing voice that definitely needed to be found, and I think if he continues this path he'll make a true name for himself. It's Not Over and Over You are my two favorite songs on the cd, I can't even express how many times I've played them. [...]Chris has the voice for today's age and I think he'll grab many new fans, especially ones who weren't fans of A.I.I'm so glad he put out a CD, I had been waiting for it.

But his voice kept me listening until I really got to know the songs. Each one is unique and powerful once you let the lyrics sink in -- it takes a few listens to get there. I find these songs running through my head during the day and I can't wait to listen to them again -- when I do they seem to gain more and more meaning as time goes on. (By the way, he has writing credit on every single track, something most \\"Idols\\" can't claim.)

The person who called Daughtry's album an amazing disappointment should write an album's worth of music and then we can hear if that's worth 4 or 5 million in sales figures. Please. Put your money where your mouth is and let's hear YOUR stuff. I've been a music collector practically my whole life, and I take any armchair critic's claim of someone not having any talent with many MANY grains of salt. Daughtry's managed to land an opening spot on a Bon Jovi tour, and you don't get THERE with no talent at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome CD","review":"This is the best CD I have heard in a long time.

I was compelled to watch each week just to hear what he would come up with next. I was stunned when he was voted off so early. I have been watching and waiting ever since to see when he would come out with his first album. I knew it would be fabulous, and I was not disappointed. When you buy an album, it is usually to hear a song or two, but his whole album is worth listening to. I count him amoung my favorite artists, and eagerly await his next album.

This CD was definitely worth the wait!! I have not stopped playing it and it has brought a smile to my face every time I listen to it! It's not a hard rocker album, but a good solid rock effort IMO. Daughtry is a nice blend of catchy tracks like \\"It's Not Over\\", and ballads and a few harder tracks like \\"What I Want\\". My current favorite is \\"Crashed\\". Chris Daughtry has a gift. He touched so many of us during Idol and will reach many more fans, I'm sure, with this awesome debut Cd. I am SO much more pleased with this debut album that I was with the disappointing Bo Bice debut last year. I'm glad Chris didn't get pushed into a pop CD and was able to have the song creativity and band he wanted to make this CD. Rock on Chris!! Nice job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"***AWESOME***","review":"Chris Daughtry's first album is amazing. If you didn't know better, you'd think this was his 10th album instead of his first. He has done a great job of putting himself into each song.

Because the album had to be rushed out before season 6 of Idol started, Chris had to record with studio musicians instead of a real band.Pros:Catchy rock songs, meaningful lyrics, Chris's powerful vocals.Cons:Tempos of the songs don't vary much.The background mix is a bit too heavily processed.My favorites are: It's Not Over, Used To, Home, Over You, Crashed, Feels Like Tonight, Breakdown, What About Now, and Sorry (iTunes bonus track).Tag: American Idol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray For Daughtry.","review":"This is a great CD and I think it is going to be very radio-friendly as well as home-listening friendly.

You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!!!!! Brilliant, Alive, Vital!","review":"I don't watch telly so I had no idea he was am American Idol. Just picked up the tune from Ganymede's MySpace and fell in love with it. There is a power, a strength to his music. A wee dram of older rock, with a stamp of his own fresh power.

You'll be shocked when you hear how every song sounds the same on this album. It's not a bad song, but after after hearing it 12 times, you kind of get tired.

If you are a fan of his Absent Element stuff, you will be really disappointed in this CD, at least I am - even Slash couldn't save him. Such a waste of an incredible voice and talent. It is just really different - more like stuff that they would play on American Idol - very safe and no personality. On a few of the songs, I couldn't tell if he was making a country song or a rock song. He even managed to ruin \\"Breakdown,\\" (a song on his Absent Element CD) and totally mellowed it out. \\"There and Back Again\\" was pretty good and almost made me give this CD 2 stars, but I couldn't cause I want to know: WHERE'S THE ROCK AT CHRIS?

I just bought Tyler Hicks CD, and like Chris's debut better!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughtry Begins at Full Speed","review":"I am one who generally has to listen to an album several times before deciding on its value. This is a notable exception. Chris Daughtry has come out of the American Idol shadow with an album far better than anything expected or seen before. Only two of the songs, the second and last, seem to divert from his strengths. Overall, this album is one of the best I have ever bought. For the price it is selling at right now, you will not regret your purchase. My guess is that this will be the first of an outstanding career. If you like classic rock and solid, strong vocals, you will love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"More of the same old, same old, rocker. Not very appealing or interesting music.

I urge all of you to stay far away from this. Stay away from linkin park, stay away from nickleback, and just stay away from mediocrity in general. I much rather you join the legions of teenage girls and praise fall out boy over this garbage. It's half a notch above this, but hey, I believe in baby steps. WHat don't I like about this CD? Well, for starters, every horrible 90's radio rock cliche is contained in just the very first song. If you're going to steal bits from other acts, how about acts with merits? Steal from the Velvet Underground. Take guitar riffs from The Stooges. Take melodies from The Beatles for christs sake. I am not encouraging rip-offs but if you are void of creativity (daughtry) then atleast have the decency to stay away from abominations such as nickleback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs Suing in Screaming Form","review":"Daughtry was, by far, the most talented singer on last season's Idol. In fact, Katherine cannot even begin to dream of having as good of a voice with her watered down, weak, pitchy voice. Hicks is a good singer, but not original and a performing fool. Daughtry disappoints those who were disappointed by his departure from the show way too early. The songs are screamed and seem untrue to his own style. Idol, once again, took a very good voice and \\"engineered\\" it to fit a certain - already done too much style - just to sell to the masses who buy only one type of sound. I predict his recording career will be over very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old same old","review":"I personally have thought all along that Chris Daughtry sounds like every other rock musician out there. I for one would like to hear something I haven't heard in a long time or never before. I would not recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughtry? Don't!","review":"Daughtry. What an amazing disappointment. This is pure trash. Just goes to show you that no talent will get you somewhere. I had to give it a star. It should give me back 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super CD","review":"I was more than satisfied with this CD. Had heard only two cuts from it, and that is what prompted me to purchase it. GREAT rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of all time...LOVE IT!!!!!","review":"This is my favorite CD of all time. Ofcourse, I am a Chris Daughtry fan.It is rock, but has a soulful quality. Buy this CD. Let the Music and lyrics lift you up and mellow you out. I heard it was the fastest selling album ever!!!!!!! I would give this CD 10,0000 stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!!! This CD is AWESOME","review":"This Cd is so good. I love every song!! I have never purchased a CD that I love every song on it. It is impossible to pick a favorite song because they are all so good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very mediocre.","review":"I am shocked seeing all of these 5 star reviews. THIS CD IS VERY BORING. I wouldn't waste your money on it. It actually reminds me of The Real Thing by Bo Bice, except even more boring. Sounds like a Nickelback Clone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris daughtry? WOW, doesn't sound like it!","review":"this CD was bad, i didn't even like any of the songs, They all pretty much sounded the same, yah, he has a good voice but the songs sound the same! Thats not 21st century people want!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unoriginal garbage","review":"I'm willing to bet most of this guy's fans are either young teenagers (who will buy anything) middle aged mothers(and maybe some fathers) who don't have a clue about what good music is, or, girls/women who just think he's \\"hot\\". This entire album is commercial watered down garbage. I knew it was going to be bad before i heard it, but I listened to it so I could write an educated review. All the songs sound alike. No originality, no creativity. He has a little vocal talent, but it doesn't help much at all. Anyone who thinks this is good music needs some serious education."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT!!!","review":"It's almost as hot as he is! Love every song! This CD will leave NO doubt...Chris was robbed on Idol!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD","review":"This is the best CD I've heard in a long time. Well worth the money. Most CD's only have a few good songs, every song on this CD is a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was blown away!","review":"Seriously, blown away at the quality of this record. I really just wanted \\"I'm Going Home,\\" which I think is one really great production - the tempo, the sentiment, the poetry and the artistic performance. When I played the whole album, I was truly blown away by how great this is. Every track has something great to recommend it. If you love rock, the kind of music that you can play in the background and feel good about, and then turn it up and really listen to the sound and poetry, I'm telling you, buy this record. You will find yourself grabbing this one often. After this debut album, I can hardly wait to see what comes next. By far, one of the most talented emerging performers to come along in a while, even if he did start on American Idol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughtry Rocks!","review":"Chris Daughtery's new CD is fantastic! It truly is a rock-and-roll album! All the songs are amazing but I especially like tracks 3 and 12 -- they get to the heart and soul of what music and love are all about! Buy this CD for someone you love who loves rock music --- they won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I got chills...","review":"I cried, perhaps that's pathetic at 37 years of age but this is the first cd I have bought in almost 8 years and it's so amazing I bought 2. I was blown away but the entire album but particularly moved by \\"Home\\" and \\"Over You\\".Congrats Mr. Daughtry, you deserve every bit of your success and I have a feeling this is just the very begining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughtry Review","review":"This album is awesome. Very few people ever get it right the first time, Daughtry did. It was good the first time I listen, and gets better each time I hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I knew he had talent, but he really out it all out there on display for us to enjoy. I will say this...don't get too Hollywood or full of yourself Daughtry. You were too primped & plucked on your American Idol return performance. However, the album is rockin & we want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughtry","review":"I love this CD and music! Not to be critical, but some of the songs were a little louder than others so I the sound quality could have been a little better on one or two of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD.","review":"Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. She normally listens to harder rock, this is a little more mainstream poppy kind of music, but she likes it anyway. She originally saw Chris on Am. Idol and liked him on the show. All in all a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic","review":"Love it! I was beginning to lose faith in the music industry but now feel hope that authentic music still exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I bought the cd as I'd heard \\"Home\\" and loved it, hoping the rest of the tracks would be as good; and it is. Daughtry delivers some great music which is easy to listen to over and over. If you've heard one of their tracks and liked it, its probably a good idea to but the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"I was looking forward to this album but was very disappointed. I found it very 'samey' in that all the tracks seemed to blend into one sound. For fans of hard rock only I'm afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Generic","review":"You can play this back to back with most of the Adult Contemporary Rock and you wouldn't be able to pick it out if a crowd. Like anything from American Idol, it plays pretty much safe to the middle. There is nothing groundbreaking here at all. There are some good songs and the guy does have charisma but, it begins to blend in with the woodwork after a awhile because you have heard it all before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaw breaking yawn!!!","review":"If you're a 13yr old teeny bopper who knows nothing about real rock music this is the album for you... I'm glad I \\"found\\" this and didn't have to waste any money on it because I would have felt GREATLY ripped off... This guy acts like a girl in a guy's body and this music sounds the same as the other 100+ wannabe's that MTV and corporate radio wanna pass off as rock... Buy some Stevie Ray Vaughn or some Pink Floyd and leave this wannabe Daughtry on the shelf where he belongs... Slowly inching his way to the 99 cent bin (or the plastic recycling bin)... Just like Nickelback..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic songs from a great singer...","review":"OK,,,Chris CAN sing, but it seems that THEY got a hold of him and his album is so typical, its disgusting. There isnt one shred of originality on it. I cant believe the SOOOOO generic \\"Its all over\\" is now number 1. I guess American Idol fans must be blinded by lack of orginality. I hope Chris can get past this crap, and really ROCK, like I know he can."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Idol, A Refreshing Change...But This Ain't An Idol World...","review":"Poor Chris Daughtry. What's an American Idol also-ran to do? Throughout the competition he was the odds-on favorite to win until the very night he was voted off in lieu of the caterwauling Katherine McPhee. Despite the audible gasps from the over-reacting audience, let's get one thing clear: in the realm that was Idol, he was a refreshing breath of crisp, unadulterated air. Unfortunately, in the outside world, he would win the Nickelback Karaoke Contest. And that is the pitfall we have here [and there are no pits to fall farther than Nickelback]. There is no range or depth to his music, you've heard it all before on today's rock radio, for better or worse. My grade: B-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chris Daughtry CD Good but CD cases always arrive broken!!!","review":"I've really liked Chris Daughtry's music ever since he appeared on American Idol. Of course, I like some songs better than others. My major complaint is about receiving the CD's broken. They \\"ALWAYS\\" end up being cracked when I get them. For this reason, I'm not buying another CD from Amazon. I gave the item one star because of the condition of the case, not the music itself. I think people should be aware of how stuff arrives. Maybe Amazon will change things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Chris Daughtry was my second favorite on American Idol last year. This cd shows his rock edge. Even if you don't like rock you will still like this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Daughtry","review":"This CD is exactly what all of us that demanded more Daughtry trusted it would be.....Pure Daughtry!!! Love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughtry Rocks","review":"Chris Daughtry wowed audiences with his appearance on American Idol. While it has been disappointing not to hear Chris's music in the past few months, this album has been far from disappointing and more than worth the wait. Chris's rich vocals and inspiring lyrics will make this a must have album. Kudos to Chris, the band and everyone who was responsible for bringing this album to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Congrats on an awesome cd Daughtry!!!","review":"I have not one cd in my collection where I love more than just a few tracks per cd...until now! Daughtry's entire cd is absolutely amazing!! Several of the songs have a \\"huge\\" potential of becoming #1 hits!! I have no doubt in the world that we will be hearing alot more of Daughtry in the weeks, months and years to come! Way to go guys!! Keep doin' what your doin' and keep on rockin'!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughtry","review":"Ahh! Chris, I loved you on Idol, where's that sultry, yet clear voice. Disappointed in this album. It sounded too ordinary, Know you can do better and I'll keep watching for it. Let's hear some solos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughtry Delivers a Good CD","review":"This is definitely a good CD. Not one of the most original sounding rock CD's I've heard, but a solid CD from a good band with catchy songs. If you like rock music, you'd probably like it. Nothing exceptional here, but still worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Daughtry Should Have WON!!","review":"There is NO WAY, as an AMERICAN IDOL fan that you can let this CD get by you!! Chris Daughtry is the clear and present danger to all those wanna bes and shoulda beens...wow. THIS MAN IS HOT!!! Take me \\"HOME\\" and it has nothing to do with the physical...I LOVE this guy's talent and vocals are just WAY SEXY and MOVING. Long time since an ARTIST has been this Talented!

Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I enjoy a variety of music and I always would hear Daughtry while in the gym but never purchased any of their music until now. This is worth the money. Great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not trying to rain on anyone's parade, but..","review":"I am just not that impressed with this CD. I was worried that he was becoming too one dimensional on American Idol, and unfortunately, that continues on his CD. The material does sound a little like Nickelback, but that's not exactly the problem. It's not a Nickelback or even a Live clone. The problem is that the riffs don't let loose enough and it's too slow and ballady to stand out. Nothing pulls at you like his version of \\"I Walk The Line\\" did. I don't know if Chris planned it this way or not, but to me, the edge is missing and it blends in. I like \\"There And Back Again\\" the most, where he can really show his rocker persona. He has a good voice (definitely better than the singers in Nickelback, Fuel, Creed, and Hinder,) so I hope he does better next time. If you disagree with this review, that's fine, but I'm entitled to my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst best selling album of the year ever???","review":"This is everything that is wrong with Rock music. It's soul is inflated with empty hooks and exaggerated lyrics. Tennie boppers, please buy a Wilco or Sigur Ros CD, your minds will be blown and Rock N Roll will be better for it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughty is an Excellent Freshman Album","review":"There is not a single song I feel the need to \\"skip over\\" on this CD, which is unbelievably rare in my experience. \\"It's Not Over\\" is very catchy, and so are \\"Used To\\" and \\"Over You\\". \\"Home\\" may very well be the best song on the CD, and it's not really rock. It has huge potential to cross over the pop charts and the country charts. I also love the hard rocking songs on the disc. \\"What I Want\\" gets your head \\"banging\\" and \\"There and Back Again\\" is dark and edgy, almost reminding me of a little Metallica sound. \\"All These Lives\\" has a great sound and \\"Breakdown\\" is very haunting and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much More Than I Expected!! AWESOME!!","review":"I was a Chris Daughtry fan all along but I was really glad he got voted off. He was able to pursue his own \\"stuff\\" and not American Idol songs.This is a terrific CD. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME, BLAND","review":"I was so happy when chris one of my favoite idols released his cd. I was even more excited when I got the cd home. the problem is that even the best song which is the single It's Not Over are nothing to get excited about. the songs are dull with no life. chris I have to say tries to save this cd by singing his heart out. But that's not enough. I'm not giving up on Chris yet, I will wait till his next cd comes out and this time listen to the cd before I buy it. I very suprised that it was this bad, but I will try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAUGRITY THEN","review":"this is a great cd love it...... i cant say enough about it... only thing is i wish that wanted dead or alive had been on there as well.. maybe next time he will pair up with Bon Jovi"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm thanking God right now!","review":"that he didn't win cause well, we all remeber how Bo's cd sounded. it wasn't very good, didn't live up to the potential. I am however, disappointed that Chris still had to put some AI into this. 4 of the songs sound exactly alike, \\"It's Not Over\\" \\"Used To\\" \\"Over You\\" & \\"Gone\\", & if you wanted to pick one of those to listen to, I'd go with his single, \\"It's Not Over\\" cause it is catchier then the others! however, what seperates this album from Bo's is that the rest of the album switches around alot. every other song is worth listening to! it has substance, it has style! \\"What I Want\\" & \\"There & Back Again\\" are good solid rock songs! \\"What About Now\\" \\"Feels Like Tonight\\" & \\"Home\\" are great catchy ballads with alot of heart put into it from Chris! this is the album I wanted him to have, not so much AI, though I would've preferred no AI into it but Chris' next album will be something to remember! but this was a solid start from the rocker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it end?","review":"I actually had somewhat high hopes for this album. Daughtry showcased his impressive vocal capabilities along with an appreciation for the classics on American Idol, so I thought his album might be a fusion of those two qualities. Wrong. The music on this album is utterly indistinguishable from the legions of other \\"alternative\\" artists on the radio today. Simple guitar riffs repeated over and over, yawn-inducing percussion, cookie-cutter song structure...when will this \\"alternative\\" wasteland finally be done away with? I anxiously await the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"Chris Daughtry was the most interesting Idol, the only one who seemed to be as much artist as singer. He does not prove it here with a balls-to-the-wall onslaught of MTV-ready noise. I was hoping for something more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good first album, but he has more to offer than this","review":"Might as well call this \\"Monster Ballads Vol XX\\"Duaghtry is a rocker. You can tell that he made the best of the songs his writers gave him. Daughtry never really rocks on this album. His vocals are strong, and in range for him, but the genre is basically rock ballads. Keep in mind that this album is produced through the American Idol contract, and that Daughtry's input is probably limited. He is truly talented, and has incredible potential to develop.Good album, but better are yet to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"There are not enought positive words in Webster's Dictionary to describe how great this CD is...The words, the music, the passion, are indescribable. HE ROCKS like no one I have ever heard and I predict multi platinum sales and major awards for this cd. I can't even pick one favorite song they are each great in their own way. I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed!","review":"Perfect Rock artist. Does it for me. Feel the angst and hunger in Daughtry's voice which you won't hear in many modern contemporary artists these days. Some songs in this album are a little too similar but the rock sound mixes are interesting and does the trick. Very satisfied, hoping for more to come soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"chris rocks","review":"i got to say i was soooo disappointed when chris got voted off idol. he was by far the best singer in the bunch. i voted for him every week, as many times as i could get through. i am glad to see he got a record deal out of it. this guy can truly sing, and if you watched idol you know he could sing many styles of music and always did an excellent job. One of my favorite idol performances was of I walk the line, i love how he took every song and made it his own. Chris i hope you read this. you truly deserve to be where you are and have great success. you got robbed out of winning idol, but i believe in the end you will out-sell the competition anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Guy Does It All","review":"Ever since I watched Chris Daughtry perform \\"I Walk the Line\\" on American Idol, I was hooked. This guy is outstanding. This guy rocks. What's better yet, Chris can do it all. He's got range, emotion, power, subtlety and it's all the real thing. His ability to be innovative is truly unbelievable. On this album he just goes through a whole range above, below and right on target rudimentary rock and roll music. Chris seems to have mastered every interpretation of different styles of rock. Chris is reinventing the rock and roll wheel and presenting a whole new sound and it is amazing. He is that good and this album is testament to what Chris Daughtry is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny!","review":"I never hesitated a minute to purchase the Daughtry Deluxe Edition--I have nearly worn out my original CD! If you are already a Daughtry fan or if you just like awesome music, this is for you. \\"Feels Like the First Time\\" is great, and I also love the acoustic versions of \\"Home\\" and \\"What About Now\\". But the DVD alone is worth the cost--it's like my own personal concert that I can watch any time I want! This band is so talented, and we will be hearing about them for a very long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELENT !","review":"SURE TO BE A CLASSIC ! GREAT ROCKING CD. ALSO HAS A CONTEMPORARY COUNTRY SOUND, BUT MOSTLY ROCK'S THE WAY I LIKE IT! CHRIS HAS AN AMAIZING VOICE THAT STAND'S ON IT'S OWN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"The message and music of the CD is excellent. We loved his performances while competing for American Idol and look forward to whatever else this fine performer has to deliver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughtry; The Real Deal :)","review":"Great debut album from Daughtry,although it might be a little generic as what other reviewers said. But still overall,a very enjoyable album offering and powerful vocal delivering of songs from Chris. Although a pity that he was voted off during the final 4,it brought good news instead when Chris had formed a band and was going to release an album.My top 5-It's Not Over-Over You-Gone-Feels Like Tonight-HomeAnd..please..stop comparing Daughtry to Nickelback..Creeds or other rock bands..and who says they're Nickelback wannabes? If Daughtry was,I would put Hinder in front of Daughtry for the line-up of Nickelback wannabes. Geez. There may be some people who dislike this album or Daughtry,but I'm definitely one of them who enjoy Daughtry and their album as a die-hard fan! 4 stars for this album,a must-have for all Daughtry fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT","review":"Daughtry is the all around rock star in our modern times and will stay that way for a long long time. Up and coming rock stars fade but not Daughtry, he will command the spotlight and adapt what will be popular for the coming younger and older generation. LOVED HIS CD. MY FAVORITE CD SO FAR. For all of you that say all of his songs sound the same, you guys are nuts. Can't wait for his next album. ROCK ON DAUGHTRY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets all expectations","review":"Excellent CD - Chris Daughtry should have won American Idol and this album is proof of what a great musician he is. I exepect we will see a lot more from Daughtry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss that Absent Element sound","review":"Don't get me wrong - I love Chris Daughtry, and will continue to buy his CDs. But some of this was a little too \\"generic\\" sounding for me. There were only 4 songs I liked on the CD. I really miss the driving beats and individuality of the Absent Element sound from Chris' earlier days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughtry","review":"Daughtry is an excellent album by an awesome artist that should sell millions of copies.

It has been something I can enjoy as well as my 13 and 15 year old boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut Album","review":"I received this cd as a birthday gift and I love it! As a debut album, Daughtry started out right..the combination of great vocals, lyrics and music make this cd a best seller. I can't pick a favorite song..I like them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughtry","review":"Chris Daughtry really did well with his debut album. Can be compared to Nickelback and Live. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nickelback? Another One? Why?","review":"I had great hopes for him when I actually broke down and watched American Idol (when he sang Higher Ground) with my wife because of him and my wife watches it. I am very disappointedd to say he sounds just like Nickelback. I do not like Nickelback either. I thought he had the Audioslave quality to him, but then he comes out with a cd which sounds like a new Nickelback cd. Weak, real weak. Very disappoining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Gasp for the Emo Rock Genre?","review":"Dull, predictable and over-wrought, this post American Idol runner-up is without originality or perspective. Chris's influences are so obvious, it begs the question, do we even need to hear him? He brings nothing new to the table, and has no musical depth beyond the very immediate emo rock genre. His sound is so \`now', it's practically too late! He doesn't move forward, and he doesn't have enough depth in musical knowledge to make any sort of independent statement. It may be selling, but word to the wise Chris, save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd","review":"over all not to bad for his 1srt cd,need more rock in to it..so good luck DAUGHTRYWISH YOU THE BEST!!it came in really fast and in perfect condition this cdthan you"},{"rating":"1","title":"They All Sound The Same","review":"i love Chris, but after listening to this CD (and my husband said the same thing), all the songs sound the same. It's hard to differentiate where one stops and the next one starts. I'd have loved to see \\"Ring of Fire\\" on this CD, but there are no ballads, no change of tempo... Simon would have said, \\"Lacks imagination\\". I know Chris can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"I was impressed when Daughtry didn't jump at the chance to front Fuel, choosing to stay the course and do his own thing. But his own thing sounds like a watered down Nickleback. There are a couple of radio friendly songs that are easy to listen to because they sound like you have heard them a thousand times already. Not once does this album \\"Rock\\" like many of the previous reviews mention. The album is mid-tempo throughout and never comes alive. The guy has a good voice which we all knew anyway... but he doesn't have any writing talent. He should have hooked up with Fuel just to learn how to craft song writing.Obviously the album will sell because he has so many fans from being on TV, but there will be no staying power with more dribble like this. Hope he socks away the money he is making now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cookie cutter","review":"The problem with this CD is that there is an overwhelming sameness among the songs. Each is a variation on a theme that has been done ad nauseum by Live, Fuel, and Nickelback. It's bad enough to be derivative and imitative of other bands, but worse to be that within your own CD. If you like the sound, I'd suggest downloading a couple of songs -- my choices would be \\"Home\\" and \\"Over You\\" -- from iTunes. Just play those two songs six times and you've got the entire CD for just $1.89."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nickelback? Creed? 3 Doors Down? Oh.. It's Chris Daughtry? Really? Hmm...","review":"That's how generic his music is. There's no rawness, there's no emotion. Just plain, basic, sweet, over and over again.Even the lyrics are full of sugar. Nothing that could make you stop for a while, and think, and then go back and listen. I thought he loves Ed Kowalczyk of Live, no?However, I have no doubt that he will sell millions of copies. He'd better be quick before another Idol \\"rocker\\" coming out of this year's season!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't know Chris loved Nickleback this much","review":"The CD sounds good, it has a catchy feel to it, but it sounds EXACTLY LIKE NICKLEBACK. Don't get me wrong, I own all things by them, but really, I was hoping for something heavier and more original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the Best American Idol Rock Album Yet","review":"Okay, maybe it's the only true rock album to come out of American Idol, but it is very good. Much better than the \`pop' album that Bo Bice was obviously forced to make. It definitely holds its own with the other rock albums of its genre, such as Live, etc. After listening to it several times I have come to the conclusion that there may not be any mega-hits on it, but every single song holds merit. There is not a bad song on the album. Definitely a good one to pop in the cd player on a long drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I didn't expect his album to be this good. I even thought he made a mistake turning down the lead in \\"Fuel.\\" I was wrong on both. The album, while not perfect, exceeded any expectations I had. The more I listen, the more I like it. At first, as with most albums, the music runs together. But as you listen more, the songs stand out. I especially like \\"All These Lives.\\" Many people make comparisons to Nickelback here. There is some merit to those claims, as they do sound a bit similar. However, I think Chris's voice is smoother than, and has more range than Chad Kroeger's. If I had to classify it, I'd call it more of a mix of Chad Kroger and Aaron Lewis. That's not bad, since Staind is by far my favorite.If you're undecided whether to buy the album, you owe it to yourself to at least preview the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is a great CD! Way to go Chris! Every song is good on this CD. Can't wait to see what else he comes up with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this CD","review":"I am usually hesitant these days to purchase CD's because there may be only one or two songs on the entire thing that I care for. This CD was different. Every song is great. My only disappointment is that \\"Breakdown\\" is almost identical too his song \\"Conviction\\", which is not on the CD, and I prefer \\"Conviction\\". Other than that, I love every track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Surprise","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I bought this CD. I don't watch American Idol so when I bought it I didn't know he had been on the show. I just wanted the song \\"Home\\" by the random voice on the radio. I was pleasantly surprised by the songs I got and the voice I heard. I would recommend this CD to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughtry - A winner","review":"I don't fret when good singers don't win the \\"American Idol\\". Daughtry has just proved who a \\"true winner\\" is. His album is #1 selling over Dream Girls, and he's just a great singer. I didn't give the album 5 stars because I have not heard the whole thing, but I love \\"IT's not over\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stonker - who'd have thought!","review":"Brought this CD for my daughter because she liked Chris Daughtry on American Idol, but I must admit I've been playing it in the car ever since. It's a real stonker of a CD. Some great tracks for a debut album, especially 'All These Lives', 'Used To' and 'Over You'. Great to listen to in the car, especially when you crank it up load and sing along at the top of your voice - even if everyone else of the road thinks you're a nutter!Have to admit, I was surprised at just how good it was. Thoroughly recommended. Get past that he was on American Idol, this guy and his band are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"the real winner:)","review":"i really didnt want to watch american idol after all the really bad people were off, but my girlfriend made me watch it with her. im glad she did. if i hadnt i would have never seen chris daughtry. his voice is fantastic. i also really like his writing and the fact that he is a writer, not just singer. anyway, great artist, great disc and what were you people thinking? taylor hicks? seriously..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughtry Rocks!","review":"This is pure Daughtry!

I was disappointed that they didn't have a full album to take home with me, but I finally picked this up when it came out last week.The album was worth the wait. Every song is solid, the lead has a great soaring voice, and they already proved their worth as a live act. It is a really well done rock n roll album. \\"Strange New Place\\" \\"Ceasefire\\" and \\"Control\\" are pretty killer rock songs.... \\"Element\\" \\"Send Me Out\\" and \\"Fall Behind\\" show a softer side... the opening song \\"Days Away\\" is incredibly powerful. The lead singer's voice is really haunting at times with his soaring voice being a prominent feature throughout the disc.

My intention was to make a world tour by motorcycle and idea was to read how Mr. Rogers had done his trip and maybe to get some ideas. But the book was a total disappointment (wasting of money). Firstly disappointed to the layout of the book. A few hundreds of pages in the book, but if I remember correctly, just eight photos - black and white!Another reason was that I think I could notice the writerhaving some arrogant attitudes towards local cultures and people. Well, he's a rich man, possibly he thinks he can buy anything with his money.I expected more description of the local cultures and things they experienced on their almost-2-year-tour. I can say that I didn't learn anything new from his book, nor didn't bother to read it completely.I did my world tour by MC in July 1997 - October 1999...."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy--borrow from your local library","review":"An arrogant, rich guy brags at length about snagging a trophy girlfriend (his client's daughter), then chuckles to himself as he motors his shiny BMW bike through crowds of \\"brown faces\\" (I think those were his actual words). As a travelogue, this book fails because all of the locations and cultures blur together. As a means of imparting financial strategy, this book also fails--for the reasons noted in other reviews. Anything worthwhile the author has to say is completely nullified by his enormous ego, which comes across on every page. For those of you seeking adventure writing or stock tips, look elsewher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"A highly original piece of travel writing that is also informative. NOT for the investment professional, but then again, the lessons learned are the types you don't learn in textbooks! Like how manual and human based a lot of stock markets were in the early 90s. Looking back the book hasn't dated. It's interesting to see how many projections were spot on."},{"rating":"2","title":"stellar tour","review":"Investment Biker is a fascinating book for anyone interested in biking, world history, or economics.

By reading this book, through the author's eyes you can experience a graet world bike adventure. In this tour, you are going to see natives' lives and cultures in those countries, even to understand those and world economics, for as a investor on the bike the author observes those areas in detail from many viewpoints. It's interesting and useful to read this book, by which you can enjoy a world bike adventure and study economics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic International Perspective, Adventure, and Tutorial","review":"Jim Rogers does an excellent job of describing his bike touraround the world. This book brings home some of the issuesthat have plagued mankind for centuries and how man has never been able to learn from past mistakes. Knowing thisas Jim points out makes for excellent investment opportunities abroad. After reading the book, one becomesfamiliar with the geopgraphical, cultural, and economicclimate of the areas Jim has visited. Some of the adventuresthat Jim describes, such as the face-off with the Frenchmanin Zaire, and the battle on the border in Argentina, soundkind of suspect. All in all this book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Ugly American Abroad","review":"I heard about this book when it first came out, but wasn't interested in subject or author so never read it.

This isn't just an around the world motorcycle journey but a look at the current state and future direction of world economies. If you have read Dave Barr's Riding the Edge, Barr goes around the world on a dollar a day while Rogers does it on a thousand dollars a day. He even buys a new bike for his girl friend in Japan to finish the trip because her old one wouldn't make it.

You don't find out until the very end of the book just what the supernatural portion of this book really is and by that time I didn't care. So much of this book is confusing because it isn't explained up front. The prose is choppy -- the references to characters and places are very old school. Just an odd book that wasn't worth the time investment to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Slow","review":"The problem with this novel is that it never really goes anywhere. The supernatural element is hardly intriguing and the mystery itself is a real bore. Even the author's description of the Hollywood nightlife and the disco era fail to captivate.

This is a complete surprise and I am sure the studio heads or Rains had to be at the bottom of this as Jack Pierce is probably the best make-up man to ever grace the movies with his genius work! He is famous for creating all the enduring classic monsters, Dracula, The Wolfman, Frankenstein's Monster, The Mummy and so many more! I would think he would have had a really great concept for the Phantom. The movie should still be in any horror fan's collection. The DVD has only been released once a while back. It is loaded with extras and the transfer is good. I'm sure there is room for improvment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phantom of the Opera CD","review":"I rated this ITEM low, only because it was an edition that was older than I expected.

This film focuses much more on the opera than the Phantom. The film's style precedes that of Lloyd Webber's musical.This version takes considerable liberties with Leroux's original story. Some events are still intact, such as the chandelier crash scene and, of course, the unmasking. However, some scenes like the masked ball are not included at all. The Phantom's back story was also completely revised. With all these changes, fans that are looking for and updated, colorized version of the 1925 film may be disappointed. If they had made many more changes, I could hardly call this a Phantom of the Opera movie.Overall, if you are looking for a different take on the Phantom story, you may like this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great universal movie wasted with old music.","review":"This has to be the best universal movie ever made. It contains a masterpiece plot and a group of great actors with good parts...... but then the old fat lady came to sing! That old fat lady who sings the 20 min song wastes the role of Claude Rains. Claude Rains is very scary as the phantom, though he looks very young for his age. Sue Foster is very beliveable as the young actress, and Nelson Eddy is horrid as a viewer. It seems that the movie has many sparks, but just can't add up enough scares to kill the fat lady!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie if your into watching old classic horro movies","review":"The Phantom of the Opera is a good movie because some people don't like to watch some of todays horror movies.

It does not tell you his real emotions except perhaps being a perverted old man who has a special likings for young women. Nothing was accurate to any story I've ever heard and compared his being with that of a sewer rat. The love story is absolutely awful, esspecially because of the fact that no one gets the girl, the one who was obsessed with her dies, and the two \\"dashingly handsome\\" men who competed for her affections, gave very little mind to the fact that she chose neither of them in the end.

This one worked to make the Phantom considerably more sympathetic and tragic than any other version of the story I've seen. For starters, we get to know his character for the first half hour before he becomes disfigured. This version explores his obsession with Christine and what draws him to live the depths of the Opera House. I also enjoyed the new characters, including the performance of Nelson Eddy. The makeup was a bit toned down considering what the Lon Chaney film had done about two decades before this movie. Also the finale seemed a bit rushed considering the build-up, but these things I forgive. This one is definitely one to be remembered, and a must for any movie collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay Version of a CLassic Story","review":"I love the story of the Phantom of the Opera.

His whole film career at MGM never allowed him to display his talent so beautifully. Claude Raines was very effective as the Phantom, and Susanna Foster, in her first film role was a beautiful and talented Christine. The opera scenes were well staged, and for a 1943 film at Universal, it was quite lavish. The underground lair of the Phantom was chilling--I do believe I read that part of the set was where the Lon Chaney version was filmed. A bit of trivia--this is the only film in which Mr. Eddy did not win the leading lady at the end. Hopefully this convinced him to never dye his blond hair black again and grow a mustache:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very violent book, but enthralling","review":"This book both captured me and repelled me.The concept and storyline are well fleshed out and very clever.

This is not a quantitative text, the discussions on finite difference and finite element methods include very little math. I would have also liked to have seen a better discussion of well hydraulics. I still turn to it for a reference as it is a very useful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap, just crap","review":"Bought this in September 2012.

From the intro, \\"You Know\\" confirms that the material in this album (including the jaw-dropping liner notes) is going to be as naughty as the album title suggests. It's chockful of electronic bleeps, clash, bumps, whips, chains, cocks and locks. Adriano Canzian tells us he's sometimes bisexual, sometimes transsexual... but always gay. And proudly so. This is edgy music of the 21st century that will do well in any discerning club (or dungeon, for that matter). Let the Macho Boy rip!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful is the title of this review","review":"Because beautiful is only one of the ways to describe this amazing documentary. Everything that is said during these short \\"interviews\\" with the Buddhist monks and nuns is almost worthy of writing down for future reference. Many of us have wanted to take off and find solitude, and the maker of this film has done just that. He packed it all up, moved to China, learned Chinese, and spent months tracking down the whereabouts of the elusive mountain hermits, and thats only the first 5 minutes of the film. If you are interested in seeing China from a mountain hermits perspective, just purchase this film. It is ensightful as well as inspiring. I have watched it twice in a week and I am looking forward to watching it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amongst White Clouds","review":"This movie is just what I had wanted - more about the scene and environment than story line.

It provides a lesson in Buddhism, but not the one I was expecting. I was expecting to hear or see actual translation of what the hermits were saying about the practice, yet there were very few lines translated. I got more wisdom from watching Kung Fu Panda with my son, than I got from this movie. To say I was dissapointed, is an understatement. I don' think I will ever watch this movie again. I purchased this film, in part, to share with friends and family who were not familiar with Buddhism. Even as an enthusiastic practitioner, I find little in this film to inspire me to want o know more about Buddhism, which is a shame. Don't waste your money, donate it to a charity like SAVA instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe there was good intention, but was so mixed up....","review":"If you like to drink hot coffee mixed with iced tea, you will enjoy and value the movie.

If you think the series is dying like i did you should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Book. You really get to know Samantha!","review":"I think that this was an excellent book. It was a little sad but it teaches you that not all things involved with horses are perfect and there are some cruel people out there who treat their horse bad. This book also lets you really get to know Samantha. I found out a lot of stuff about her and her mother that I didn't know. I enjoyed this book, not only because it was informative and truthful, but because I thought it was well written and deserves a five-star-review. Keep up the good work. I just have one more thing to say. Why does it keep saying:Created by Joanna Campbell? I wish she would still write them. I mean, I love Karen Bentley too, but I think they should switch off, like every other book. Anyway, I would recommend this book to any Thouroghbred book fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like this flavor but the bars were months past expiration","review":"This rating is for Amazon sending me bars that were months past their expiration date.

As such, it is very outdated; for instance, it still lists the solar system as having 9 planets, the purpose of the thymus as 'unknown', etc. If you were to memorize all the outdated material in this book, it would make it very difficult to actually pass the CLEP NatSci exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Prep Book","review":"It is a very concise preparation book for the Natural Sciences CLEP exam which only hinges on a few topics for each subject area (physics, chemistry etc.) It is certain that the examinee will need other resources (college textbooks or study guides) for an optimum and effective preparation. That said, the review does not offer sample of tests akin to the difficulty of the actual one. The questions in the review are in majority conceptual, which is not the case for the real exam. Eventually, there is NO progression throughout the book; which makes it difficult for the examinee to evaluate whether s/he is ready to take the test. Overall because of the lack of concistency and reflection to the real exam, I will highly recomment not to buy this book on its own as a preparation guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"I tell you what . . .","review":"Worth every penny . . .

As another reviewer aptly put it - some 20 years too late? These songs requre a fresh, young Italianate voice. At this point in his life, the great Placido Domingo does not meet any of these requirements. I can only conclude that Domingo was persuaded to record this material only to \\"complete\\" a career repertoire that includes Handel and Wagner, and everything in between!

Solid build quality, it works fine. There were a few things i did not know about this before i bought it, maybe other people could use this info as well1)Gives you about arms reach distance between camera and flash, can probably be uncoiled with heat, but dont expect to put it more than 3 feet before it starts pulling on the stands. Perfect if you want to just hold it in your hand and get different light effects.2) Has a switch on the front that either allows the AF illuminator in the flash or the termial on the hot shoe of the camera. One or the other. Cant use both. I doubt anyone would need both though.3) No PC connection. I read that the SC-28 has one though4) it does have the shoe locks.5) Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent!!!","review":"this product helps a lot.

If you look above you, you can see the entire universe, but visibility in front of you is barely 1 meter. THAT is Delirium Cordia.And you know what's stranger than odd? I've heard other albums by these guys and can't stand them.

Musically, its almost operatic in nature. The vocals are wordless, more assisting in atmosphere than in attempting to communicate anything. But the thing to note about this-- in its over 74 minutes, this piece DOES evoke moods, haunting, anticipation, and does so quite well. This is, in many ways, a major success. Its definitely not easy to swallow, but it can be very rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mike Patton has LOST IT!","review":"Whatever was going through Patton's head when he worked on other Fantomas albums, as well as Bungle, Tomahawk, etc, is gone. This album is almost as bad as \\"Weird Little Boy.\\" I am a long time fan of Patton/Zorn styles of music, but this was just ridiculous (not unlike much of Zorn's work). If anyone besides Patton released this album, it would get ZERO stars. Mike Patton could fart on a snare drum for 80 minutes, and his fans would buy it, which is the ONLY reason this album is getting good ratings. It's a shame Patton can't deliver a CD worth $13.00 Hopefully the next work he's involved in will contain actual music, rather than 70 minutes of random noises with minutes of silence between each. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I WANT A REFUND!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This is the worst Fantomas album.

Unfortunately, it's just not that compelling to me.

It brings me back to the day i bought the solo Patton album 'Adult Themes for Voice'. I tried to take the cd back and Barnes and Noble wouldn't let me because i'd opened the cd. I love Mike Patton, but this album is the second he's made me feel like hi wonderful sense of goofiness and irony is focused soley on me, the listener. Granted, there are moments of creepiness i can appreciate as a work of art, but i really haven't bought an album by Patton yet as a work of abstract art. I love the brilliance polished with an almost pop sensibility. That characteristic that made Mr. Bungle's 'California' my favorite album of all time. To me, this album is just another time-killer until we get another 'Director's Cut' or 'Angel Dust' or the underappreciated 'MIT GAS'. Up the bar, Mike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU ARE GREAT MIKE!","review":"It's simply the best work since fantomas is on the road, because got everything, emotion, power, rarelees, it's a great album, and i love it.If the director's cut was a cool album this is two times better.you must got it men!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just wait till the chorus kicks in!","review":"delirium cordia is a pretty good song for being so long. It's got a lot of catchy hooks and the chorus is really great. Surgery is a pretty grim subject so i'm glad these guys approached it light heartedly.

The artwork is also a nice touch, adding to the album's overall atmosphere as all good album art should do (i.e. Iron Maiden, Janis Joplin). I won't give away the inside artwork but let's just say the front cover is only the beginning! I hope lots of people buy this record because I think it deserves a lot of attention. I mean, if you don't like this album, what in the world are you gonna like?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring album","review":"I change my mind and go back to my 2 star review. I am disappointed and think all the members of this band including Mike don't have enough faith in the power Fantomas can have. People are sick of new metal and I know lots of people, including myself, that are sick of Slayer and their worn out ideas. Directors Cut was totally fresh and original. Delerium Cordia is not acceptable to me as a huge fan of either Mike Patton or Dave Lombardo. I expect way better on the follow up guys. This release is just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third time's a charm!","review":"All respect to the previous greatness Mike has been involved with, but...If I wanted to listen to a soundtrack I'd watch a movie while doing such.If I wanted to listen to slow progressive metal I'd put in Opeth.I would not, however, continue listen to something, and furthermore rave about how great it is, just because I liked the previous work of that artist.There is NO WAY these people would be raving about this album if done anonymously. And you know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best.....","review":"The first Fantomas cd was 30 tracks of brilliant insanity. this is merely background noise with a few good parts but they come too little too late. On the self titled, or \\"book 1\\" to some, i can close my eyes and envision a storyline to the tracks, on this cd i really don't know whats going on and don't really care. i've heard these noises before. there's very little actual music being played on here, and don't get me wrong i love Mike's solo albums and his work with Merzbow, but i expect ALOT more from Fantomas. I don't think i'll listen to this very much, if i ever do again.I'll have to agree with another reviewer in saying the best part of this recording is around the half hour mark, but before and after that, its really not worth the money i paid. it belongs in your collection if youre a fan of mike's work, but not many other people will really get this or even care to. Myself? I'm patiently awaiting Suspended Animation."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the movie","review":"There is no music on this CD.

Their second was a collection of dark covers, and their third is one giant creepfest. Any fan of Melvins/Patton/Ipecac work knows that occasionally they release what I call \\"Duds\\". There has to be someone who likes this stuff (see other reviews)but I always feel BURNED when I pick up a CD like this. It is over an hour of creepy noise and... more noise.

Try fast forwarding to your favorite part; it's fun.For those of you new to the Fantomas, don't pick up this album.Go out and get the brilliant \\"Amenaza al Mundo \\" or the awesome \\"Director's Cut\\". Don't get me wrong, there are those that appreciate \\"atmospheric experimetal\\" stuff but I just get bored. Once you've heard John Zorn's work, you've heard it all.

I wanted to know about Poe, not about Arthur Hobson Quinn's grasp of psychoanalysis and postmodern politics, and that's what I got.Quinn bends over backwards to be sympathetic to Poe in all the controversies of his life, but Poe needed all the charity he could get, now as well as when he lived. Quinn writes from the perspective of a University of Pennsylvania professor, a historian of drama and literature, and Quinn's not afraid to wade into the texts of Poe's Tales and Poems to give us critical opinions, nearly always based in some facts, not high-flown speculation.Too bad we don't have more of these old school men who lived between 1875 and 1944!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh the memories!!","review":"I listened to this growing up and now it's my daughters turn.

Maybe one could argue that the opinions put forward were naive intentionally so as to give the impression that the characters were illinformed. I do not however feel that this is the case. I think that this is purely another blatant example of Mr. Elton standing upon his soapbox and smugly preaching his political beliefs to us. Save it for an editorial.

Obviously the story is just a flimsy excuse for Ben Elton to wax lyrical about all sorts of tired political themes. I read it primarily because I was aware that sometime in the (distant) past, Ben Elton was actually a funny man and I wanted a laugh. Unfortunately the story which he chooses to frame his views is just awful, why the pretence of a thriller? It's very inept, sub Sidney Sheldon stuff. None of the characters strike me as remotely believable, they are all just slaves to the plot and the (pointless) diatribes they utter. Absolutely pointless book, money for old rope."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun Ben book","review":"I have been a huge Ben Elton fan for years (unusual for a yank for sure, however lived in Australia for 8 years, so...), and have read all his books. I felt that this had it's truly enjoyable Elton comic moments, however the story was rather weak. Buy, hey, what the hell! Ben's books have never been literary masterpieces nor the top of the pops when it comes to 'the most clever plot line' either. Stark was better than this, however this was a far cry better than the pathetic 'Other Eden' thing he did a few years back. Overall, this book moves along pretty well, and sprinkles some of the ole Elton humour liberally amongst the situations. Can Ben really write the thriller of the year? NO - however this book is great bit of fun, and we all need that every so often, eh?Enjoy it for what it is - Ben is not out to be the next Hemingway or anything - I think he just likes to write, and he doesn't do a bad job of it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price of the paper it's printed on","review":"Throughout the whole book I was waiting for something to happen, and then nothing did.

There is a scene in which the priest locks a family in their house and lights it on fire, and another in which he sings about his lust for Esmeralda while watching her dance erotically in the fire. Other Disney cartoons have hinted at such things, of course, but usually off-screen or in a humorous way for the adults watching that the kids will miss. Fortunately my 4-year-old had wandered away bored before the very mature parts, but it left me wondering what Disney was thinking, especially in a G-rated film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The one i care less....","review":"I don't like to say bad things about DISNEY movies...most of their old animations are my ALL TIME favorites like THE LION KING and THE JUNGLE BOOK...but this one, THE HUNCHBACK of NOTRE DAME is BY FAR the one i care less....it's not so inspired, and the story is not so good..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Disney...","review":"The scene where Quasimoto rescues Esmerelda from the fire is rather stunning. That is the only reason I give this 2 stars. Other than that, it's typical Disney...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been PG 13","review":"I saw this movie and was shocked at the contents, considering that it was aimed at children. It starts out with the gypsy Esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance. While no stripping happened, there wasn't much other difference in the style of dance. Later in the movie, one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner I would never want my children to see. He sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he doesn't have her, and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire. Regardless of the rest of the movie, these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children. Not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel, which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Victor Hugo did about 78 RPM when this came out.","review":"If there had never been a classic book called \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" this would have stood well on its own. But if you're going to base a movie on a classic novel, it behooves you to pay attention to the story. It wasn't just the fact they changed the ending it was that they tore the heart and soul out of Hugo's work to make a musical caricature. It's not suitable for children and it's not mature enough for adults. This was made during Disney's \\"Oh Gawd, we're out of original ideas!\\" period. They started cribbing the classics in desperation and that's ALWAYS a bad idea. It suffers badly by comparison to the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not become a disney classic","review":"The ending is ok I even liked the little talking statues,but the rest of the movie was boring and it was a waste of my time watching it. \\"Do not buy this movie\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"this is by far the creepiest Disney movie of all time. It is far too sexual and just all around not fun. Esmerelda's dancing is basically a cartoon dancing like a stripper while keeping her clothes on. Frollo's fixation with her is way over the top (re: fireplace scene) and all around it gives me the willies. How do you explain to a child why Frollo wants to \\"have her\\" or have her \\"go to hell\\"? Seems difficult to me! Another part I found somewhat disturbing was the burning down of the peasant-looking folks' house. Seemed like something you would see in braveheart. If I was under the age of 10 or so, I would have a hard time sleeping after seeing that movie and.or understanding a bit of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids","review":"This movie made me angry when I saw it. This was given to my 3-year-old son for Christmas. It's definitely over his head, and ditto for any kid under 12, I would think. There is WAY too much adult material here. Disney needs to stick to films the whole family can enjoy. That's supposed to be what they're there for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to all the naysayers","review":"I don't think that movies necessarily have to follow the text and sometimes just using the text as the base starting point from which you can add/delete things can result in a product just as creative (take Disney's Jungle Book and Tarzan, for examples). The Hunchback of Notre Dame does this and makes the story touching and heart-felt in the traditional Disney fashion and I think it is appropriate for children (considering all the junk they usually watch on television). Having said all this, I think the movie would not be as rewarding to watch without the AMAZING soundtrack. Talk about creating atmosphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie EVER made by Disney","review":"Yes, it was darker than other Disney movie but I think without the darkness it would be horrible and make no sence.

Everything about this film is great from the animation to the music to the characters. The is truly Disneys best work. Although Mulan was good ,it doesn't touch this. This is Disney last truly great film. Hopefully there up coming movie Dinosaur will bring this kinda of style back.

The animation is flawless, the music is heart-pounding, and the actors are superior!Forget all those nasty comments about this movie; those people are probably just trying to give Disney a hard time. I own this movie, and I can honestly tell you that it's worth watching. It ranks among my all-time favorites! Clopin is my absolute favorite animated Disney character, and Frollo is my absolute favorite Disney villain.Aside from being a terrific movie, this film also teaches important life lessons, such as how you shouldn't judge people by their outward appearance, and how you should learn to rely on God in difficult times.People complain that this movie is too dark for little kids. My youngest sister is a little kid, and she loves this movie almost as much as I do.

Taking a compelling story from the classic Victor Hugo novel, this features some of the darkest moments ever in animation history, but the result is amazingly brilliant. The DVD was originally set for a December 2000 release -- why was it delayed? -- but fans will be rewarded for their paitence.

I watched this movie with the children I was babysitting. I loved it. It even made me want to read the book. The music is inspiring and this movie teaches children a good lesson: you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. The music for this movie is wonderful. So far, from what I've read of the book, there are some drastic changes to make the movie less dark and depressing. I understand these changes, for a childrens audience, but if it were a movie for adults, I think that its inacuracy takes some of the realism out of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a family or children's film","review":"I am usually a huge fan of Walt Disney animated movies, but this movie is not for children.The character of the hunchback's benefactor is very dark. During the song, Hellfire,\\" this character is clearly struggling with sexual and demonically depicted lust for Esmerelda. There is nothing G rated about that. Additionally, there is a scene where he tries to impose on Esmerelda and is clearly lusting after her and sniffing at her hair. He wants her to burn in hell if he cannot have her.Esmerelda is depicted as a pole dancing temptress. How could this pass as a family/children's filmBeing a Disney film, it does not fully follow the original story by Victor Hugo.

I think I saw this when I was little but I really didn't remember anything about it, so I wanted to see it again! I was actually excited to see it because Disney movies are usually always great. The script was mediocre and the music wasn't memorable. Disney movies can be enjoyed by adults and sometimes, there are things that you won't understand until you watch them as an adult, but this one seemed like there wasn't much thought put into the script. I know this is a recreation of a classic story, I don't have a problem with the plot, just the execution of it. I also found that this movie bore some similarities to Disney's Aladdin.

The animation is strangely lifeless, the songs are forgettable, and -- worst of all -- Quasimodo is zapped by Disney's pixies and changed from a terrifying, nearly speechless deaf bellringer into a lovesick teenager who won't shut up; it's enough to make a movie fan look for \\"Sanctuary!\\" I have a complete set of Disney DVDs to date, but I won't be buying this one.Stick with the Lon Chaney and Charles Laughton versions, which are better for adults AND kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacks charm of classic Disney movies","review":"Disney was not doing their best work when they produced this movie. It just didn't have the charm of Disney's other animated movies. The animation wasn't as rich and colorful as the older ones. It looked hastily done, as if the artists were painting by number---no fine detail, no artistic touches, nothing. That was a disappointment. The story itself is also a disappointment. It has little to do with the book (not that it always has to) and it just isn't a story that will entertain kids. What little kid wants to see a poor innocent man tortured and humiliated? It was so violent and had lots of religious themes that take away the viewer's attention. It isn't charming, it isn't fun to watch, and it isn't classic Disney. The movie was made in too much of a rush, and Disney should not have even attempted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good.","review":"I saw this movie when I was maybe seven I suppose. It was downright disturbing.

It's a big royal mess from beginning to end.

And, oh, lets give it a happy wappy, cutesy wutesy ending. Screw that; this is a dark, sad and disturbing tale AND THAT'S THE WAY THIS STORY SHOULD BE!

Last time I checked, the book ended very differently than the pleasant everyone is happy even if they didn't get what they thought they wanted ending in the movie.If you want entertainment for an adult, go read a book.

Quasimodo is a wonderfully heroic and kind character...but is the story a good one for kids? For a child to grasp a story, it has to be quickly paced and well drawn. This (I am sad to say) fufills one of its requirments...the drawings in this movie are extraordinary...sometimes looking like real camera shots. Though, at times the story is interesting, it leaves something to be desired. Perhaps this story just isn't a good one to translate from literature to childrens movie...but I enjoyed it to a certain extent...so it wasn't a total failure. After all, isn't enjoyment the most important thing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"best Disney ever","review":"My all time favorite Disney movie! The characters were great, and I think Frollo (the bad guy) was the most evil Disney has ever made anyone seem. Also the music is great. It's broadway style music, and that really helps the story. I also think this is the most intense Disney has ever gone. Even though the storyline is not completely true to the original book, I think I liked it better. I do not recommend this movie for little kids because it is really intense. The violence is more than usual for Disney, but it's not just that. There are a lot of emotional and dramatic issues involved. But anyone who can take this should definitely buy this movie.

It reminds me of the time I saw my brother smoking cigarettes behind the garage. He had stolen them from my mother and didn;t really seem to be enjoying himself. But he smoked the whole pack. As he finished, I thought to myself, \\"what a loser.\\" But the fact was I had sat there for 45 minutes watching him smoke all those cigarettes. So, I guess I was even a bigger loser. A moniker that stayed with me most of my teenage life. I didn't dislike school, I got to see a lot of pretty girls that would never have sat next to me anywhere else. I didn't get good grades, as I was addicted to after-school cartoons like Tom & Jerry. Even well into my teens. If I see them now, I watch them in totality looking for what appealed to me when I was younger.

The poetry taps into the mind of a person with bipolar disorder in all stages of the illness. The pain, the struggle, and the triumph is all exquistly expressed in Alicia Birmingham's words. Additionally, the haunting photography provides a stark, moving addition to the words. I feel that \\"The Crazy Inside\\" should be read by anyone who has experienced mental issues, their family and loved ones, and anyone else who wants to experience the beauty in Alicia's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't know....","review":"I didn't know that it could be like that.

The poetry is captivating and easliy, albiet sometimes heart breakingly, guides you through her life. I would recomend this book for anyone who is or knows someone with Bi-polar Disorder and for anyone just looking for a good book to read. It's short and leaves you wanting more. I hope to see more writing from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie should be included is our educational system.","review":"I was drawn into this movie while listening to it from the next room. Before long I was glued to the set and crying like a baby! This story should be shared with our school aged children as an example of human behavior at its finest. (Which is what I plan to do with my copy.) Also the word usage and customs of the time period were fascinating. One of my favorite conversations was at the end when Claude is placing his order for them \\"Sears & Robuckers\\" for his grandfather and having his first cup of coffee with the \\"men\\".

Shamanism, as still practiced by the Huichol Indians of Mexico, grows from a deeply rooted respect and reverence for the natural world. Tom Pinkson traces his own flowering into this ancient wisdom and offers the modern world some hope for an alternative future. Nature-based cultures hold \\"life in balance and harmony with all living things\\" as an essential spiritual practice. This \\"eco-centric\\" understanding offers the promise of a truly sustainable future for humans and the environment with which we remain intimately connected. Tom's journey into Huichol shamanism, provides a light for those who seek to become part of the solution to the ecological challenges which face our planet. Readers will find themselves empowered to choose their own path toward healing on each of the planes of our existence from the personal to the planetary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book about trusting one's intuition and inner guide","review":"In a world in which a logical positivist approach is overemphasized, it's encouraging to read about someone who listens to the wisdom of the shamans and indigenous peoples, despite having grown up in Brooklyn. It offers hope to the rest of us who have, essentially, been conditioned (programmed?) to view the world in a narrow and highly limiting way. Regardless of whether or not you believe everything in the book, it's likely to help expand the boundaries of the world that each of us uniquely occupies through our perceptions. It may be overstating it a bit, but I'd say this book has the potential to be a present-day \\"On the Road.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive crap","review":"This was a $350 rip off!

I, too, found difficulty with some of the poses that led me to face away from the television more often than with my other tapes.

The pace is nice and you do get a decent combination of relaxation and stretches. Some of the stretches may be a bit advanced for beginners, but, with time, you'll loosen up and they'll be easier.As with any video tape, I found that these tapes do get boring after a while unlike a live Yoga class which should be different from time to time. They are no substitute for a great instructor and a full Yoga session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for beginners, but good","review":"This is not for real beginners. I have been doing yoga for about five months now, and I was sore the next day. But I have a feeling it may become one of my favorites.

The 20 minute routine is perfect for a busy lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Beginners","review":"If you are looking for a beginner's yoga tape keep looking.

The book isn't really that. It has a literal translation in English which sometimes doesn't make any sense. The text is too much of a critical scholarly treatise. Too much is in Sanskrit, and since I don't understand Sanskrit, I don't get many things.Also, there is no Word for Word translation (which I've seen in many sanskrit commentaries).

It is about a girl named Anne, the middle, neglected child in her very dysfunctional family, who is persuaded by next door neighbor and close friend not to marry Captain Wentworth, the man of her dreams. About ten years later, Wentworth comes back from was and they reevaluate their relationship. This is a book about second chances, love, and finding one's true identity.

Mr. Santa Rosa's command of his voice and tempo just makes you appreciate Salsa music. The tracks \\"Me volvieron hablar de ella\\" and \\"Tiene un amigo\\" hit the sad and romantic sides all at once. The horns rising from far and carrying on just long enough just before his \\"voz de Caballero\\" kicks in is.....Priceless. Gilberto has been around for a while and has gained the respect of every latin (and non-latin that have ever heard him), musician in the business. This Puertorican's CD is the one you will play when you are by yourself (have a cocktail and feel the goosebumps) and will always be a coversational piece at every party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhytmic, beautifully arranged, melodious and inventive.","review":"As a newcomer to Latin American music, this one took me several listens to truly appreciate, but now it's one of my favorites. Gilberto Santa Rosa's voice is pleasantly raspy,and his phrasing is very deft. There are several different arrangers for the eleven tracks, and each succeed. My particular favorite is \\"Que Manera de Quererte\\" written by Emilio Rios and arranged by Pappo Lucca and Georgie Padilla. This is good music either for listening or dancing, as it is rhytmic without being repetitious. The percussion is especially effective on \\"Bendito Tiempo.\\" This is great music to listen to while cruising down the road towards vacation, and to remind you of it on the way home.

Cut to .5 second shot of crane camera swooping overhead. Cut to 1.0 second shot of Phil playing guitar. Cut to rapid-fire shots of good-looking female backing musicians. Quick cut back to Ferry. And on and on and on.Very MTV-looking and flashy, with a pacing that only ADD types will truly enjoy. Even most of the classic tunes are sped up to the point of sounding hyper. There is virtually no sense of the interplay between musicians here...no time to really feel the emotion of the performances. Just flash cut to flash cut to flash cut.The editor was obviously not a musician.I love Roxy Music and desperately wanted to love this DVD, but instead I pretty much hate it.

It sickens me to watch these two sorry individuals pretend they care about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot me!","review":"What's wrong with Danny Glover's mouth? I couldn't concentrate after hearing him speak in that lisp. This was Wahlberg's follow up to the academy award winning performance in The Departed??? WTF?!

Please Shooter, end my pain and shoot me comatose from Whippets if I ever have to see this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody, BLOODY Awful","review":"This movie is terrible. Where do I begin? Is it the lack of action? Is it the plot (or lack thereof) or is it the fact that the best shot of the movie was Wahlberg when he shot the beef stew? I was told this movie was \\"A smart, sharp action thriller in the tradition of Bourne Identity\\". There was way too much talking and not enough 'action' as the back of the DVD promised to give. It's a damn good thing that Hollywood Video didn't have this movie to purchase - so I only rented it. I only wasted $4.80 and after watching it, as sad as it may seem, I really would do anything to get that $4.80 back and buy something worthwhile. Those are my thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shooter","review":"A hundred percent Hollywood crap, unless one enjoys completely unrealistic, shoot-em-up, never in a million years could happen, kind of flick. I decided to watchit after seeing it had a four stars rating on this web site. So it makes me wonder, are these reviews written by fifteen year old boys, taking a break from playing their favorite war video game, or what?As far as I'm concerned, the acting is atrocious, ( when it breaks out at all.), the plot is ridiculous, the special effects commonplace, and I don't recall any musical score, ( I'm laughing to myself.).It deserves less than a star due to the fact there wasn't even any redeeming nudity or passionate sex to save it, or at least give it a star.. To sum it up, if you can't tell by now, a waste of time! Watch Rambo again,or maybe Rocky again instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great except for the Che Guevara propaganda","review":"I agree with what all the other good reviews this movie has gotten. I saw it a couple of years back and wanted to watch it again. I totally forgot the Che Guevara shirt on the middle. If you were ever a victim of the guy directly or indirectly, you'll know he wasn't any better than the bad guys that this movie depicts. In fact, he was worse. If just only because he actually existed.Again, someone in Hollywood trying to push their propaganda. Because it HAS to be black or white. Otherwise it won't sell. A well made movie is never enough. There has to be propaganda and boot kissing to somebody's agenda behind cameras.Of course, nobody cares until someone like that steps on their own foot. And then it's too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shooter","review":"Great story, entertaining, action packed and a very believable conspiracy theory plot.

This one takes the cake though!!!","review":"The plot was boring, the characters were stale and the dialogue was nothing spectacular. It even had me snoring before the end. I had to pop it back in to watch this disaster piece from the beginning.Mark Wahlberg was hot as usual, but next time he should read the script before jumping into a movie such as this one!Not recommended and should be avoided!Rent something more exciting and relate-able, Perfect Stranger for the former and American Beauty for the latter.2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!! A keeper!!!","review":"We've rented this film twice. It is has a compelling story line, with very good characters. I rented it first while the girls were shopping. When they came home they saw the tail end, got interested and wanted to see the whole thing. We watched it as a family and the girls really liked it too... It is not a far fetched plot, easy to see it get played out in the real world. We'll probably buy the Blue Ray, so we can take full advantage of the action and scenery... Sound is pretty awesome too. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good action movie.","review":"As I have indicated before I am a Mark Wahlberg fan. While the movie is somewhat different than the book it is a great action film. I also like the shooting side of it also now that there is more coverage about military snipers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I only wish I had known of this movie while it was in theaters! What a great action movie and a plot line that is not only plausible, but sadly, conceivable in real life.

The story line for The Shooter was just way too implausible to even buy into just a little bit. So it got shut off after 16 minutes. I so disagree that Wahlberg can act - his main acting face seems to be a frowning serious far away look. When it comes to a choice of continuing to watch the movie or finding something better to do, this movie loses."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I don't think you understand. These boys killed my dog.\\"","review":"I understand. Because I love dogs too.Shooter was exactly what I expected, an exciting, action packed story about an expert marksman who is framed for a political assassination. Along the way to proving his innocence, Gunnery Sergeant Bob Lee Swaggert has to enlist the help of an FBI agent, the ex-wife of his former spotter, and a crooked US Senator.I didn't expect much from this film, and I wasn't disappointed.

Nuff said since I already wasted my time watching it so may as well not waste time writing about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Book! Skip Movie","review":"Unfortunately, for fans of the novel by Stephen Hunter, POINT OF IMPACT, the film casts Marky Mark in the anti-hero leading role. Fortunately, it has a grade A director, Antoine Fuqua, director of Denzel Washington's Oscar winning turn in Training Day, and the increasingly impressive character actor Michael Peña [Battle Los Angeles, Crash, & Oliver Stone's World Trade Center].Still, the viewer who cares about good acting has to endure Mark Wahlberg trying to act in every scene, and that's just not worth the torture. Read the novel instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent AND True-to-life!!!","review":"This is an EXCELLENT action movie, and contrary to the \\"editorial review\\" written by the Amazon-folk, it DOES take a VERY realistic look at our modern day government and the filthy politics that go on behind the scenes.

Packed with action and has decent replay value..Gotta love Hi Def"},{"rating":"1","title":"I saw this one in the theatre","review":"I am amazed this film is getting that positive of a review. When I saw this turkey in the first week of release I was psyched to see another sniper story/thriller which the reviews made look like a good action packed movie. There are some half-descent action sequences but that was not the focus of the film. Mostly they were making a big political film and it spoiled most of the entertainment value for me. They took what was otherwise a lackluster though passably entertaining film and flushed it down the toilet. I am assured by a friend that if I had read the book I would be even more outraged at how stinky this film is. I'll take his word for it. I would suggest giving this thing a miss even if you are a Wahlberg fan. I enjoyed 'Sniper' with Tom Berenger much more and that wasn't really a super movie either. I'd give this movie a wide berth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-American Propaganda From Start to Finish","review":"Anti-American propaganda so blatant it would make Michael Moore blush with shame, disguised as an action flick.

One of my 3 favorite books of all time, (Lonesome Dove & Silence of the Lambs). First mistake? casting: Mark Wahlberg is a 2nd rate \\"B\\" list actor at best. The ideal for this guy is someone like a little bit younger Clint Eastwood. Make this great story a \\"MAJOR' motion picture, not some watered down version. Could NOT be more disapointed. Bob \\"The Nailer\\" is one of my favorite action characters, and they give me Mark Friggen Wahlberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minimum Stars - No Stars More Accurate","review":"No offense intended to prior reviews - this is my 2 cents.Forget the poor adaptation of the book \\"Point of Impact\\", which was expected, given the technical details of a sniper's craft and the intricate plot line. This movie is a muddled mess, complete with mumbled dialog and cartoonish characters, from the mis-cast Mark Wahlberg as Bob Lee Swagger, to the buffoonish senator \\"played\\" by Ned Beatty. And don't get me started on the Danny Glover character. What a waste of talent.On the other hand, the action sequences were visually appealing . . .Completely, utterly, mindlessly action-oriented movie for the hard-core explosion, gun fight, blood-splattering violence fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated, underpublicized winner","review":"This film was a very nice surprise. I expected action and suspense. I got that. I just wasn't expecting the quality of writing and acting. The plot worked for me and while the movie isn't perfect, it was a darn fun ride, complete with political philosophy, pathos, and some realism.Dare I say that Marky-Mark is turning into a fine actor after watching this and the Departed?

I saw this when it came out in the theater and enjoyed it. I especially loved the action scenes in this movie. This movie in my opinion is probably Fuqua's best film since Training Day. This movie was way better than King Arthur and way more exciting than Tears of the Sun. All the actors were very convincing. This is definately worth buying on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awww..... maaaannnnn","review":"Honestly, my son and I really enjoyed this flick.However, the movie foreshadowed itself from the beginning (for me) but left my teen aged son wondering if I was clairvoyant. Too many times I voiced the next line in the movie to the point my boy asked me \\"are you sure you haven't seen this before?!?\\"No, just that \\"been there, seen that\\" atmosphere that pervades this film, even if it's told from a different point of view. It did have some different elements missing from stories of this type, just enough to make it enjoyable for both of us.Good, silly fun. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasn't a bad movie- great HDDVD...","review":"The movie is pretty much what you would expect. It was pretty good. The HD-DVD picture is in fact- very good.

Great picture quality and the DD+ track is good. No DDTrue that I remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive review","review":"I need to add a positive review for this movie. It was definitely my second favorite movie of 2008 (I liked Saw V better). This movie has a lot of action and explosions in it and kept me wondering until the end. I really like Walberg and he does not disappoint in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Bourne","review":"This was a decent shoot em up flick. I gave it 4 stars because I can still recall the plot-so many are forgetable. Its a bad attitude Bourne type movie and I liked Walberg as lead.

Not warm-Not fuzzy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, lousy movie","review":"Hunter wrote a great book; you can read all of it and go back into the middle and read again to the end, and not sleep, it's that good.This movie is so bad. The first twenty minutes are mostly Mark Wahlberg breathing heavily.Some books should make great movies. This isn't it. This one reminds me of \\"The Firm\\", which is a great book, but the !@#$% Direector couldn't take his camera off Cruise's beautiful face. I think this time the Director, Fuqua, couldn't shake off Wahlberg's lungs...whatever. Lots of noise, not much else.Don't waste your time and your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vengeance is mine","review":"If you care for an action-packed film with evil government figures seeking political assassination as a means to an end, add a couple of appealing heroes with an attractive gal thrown in, and over the top heroics, this is your film.

She loves this movie. It arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner. She was delighted to receive this video as a gift for Christmas. I highly recommend this movie.

Having it on blu-ray is very nice as there is some incredible scenery in the film. Due to my setup, I actually like the fact that it has dolby 5.1 and not HD dolby... This allows me to get surround sound via a digital optical cable. I have my picture going through an hdmi cable but audio through the optical cable, because of this, a few of my blu-rays have to be played with linear audio and I can't use bitstream (taking away my surround sound). I think it would be great if all blu-rays offered both sound options."},{"rating":"2","title":"This deserves at least 4 stars!","review":"I was very pleased with this one. I love action movies that grab you quickly at the beginning and don't let go. This is one of those movies. OK, these movies don't win 'movie of the year', but neither do comedies (my other fav genre). This is recommended for those who like these action movies as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can watch this a hundred times","review":"I generally rate movies on, \\"Will I Buy This Movie?\\"If I can buy the movie, it's a movie I'm willing to watch again, and exceptional. This is one such movie.It's great action. While knowing what'll happen does detract slightly, don't think about movies such as The Prestige when you think about this.

However, well done as it was, I would've really loved to see this movie made, totally following Stephen Hunter's book, \\"Point of Impact\\" on which it was VERY loosely based on! Now THAT would've been a superior movie, that could've won an Oscar or other award. As it is, if you enjoy this movie, do yourself a favor and READ Hunter's book!!

Maybe too much violence for younger viewers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unrealistic, Shootem-up","review":"This movie has a solid concept, and a lot of factoids about long range shooting. However, there is so much political spin and bias that it ruined the movie for this conservative. Starring ultra-liberal friend of dictator Hugo Chavez, Danny Glubber, the movie is like one big propaganda commercial. It portrays a Dick Cheney look-alike as the leader of the bad guys (who are evil government contractors who sound a whole heck of a lot like Halliburton), which seems to be typical out of Hollywood now.

The plot was far-fetched. Danny Glover is absolutely obnoxious with those braces on, and mis-cast as the bad-guy heavy (unbeknownst to Wahlberg).

There are a few good action scenes but nothing you haven't seen before. Mark Wahlberg plays a sniper who shoots and kills people. Not exactly what you would call a sympathetic character. Wahlberg is set up by the Government to take the fall in an assassination. The problem is there is no character development and you simply don't care if Wahlberg's character lives or dies. The movie is devoid of drama and simply relies on the power of the action scenes to keep your attention; unfortunately, my attention was lost about a half hour into the movie. I give it another half hour then I gave it the gong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of bang Little for your buck","review":"Great for a 14 year old boy...... Anyone else it is nerve riding...

This is only one of many, many small problems with the book.I do however give it two stars because the website accompanying the book gives a lot of explanations for each chapter with videos to better see what the chapter talks about.If you're getting this book for independent study I recommend something else because this book has a lot of information that is wrong and you won't know to correct it. If you have a teacher who can point out the little qualms with this book, go for it but buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used txt book","review":"I bought this older version of the A&P book and it has the same infromation as the latest edition.

I haven't bothered to begin reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvel video games","review":"Most people have seen all of the marvel cartoon television shows. X-Men, Spider-man, Batman, and of course, The Incredible Hulk. Now that we have computer technology, game manufacturers can make any character come to life. Children enjoy playing the role of a superhero in a modern video game. When a kid sees the latest video game in a store, they immediately want it. The qualities in a video game include graphics, cheat codes, and....... well just those two factors. Every popular movie comes out with a boss video game!!! The Hulk is an incredible character. Like most common characters, he has to deal with a problem. A huge, bulky, green problem. Let the kids let their imagination run wild. The Hulk is a great game to let kids express themselves.... in a violent, fun way. I encourage kids to have fun with the new Hulk video game. Now, if you will excuse me, I have to play the Hulk game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera angles by Escher","review":"My enthusiasm for the film and even the demo version notwithstanding, this PC game is a dog, no, it's a Gamma Green Hulk-Dog.Imagine the worst, most annoying camera angles imaginable,impossible \\"puzzles\\" that would've made Banner Hulk-out given the frustration level (and I'm good with puzzles, if my experience with JKII: Outcast is a gauge),and repetitive, deployment of the game's cannon fodder of Special Ops soldiers.There are well-designed villains in this game, but even in the unlocked modes, you can't play them. The first-person view option is poorly executed, since you can't do much in first-person except look around. The vaunted destructability of the environment is very limited. Finally the game is about linear as anything out of 1995. Why you need 3 CDs to play this game escapes me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhh, I Bet It Would Be A Great Game If It Actually Worked","review":"I recieved The Hulk comp game as a gift for straight A's in school and I am very upset it didn't work on my comp. It says right on the bottom of the box it can work on my comp but NOO, it doesn't. I bring it back to Target the next day and got another one. Doesn't work either. Now I'm stuck with a software game that looks extremely promising and fun but won't work. And I can't do anything about it. So remember my story when you think u wanna buy this game. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD!!!","review":"This is an extremely bad computer game. The first time you play it is okay, but the second time you realize how boring it is. There is no challenge in the game at all. The only reason I gave it one star was because it had one okay level, and it has somewhat good graphics. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GODDDDDDD!","review":"For God's sake did anyone else realize how incredibly stupid this game was?! The first time its okay because lets face it, it was a new game so you were dying to play. After awile you actualy start to realize how boring this game really is. Ex.

While still going to school."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful faith","review":"Lauren Winner, a frequent writer for Christianity Today and professor at Duke Divinity School, opens her story to us so that we might have a glimpse of what it means to wrestle honestly with both the Jewish and Christian faith traditions in the postmodern world. I'm deeply impressed with her honesty and tenacity in holding these elements of her life in creative tension: she loves the way Judaism shaped her love for text and ritual and singlemindedness toward God, but she is unafraid to explore why she became drawn to Jesus and Christian theology. I recommend this memoir for those who are interested in understanding a personal account of what draws a person to an intellectually rigorous faith amidst a culture of skepticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Stars","review":"\\"Wow, what a book!\\" Those were my exact words when I first finished Girl Meets God. It is a funny, always interesting, sometimes sad memoir of a young woman in her early twenties working on a Ph.D in American History at Columbia University. It is also a story of conversion-in her case from Reform Judaism to Orthodox Judaism to Christianity, having come to believe that Jesus is God. She writes that people wonder when she will convert to another religion, which she doesn't think will happen, among other things, because \\"I am not sure that I have the passion to fall in love with a religion again.\\" The amazing thing is that you see that love, for Christianity and for Judaism, all through this book. Finally, it is also literature. It is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. I would give it ten stars if I could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most beautiful writing - a feast for the mind","review":"Someday when I am a big girl, I want to write like Lauren F. Winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crass Self-Promotion","review":"While Winner is clearly a gifted writer who discusses her various spiritual conversions in vivid prose, one gets the uncomfortable feeling that she would become a Buddhist, a Zorastrian or anything else if it would make her more marketable as a young hip religious writer. While others have certainly written of (and, yes, profited from) their spiritual journeys, Winner has an aggressively off-putting \\"hey, look at me -- I'm the next great quirky religious chick\\" style. One hopes she has finally found her spiritual home. Her relentless search for acceptance with a religious community, with men, with anyone is sad and depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Spiritual Reading, Good Story","review":"The basic plot: young woman, commited Jew, is gradually drawn to Christianity, evnetually converts, and then (as she put it) has to put her life back together again. This memoir, though, is not just for those with a peculiar interest in Christian covnersion or Jewish-Christian relations. This memoir is for those who are interested in the ups and downs of leading a spiritual life. Lauren Winner doesn't claim to have all the answers, she doesn't claim to be perfect or righteous (She has trouble makign herself pray regularlly, for example), she just claims to be on the path. Anyone else who is on the path to a spiritual life will find her an affable and consoling companion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, looking forward to more by Lauren Winner","review":"I picked this book up by chance at my local library. Having lived through my husband's conversion to Christianity (and then his seminary education), I found this to be an honest and very real account of what it is like to go through this kind of spiritual rebirth. I found myself nodding and grinning throughout the book, and read most of it out loud to whomever would listen because it touched me so deeply.Aside from some disagreements I have with Lauren's assessment of Luther and Lutherans (a-hem), I will be recommending this especially to some college-age young women I know. Can't wait to see what Lauren Winner writes next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fresh- stale","review":"I have eaten this before and am usually satisfied with the product when purchased in a store like Whole Foods. However, I thought I would try an online purchase because I can no longer get the cereal where I currently reside. Bad mistake. This cereal was stale upon receipt, not so much in taste (although it was oddly bland), but more in texture. I'm not sure whether this is because of how it was packaged but I noticed that the bags were strangely thin in places. I cannot recommend this unless you like old tasting puffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilt-free treat!","review":"Organic Corn Puffs cereal is great as a treat and even better in salads. I know it sounds silly - but I use them in place of croutons in a salad to give it an extra texture. They are light and airy and don't make you feel bad eating them. They also are good when you mix them with protein powder or even eating them plain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"These corn puffs were pretty bland. I could only get my kids to eat it by adding alot of sweetener (I use organic evaporated cane juice, or unrefined sugar as I call it) and a little sprinkle of cinnamon. I probably will not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad Book, Not Good Either","review":"This book is ok, but I would not recommend it! The games and ideas seem to be similar to other manuals of teaching tennis to kids. I would recommend looking for coaches who have specialized in this field rather than those who like to jump on the proverbial bandwagon. Nice try Mr. Dinoffer, but a no go in my books...Dr. Robertson"},{"rating":"1","title":"IDEAS ORDINARY","review":"I will give this book a very low recommendation the concepts and ideas are not original and actually taken from other books offered by tennis federations such as the German Tennis Federation. Joe Dinoffer needs to start writing material that he himself thinks of... I will not support this book. I am sure that the supporters of this book have absolutely no knowledge that his material has been \\"borrowed\\" from other sources. This book cannot be supported by any law abiding coach. Any reviews sent in after this one ... need to be ignored!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"As a certifed professional in Europe and the USA I cannot give my support to this book. The drills are outdated and unoriginal! Mr. Dinoffer tries to promote tennis in ways but seems to go overboard in the promotion of his company and products which misses the point of \\"coaching kids tennis.\\" Tennis books which focus on children must place coaching as a priority rather than selling his products. I am appalled that he is doing what he is doing and recommend that Joe start coaching with ethics. I must say that if a review is sent in after this one that really gives lots of support to Mr. Dinoffer, I will bet you that it is from him or his staff and should be ignored. I have an inside source that he promotes his stuff both out in the open and in disguise... Ignore this book it does not deserve support!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This DVD!","review":"The promo's for this DVD are very deceiving! It makes it seem like this movie is so romantic and intriging! It is not!! It was a real frustrating movie to watch. If you know any thing about Anthony Trollope you will stay far away from anything that has been adapted from his novels. They are all downers. The man only writes about disappointments and depressing subject matter. His stuff is not uplifting at all. If that is what you are into than by all means buy, but if you are looking for romance and happy endings don't go in for his stuff.Unfortunatly the way they advertise his adaptations are really deceiving. This movie was not anything at all what I expected and it was VERY EXPENSIVE! I don't reccomend buying it because you won't watch it a second time because it is not enjoyable to watch period!Sorry to be such a downer but that's the truth!Read Anthony Trollope, don't watch it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Differant Suchet","review":"David Suchet is a fine actor.

Here are several love triangles that intersect and overlap.The plot lines took twists and turns like many great novels.From these hours a fascinating drama the various facets of human love were explored and exposed. Is it any wonder that romance can never fit nicely in any box?Power, sex and romance are as powerful today as they have been anytime in history. And that makes the title of this movie all the more important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing little soap opera","review":"This was a very entertaining little soap opera. Costumes and sets were fantastic. Plot was breezily complicated. Entire cast is great, especially Matthew MacFadyen, who is deliciously sleazy--but Miranda Otto? WORST SOUTHERN ACCENT EVER. I laughed out loud (and not in a good way) every time she opened her mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant","review":"Not that being pleasant is all there is - but in all honesty I really didn't like this story. I know Anthony Trollope is a writer to be reckoned with, but the film was slow and unredeeming. Good performances of nasty people, and I guess that says something.You're going to see some nasty people in charge of things. Not unlike the people we see now; I guess the story is timely in that sense.But still.I can't recommend it. If you are like me, you will never watch it more than one time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Drama!","review":"Suchet gives a great performance as the cunning, Melmotte who's out to swindle an unsuspecting town into doing his bidding while chasing his daughter for his supposed fortune. The Way We Live Now is full of drama, scandal and intrigue that kept me glued to my seat to see the conclusion of the whole matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Movie!","review":"My wife wanted this movie for a while so I ordered it for her not expecting much. Well, it kept me captivated throughout the movie, the acting is excellent, and so is the plot. If you enjoy period movies, you cannot go wrong with this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Posh Society...or is it?","review":"This DVD produced by non other than the BBC sticks fairly close to the book it was adapted from by Anthony Trollope. The cast was remarkable and the sets and costumes were all lavish indeed.Short version of plot: Lady Carbury wants nothing more than to sustain her good name and in doing so, tries in vain to get her wayward son Felix , who is a cad if ever there was, to find a decent and, more importantly wealthy girl to marry. Should that plot fail, her daughter is available for the right price so to speak. There are too many sub-plots to this that are intriguing and although seemingly complicated, not hard to follow.Overall, it was a fine adaptation although, not as finely detailed as the book . If you read the book you may find some of the casting decisions to be a bit quizzical.It is a bit on the pricey side, so unless you are an Anthony Trollope fan, just rent it. I am not so sure that I will watch this again, although I have read the book twice.Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply splendid.","review":"You can't go wrong with this magnificent period piece set in 1870s England. I was led into Trollope's comic masterpiece by the actor David Suchet (who plays Poirot in the excellent series of the same name) who I am following. He seems to find his way into the very best movies. In this one, he plays the rich old swindler.Smart, passionate in turns, humorous, and thoughtful. Superb acting, and the writing is without compare--far, far better than most scripts we see today! I would even recommend this for people who don't normally like period pieces, or are not interested in history. There are such people about, aren't there?Dig the opulent sets, the lifestyles of the rich and infamous, and the psychology of these idle, bored, lazy fools who we watch for amusement and instruction. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent adaptation, excellent acting.","review":"I have now viewed this film about 5 times. Everytime I view it I am more and more breathless at the wonderful camera work, acting, and general story. \\"Hercule Poirot\\" David Suchet is just wonderful, I think he is one of the great actors of our time. The way the story ends makes you feel good, yet also makes you THINK.

Ruark's tales harken to a halcyon age when hunters were still expected to follow up their own game, cut their own roads through the bush and build their own bridges. Anyone who has ever been bitten by the Africa bug, who has ever longed to seek out and kill something that could kill him in return and who has ached to feel his soul sweat in the glorious exertion of the hunt will appreciate Ruark's tales.

Not a bad book when compared with other writers, it's definitely below par for Ellroy. As a former caddie we can presume that Ellroy handles the sections of the book dealing with \\"loopers\\" and their lives accurately but other than this the plot of the book falls into place ridiculously easily. Is it really so simple to impersonate a police officer on the telephone every time you need some information? The book is also careless. A character is described is \\"slim and athletic\\" and then twenty pages later as \\"fat and strong\\". If you read this one, read it before you read any other Ellroy then maybe you won't be so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhh, the old days...","review":"This is pre-LA Quartet for Ellroy. Back before he found his beat-poet 'style'. Brown's Requiem, Clandestine, and Killer on the Road are just great books by a fledgling author.

I really didn't know what to expect. This book was just really out there. I felt lost with some of the dialogue - loopers, etc. The writing style reminded me of Catcher in the Rye. I think if you like Catcher in the Rye you will enjoy this book. There are an awful lot of plot lines going and sometimes it gets confusing because there are so many characters. The book was interesting and different and definitely kept my attention. I just can't say it was a favorite or something that I would wholeheartedly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still like more the LA Quartet","review":"Well, I must say that though I adore Ellroy's books, specially the called LA Quartet,but this book has dissapointed me.

So far the author has insulted every major ethnic group and religion save the one most currently politically correct. There isn't one redeeming, likeable quality about the lead character and the use of expletives is sophomoric. Normally, I persevere through subsequent chapters but can't think of one reason why I should. Even at $2.99 I feel ripped off. Really Amazon what were you thinking making this the daily deal? Sorry folks, I love a good mystery but thumbs down on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start to a brilliant career.","review":"Only Ellroy could seamlessly weave the mystique of the golf course with a bizarre murder mystery. This first book is heavily autobiographical, using Ellroy's previous work experience as a former caddie, his love for classical music, and so forth. I thought this book was better than the two novels that followed it. And, no, you do not have to be a golfer to enjoy the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gooid Book But Edition Needs Editing!!!!","review":"I was captivated by Ellroy's \\"noir\\" tone, and I liked \\"Brown's Requiem.\\" My only complaint about the book involves the publisher's carelessness in editing. I was frequently distracted by typographical and grammatical errors that should have been fixed before the book went to press. Good fiction enables a reader to forget that he is reading and the mistakes in text were a frequent reminder of what went into making the book. The high price tags on even the most humble of paperbacks should more than pay for greater editorial attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mystery in Retro","review":"This is a good mystery.

He's an electric engineer but also the type of guy that REALLY takes his time. He programmed our DVD player, computer, cable box, and TV in under 45 minutes with ease. But that's also including the time it took to get the items out of the packaging which also used a significant amount of time.Never had to reprogram anything. The range is GREAT. You don't have to press very hard on the keys either. Actually, sometimes when you actually bump into the remote, the button gets pushed, so I don't suggest if you are one of those people like me, sitting on it by accident or letting it get a little lost on the couch.It also comes with backlighting that you have the option of turning off which is always nice. Other reviewers are right, you could even point the remote away and the buttons still work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great replacement for Logitech Harmony","review":"If you don't want to spend the $'s for a Logitech 1000 remote or just need another for a additional system, this is a very close 2nd for the price.

I had recently replaced my old television with a flat panel tv, and I had built the new closet in the nearby hallway to house all of the components. I had looked at several hardwired repeater products out there. All of them seemed complicated and required running wiring from the television to the av closet. The URC RFS200 PowerPak Bundle and PowerBlaster was easy to hook up, took no hard wiring whatsoever, and worked the way it's supposed to work immediately. I can now control all of the components down the hallway in the closet without pointing a remote at them (or at the tv for that matter). Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well with a variety of sources","review":"I have had this product for over a month now and am very pleased with the purchase.Pros:1.

There is one radio frequency and if it picks up a frequency from some where else or it is too close to your equipment, it will change automatically - changing channels, deleting programs, deleting programs being recorded. If you really want a rf remote get a harmony and invest the extra money. Returning the product was that easy. They wanted to charge me a restocking fee for a defective item. This may change but it has been a hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb control","review":"Very well-designed control. Both IR and RF functions are flawless. Easy to set up, easy to \\"learn\\" any command from any other remote (for example, it didn't come with a code for my Sanyo PLV-80 projector, but I was able to get it to learn ALL the Sanyo remote's commands -- like lens shift, input, focus, etc.-- in less than 3 minutes!) The optional base station works very well, but its antenna should not be too close (1 foot) to any component or DVI cables (otherwise it picks up spurious signals and blocks out the remote's RF transmissions). I use mine from 50 feet, through walls. What a refreshing change after my Logitech Harmony--which is a royal pain to program, by webpage wizards!!!

I am not sure if the thickness of the door had anything to do with my problems, but the remote would not work with the doors closed. Also, I found it very difficult to place the IR blasters (eyes). They seemed to need to be very precicely placed, or they would not work at all. I much prefer theLogitech Harmony 900 Rechargeable Remote with Color Touch Screenwhich uses a few large IR blasters that can be positioned almost where ever near your A/V components.

Worth the buy though.","review":"I would have to say that it is great for the $. It is very responsive and does what I need it to do. My only flaw is some of the buttons and how you have to page through and select the item that you want to use. Additionally (it might) I haven't been able to figure a way for it to just utilize the volume button for the TV or amplifier on its own. Therefore, when I use the satellite function I have to go and select (page through) the tv button select it and use it. I have know less \\"smart\\" remotes to be able to function a volume always. Also there is a way to \\"smart\\" program the remote by shooting the other remote at it; it just doesn't work or I am doing something wrong. Therefore I had to program it manually, which wasn't a big deal. Overall a good buy for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for!","review":"We have a projector and have all of our components in a closet -- out of the line-of-sight of remotes. We've been using a different RF component, but sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't, plus we still had to use all of our remotes. This combination works FANTASTIC! It was quite easy to set up and I was very impressed with the codes available -- they even had a code for my projector, which is great!

I'm so glad I expanded my search to enclude Universal. This remote has saved me hundreds from the cost that the Harmony would've cost. The remote programing was very easy, even the macros. The RF feature was a very important feature for me and this thing has worked flawlessly with my setup. All my HT equipment is now in my closet, out of view and I haven't had any reception problems at all with the PowerPak.

After programming, I was able to stow four separate remotes, out of sight and mind.The unit works perfectly. The most used control is for the STB (set top box, in my case, Direct TV), somewhat strangely named \\"SAT\\" (for satellite). The RF20 allows control over all the STB functions, including the DVR (via one of the submenus) after plugging in the appropriate pre-programmed code.The macros for all components \\"on\\" and \\"off\\" are also useful.My primary complaint is that the manual, as others have observed, is weak, weak, weak. What would be useful is a pull out card that lists the programming steps in one column that can be read (or followed) at a glance, rather than paging through the manual or making your own list of steps (as I did). A list that fully names the abbreviations used on the sub-menus would also be useful.For my purposes, the PowerBlaster is not required. The RF20 alone should suit most users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing for the price","review":"The remote works great. I was a little skeptic at first.

When he put me on hold before taking my information, I was disconnnected. I called back, waited, and told the next technician about the previous call. After a brief rundown on what the previous technician and I tried, he agreed I had to send the device in. When he asked for the serial number, I discovered there was no serial number where it was supposed to be on the remote.

I got in the habit of taking multiple photos of a subject using various settings because I never quite knew how they would turn out. Then I would sift through them on my computer looking for decent ones.The camera is also fairly slow, due to the use of xD memory cards, I suspect. I had a 2GB card, which was plenty of storage space, but unfortunately caused the camera processor to struggle.Recently, the auto-focus stopped working, rendering the camera useless.

The zoom is great and there is even a super macro mode for shooting small objects. But the pictures, regardless of setting, were really awful in my opinion. They are blurry and washed out. Other sites' reviews indicated similar issues. After about an hour of toying with it I decided to return it ASAP. I'd even eat a re-stocking fee I am so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple user interface and large LCD, but poor picture quality","review":"Missing manual mode really hurts, the other automatic scene functions are no comparision to manually adjusting aperture and shutter speed. The worst is the picture quality, grainy, poor exposure..., it is worse than my other 5MP Olympus at HQ mode and definitely uses more memory. Well, its only usage is as a quick point & shoot and easy to carry camera which my wife can fit it in a purse.

But unless being seen with a small camera is all you want to do (not, for example, take picture that are worth looking at) you should look elsewhere.My only regret is not buying it from a merchant where I could return it.If you want one cheap, mine will be on eBay as soon as I can find another camera to take a non-fuzzy picture of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small but not worth the shots","review":"I purchased this camera for around $300 at Best Buy after all was said and done. I wanted it for landscape shots while hiking. I found that the images remained grainy or blurry no matter what I did. The size of the battery had me out of juice halfway into the Grand Canyon in a helicopter. What a disappointment. Regardless of whether you are in SHQ (super?) or HQ mode, the images were never clean or natural. The video capabilities on it work great! Unfortunately I purchased this camera for the photo quality, and now I am stuck with it. I will do more research next camera I buy, and purchase something a bit more hefty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six month Life","review":"I purchased this camera in October and by May it no longer takes colored pictures.

Do not read this work if you are looking for a well argued thesis. He lets points stand on sweeping generalizations that will only be accepted by those already in agreement. Santayana's critiques of religion rest upon sociology rather than philosophy, and his appreciation of religion is limited and patronizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty rhetoric from a jockstrap pragmatist","review":"Santayana is known broadly as the guy who said that those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it -- whatever that means. And therein lies, in miniature, the charm of this tireless windbag, most of whose vast output is thankfully out of print. The statement in itself means precisely nothing, and its perfect emptiness is what renders it most useful. It requires a trememdous volume of ignorance to make Santayana profound, which is, I suppose, why he was for so long America's national philosopher. If you expect philosophers to be blowhards, then Santayana will never disappoint you. For the rest of us, instead of this volume and the five-volume bolus of which it is the condensate, one can read William James' essay \\"The Sentiment of Rationality,\\" the wisdom of which it, as it were, repeats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dad loved it.","review":"This was Christmas gift for my Dad.

After the first week of using the product I began to notice a fine black dust around the rooms I was using it in. The BLACK DUST problem became worse and as it turns out it was from the carbon(charcoal) filter in this air purifier. The unit blows (exhaust) air straight up--about like a box fan on \\"High\\" setting.

The unit I received vibrated and pulsed air out of the top. I called Kaz the manufacturer who confirmed this is not normal. Returned to amazon and requested replacement. Second 50150 had exactly the same problem. Returning to amazon for refund. I recently purchased the 50250 from Kaz, and it works fine with no vibration and stable airflow with no pulsing.The problem as I could figure is the 50150 came with a hepa filter that was slightly too tall at 6.25 inches. The housing could not be installed over the base so that it was flush at the bottom like with the 50250. This could be the reason for the shaking and vibration. There was no shaking or vibration if I removed the filter. Or, it could be a problem with the fan vibrating. Hopefully Kaz will fix this, because otherwise this could be a good performing air purifier for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"I bought this air filter for my den, which has a little mold damage from a leaky room. Within a day, the lingering, stale smell of mold was gone, and the air felt so much crisper and clean. The high setting is quite loud in an otherwise silent room, so I recommend using the high setting during the day (when I play music throughout the house anyways, and can't hear it), and turn it to low at night, which is very silent. I am very pleased with this excellent product.

I have included the fix below. With the unit unplugged. The grey portion with the switch will snap out with moderate pressure. Flip the switch housing over, you will see the various power wires. You will see another white cover held by three screws. Once the screws are removed the white cover will be off.

With that light off it is now a 5 star product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"This air cleaner seems to work well, but as other reviews state, it's quite loud, even on the lowest setting. The description mentioned that this was the (newer) model with the permanent HEPA filter, however the unit I received was the (older) model with filters that require periodic replacement. The response from Amazon after inquiry to get and exchange for the described unit was \\"We are not currently set up for exchanges...\\". They went on further to say: \\"I've checked our records and see that you placed an order for the Honeywell 50150 version of this item please note this version does take a replacement filter.\\" although the description clearly stated otherwise. The lesson learned is not rely on the descriptions given by Amazon, but look at the model number and research elsewhere what the item you're buying really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moves a lot of air, but noisy","review":"I got this air purifier for my wife at Christmas, and she loves it. It moves a huge amount of air, and has helped her very much with her allergies. But I can hardly stand to be in the same room with it, as it is very noisy. One supposes these are compromises that might have to be made. Fortunately, we've agreed on a placement for it nowhere close to our TV or stereo system."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY LOUD!!!","review":"I bought this for my baby boy because he is allergic.

I could even kind of deal with the noise (even on low), but the machine just dried the room out and simply didn't do the job. I was replacing an oreck that I couldn't find filters for anymore, and this machine didn't even come close to doing the job that my little oreck did. I returned this machine, as it made me feel worse, instead of better."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more living in a dust bowl...thank you Honeywell!","review":"So far this 50150 has turned my dust bowl of an apartment into a wonderful place to live. I can't believe how quickly it took the dust and stank out of the air. I could easily dust twice a day prior to getting this unit but now, I'm not sure when I'll dust next. It seems to be taking care of an area around 325 square feet for me which I know is more then it's rated to do. I can't imagine being without it now.As far as sound goes, it's certainly not silent. Turbo mode is down right noisy. Medium speed is better but still hard to deal with in a room with a TV. The lowest setting is ok...but still a little loud for my taste. I can't knock it for this though. It's doing its job and doing it extremely well so I'll deal with the noise. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't rattle the walls or anything like that...it's just like having a floor standing fan in the room.

One problem I have is that many artists are traditionalists and they end up sounding like they came from the same gypsy jazz school.What's interesting about this album (and their other two, Swing Rencontre and Entre Amis) is that Angelo and Ludovic seem to resist sounding like other modern proponents of jazz manouche. Maybe it's the accordion, a welcome addition to any gypsy jazz line-up (see Note Manouche, Tchavolo Schmitt's \\"Alors...Voila\\", or Les Pommes de ma Douche). At any rate, with their arrangements and sincere playing, these guys raise the bar for modern gypsy jazz music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of dry writing...","review":"I found this book to be a bit dry reading - not enough pictures and she gets bogged down in boring details.

WA! it's nice......","review":"I have owned many Jo Ral mutes and accessories and this one lives up to its name. In my opinion this is a great plunger as it has a hole in the center of the gripping area. This allows some sound to come out, even if the whole bell is covered. Using a standard rubber \\"plunger\\" toilet type that most trumpet players use, this is not the case. If you close up the whole bell it stops 95% of any sounds and it even changes the pitch of the note. I really like this mute as with the hole I spoke of above, it lets sound through which I think makes the WA! WA! sound much better. I only wish it came in copper, but beggers cannot be choosers. All in all, an inovative mute and a great addition to any trumpet players mute inventory, replacing the old rubber plunger's we have used for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AUTO FRIENDLY","review":"This compass may work well on boats, but it does not have enough adjustment flexibility to compensate for all the electrical influences in a car.If you don't position it exactly right, including making some some adjustments, it becomes unless in any any other placement you may want to consider.The limited amount of adjustment available on this compass, does not give you much of a choice where you set it up.I would not recommend this compass if you are considering using it in a car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little lighted compas","review":"This was and exact replacement for one that had weathered after thirteen years.

There are no really big adventures to deal with and no real excitement unless you consider insulating a building exciting. (Just keep imagining the pulsating punch of the staple gun and maybe you'll get deeply into it...) The other big problem is that the author can't restrain his desire to describe everything in terms of a big, somtimes unbelievably cloying, metaphor. I wanted to scream, \\"Enough already!

The ends of the pipes were not done cleanly. It required the grinding to get the flaring off the end that was left from the cutting tool. None of the pipes would slip into the collector. This extends the assemble time, when it could (should have) been removed in the manufacturing process.The instruction said that no re-jetting should be necessary. I have recently rebuild the stock 79 carbs. I went from a machine that could easily exceed a 100 mph to a max of 90 mph...This is a totally low mileage stock bike.All this being said.

I would recommend this book to any engineering student or practicing engineer. Consulting the work of other authors (eg Sullivan) would supplement understanding and appreciation of the subject matter. I gave the book a 4 star rating because of the errors within the examples provided.

First heard this CD in a bar in downtown Portland, OR and was hooked from that moment on. I really think that the only weak track is, ironically, the title cut, \\"On Track.\\" Aside from that this music is solid as a rock, full of harmonics, some traditional Hendrix played Cajun, \\"Midnight Special\\" is especially good. I'm shocked that this CD was so hard to get my hands on. Had to buy it through a third party Amazon seller but the wait and hassle were well worth it. To me, it beats all other Buckwheat CDs hand down, but it may be prejudiced by my first exposure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"What a waste of 70 minutes of my life. The premise sounded interesting (a corpse recounts the events leading to her death), but even Bela Lugosi could not save this turd from stinking up my DVD player.The characters and dialogue were absolutely horrible, especially the moronic ex-cop/bodyguard. I can take a fair amount of cheesiness in old horror movies, but this went way beyond cheesy. It was just plain bad - and not even remotely scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harrassing film","review":"The characters in this movie are awfully unlikable.Leading the pack is one bodyguard-type who right to a ladie's face tells her he wishes she was dead so he could investigate a murder.

Nice looking cinematography and beautiful leading lady (not Lugosi)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie; Bad Product","review":"\\"Scared to Death\\" is one of the best movies, I ever watched. George Zucco and Bela Lugosi are at their best. Everybody has something to hide, so everyone is a potential victim of blackmail. If you want suspense and mystery, then this movie is for you. However, the seller, videoluvr has sent me a defective tape, that I have to constantly re-adjust the tracking. Try enjoying a film with the tracking all screwed up every four to seven minutes. The movie is one of the best, but please refrain from purchasing from this vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor!!","review":"Buyers should avoid the Republic version of this film, which is sheer butchery. It has been severely edited (the entire opening sequence has been removed), and the original color has been replaced with \\"digital color\\", which means that it has been \\"colorized\\", with predictably poor results. There are better versions out there, so don't waste your time and money on this hackneyed mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"More confusing than scary","review":"For devotees of \\"bad movies,\\" this film is a must-have. Despite the presence of horror-film stalwarts Lugosi and Zucco, this one is terribly boring, in large part because the plot is so badly muddled that it is virtually incomprehensible. By this time, both Lugosi and Zucco, despite their impressive acting talents, had become fixtures in third-rate horror features. In addition to the poor scripting and direction, the color is atrocious. It appears as if the entire film was carelessly thrown together, with no regard for continuity or plot progression, and is noteworthy only as Logusi's sole color film. As a serious drama, it fails miserably; however, the illogic and ineptitude which define this production make it a collector's item for those who savor Grade-Z gems like this one, a masterpiece of pure poverty-row hackery. As bad as it is, it deserves one star for the sheer nerve required to film and release it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bela in Living Color","review":"\\"Scared to Death\\" (1947) is a bizarre mixture of horror, mystery and comedy. The low-budget production remains notable for being the only color film to star Bela Lugosi (who wears his Dracula cape in yet another red herring role). Another unique distinction is the jarring flashback structure - with narration provided by a dead woman in the city morgue! The B-movie cast includes George Zucco, Molly Lamont, Angelo Rossitto and the archaic comic relief of Nat Pendleton. Running 67 minutes, \\"Scared to Death\\" benefits from Bela's striking Cinecolor presence and its decidedly weird atmosphere. Not a particularly good film, but a watchable curio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding writing with remarkably thought provoking conten","review":"I simply adore Ken Carey's ability to reach deep inside...past one's veneer to the utmost depths of their heart.

Its simplicity moved me and the small stories that it told helped me feel how Nogales was in the 1950's and 60's. I usually find memoirs to be too orderly for literature and to self-serving for nonfiction. This one is different. Rios's memoir is beautiful literature.Alberto Rios writes in the same way that a great abstract painter paints. He draws an outline and leaves blank spaces. He admits that he doesn't know things. The pieces that he puts in are enough so that you can accept the unknowns and the uncertainties of his life or yours and just see enough of the picture so you can feel how it was without knowing everything.Capirotada is brilliantly written book that is a marvelous tribute to his parents, to Nogales, and to immigrants everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very boring","review":"I read this book because of One Book Arizona's sponsorship.

There was, however, one good part - good because it was so laughable. In the beginning scene, when Stallone's character is trying to save the girl who falls, Stallone's helicopter pilot is LAUGHING. It's true! I think the actor is supposed to be showing concern or fright, but he's not - he is LAUGHING! If you don't believe me, check it out.

Thanks to the creator of Cliffhanger in making this come to reality. Obvious enough, the movie has very few weak visual effects that kinda disapproves a thrill seeker's likings. I wonder if there were a few scenes in this movie that were shot in Hollywood. Nonetheless, the movie is packed with action and adventure. It was quite disheartening on the first episode after a girlfriend falls from the line. So terrifying and so real! Sylvester Stallone is just the man for this kind of adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"action movie, accept it","review":"Cliffhanger is an all out action movie, and this should not be forgotten. Although there are a few blaringly obvious mistakes in the climbing sequence, this does not take away the fact that this movie achives what it sets out to do: entertain the action-movie junkies. This movie is a must for all of the Sylvester Stallone fans out there, and for anyone who enjoys the typical one-man-aginst-the-bad-guys movies. John Lithgow is excellent as the baddy, although he does always look a bit to kind. Sly Stallone does what he does best, running around saving people with as little clothes on as he can possibly manage, and the other cast work well as either bad guys or good guys. Warning though for those weaker viewers out there, this movie is gory, the deaths scenes being the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Cliffhanger it is!","review":"What a Great Movie! Within the first 10 minutes of this movie, I was exclaiming out loud - \\"why haven't I heard of this film before?\\" Talk about edge-of-your-seat ... the opening scene deserves a place in film making history as one of the all time openings. It's already been tributed - the second \\"Pet Detective\\" movie opening spoofs this film's opening, complete with the red helicopter and breathtakingly high altitude climbing.Janine Turner is Stallone's sensible and grounded girlfriend who flies a helicopter and assists with rescue missions, but it's Stallone who gets caught up in a story of intrigue and greed against the backdrop of beautiful outdoor mountainous areas. There are subplots and chase scenes.Very believable with an interesting plot and reasonably good character development, lots of excitement and very well done. Highly recommended for an evening's entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"My mistake on menu","review":"My error on review below. I did not know how to obtain the disk menu.

I thought the movie was going in a direciton that would be boring, so I waited until I was bored to watch the rest of it. I was pleasantly surprised. It was different than I expected, with twists and surprises. The other characters -- good ones and bad ones -- played their roles well. It brought me through a whole range of emotions.

Yurdal Tokcan is a marvelous ud player and his playing style is very innovative and masterful. He performs some very moving taksims (improvisations) of his composition on various makams, creating a highly contemplative and expressive atmosphare. Beside the traditional exponents in his music, he uses various advanced playing techniques, such as the one called \\"the fretless guitar technique\\" - on tracks 2 and 7 for exemple - which he has clearly derived from the Western guitar playing techniques and with a very impressive result.In my opinion, the skillfulness of Tokcan is peeraless among all other ud players today!This is a must-have album for anyone interested in Turkish or Middle Eastern music and absolutely one of the best ud albums ever released.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price!","review":"In shopping for in-ceiling speakers for our Sonos system, I came across HiFi Works. Since their parent company (Sonance) did high custom installation speakers, I figured I would give them a shot. We installed the 6.5 speakers in our bedroom. They sounded great. Even the bass response was better than I had expected. So, I ordered the speakers I was planning on putting in the rest of the house (9 pairs in all), including these 5.25 inch speakers. I installed them in our master bath. They sound great for the price and installation was a snap. Cut the holes (I used a spin saw with a circle attachment--it cut a perfect hole), ran the wire, connected the speakers, placed them and tighten the screws, replaced the grills.I don't think you could do much better for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Songs & Quality Sound","review":"One of the best gospel recordings ever made, Pop Staples worked with the best in the business to give us a polished gem of a masterpiece. Some of the songs, such as This May Be The Last Time, have been on previous Staple Singers albums but here they get a contemporary treatment. Guest artists include Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Brown, and Ry Cooder. Mavis, Yvonne and Cleotha Staples join him, with Mavis taking lead on Pray On My Child. Some may find the album sounds uneven with five different production teams, but I enjoyed the styles that each brought the recording. For example, Ry Cooder brings a pared-down rootsy sound to the production of the delta blues material that reminds us of where the music came from, on songs such as Down In Mississippi, and I Shall Not Be Moved. Willie Mitchell brings in Jackson & Love of the Memphis Horns for a more urban sound on America.

If that is not enough to lose interest in this author, there are some serious mistakes in those 25 pages as well. For instance page 268, there is a reference to the Print Space Profile--Same As Source. Anyone who knows how to print, knows that Same As Source is used ONLY to print a Target.

The first part of the book is a history lesson talking about Graham Nash being the first one to do high-end digital printing for the art world. It includes numerous plugs for Nash's Nash Editions printing company as well as other related companies. The second park talks about the various equipment available for digital printing, both high end, and at home. Again, a great history lesson (most equipment is outdated already) but you can learn more by window-shopping at a local electronics store. With a title like Mastering Digital Printing, I expected more info on color calibration, setting up images for output, etc., and less of a history lesson. If they re-titled the book to actually reflect the contents, and cut the price in half, this would be a great book at an acceptable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Mastering!!","review":"I agree with the other reviewer who describes this book as only an overview. If you knew nothing about printing before buying this book then you'd have more information than you started with. If you started with some printing skills and a basic understanding of industry terminology then you'd learn little more than a little bit of historyThere is also a MAJOR emphasis placed on providing information about Epson printers. This obvious bias makes the book come across as a blatant advertisement that only occasionally mentions other printers. This book contained so much advertising that I feel that it could be reduced in size and be passed out for free at all Epson dealers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enought","review":"When I first started to read this book I was really impressed. Then I kept trying to find specific information that I could use. There is very little. A good book for history and hype, but there are better books for useful knowledge. I would suggest Kieran's Photoshop Color Correction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take your digital printing to the next level","review":"Mastering Digital Printing is a comprehensive manual/textbook for the professional photographer or artist who demands the knowledge to control every aspect of his/her final output, as well as the printmakers who assist them in this process. From printing techniques, file management, history, paper selection, every aspect of printing is here. The photos and bios of printers, artists, and photographers in their studios is helpful to see the layout of the workspace and creative ways of using the space available. This is the book you need to take your digital printing to the next level."},{"rating":"1","title":"got the t603 and not the T605","review":"Ordered the t605, and got t603 in the mail.

They need to get this issue resolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother unless you have an RCA jack","review":"I bought this for my car. The installation person told me I could connect it to my factory radio and it would be no problem. Once I got there, he told me I didn't have an RCA jack on the back of my radio, so I would have to use the Motorola speaker. Who wants to listen to high quality music on a cheap speaker? I wanted it to play through my car radio speakers. Don't think you are going to seamlessly install this in your car unless you have an RCA jack or you are planning to use the factory speaker.

It was in a plain white box with bot a T603 and T605 label and the unit was clearly marked T603. I was disappointed but Amazon is giving me a full refund. Seller then increased the price on the T605... Just a bit of inconvenience. Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Research Before Buying","review":"Not based on the product itself because I never hooked it up. The return was handled well, but they did send the T603 instead of the T605. I have a 05 Honda Accord and it is not the most user-friendly when it comes to aftermarket stereo equipment, I took this product to 2 different car stereo installers in the area, one said they couldn't do it, the other could but it would be about $150, plus I would need to buy a $30 harness for my car. I couldn't find the one I needed and decided $300 was too much for the bluetooth feature. Decided on the Gogroove instead that just plugs into the cigarette lighter. Review will be posted once I receive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motorola 1","review":"This product has thus far been a disappointment. No where in the advertisement for this product is there information stating that for most car models to install this to work with your sound system you will need to purchase additional cables. Motorola was no help at finding this information, they stated that it can only be installed by a professional. We were able to locate cables after many phone calls and research on the internet, but the cables cost more than the price of the unit. We are still waiting for the cables to arrive, so the unit has not been installed yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"They don't tell you that your ipod will not work unless you buy a D650 (bluetooth for your ipod).

The Honda was a very simple install, but because of the premium speakers I can't integrate the system into my stero. The speaker it comes with is okay, but I wish I could get the sound through the car speakers. The product works great and I would recommend it to anyone, as we all should be responsible drivers and use hands free kits in our cars. As for the Saab, I need a special harness to use the kit so I can't really comment on it to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanted music interface too.","review":"It is a nice product. I upgraded from the HF-850, becuase the 850 didn't work with the IPhone. This one works well with the IPhone. The only downside is the fact that I can't use the Music feature of the 605 because my stereo doesn't have RCA jacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book for understanding corporate financial statements","review":"I use this book to teach college journalism students how to decipher corporate financial statements and write stories based on the numbers.

Since he goes to Catholic School I wanted him to get full disclosure from a 3 rd party as well. It's written to keep the interest of the kids but is fact based. He was \\"grossed out\\" of some of the things but kept reading it so I know he liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Insightful","review":"I bought this book for my 12 year old son and he finds it to be very interesting. It has opened up discussions on things he would normally not discuss with me which has helped us have great conversations. I recommned this book for anybody with young boys going through puberty whom are normally not used to talking about what's going on with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer BEWARE- XXX RATED","review":"This book is suggested for 10 year olds and yet is filled with PICTURES of female anatomy labeling the clitoris etc. Moreover, it discussed homosexuality, herpes, female pubic hair, abortion, tampons, sexual variation (BONDAGE WITH PICTURES), Internet Pornography etc. I thought this would be a good way to provide information to my children about their bodies but I am returning it immediately! We are open-minded progressive parents but this is just too much! It belongs in an adult bookstore not a kid's bedroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Words, Beware!","review":"Chapter 8, titled: Is This Normal? States, \\"it is not unusual for a boy to watch another boy masturbate or to masturbate with a group of boys. Nor is it unusual for two boys to masturbate each other.\\" My 13 year old son was accused of sexual assault by an 11 year old boy (a friend) after the 11 year old suggested they masturbated together, they did so on three occasions. The charge came a year later, social services and the police visited our home. Our younger son was almost removed from our home. Our 14 year old was questioned by police, charged, fingerprinted and we had to hire a lawyer. This book states that boys masturbating together or each other is not unusual. Maybe so, but it is a crime, and your child could be charged with sexual assault. Especially when the other child, out of guilt, fear, or revenge perhaps, tells his parents that he wasn't a willing participate once he realizes his \\"young, boyish curiosity\\" was a crime. BEWARE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative Book","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book. The way it is written and illustrated is perfect for maturing young men. My son is 12, and even though we speak about the \\"changes\\" you go through in puberty, this book provided information on the more \\"personal\\" issues related to growing up. Issues he may be a little more embarrassed to come to me with.Nothing is better, in my opinion, than a parent or guardian personally speaking to a child about the birds and bee's, opposite sex, changes they see in their bodies, and emotions they feel while growing up. Turning into a teenager is hard! But this book definitely gives parents that little extra help in opening a usually difficult conversation with their maturing son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Younger Boys","review":"Unless you let your 10-11 year old watch R rated movies, your child is not ready for this book. Some of the pictures are too advanced for a younger child. Instead of starting off with the physicial changes of puberty, this book starts off Chapter 1 about sex and concentrates mainly on this subject. No easing into the subject here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for the early tween","review":"This book has some great info...but ventures into places that I was not ready to go with my 5th grader....I was looking for a puberty \\"starter\\" book...but this delves deeper than I was ready to go...so it is tucked away for a few years....like high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice for early adolescence","review":"My son appreciates the mixture of humor and information.

Extremely well done. I really liked the way the subject manner was handled. Any kid would really enjoy reading and would understand what the authors were saying. However, since the book condones abortion and masturbation, and doesn't really promote abstinence and responsibility, I'm returning it. It was intended as a gift and I would not want it to reflect by views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for younger boys","review":"I purchased this book and \\"What's Happening to Me?\\" for my 11 y/o son.

He brought it out to me after reading 3 chapters and said he wasn't ready for it and didn't want to read any more of it. He came back out a little later *very* upset by what he had read, crying and saying he couldn't live with it. It took him 2 hours to calm down enough to go to bed. He asked me to write this review.

He said he thought the book would tell what happens during puberty but this book dealt too much with sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed!","review":"My son went through puberty early (10), and was too embarrassed to talk about anything. I gave him the book. He read it (he hid it, so I have no idea when he would sneak a peak!), and then when I would bring up things, he already knew about them, or would finally ask questions. It actually went along quite well with his school \\"family planning\\" program they have in the fifth grade.

A good adornment for your desk.The main problem with this item is that the darts do not stick on the board if you throw them hard. As the magnets are too small, the darts just bounce off the boards. You have to be very gentle in throwing the darts for the magnets to work.Many people who walk by my desk tried it and were unhappy about this since you can't really play much with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY PLEASED","review":"This product is exactly what I needed to control the speed of a motor for my fishing line winder.

I am not very happy with spending so much money on a cheap plastic item. However, it does work. It is spring loaded though. Which means that you can't set it at one speed and remove your foot.

It is designed for elementary students....but it includes the details of getting his slave, Sally, pregnant (exact word used) at 14 years old. Sally was also Martha's half sister since her dad also had six children with one of his slaves. INAPPROPRIATE!!! This is not an exaggeration!!

This book attempts to include all of the greatest motorcycles ever produced. There are great photographs and plenty of informative text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into Deadly Air","review":"Having once almost died himself in a mountaineering accident, Joe Simpson's \\"Dark Shadows Falling\\" attempts to sound the warning for amature climbers who might have missed the message in Jon Krakauer's hugely popular \\"Into Thin Air.\\" Elite mountains (such as the Himilayas) should be left to the elite climbers, and even they should take pause before tackling the world's toughest climbs. That is the Simpson's message and he dramtizes it with various accounts of mountaineering tragedies and triumphs. There are also light moments, such as the photo of a Sherpa lifting up three granite blocks with his, ahem, scrotum. Overall, this is an excellent read for anyone interested in mountaineering."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest read on the unethical pactices of some climbers.","review":"Simspon writes briefly on his lonely ordeal in the Peruvian Andes and uses this a springboard to rationalize the unethical actions taken on by other climbers.Climbing is dangerous and there is alot of energy and cost involved. However Simpson questions the treatment of dying climbers who are often left to die in the lonliness of the mountain. Often without comfort of another soul.He goes on to tackle the commercialization of the sport, which has stripped the members of such climbing expeditions of any human emotions or feelings. A truly philosophical honest read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read, makes you rethink life and death","review":"I really enjoyed this book when I picked it up on Mt. Hood in Oregon and read it while I was out west hiking the mountains (not mountaineering)He really looks into the great Yaw of death and what he finds there will change him and the reader, it is as if you are going through life threatening experiences with him and you wonder how you would handle the situations.Worth a read by anyone who wonders about the great hereafter."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a climber, you must read this Book!","review":"I first cme into contact with Simpson when my father convinced me to read \\"Touching the Void.\\" Although I haven't read all of them the ones I have read have been Unputdownble in every sense. If you have read into thin air by Jon Krakauer then this is an excellent follow up book. The harrowing first chapter introduced me to an element of climbing that I had never seen and do not want to ever see. Again, if you are a climber then you must read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some strong stuff","review":"Joe Simpson starts out his book \\"Dark Shadows Falling\\" with an eerie and troubling tale of a mountaineer who was left out in the cold to die within a few hundred feet of his companions tents. Simpson uses this story to dramatize how far mainstream mountaineering has strayed from its original adventurer roots. The book's main drawback is Simpson's analysis of the 1996 Everest disaster which has been over reported and covered far more completely by those who were actually there. Simpson closes the book with an interestting but relatively uneventful recent climb of his own that seems to have little to do with the rest of the book.Overall, Simpson is an important figure in mountaineering and he does have plenty to say. Those with an interest in the subject should enjoy this book very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite Joe Simpson book","review":"Let's face it, Touching The Void is such a fantastic story that it has to be Simpson's best book. It's certainly his most famous.But this one is my favorite, I think because it is more about \\"climbing\\" than about \\"Joe Simpson\\".Simpson makes a compelling case for the idea that the ethics of mountaineering have been harmed by the commercialization of climbing.I usually figure that any story about \\"the good old days\\" when people were noble is likely BS. But that's not really what Simpson is claiming here. Instead, he is really talking more about the differences between a small and self-selected community (like \\"climbing\\" 30 years ago) and a large and public activity (like \\"climbing\\" today).I'm not sure if non-climbers would really appreciate this book, but as a climber I have found it invaluable for helping me to frame my own questions about what it means to be a climber, and ultimately a human being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible excuse for a game.","review":"No single player here at all. NONE. There is a training option, which is just some very very quick areas where as soon as you kill off the given enemies with the one or two given weapons the level ends abruptly. Also, these areas cannot be replayed once you successfully complete them. You must restart the training over from the first area. There's also no respawning on these training levels. They just start completely over.Also, do you really think anyone is playing this game online? Really? ummm.. nope they are not. I can't think of one reason to get this game. It's not even a real game in my opinion without at least a true single player. Groove made a wonderful game with Combat Task Force 121.

Auster writes like a modern day Dickens and he weaves characters and settings with grace and style. It's hard to describe the plot because so much happens within its 300 pages. But, it takes too many plot turns and relies on too many coincidences for readers to accept. Like Auster's \\"Mr. Vertigo\\" there were scenes that should have been the finale, but it trudges through and takes the reader on an exhuasting journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"imagination at its finest","review":"Moon palace is a magical book, capable of whisking anyone off their feet and transporting them to a land of imagination and coincidence.

His plot inventions, such as the countless coincidences that happened to Fogg in this book (or those metaphysical characters in the New York Trilogy) are minor irritiation in an otherwise wry, melancholy and highly absorbing story.

However, I will say there is almost not a line in this book that I would have skipped. As I read the book, I was thinking...hmmm...this is not a terribly interesting story, but the writing is so good! Thus, I kept reading, and at the end, I was not unsatisfied. I have two other Paul Auster books waiting to be read...if nothing else, I have a feeling that I won't read anything \\"bad\\" by Paul Auster.

Just this one is not worth the cost.I was expecting another full book to match the other 3 and ended up with a small story. The novella they included in this 'book' seemed longer than the featured Beast House story!If I had known it was not a full book but a novella, I never would have spent the amount I did for it.His books are interesting, but this is not a book. This is a short story that took me 15 minutes to finish.

The first half of the book was great, and peaked my interest...But its as if the author stepped aside and let a clueless idiot finish the book...The \\"Beast\\" rapes the girl then just walks away...and the girl is fine with it, and gives it up to her boyfriend immediately after? Was this some kind of comedic porno???If an unknown author submitted this garbage to a literary agent/publishing house it would be thrown in the garbage immediately.This book goes to show that well known authors can publish anything and people will buy it.Thank God it was short and I only wasted an hour and a half reading it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Friday Night in The Beast House","review":"Not bad, I would have liked for the first story to be longer, his books are \\" out there \\", but that's what makes them good.

I am studying french and am a fan of Charlotte Gainsbourg, so I picked this up. This movie is in engligh, not french, so those who want a french movie will be dissapointed.The biggest problem with this DVD is the picture quality is bad. The picture is more like a VHS tape than a DVD. There was grain in the picture, and it was not clear or sharp at times. It is not as bad as Fox Lieber, but for a DVD I expect great picture quality.The third reason I would suggest people pass on this movie is the story is not that interesting. It did not hold my interest.

I happened to tape it and I've still got the tape! I recently bought it on DVD as it's one of those films I can watch over and over.Some reviews have criticised the grainy feel of the cinematography but I like it - it gives a warmth to the picture, mainly because the DVD was mastered off tape and not the original film reel.The story is rather disturbing throughout but strangely compelling, taking the viewer on a trip through fear, isolation, discomfort and rather graphic references of incest.The backdrop to the film is unusual, being difficult to imagine where the location is and is a truly bleak and desolate place.If you're not easily shocked and enjoy a good story, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Yorker, shame on you","review":"Reviewing the DVD and not the movie here, New Yorker's edition of 'The Cement Garden' is enough to make you gag.

It is hard to understand,but you had to feel compassion, because after all, they now had to take on the role of parents and providers.

I have washed the dished in it and got it wet with no problems there.

Preston's little chimpanzee touches so many disparate places within the reader that she becomes absolutely real. No wonder the author takes such pains to remind us that JENNIE is a work of fiction.The book makes serious emotional demands upon its reader.

There were some things about this book that bothered me, however.From the start, the heroine and her sisters are at what I thought was a tea room - drinking tea and eating pastries. Then one of the women is asked to DANCE. That seemed odd.The heroine dates - as in going on dates to restaurants and parties with a man.Maybe that was done during this time period, but I don't think it was done by members of the England upper class.The story is written in what I've come to think of as a Regency style - but it takes place in the late 19th century.I did like the characters, but did feel that they jumped into bed too quickly and too casually.That sounds like I didn't like the book - but I did!

It seemed that the book was written for the porn crowd. I like a spicy book, but don't care for the female protagonist as a slut, and her gentleman 'friend' thinking that it is acceptable. The plot is transparent even for the genre, and the situations are not plot or charater driven, they are contrived and not in historical context. As I was reading the first couple of chapters I was thinking that Feather was more concerned to 'hook' you into her next two books than set the stage for this one.

I was disappointed to discover that the HD side is all demo material, basically showing off the marvels of high definition. The regular DVD side is where all the calibration test patterns are found.The menus are very poorly designed, confusing to navigate, narration is boring and too long, very little direction is provided, and the worst part is, I barely noticed a difference between the calibrated settings and the TV's default settings.In summary: waste of money, NOT high definition, outdated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Video Essentials (double sided DVD w/ SD & HD)","review":"This was not helpful at all.

Well! Okay this film i would rank lower than 2 stars if it wasn't for the fat that i liked sharks and i want to be a marine biologist. The other reason was i think Casper Van Dien is good actor with a good career ahead of him. But this movie stunk. In no ways does it compare to jaws nor even Deep Blue Sea. I hated almost every moment of it. If you want to see a good shark movie rent or buy Deep Blue Sea. Or better yet just stick to jaws its still the best after all these years. Don't be fooled this is a waste of time and effort. This film needs some coupe de grace some spice but it gets none. ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent support & good quality","review":"Wonderful bras; comfortable, durable and look good.

Unlike the #458, there is absolutely zero support for the lower half of your breast area so they just hang there without any shaping or support whatsoever.

Cobb, who would have been a very good NBA player was acquited of all charges, yet Porter wants you to believe that Cobb was guilty. This book insults any true Basketball fan's knowledge of the game.

Two things saved this book from a one-star review. First, it did include a somewhat helpful section on conducting a reference interview.

Bullens remains though, critically acclaimed but commercially overlooked. A situation which seems unlikely to change, despite her latest effort Dream #29 being the most compelling and enjoyable album of her career. Bullens excels here, on a set of songs that shifts gear effortlessly from acoustic poignancy to robustly rocking. There's much to admire throughout, from the heady, seductive atmosphere of opener \`Oriental Silk' to the devastatingly beautiful \`Mockingbird Hill' through to the poignant, heartfelt album closer \`January Sky'. Dream #29 is a consistent winner. A raw, heart-stopping, life-affirming record.Like This?

With a single line of text not 25 pages in, Gideon gives away far too much than he should, and the suspense caves in.The characters, however, are fairly well written and you learn to appreciate and empathise with their inner and outward struggles. But, still, I feel there was a certain lack of intimacy between the reader and the book's population. I could have felt more for them if I knew them a little better.Ultimately it is a discovery the reader will have to make on his/her own.

Finding at least one well-known film critic, Leonard Maltin or Roger Ebert anyone?, to comment on Wood's legacy would have added immeasurably and given this effort a lot more depth.

The pre-filter is supposed to be changed every three months and the HEPA filter is supposed to be vacuum cleaned every six months. The pre-filters cost between $10 and $15. I've only had it running for several says and the pre-filter is already covered with dust, so it's really doing what it's supposed to be doing. What's more is that the air is so clean and crisp. The instructions say that you should run the air purifier 24 hours a day, but I think that's a huge waste of energy and only run it when I'm in the room, which seems to work just fine. It does make a lot of noise, but it's white noise, like a window air conditioner or a box fan.

At first I thought I was doing something wrong. I'm not the best cook, but was it possible I'd forgotten how to make toast? But over and over again...one side of the bread is toasted, one side is not toasted.So here's the cons:1. Bagels don't fit.2.

Somewhere after \\"What Am I Doing in New Jersey?\\" he started to get angry and his whimsical humor began to sour. After staking his claim on pointing out universal foibles and the quirks of American culture and dark edge of politics, he got mean and his humor became darker and darker until this point, at which point I truly find I fail to care what Carlin has to offer anymore.After a gloss of current, post 9/11 politics he moves on to bathroom humor, discussions of scabs and bodily functions. This isn't Carlin at his best, this is Carlin channeling the weaker parts of the Jerky Boys and that's a shame.Don't bother with this disc. Stick with the nostalgia of FM & AM and Place For My Stuff.

It's very small, and the back of it is completely hollowed out. This wouldn't be a problem if it had a bail you could use to hang it on a cord, but it doesn't. So, in order to wear this pendant without showing the ugly backside, you will need to loop a soft cord (silk might work) around it.

The quality is not great, but I might have kept it if I hadn't paid so much for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long-winded, tied to Websphere and VAJ","review":"This is not a good choice if you want to learn how to write web services quickly. The book is long-winded, covering 280 pages before starting the first example of an actual web service. It also uses an obsolete version of IBM's Websphere (v3.5) for its examples. There are several pages of screen shots showing how to use Websphere v3.5 to create and deploy a web service even though the author says \\"This is not a book on Websphere\\". Make up your mind. What is even worse is that he wastes several pages showing how to use the ultra-bloated Visual Age for Java to develop web services.One goal of web services is to be implementation neutral so tying the explanation of web services development to particular tools goes against the spirit of web services.On the positive side the author has some useful insights and tips on the technologies involved in web services. He also provides a web site with working web services."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing...","review":"This is a decent book if you are interested in a theoretical treatment of web services but not in building systems that produce and consume web services. Yes, there are examples, but because the book is not tied to a specific web service platform it is not well grounded. I've been working with web services for over a year now. It is easy to speculate about web services architecture in the abstract. However, when you pick a platform to develop web services on, you quickly discover that you have to keep compromising your architecture because of various limitations. This book is unrealistic: it ignores many of the constraints of the real world. Perhaps it is meant for architects that don't have to actually build any software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"This is not a book for technically oriented people looking for answers on web services. Questions you have on things such as scalability, security, and business models are either not covered or are glossed over at a 50k foot level.

Not only does William show you different implementations, but gives you the architectural guidance that most (if not all) other books on the subject lack. This book is definitely not a re-hash of some help file or article, but a clear, concise way of designing and architecting Web Service solutions.

He doesn't even mention SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, or any of the standard Java APIs: JAX-RPC, JAXR, or JAXM. Instead, he designs his own protocols using XML and servlets. Unless you're looking for job security by writing software noone else understands, skip this book.At this point (June 2002), your best bet for learning Java web services is to download Sun's Java Web Services Developer Pack and go through the tutorial.

There's hardly any text to read, I would say ~85% of the learning is done by solving the problems. Barbeau guides the reader by giving directions on how to solve them sometimes, so learning from this book is MUCH MORE interactive (I think that's the right word...) than with others where you just read. It covers complex numbers, how to solve quadratics, cubics & quartics by radicals, symmetric functions of the roots, some number theory (like congruences), numerical methods & approximating roots, factors & zeros and symmetric functions of the roots.

HOWEVER, as I watched this film it seemed to be that Michael was the one with brain damage. Outisde of a love for rings (which he shares with one of the Beatles) Joey seemed much saner. The film though well-meaning on the part of the actor/director/producer/writer/editor is yet another proof that a second viewpoint (rather than have one person do it all) is necessary unless one is a genius like Chaplin or Welles. I found it impossible to identify with the character or even to like him. It's one of those films that bore to such an extent one keeps looking at a watching saying: \\"40 minutes to go...30 minutes to go...20....10...7\\" That no other film appears with this director/star is not suprising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another depressing indie","review":"Depressing black and white portrait of Joe, a puffy faced gay man in his 30's who is sexually attracted to older and even less attractive men.

Their catholic mother raised the boys and Joe is now a men's washroom attendant when he's not cruising New York's Central Park. The film is disjointed and goes nowhere. Much time is spent as Joe takes one candle lit bath after another. It appears that the director knew he was in trouble and hoped that showing some skin would raise interest.

It has some good interesting things in here but really, its much of a snooze fest and Sands is that a great bad guy but the real treat is watching Richard E.

I was severely disappointed. The dialogue was stilted and hard to distinguish at times. The actors were all stiff and boring--many of them could have benefited from an acting class or two. Given the decade it was made, I wasn't expecting much from the \\"special effects\\", but those could have had a little more effort put into them too. Overall, I hated this movie and have suffered through it both times I have watched it. I say skip this one--Julian Sands has done better things than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not scary - very dated, kinda humorous","review":"I love horror movies, but this one is very dated and campy.

It's a bit of a ripoff, and shows a great disregard for the DVD buyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Film","review":"This is the type of film that people will see and wonder how many years will go by before another one comes along. The portrayal of Jimmy Morris by Dennis Quaid is tremendous and certainly his best work in 10 years. Many films claim to be based on a true story and venture far away from the facts. This film follows the true story very closely. If you have ever had dreams as a child you will immediately respond to this outstanding film. I guarantee you will ride an emotional rollercoster throughout this wonderful movie and in the end it will make you think long and hard about giving one more try to that little something that has been gnawing at you for many years. I have viewed this film at least 10 times and I can't get enough. Thanks to Jim Morris for giving himself another chance and sharing his story with the rest of the world. Additionally, thanks to Dennis Quaid for the hard work he put into this film and bringing Jimmy Morris to our hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Stories of Our Day","review":"This is a most inspiring movie. Dennis Quaid does a great job as Jim Morris, a man with a second chance to achieve a dream.I was aware of Jim Morris when I read his story a week after what happens to be the end of the movie. It was an intriguing story, a man who is challenged by his High School baseball team in a small town to go after something he hoped for after he suggested they give their all for the game they played.It is a great story of a small town, small team, young man who is wandering. You learn a lot about Jim Morris and his life and you sense his desire to want to play again.The story will make you laugh, cry and cheer. This is a great movie for families and groups to watch. I have this as part of my library and will cherish the story of 'The Rookie.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"baseball season is here\\"","review":"In Disney's The Rookie, Dennis Quaid plays \\"Jim Morris.\\"He's loved baseball ever since he was a kid. He's moved from state to state. Finally, he arrives in Texas. Not a lot of people play baseball in Texas, so it is hard for him to fit in.As the years went on, he became a science teacher. He also was a coach for baseball. His players on the team always lose. He tells them that if they don't have dreams, they don't have anything. Then, they agreed that they would play if he would play baseball again. He then becomes one of the greatest athletes of all time.

It's kind of like two stories that are lamely put together. The first half of the movie was about his success in inspiring his high school baseball team to a winning season, and the second half was about his fulfilled dream of pitching in the ML.

It is one of the best family movies to sit down and see because of the inspiration and people could relate it to their lives. The movie is about a man in his late 30's and his team wants him to pursue a chance to pitch in the majors. At first he is not sure what to do but in the end he gives it a shot. While some people might think this movie is unrealistic a pitcher on the Phillies two years ago was 34 when he made his debuted. The movie does have a lot of emotional moments as you end up rooting for them to succeed. After going through the minor leagues and so many struggles he discovers his dream and gets his chance to pitch in the majors. It truly is an inspiration to anyone and says if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything that you want. 5 Star movie in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Story","review":"'The Rookie' is a story about a 30-something high school baseball coach getting a second shot at his dream to play major league baseball.Based upon the real life story of Jimmy Morris, Dennis Quaid does a superb job playing Morris. Jimmy is teaching chemistry and coaching on the side. He is leading a team that has done poorly for several years. He motivates them and strikes a bargain. They demand that he try out for the big leagues if they can win their district title. He agrees and the rest is history.This show is about doing one's best, chasing the dream, and life. It is inspirational and very well done. It is family friendly and can be enjoyed by all ages. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been better","review":"The movie is good..but when you read the book The Rookie aka The Oldest Rookie, the movie looks like fiction. Morris' dad was actually not that supportive of him at all and I thought it should have covered the resentment he got from some teammates. Disney's other sports films are better because they are more in-depth than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT FILM!","review":"This was probably the film I enjoyed the most in the last year. It is a wonderful and inspiring film and Dennis Quaid is at his best in the movie. It is great for anyone, or, the whole family can see it together...no problem. It has a great message in it and is worth 5 stars in my book. I cannot wait to buy the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching, Great, Feel-Good Flick","review":"I got to see a sneak preview of The Rookie in Dallas. I was really anticipating the release of this movie for a while, and was hoping it wouldn't [stink] like Pearl Harbor. Th movie is about a 37 year old man who always dreamed of being a major league pitcher. Today, he is a science teacher who coached the high school baseball team. He makes a bet with them: They win State, he tries out for the pros. They win, and he makes AA minors for D-Rays. He pitches so well, he makes it to the majors. The movie i a bit long, but all of it entertains you. Th acting is superb, the settings are very convincing, and the story-telling is very well done. If you are skeptical of seeing a G rated Disney movie, don't be. It is no less great to kids than it is adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"very inspiring","review":"We have enjoyed this video for many years now until we wore out the VHS and had to order the DVD of it. Dreams are what life is made of and Jim Morris has a dream of playing major league baseball as a pitcher. It takes him over 20 years and 4 surgeries but he does it.

Even the smart [aleck] kid is muted & pleasant. Dennis Quaid is very good in the title role. He prepared well & I could actually believe he could pitch a ball 98 mph.

I never had that problem with my genuine apple charger.Not all chargers are the same that are purchased under this review.

Through laptop speakers it is fine, but through headphones or external speakers it will generate a very annoying hum due to the fact that it is not a grounded power supply (it has a 2 prong plug rather than three). I record music and found it nearly impossible, as it would pick up the hum from the adapter. And because my battery is nearly depleted, I could only record for a few minutes at a time, recharge and then repeat. If you are thinking about this product, I would just rip up a $20 bill or buy a grounded, Apple authorized replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than nothing?","review":"Well, it's not the cutie lil charger that comes with the ibook, but it'll get you by for a little while, and when you have to replace it within six months you'll be glad you didn't pay $75 for the one on macstore, which lasts about the same amount of time. Honestly, when is someone going to figure out a way to make these LAST? This is my second replacement! The original died due to the flimsy little cable wearing clean through at the point where it bends away from the insertion tip, and the second just....died. Little blue light went out and that was it. Really, these things totally bite, so you might as well get the cheapest one you can, and before you spend your time on a mad search of eBay, macstore, etc. you should know there are only three or four different types out there, including the WAY too expensive original, and this really is the cheapest you'll find."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad customer service","review":"reall bad customer service.

I plugged this new adapter into my Apple G4 PowerBook, and it still didn't charge. Since I didn't want to bother with returning this cheap item (and I thought maybe it was the computer itself), I removed the connection at the end of the cord and compared it to my old adapter, which was already torn apart.This new adapter had half the amount of metal wire inside the cord as the Apple one, and it was in a different configuration.

The movie did fill the time and had some action but something about the flow of action was missing.I would rent it, but purchase might be a push.

He just didn't want the emotional response to overwhelm the intellectual response and remove the audience's capacity to judge the work objectively. In this play, we have a heroine who is not a heroine. We understand her, but we never empathize with her. Consequently, the interdependence of war and economy is illuminated without making the reader wallow in excessive emotion. Yes, we do feel strongly when Kattrin is beathing her drum, but that feeling is not what the audience leaves with at the end of the play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Response to Noah Lambert's review","review":"Brecht doesn't want emotion because that is Brechtian theater. He thought that in order for a play to invoke social change, it needed to be clear to the audience, that the audience needed to learn something. Emotions, Brecht felt, clog the mind and only feed the brain sentiment, not rational thought. Mother Courage and Her Children is, quite obviously, an anti-war play. Brecht wants you to see that war makes criminals out of everyone, even mothers. He wants you to love Mother Courage while you hate her so that the emotion is cancelled out and you are only left with the thoughts of her actions and why they were wrong. If you want a play to read or perform that is challenging, amazing, and intellectual all at once, this is the way to go. I performed this and I was forever changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring Play I have ever read.","review":"There is not a single passage of entertainment in this play, or anything even scarcely enjoyable about the reading experience. You will never finish it unless you are at all interested in the Thirty Years War.

In fact, if our baby pees in them more than once, its for sure going to wet through to his clothes. If he has any sort of bowel movement, then it's a complete mess. If you want to buy a cost-effective diaper consider those from Luvs. They have a leak guard guarantee and are somewhat cheaper than Pampers and Huggies.

The code and examples are all available online for the reader to down load and experiment with.The progress through the book seems well thoughtout and logical. It has clarified numerous questions about CSS that I could not find elsewhere. I can recommend this book to all beginners and middle-level users of CSS. It is probably too basic for truly advanced users. The one criticism that I have is that the book lacks color illustrations which sometimes makes it difficult to see the examples clearly.

She clearly explains all these examples. The 1st 2 chapters begin at an easy level, with basic styling, and she uses these as a basis for the more complex designs that follow.If you've read of the amount of work developers of web application servers like Plone put into their CSS design and wanted to understand their choices, this book will be a great aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy CSS: The Missing Manual instead of this","review":"CSS: The Missing Manual by David Sawyer McFarland is a much better book on correct usage of CSS, and is written by a much more respected author.

They fail to achieve any greater effect, and as you read on, you begin to smell the rat: the writer's inability to resolve narrative dilemmas, to develop any characters or even a voice that will cast a spell strong enough to warrant the narrative game-playing. The prose piles detail upon detail without finding its soul, and the writer has neither the intellectual heft nor insight of David Mitchell, nor the warmth and sensitivity of Haruki Murakami, both of whom seem to hover distantly above and beyond this book.

To say the least, this work is in it's infancy - at least if this book is any indication.If you're actually interested in Go, this book is not going to be much help. There are numerous alternative publications suitable for learning about the game. By the authors' own admission, virtually none of the \\"endgame positions\\" featured in this book would ever appear in a real game of Go played between humans with reasonable skill.I imagine the material is somewhat interesting, at least in the abstract sense, but I would not recommend it to anyone looking for more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting reading, but not worth of owning","review":"The title of the book should be understod literally. The book is not about 'last point' in sence of final argument to the topic, but really about which player, white or black gets the last point in Go game. This also means, that if you utilize all knowledge from this book either in your playing of Go or incorporate it into Go playing program, you at best score 2 points more territory in comparison to you opponent than without this knowledge. Reading this book is revealing in some sence, since it proves some 'common sence' assumptations wrong and gives some insights of mathematical handling of the Go, but the scope of the book is very limitted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undoubtedly","review":"the best DVD investment I have made.

The damage wrought by the shoulder-to-shoulder assaults of 1914 and the inflexible defensive tactics of 1914 through 1916 could not be undone by the stormtroop tactics and mobile defense of 1917 and 1918. The result was catastrophic defeat. The lessons are clear: encourage innovation; learn from the battlefield; don't wait for a new manual to change the way you fight. G.C. Wynne's mistitled \\"If Germany Attacks: The Battle in Depth in the West\\" is a good alternate to Dynamics of Doctrine, and Bruce Gudmundsson's \\"Stormtroop Tactics: Innovation in the German Army, 1914-1918\\" is an excellent and concise complement."},{"rating":"1","title":"More a travel guide than a work of fiction","review":"I kept waiting for something interesting to happen in this book but it never did.It was a pointless,boring narrative with poor,shallow characterisations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very moving story.","review":"This book is interesting from beginning to end -- a wonderful story that is very enjoyable to read. The perspective from which it is written (through the eyes of a five-year-old) enables us to see and experience life a little differently, and that is unique. It is well written, and the characters are all richly drawn and memorable. I found it to be touching, funny, sad in parts, and very moving. I read a lot of books, and have not come across such a strikingly good one in quite a while. I didn't want it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The eyes of a five year old","review":"\\"Hideous Kinky\\" is a superb book in two respects; firstly, in its narration. Permitting the reader to see the world through the eyes of a five year old is a rare treat at any given time, but when the world viewed is one as beautiful and exotic as Morroco, North Africa, the book becomes a modern classic. The second reason that I rate this book so highly is the storyline, and the issues it raises. Does the mother act in love or in selfishness, is the journey to Morrocco one of free will and love or a rash act of irresponsibilty? The reader will make his or her mind up, while treasuring the visions of North Africa through the eyes of a little girl"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Through the eyes of a child / You will learn how to see..\\"","review":"\\"Through the eyes of a child / You will learn how to see..\\"I saw the film when it opened at the Seven Gables last Friday.

The story concerns about an astronaut who travels back through time to realize an affair - very brief, indeed - with a woman he once glimpsed But the entire film except a brief shot, is narrated with the support of photographs and isolated shots. As a matter of fact it became a substantial reference to Terry Gilliam in his memorable \\"Twelve monkeys\\"Because the photograph does not create - like the art - the eternity, but embalms the time; limiting itself to subtract it to its own corruption."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Jet","review":"La JeteeBeautiful movie.

If you want to listen to one of its tracks just youtube it and you will know how good they are for a background music when you are working on some graphic design or software development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I love what Safri Duo has done, and have been hooked on them since I saw the music video for Samb Adagio.

With its dream-like but devastatingly accurate script, Fellini has poured into this movie everything he has learned about women... Awesome!Until now, fans of the movie had to make do with poor VHS tape transfers, since the film never made it into laserdisc. No more; happily, the new DVD anamorphic transfer is quite good! A must have for Fellini fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A backburner film that deserves new attention.","review":"The first viewing of this film left me wondering if I really had any idea of whether or not I had a point of reference to understand the dream states it was portraying. Being male, it took several more viewings to see that at least for me, it mimicked the male subconscious in an somewhat audacious manner.Although panned by fiminists at the time, seeing the film now should allow for the fact that the commonplace understanding of our psyche will out their arguments.What is displayed in this film really isn't up for comment. You either \\"get it\\" or you reject it. Seen with an open mind, this should impress you that the master Fillini has hit the nail on the head while swinging in his proverbial murky grayness.Buy it, see it, sleep on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible transfer","review":"This film is, like most reviewers seem to think, on of Fellini's greatest films. My first viewing was on vhs and I believe that the transfer on this dvd is worse. It is far and away the worst dvd I have, loaded with artifacting and all sorts of digital noise. Is it possible that I have recieved a poor copy, yes but not likely considering I traded it for another of the same film and they were identical as suspected. Alas, it should not deter the film lover from renting, or buying, this film for it is a masterpiece of film making."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Strada fan","review":"Beware. If you're looking for another La Strada or Nights of Cabiria (both 5 big stars), City of Women is not it; nor is it 8 1/2 or La Dolce Vita or Juliet of the Spirits (at least 4 stars each).

There is only one disadvantage that I can find; one of my tanks is a 42 gal bow front and the metal scraper does not swivel so it cannot maintain good contact on the bowed glass.

However, I never expected to enjoy it... This well written history is the first time I have been so close to the experience of the American Revolution since \\"Johnny Tremain\\". The struggles you just don't consider as a 21st century resident are strongly represented. Henry Melchoir Muhlenberg left his well-educated world in Germany to deal with an unstable and often unfriendly new world in Pennsylvania. He struggled to create the Lutheran church in America while raising his family and caring for a wife who suffered from seizures. His children went on to be extremely important men in history. Wonderful and important history which includes many notable figures (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Benedict Arnold, Alexander Hamilton, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Though used it wasn't clear it was a first edition from 1978. 8th edition is latest.","review":"Though used it wasn't clear it was a first edition from 1978. 8th edition is latest.

So much of this book is common sense, but when you see it in black and white it puts everything in perspective. This is a very good book, and reminds me a little of every woman I have ever met.

This is just a book of housecleaning and home organizing tips, although the author has seen fit to sprinkle in more than a liberal dose of adulation allegedly written by her adoring fans. And therein lies part of the problem: too much space dedicated to self-aggrandizing. If you want this type of thing, why buy the book? You can get it for free on her website, which by the way, also advertises a whole host of home organizing products, turning house-cleaning into a religious industry. In another culture, she'd have everyone screaming \\"Jihad on Clutter!\\" How does becoming so mindlessly sloganized help you get your life organized? With so many other books on this topic, it's a safe bet you could take a chance with any one of them and get a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!!","review":"I love this book and the FlyLady system.

IF YOU BUY ONLY ONE BOOK PURCHASE THIS ONE!! What makes this book so differant is the author lays out VERY managable step by step things you can put into practice in your life (not to mention she is very funny), I can tell she's been there. I feel as if she is right with me almost taking my hand (and although she can't do it for me) guiding me the whole way.

(Hint: If your doctor even tries to give you parts that he removed, just say no! You won't need them again -- I promise!)These are the elements you won't find in Sink Reflections, which is essentially a print version of the central parts of her Web site. The basic message is fine -- she breaks decluttering into 15-minute bites instead of turning it into an all-weekend bonanza of pain and frustration, plus she emphasizes the importance of having routines for keeping the home under control -- but the Web site does it far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomest book ever!!!","review":"I can say enough about Flylady and her great book.

Having lived in the same home for 20 years, these last two years since her book have changed my life, allowed me to live peacefully, and freed me from guilt, procrastination, and inefficiency. Just the \\"you can do anything for 15 minutes\\" was enough to warrant purchasing the book.Please consider purchasing Leanne Ely's book \\"Saving Dinner\\" along with it; absolutely a ONE-TWO punch for anyone in charge of a home.These two books taught me how to keep my housework manageable and put a nutritious, easy meal on the table every night while saving money, time, and my self-esteem.

It's interesting to me that the book doesn't tell you how to change your life, just to put on your shoes every morning! This is not a literary masterpiece or a new interpretation of The New Testament. It was written by an ordinary woman, with ordindary life problems that can be overwhelming. There are some recognizable catchwords and familiar philosphies, but it is her application of those principals in a way that nearly anyone human can relate to without shame, guilt or any of those other feelings that come with ordinary, human shortcomings. The surprise here is that the book demonstrates a way to relate to your children as an example about work, self-love, family, and community life in a positive, life affirming, \\"we're just learning\\", \\"we all make mistakes\\", \\"today's a new day\\" way.

Most of the reviews giving this book/system less than five stars (and/or five exclamation points in the all-caps title) reflect many of my thoughts on this book--the treacly homespun attitude, the annoying religious references, the inability of Ms. Cilley to accept differing opinions (when I once disagreed with her, it was the subject of her next mass mailing), the demands to wear shoes in the house (sorry, not gonna do it), etc. For me, the negative outweighs the positive, and there are plenty of other books out there with essentially the same advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE of Shrill, Mean, Preachy Tone: Yes, Exactly!","review":"I deliberately \\"borrowed\\" the title of my review for this book, because I completely agreed with another reader who noted that the \\"tone\\" of the book comes across both as preachy (with some suspect religious overtones) and shrill. Worse, there are times when the author seems to berate the reader, and this is where the \\"mean\\" designation comes in.What about the rest of the content? Well, if you really need a book to tell you to empty your trash and clean your sink, then I guess this might be the book for you. But for this reader, that info. was just a little TOO basic.I would have preferred some organizing tips that addressed concerns for working women, women with un-cooperative husbands, etc. (It seems all the women who are \\"flybabies\\" have DH's, aka: Darling Husbands.)As another reader noted, the book seemed to be aimed at those who are very depressed, and need daily motivation to just get dressed and get moving.[...]Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has changed my life!!!","review":"Marla Cilley (The Flylady) has written a book that is slowly changing my life. This book not only gives tips for house cleaning and getting organized, it is about changing your life style to avoid chaos (can't have anyone over syndrome). I can honestly say that this book is one of the best that I have ever read. Many say that to lose weight, you must change your life style. This book has changed my attitude about house cleaning, parenting, relationships, work habits, and more than I can go into here. I wish that I could give this book a hundred stars, it deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"This is a wonderful book!

I was expecting nature that would be at least seasonally inspired. This is pretty amateur footage also. On the flip side if you close your eyes the music sound good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great games but:","review":"With Quake 1 and it's mission packs it spoke of an incidious villen named QUAKE that had to be crushed to save humanity. It was an amazing hellish story. Why did they drop that and pick up with the \\"Strong Invasion\\" thing. I mean Quake 2 is an awesome game no doubt, but it shouldn't have been Quake 2. Quake 1 had the coolest story ever second only to DOOM. Which makes me also wonder why the hell did they change the amazing monsters in the DOOM/DOOM II/Final Doom storyline and go with the new retarded monsters in DOOM III? DOOM III and Quake III & IV are good but will never match the terror, funfactor, mystery and down right joy of the origional DOOM & Quake games.The 5 Stars is for Quake 1"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am annoyed by characters like this","review":"It is not amusing and I don't admire people who think they know more than authorities and withhold materials and information that are germane to an investigation because they think they are smarter than the police or other authorities.Perhaps it makes for a longer story but it simply annoys me. I bought two stories by this author. Read the first one all the way through thinking that it would get better but was disappointed in the end.The second one (this title) I managed to get through half way and gave up because yet again the protagonist held back information that would have averted much of the damage to other people.I won't buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Popstars AGAIN?","review":"Most people are getting sick and tired of ideas being used up over and over and over.. First it was \\"Making the Band\\" then \\"Popstars\\" and now \\"Popstars 2.\\" What's next? \\"ROCK BAND?\\" I like the music, but pop music is so over played that i think this band Scene 23 will get nowhere near NSYNC. Though their music might be popular for a few weeks, it will only last as a One hit wonder. This album, i would say, rank 7 out of 10.. They really lack the music originality and group individuality. But more or less.. Good Luck to SCENE 23 as they become another teen pop group.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Popstars? Ha!","review":"To call this band, \\"Scene 23,\\" popstars, is like calling brussel sprouts delicious. They just aren't. All of the songs are bad, except \\"The Greatest,\\" which I would like, except for S Club 7 were the original singers of it. There are only 6 original songs, not counting the intro and \\"The Greatest,\\" and they all sound the same, and all lack the \\"bang\\" you need to have a hit. I can see why they didn't release a complete album. The world couldn't handle an entire Scene 23 CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scene23 Hottest Band Now","review":"Well I watched the Popstars show all season and was sad to see it go .When I found out they were making a cd I had to find out when it was coming out so I watched the show really careful. So when it came out I camped out at the Meijers I live near to get it. They are a awsome group and I love Josh."},{"rating":"2","title":"~*They are great!*~","review":"I think Scene 23 is a really good band! They are wonderful singers and great dancers. I love singing and I like to sing along with their songs because they have a good beat! I also really enjoy their show and I think it teaches you a lot of new things! I really enjoy listening to Scene 23's cd. and I think everyone else should too! I think That everyone should buy their new album because it is the greatest! I would rate Scene 23 way more than 5 stars! I love all of them!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Joke!!!","review":"Ok first off when you look at the track listings you normaly count the number of songs, right?? Yea, well this one says that they sing 8 of the 14 songs on the CD and the other 6 are by other original artists. Ok well the truth is that they, Scene 23, only sings 7 songs track # 1 is a bunch of different people saying \\"Popstar\\" as for the other 6 songs by original artists 3 of those tracks (#9, #11, #14) are just clips from the show, it's just a bunch of space filler. Don't by this cd, my advice get a copy of the CD from someone who was dumb enough to go out and spend money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Stars 2 Introducing Scene 23 Results","review":"This CD is really good. I liked the T.V. show, and I thought I would buy the CD, and it turned out it was well worth my money. Mostly all of the songs are good. The only one I'm not to crazy about is All This Love. The Popstar Experience songs are good too. I really like I Believe I Can Fly and I Wanna Know. I'm not to fond of I Still Believe though. I think that the Inturludes give the CD a nice touch, and I enjoy listening to them. My favorite songs on the album are I Really Don't Think So and He Said She Said. Overall I think you should buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, Not the best","review":"I did like the songs, but not all of them were from Scene 23. Only 7 of 14 were their songs. The rest were interludes or songs from their audition (which were not sung by them). My favorite song is \\"HE SAID SHE SAID\\". Again, it's ok, but it might not be worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"First of all, how insulting that they didn't even give us an entire album. Instead they gave us only seven tracks that are sung by Scene 23. Four of the tracks aren't even music but are clips of people talking from the show, and the final three tracks are R. Kelly's \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\", Mariah Carey's \\"I Still Believe\\", and Joe's \\"I Wanna Know\\". Shame, shame. Generic dance beats plague all seven tracks by Scene 23 and weak and uninteresting vocals bleed through unexciting songs. The only potentially good song on this album is \\"The Greatest\\" and that's because it has a salvageable chorus. The rest are just overproduced, dreary filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scene 23","review":"I saw Scene 23 First on Popstar 2, and I was immediately hooked. I went out and bought their CD, and it was really, really cool. Their video \\"I Really Don't Think So\\" was really amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it BE any Worse?","review":"Ok, Pop Stars reality show? LAME. The only good music reality show was Making the Band... and even that got lame in its third season. If you buy this CD, I am sorry for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is not That Good","review":"This CD is not that good. The \\"Only\\" good song is \\"I Wanna Know\\" By Joe. This CD is stupid and dumb. It's like they had to make the scene 23 CD. You cannot buy it. \\"SO DON'T BUY IT LIKE\\" I I SAID!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Bad CD","review":"This CD overall isn't that bad. I was a bit dissapointed that they only had 7 tracks from them but i think Scene 23 will make it big. This group has a lot of talent. I watched the tv show Popstars 2 and these 5 guys have worked really hard and really deserve it. It's an awesome cd... the lyrics aren't bad(like swearing and stuff) and the music has a catchy tune to it. It's something that people who like N'Sync, Christina Aguilera, and etc. would like a lot. I'd rate this cd 4.5/ 5 stars. It's a pretty good cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"popstars yeah o.k !","review":"when i first started watching the show they seemed like a pretty good group so when the c.d came i knew i had to have it.the over all it was a pretty good c.d but it disappointed me to find out that they only had like 7 orignal songs on there and the others were all by different artist.if you don't mind only a few songs by them then i say go out and buy it but if you don't than save your money on a artist that won't let you down on their first c.d"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cassette","review":"I watched the show last night and decided that I wanted to get the cassette and one for my sister also. Seeing as they have discriminated against us people who do not HAVE a cd player, I guess there's 2 that won't be sold. Too bad they don't wan t to appeal to ALL audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"[Imitations]!","review":"None of these songs are actually theirs- \\"I really don't think so\\" is a song fromn K-0tic, another UK pop stars group, \\"the greatest\\" is an S Club 7 group- why they haven't even given this band their own songs- they seem talented enough, but they're just basically like every other pop group. The end. If you're looking for some good \\"pop\\" music where a band sings their own songs, try eden's crush or s club 7 or something. I know this is a pretty [weak] review, but I just wanted to say that."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd is so lame","review":"this scene 23 cd ... i thought they would be kinda good but boy was i wrong i think the only good song is the greatest thats the only good song"},{"rating":"1","title":"*Yawn*","review":"Okay, one word: BOOOOOOOOOOOORING!!!!!

If you value \\"family friendly\\" (whatever that means) above all else and if you're willing to park your brain at the door you might enjoy this one. The script is juvenile if not plain bad.

As an adoptive parent, I was especially insulted by the idea that for this couple to arrive at the idea of creating a family through adoption, they had to have this bizarre, supernatural experience of literally having a \\"home grown\\" kid first. It had such an unbelievable plot and pathetic dialogue, and weak characters. It was so bad that I had to watch until the end to see if it could somehow redeem itself. This was the biggest waste of Disney dollars I've ever encountered, and I'm not sure how such a weak story made it to the point of wasting millions of dollars to make a weak movie. The only redeeming quality I could find was it was visually beautiful, but even that does not make it worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This was not what I expected literally. The two scenes in the trailer that made me want to see this film were not in the film at all. Other than that ridiculousness, the movie was just okay.

The rest of the cast are mean-spirited this side of South Park. The screenplay is clumsy and unrealistic. In-fact,the way they make a kid is sick,twisted and of course,unrealistic. Frankenstein,Creepy Crawlers,Weird Science and even Milton the Monster had more realistic and sane ways of making people. The only good things about this film are the acting is pretty good and it knows what it wants to say(unlike Drop Dead Fred) but doesn't know how to say it correctly. Like Pagemaster,it's a noble cause but a failed delivery. I give this movie a 1 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely AWFUL!","review":"This movie was horrendous!

I've seen much much better movies...I didn't \\"hate\\" it, so I gave it two stars, but I wouldn't even watch it on cable again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"Good for my kids and their grandlparents, too. Quite enjoyable. Emphasizes the true meaning and true value of family and family relations."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"what a cute little gem of a movie\\"","review":"this movie was so adorable and the kid actor did a great job and the parents were wonderful and it was just a wonderful little warm feeling movie! it's a buyer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Odd Life of Timothy Green, one of the best underated films of 2012","review":"Disney has created a original concept feel good film for the whole family maybe not so much due to the subject matter that the film has starts off with an original plot turns out after Timothy Green's first leave falls off, you can figure out where the film's twist ends up even more emotional than expected and it's has been a modest success for Disney despite being released against Paranorman and The Expendables 2 at the box office and held pretty well at $51 million to date now getting a dvd and blu-ray release just in time for Christmas to get this extremely underated family film from Disney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family Movie","review":"Excelnte movie that explains how the children reinforce the strength of a marriage and the adoption of a child as an alternative to infertility"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Flick!","review":"Santa delivered this movie to our 8-year-old. She selected it as a Family Movie Night pick over the holiday break. The entire family enjoyed it. I even caught my teenager shedding a tear at the end. Only one concern: some of the scenes were quite dark--not in the figural sense. Literally, the movie was filmed without a lot of light in some scenes. I'm sure this was for dramatic effect, but it was difficult for \\"old\\" eyes to see what was going on in certain shots. Great movie overall!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"sweet movie. It had a happy ending and it is definatily worth watching. Fairy tales do come true in this cute movie. It something for all ages that the whole family can enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical!","review":"Loved this movie, it was beautiful and kind. I don't see many movies these days because there is so much violence, nudity, and language. I rented it and watched it two times and now I will be adding it to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good wholesome movie","review":"I like Jennifer Garner and she was a big draw for me to check out this movie. The trailers when it first came out also seemed interesting to me. It was well worth watching with a message of hope and redemption. It has a bitter sweet ending and is a bit of a tear jerker. I am pleased that I took the time to watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was so hoping this would be whimsical and sweet, like my favorite movie, Big Fish. Instead it is choppy, and leads to many \\" whaaat?\\" moments. You could drive a semi through the plot, and I usually am ok with the willing suspension of disbelief. The weird girlfriend who tries to kiss ( ewww this kid is like, 8 ) Timothy is just creepy. No info is offered about her, as a matter of fact few characters are at all likeable. Jen Garner tries very hard, and she is the only glimmer of ok here. so sad, this movie could have rocked. Save yourself some cash, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Absolutely loved this movie! Definitely a \\"feel-good\\" movie! I would recommend this movie to everyone. I would watch it again myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paid extra for HD quality of picture was terrible!","review":"Really enjoyed the movie. But the Picture quality was terrible. It was like watching a movie on Dish satellite. blurry images. Not worth the extra money for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"This moving never kicked in","review":"It's not that the movie was bad just that the story line just never made sense. Things didnt flow right."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like","review":"we didn't like this movie. thought it was going to be something different about the boy and it turned out to be about a couple who we desperate for a child of their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as interesting as it sounds","review":"This movie is trying really hard to be that kind of movie that mixes whimsy and real emotion to create something meaningful. But it's forced and it fails, it's also slow and repetitive. The story fails to really ever draw the audience in, things that were clearly meant to be good moments are tacked on and don't mesh with anything that happens before or after, and the acting is unconvincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BARELY ENTERTAINING-MOSTLY IRRITATING","review":"Unfortunately, this film fails to make the fantastical notion of a pre-teen boy emerging from a backyard garden to teach two childless thirty-somethings all they need to know about qualifying as adoptive parents entertaining or enlightening. Never really develops either a sense of magic or invites our willingness to \\"suspend disbelief.\\"The amazed parents are mostly irritating in their efforts to understand and protect this child as he interacts with his disciplined, highly motivated, over achieving cousins and their driven mother, his bullying school chums, a cold apparently \\"old maid\\" town matron, or a skeptical soccer coach. The movie exhibits a better touch in the subplot of the \\"budding\\" Timothy and a prospective candidate for his first crush. I never really understood how he managed to actually motivate any changes to his various antagonists.For the record I am generally not irritated by this type of movie and wanted Timothy's \\"odd life\\" to be so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Sound ...... Bad Feed from your company","review":"There was NO Sound.....something wrong with your feed. I watched other movies that night but could not get sound with yours. Please refund my money and hopefully I will get sound the next time I want to see a movie. I want to see this movie......should I try again?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I watched the movie but it was not endearing or even close to be a family movie except for the rating. Kids would not enjoy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they make such movies","review":"Why do they make such movies.Horrible to watch and a waste of time. Produced just to fill the kid-movie slot for an opening week"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid.","review":"Worst. Movie. Ever. Only has a star because I had to. I can't believe any other review was given. Cliche, boring and utterly ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd Life, but good","review":"This movie was definitely different....a little far fetched, but really good and entertaining! I liked this odd life of Timothy Green."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better if our internet speed was higher, but cute movie for the family!","review":"Cute story for the family! We enjoyed it although it was difficult to watch on our monitor since we have slow internet speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"the odd life of timothy green","review":"cute movie, good for a family night movie had a great story line. and a great cast of stars who made this story seem believable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family movie","review":"This was a very good family movie with no cussing, nudity or crudeness. It is very rare to find a movie like this these days that the whole family of all ages can enjoy. We loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good show","review":"Very heartwarming movie. Just a nice family movie with no bad language or vulgarity, a rarity in todays film making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"My whole family loves this movie! I will watch it again one of these days. It makes you laugh and it makes you cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different...very nice family movie!","review":"This was totally different from what i expected, based on the trailers. However, it was also much better and sweeter than I expected. Very pleasantly surprised. Wonderful family film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Under the Sun here.","review":"Would not have bought this movie if I would have seen it first...poignant, yes, but nothing really new, a bit \\"weak\\" I guess I would say. I own it but I don't think I would care if I ever watched it again. I didn't hate it, I just didn't love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Different","review":"To me this was a strange movie that was hard to figure out. It was just too hard to imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute but predictable","review":"This was a cute movie that moved at good pace. Not your typical \\"happily ever after\\" film but unique story. It was very predictable but kids will Ike it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring a little elf home and your life turns for the better...","review":"Timothy Green is a sweet boy who brings joy into peoples life, opens eyes for the unbelieving and makes the true believers happy during the little time he spends with his adopted parents in this world. Nice entertainment, you'll shed a couple of tears watching this one and - even though the happy ending has some bitter notes to it - a good movie to watch with the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD","review":"This was a really cute movie, one the whole family can watch and learn from.Would definitely recommend it.Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, poor execution","review":"The story line is interesting enough, but it was just flat. Most characters were one-dimensional, either \\"good\\" or \\"evil.\\" I was bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K. Movie for lighter fare.","review":"O.K. movie if you want something mellow to watch with spouse or girlfriend. Not much of a \\"guy's movie\\". Decent to watch when you want to watch a \\"heartwarming\\" type drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Odd Life of Timothy","review":"The Odd Life of TimothyThis is a movie the whole family can watch, teaches us many lessons. I hope you all enjoy it as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed","review":"My 17 year old daughter liked it but my 66 year old mother would have given it only 2 stars. She thought it was boring"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Odd Life of Timothy Green","review":"This was such a good movie! It didn't get enough exposure during awards season. Love a movie that can make you laugh and Cretans can completely enthrall you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-warming and witty","review":"I really liked this movie. I was afraid I wouldn't, that it would be sappy and emotionally manipulative. It definitely had potential to be that way, but it was refreshing and sweet without being saccharine. I liked Timothy. I liked his \\"parents,\\" and related to their protectiveness, their awe at this boy's existence (I often feel that way about my own kids). I loved the device of the story being revealed as they told their caseworker why they were ready to adopt a baby. Lovely, enjoyable and unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was a Christmas Gift.","review":"It arrived in perfect condition and we sent it as a Christmas gift. They called us and said it was very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful family movie","review":"This movie is heartwarming & extremely touching! Even my children thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and touching","review":"A very sweet and touching movie. Sure it's a fantasy, but if you employ your \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\", you will enjoy it immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"What a wonderfully fun, feel good movie!! The whole family enjoyed it. Just wish they made more like this! Wish we hadn't waited so long to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensible, nice movie","review":"This movie is viewable by the entire family. It relates a delicate story about being different employing minimally fantastic characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda borring","review":"Short story not really much substance to the whole movie.

Kept my interest through entire movie.","review":"I really do Love this kind of Movie, although wish there could have been more to watch before it ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Interesting, touching, imaginative movie. This movie is touching...can bring tears to your face. It also shows how are wishes that come true don't always turn out as we would have controlled it. Those things in the movie have funny consequences.There are quite a few relationship spinners in the movie. I liked it and would watch it again in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I really liked the movie, very cute and endearing! Highly recommend!

I failed to find a message, if it was supposed to have one. Just a time pass..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family movie!","review":"We really enjoyed watching this movie as a family. It was very different than we expected but also uplifting. I would recommend this as a family movie night pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"incredibly weak script","review":"incredibly weak script. overacting. incredible amount of missed opportunities to connect with a bigger message. often felt like actors are trying trying to do the job of the scriptwriter and the director."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet story for family viewing","review":"Not a big rave, but a nice story about a couple wanting to do their best at parenting, getting the boy of their dreams with some surprises in fulfillment of their hopes and aspirations. Humorous lines here and there. I enjoyed seeing the parents wanting to give full support and make possible their \\"son's\\" dreams. Beautiful background music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I Expected","review":"This is a strange and touching tale about two childless people who find happiness through a gift of love from a most unexpected source. The story line is totally unpredictable and thoroughly entertaining. If you are prepared to accept some really unusual story elements in this fantasy you'll be handsomely rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Odd Life","review":"Very cute and very sweet movie. A good reminder about living in the present and enjoying what you have each day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A feel good movie","review":"The story line is a bit odd, but the movie flows really good.
