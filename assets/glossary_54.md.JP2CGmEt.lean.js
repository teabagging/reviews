The new edition is cheaper and must have omitted The Little Red Hen (which is why she no longer appears on the cover) as well as other stories I'm not yet sure of.

(Illustrated by John Steptoe.) It was interesting how Adoff writes from the perspective of a girl. With such strong sentiments, I couldn't help but wonder if there is any relation to his own life or that of someone he knows. I have read other poetry books by Adoff, and this was one of my favorites. In \\"I am making a circle for my self,\\" I enjoyed the references to Golda Meir and Moses. In \\"The way I see any hope for later,\\" Adoff powerfully addresses issues of race and gender, saying that we need to \\"stop looking\\" and \\"start loving.\\" What a powerful poem! Even the layout of the words adds to the effect. \\"Remember:\\" makes an interesting reference to the fact that way back when there was only one race--a fact that makes one wonder how we ever became so divided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the glass","review":"Looks and performs as expected, although the glass was a bit smaller than expected.

This is the second book in his Victorian series starring Sergeant Cribb and the long suffering Constable Thackery. Mr. Lovesey recreates the Victorian atmosphere very accurately. And this is a new form of English cozy crime. Mr. Lovesey seems to want to delve into the Victorian sports era. This particular book is about \\"knuckle fighting\\" without the mittens as they call it. There was a huge following of this sport in England at this time despite the fact that even watching was illegal. We get right into the whole area and learn all about the clothes, the gear and the lingo. On top of that it's a cracking good thriller. I certainly intend to read more in this series.

(I spent several months among the Shuar many years ago.) As an example, Nunkui is the spirit of Earth when referred to as a living being, but the author refers to Nunkui as \\"a female crop fairy.\\" Even if one does not speak Shuar, the relationship of the word \\"Nunkui\\" to the word \\"Nunka\\" (land or territory) should be obvious.

In the months that followed I read every non-secular grief book that I could find. Attig's was definitely the most helpful book I came across. It repeatedly enforced the point that things had changed beyond my control. It also then pointed out to me what I still had some control over. At a time when I was lost and feeling rather helpless it did a great job of showing me how I wasn't helpless. I gained a lot of motivation for facing the challanges ahead of me from Attig's book, I recommend it to others who's lives have been turned upside down from grief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Stories, Less Powerful Commentary","review":"Thomas Attig, a former professor of philosophy and recent past-president of the Association for Death Education and Counseling, would like us to believe that he has introduced a new approach to the world of grief counseling, the idea of \\"relearning the world\\" after loss. One feels like the target of a salesman as the author repeatedly seeks to convince us why his approach to grief work is unique. The more powerful portions of the book are the real-life stories of grieving that are used to illustrate the ways in which we grieve.It's not that Attig's ideas are off-track or even disputable, but rather that they are not revolutionary. They have been addressed by other writers, though without a catchy name being applied. More importantly, the process of \\"relearning the world\\" has been experienced by all who have suffered the debilitating loss of a loved one and eventually found their way back to a life worth living"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen","review":"I recently had the chance of attending to a live performance of Sabores, in Sydney.

Like its magical studio cousin, Gidget, it is deceptively simple, almost amateurish by today's standards. Two boyish surfers follow the sun and summer around the world, surfing exotic shores, mixing with locals. Bruce Brown overdubs with a sweet voice and just-this-side-of-corny narration set to his competent 16mm photography. But, like many masterpieces, it is larger than the sum of its parts---much larger. From the now famous poster image of silhouetted surfers against the backdrop of the beach's infinite horizon to the plain and lilting surf guitar of the theme music, Endless Summer has become not only an evocation of surfing's enchanting allure, but a cultural touchstone of the 60's as well and, for a couple of generations since, the sweet memory of youth itself---endless, adventurous and warm."},{"rating":"1","title":"DAMAGED used DVD!!!","review":"Purchased our first used DVD from Amazon and it was scratched so badly it could not even be watched!

The actual movie, however, is quite lame. The narration has dated badly. The first half, when the two teen surfers are in Africa, is non-PC in the extreme. Nowhere do they speak. The film is entirely narrated by Bruce Brown, who is seen in a few short clips of surfers. The soundtrack of surf music is one of the highpoints. The film ignores surfing in S. America, the Carribean, the Mediterranean and much of the southern Pacific. We never find out who financed their global excursion, nor anything else about them at all. Therefore, we don't really care about their search for the 'perfect' wave. A rather trivial film, but still charming as a period piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has been 6 weeks and it still has not arrived.","review":"The movie is awesome.

The first one I bought: one of the bars was threaded incorrectly, so it wouldn't screw onto the white piece. The second one: once put together, I hung on the door but now the door won't shut due to the top part that goes over the door is not laying flat. Besides that, I also don't like the back of the rack, I have only hung the rack on the door long enough for one shower (with the door open since it won't shut with it on there) and it has scratched up our door.I guess I am still on the hunt for a good over the door towel rack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great fit","review":"I guess our towels are too big and our door is too small..

Great concept but needs to be wider both ways. (g's wifey)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chrome Over-Door Towel Holder","review":"The item arrived as quickly as usual. A very sturdy and good looking holder, not a light weight. It fits over our extreme wide doors without a problem.

It's small. If a towel is folded, it will fit over one of the bars. However, if you want to throw a wet towel on one of the bars to dry, the bar is not wide enough to accomodate it. There are three bars and they are very close together. This just isn't designed very well. It's quite compact. The over-the-door hooks are too wide to fit a standard door as well. There are holes on the back on the hooks, but even if you chose to screw the rack into your door, there would still be a gap. My door won't close all the way with this rack on it. Maybe others won't have this problem, but it's certainly an issue for me. I'm going to continue the search for an over-the-door towel rack that actually accomodates towels. This one is far too small to be of any use."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous fit","review":"Other than being surprisingly small, it's a nice towel bar... until you try to fit it over a door. The square hooks are gigantic, about two inches deep, which would be great if wanted to hang your towels on the front door.

Don't buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Forgettable","review":"Save your money and don't buy this book at the hardcover price. It's not worth it. There's nothing wrong with it but it's clear that Balogh is losing her voice and inspiration: the result is a bland book that's totally forgettable. The hero is just another washed down version of Wulfric (complete with internal monologues about unsuitable behaviour and the now famous love/in love thing) and the heroine is very very annoying. Add to that the fact that it reads like an overpadded traditional Regency and the author's lost me by page 150. I forced myself to finish it, hoping it would improve, and, well, it didn't. The hero and heroine are thrust together in the worst contrived manner possible and I'm still wondering what the hero saw in the heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, too repetitive, not Mary's best","review":"I borrowed the book from my sister after she had read it. I asked her how she liked it and she just shrugged, like she didn't know what to say. We are both Balogh fans. I went ahead and read it but I have to admit I skipped a lot. The 'big misunderstanding' turned out to be so stupid, my reaction was \\"Is that all??\\" The hero kept asking the heroine the same thing and she kept telling him the same answer. It was boring. If you cut about 100 pages out of this book, it might have been good. I got the feeling that to justify the price of a hard cover book, either the publisher, Ms. Balogh or both thought it had to be so many pages long, even if the story didn't need that many. I expected more from Ms. Balogh. I'm also really glad I didn't pay for this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Forgettable","review":"Allow me to preface my review by saying that Mary Balogh is one of my favorite authors. I have been reading her romance novels for ages, and I usually enjoy them very much. Therefore, I was quite disappointed to read this, the first book in her new series. In a word, it was tedious. I can't quite put my finger on exactly what's wrong, but I'll try. For starters, it was about 150 pages too long. I felt that it dragged on...and on...and on. I also felt that the character development was non-existent. Lucius and Frances, the main characters in the book, were so one-dimensional. And boring. (I was surprised, as Mary Balogh usually does a great job in creating characters who have distinct and engaging personalities.) I hope Lucius and Frances don't reappear in future novels. In essence, Simply Unforgettable was a disappointing and tedious read. I guess even our favorite authors can fail us once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extermely satisfied...","review":"This book was wonderful.

This is the first book I have ever read by Mary Balogh, so I didn't know what to expect. In the first few chapters, I was like WOW! What a refreshing change of pace from all other romance books! The author is actually going to allow these characters to have a smoldering, passionate romance with no misunderstandings, etc. Then what happened? Same ole, same ole. As soon as the first passionate encounter ends, this book turns into the same ole storyline as all other romance books. I was interesting enough to keep me turning the pages, so I did give it 4 stars, but I was so disappointed in the fact that I thought I had found a refreshing change when in fact it is just like any number of thousands out there.Here is the storyline as well as 99% of all other romance books -Boy meets girl.

I have read all of the Bedwyn family books by Mary Balough (and liked them all very much) and bought this one on name alone. I won't do that again.

Would be nice if the company offered a delux set with all the nice masks, gloves, cape and belts vs needed to buy 3 sets from the same manufacturer just to get the right look.My suggestion is get the muscle holloween costume and get this belt.

He loves it now. Bat tip. Pick a closet and hang a dark sheet down in the open doorway with a flashlight on in the closet. Then line up a few chairs with a sheet over them connecting to the closet entrance. Then hang a Batman costume with the Bat Belt and mask in the closet. Set some music playing from the first Batman movie. 1990. My son crawls through the chairs like a batcave entrance to find his costume waiting for him in the closet.

Major Crisp tells it like it was- the humor and the sadness. He daringly retells his own combat decisions and the results (which are not always flattering to himself).

Weak Close","review":"For the first 250 pages, I thought that Follet had matched his earlier spy masterpiece, \\"Eye of the Needle.\\" The tale was well crafted, the atmosphere of wartime Cairo was well described and the strained relations between the Arabs and the occupying British were explored in reasonable depth.Unfortunately, the final hundred pages were a let down. It was almost as if Follet asked a junior writer to come in and mop up. The pace became hurried, and the dialogue became stilted. Even John Grisham closes his novels better than this.Despite the sloppy close, however, this was still a very enjoyable novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one, but not Follett's best","review":"This was a great spy novel, although not on par with The Eye of the Needle. I have a couple of major criticisms for this novel. 1) The hot-n-heavy sex scenes. I know that this is a major way in which Follett departs from peers like Tom Clancy and Jack Higgins, and therefore is a reason for Follett's specific (yet expansive) readership. Not that I find the description of sex offensive; I think the stories would be better off if those things were left to the imagination.2) The 'cat & mouse' game at the end of the book between Wolff and Vandam. I won't give away any of the major plot developments, but there was several times in the last 50 pages or so when I found myself saying \\"Just pull your gun and arrest 'im already!\\"As you can see, however, I thought the book was good enough to merit 4 stars.

Pillars of the Earth was the first and my favorite. This, while not as great as Pillars, is still a very entertaining read.One thing I enjoy about his books is how he can use real events in history and real places in the world and weave them into his stories. The history doesn't overpower the underlying story though. At times you can think that you're reading an actual account of someone who was there, going through what the characters go through.With very deep and true to life characters and a villain you love to hate, you can't go wrong.

The problem with a lot of spy novels (and police novels as well) is that the bad guys are smarter in the beginning and the good guys are smarter at the end (or the bad buys shoot better at the beginning and the good guys shoot better at the end). Makes the outcome less fulfilling, and that is the case here. Didn't find myself identifying with our hero, and our bad guy starts out smart and ruthless, but does not maintain those qualities throughout.Thought the sex scenes contrived, the method they used to extract information from the British officer somewhat silly (let's hide in the closet, sneak out, blah, blah, and of course he will not suspect anythings up, and will take the top secret documents with him).All in all, I enjoyed reading it, but there are better books on Follett's shelf (Eye), and better books in the genre by others as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak replay of 'Needle'","review":"Too much I didn't understand in this novel.

I think it's a good toy for babies about 9 months old for the color and sound stimulation, but not for children very much older than that. I agree with one review that it's mostly just a rattle. You have to shake it pretty hard to make it \\"giggle\\". Otherwise, the giggle noise is very slow and sad sounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cute, but kids just aren't interested!","review":"I thought this toy looked fun but my daughter played with it for a few minutes and then didn't pick it up again.

It's currently sitting in a 'give away' box (looks new!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flop","review":"I bought the Giggle Ball for my son when he was 7 months old. He loved the bead toys at the doctor's office, so I thought this toy might be a hit. Wrong...my son had no interest in playing with it, despite my repeated attempts. I have a few guesses why the toy was such a flop:-It's a bit heavy and bulky for a little one to hold onto.-The beads aren't the easiest to move around the wires, because theres not much space to move your hand around the toy.-It's very difficult to get the toy to \\"giggle\\", and when you do succeed, you can barely hear the sound it makes (not a giggle).Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute toy","review":"This toy is very pretty and it looked like it would be a great toy, but it really isnt. The giggle sound is practically non-existant, and you have to shake it REALLY HARD in order to hear it. When my daughter was younger, it seemed hard for her to carry around, its heavy! This toy didnt seem to hold her interest for long, but its been thrown around a LOT and its still in one piece!!

I can see why it might not be fun for an older baby but I definitely recommend this toy as a first toy for younger babies. I wouldn't call it just a rattle, it's more interactive and holds babies attentions much longer. Rattles don't interest my son in the slightest but the giggle ball makes him laugh and laugh.

He is now 2 years old and has never played with it. To hear the giggle you have to shake it a certain way and my son doesn't have the patience for that as i am sure most toddlers do not. It seems durable enough but then again i wouldn't really know since it is never played with.

The blade cups or dishes when it gets warm making it impossible to make a straight cut without burning. I suspect they have made it too thin. Since the Saw Boss has plenty of power for a wider kerf blade and framing lumber is not all that precious, nothing is gained by the extra thin blade and much has been lost.

This is extremely annoying since the dialog and subtitles do not match and I hate watching anime in english in the first place. I will be returning this and if possible I will get another copy to see if it was just a problem with that disc (though I have never experienced anything like this with any DVD or BD).

A telling mark is the fact that Wade dedicated the book to his \\"Radical Republican\\" grandmother. Wade glosses over the horrors inflicted upon the White population of the South during the reconstruction, choosing instead to do everything but pin knighthoods on the carpetbaggers, scalawags, Yankee imperialists and their negro henchmen. Klans of later decades don't fair much better as Wade manages to portray them as either idiot yahoos or psychotics. Wade neglects to mention the many good deeds of the Klan and fails to differentiate between activity of legitimate members of the Invisible Empire and that of criminals hiding behind the orders hoods. Wade is a propagandist of the worst kind and, if there were any justice in the world, he'd be tarred and feathered and hung."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, and very informative","review":"I bought this book before visiting Colombia with my wife's family 3 years ago. It provided a fascinating historical background to our trip, especially when we visited the ancient lake of Guatavita, where much of the El Dorado legend is believed to have originated. There is a dearth of any guide books on Colombia (decades of war and unrest will do that) - the Lonely Planet guide being an exception, although the editor forged huge chunks of that one. This book helped get to know the place for me. If you go to the Museo D'Or in Bogota, you can see the gold items pictured on the cover and inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS!","review":"It may look like something totally great, but in actuality it's not even worth a penny in my eyes. For one thing, everytime you speak into the microphone it dosen't recognize practically any of the words you say, even numorously repeated.

I like that it folds up for easy transport. Be sure to adjust the friction mechanism located on the bottom of the main tube. Strangely, the instructions for this are on the outside of the box rather than included inside. And fortunately for me, I didn't toss the box before I found this out. The only thing I don't like is the nut that adjusts the actual music platform is not a wing nut type, so to adjust this you may need to carry a small set of pliers with you. Overall, this is a good stand at a great price. You'd be better off to pay the additional money for this rather than buy a cheapo $10 stand that wobbles and can't support a heavy music binder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Lightweight Folding Stand I've Found","review":"Had this for a few years now and it has held up great - despite being tossed in with the rest of my drum hardware.

The middle peice is not something that you can tighten. If it were the stand will be fine. It's hard to explain.

The Barbarian is more in tune with the atmosphere of ELP, and, knife-Edge. Tarkus should have been more imaginative. In fact, all of these peices could have been more imaginative, and more in tune with that ELP sound. Something that would stand apart from the original on its own two feet.

I'm not sure how to describe how she was stuck but the tip of the flexible part of the clip was pushing into one of the pads on her paw from the bottom while the heavier curved metal top part pushed down on top of her toe. It took about 20 minutes for me to free her paw from the clip and it was difficult to free her without causing her pain. I ended up destroying the clip in the process.

Now that our country faces a crisis, I hope Dick Gregory will be there for us with his commentary, his insight and wisdom.I wish he would have written more about his successes in the '80's with his weight loss programs, his work with the National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers (NOCIRC) and his circumcision trauma, the Black Panther party, Tupac Shakur, the Bush family, and his vision for the future.Ah, but hopefully his next book will include that!

Amazingly thin and fast cutting, extending the number of cuts before a battery change. The red stuff is slippery teflon which does a good job reducing binding against wood.

This book was no exception, and the story was very exciting. What makes her such a great author is her ability to make you feel as if you really know the characters and you cant wait to see where the story line is going next.She definitely built up the sexual tension between the two main characters, Spencer and Ruth, and the reader would expect to eventually read about their first time together. However, for some reason, KG left the reader hanging at the end without giving us another one of her very erotic and sensual lovemaking episodes. Not sure why she left it out, it only required one more chapter. Still loved the book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet romance combined with a lot of action","review":"KG MacGregor delivers - as always - a great read.

This book is a thought-provoking addition for any graduate level class in rhetoric and cultural criticism (and maybe some undergraduate classes). It inspires by not being just another manual in methodology and by offering authors' insight to their own working paths. Because the referenced articles are fairly easy to retrieve via databases, I believe it gives students and other scholars some very special ways to think about rhetoric and critical inquiry.

Unlike Learn & Speak French, which is so intuitively designed that a child can operate it and proceed without much instruction, this program, however well-organized, is NOT for those souls who prefer to skip over instructions and therefore waste several frustrating hours trying to figure things out on their own.

But I watched the DVD (very helpful) and then went to work. It was really easy, and the results look pretty darn good, despite the fact that I cut his hair WHILE HE WAS ASLEEP!The actual cutter was a lot quieter than I thought it would be. It glided easily thru the hair, with no tugging or pulling. The company has been around for quite some time, so I feel confident that these clippers will also be around for many years to come.

I have been cutting my own hair for about 10 years, and have been through several shavers, including Wahl products, but this is the worst. Ironically, it is the most I have paid for one before. This shaver vibrates uncontrollably while you are trying to use it, the only question is whether your hand goes numb first or you cut your head numerous times. The only good thing about it is that it does get a close shave; however, at the expense of feeling like your hair is being plucked from your head and scraping your head. I am a Marine so I have been shaving my head for years, so this was not a matter of just never shaving before; the product was a complete disappointment, and if I were not in Iraq I would take steps to try to get a refund but it is too inconvenient at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't ask for more","review":"I have used Wahl clippers in the past and always thought they were good quality.

They cut hair nice and easily to the desired length. There are a comb attachments ranging from #1 to #8. As far as I can tell the # is the number of 1/8's of an inch that your hair will be cut. I've used the #2 and #3, and both work great. The scissors included in this kit should not go near anyone's hair. They are cheap and flimsy, but I didn't buy the kit for the scissors.

I cut my husband's hair and what usually takes a good hour, took all of 15-20 minutes. I was amazed at how great they worked.

The concerto is coupled with excerpts from The Seasons (sadly without the famous \\"June\\"). The playing is excellent and the sound is of high quality. (Incidentally, the Penguin guide rates this CD as outstanding.) If you are looking for an inexpensive yet high quality performance of this concerto, look no further. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Affecting","review":"Ronan O'Hora's excellent recordings for the Royal Philharmonic's own label are uniformly fine, which makes it puzzling that none of the major record companies have recorded O'Hora since then. This recording of Tchaikovsky is typical of the excellence of these recordings. O'Hora plays with fine technique and beautiful sound. His interpretation of the Concerto is very much a middle of the road one, sort of in the Arthur Rubinstein mode. Nothing is over stressed, and tempos neither drag nor speed along. Special mention must be made of James Judd and the orchestra. Rarely has this Concerto received such a lush, propulsive accompaniment, and the sound engineering in the Concerto is absolutely fabulous. O'Hora's performances of 8 pieces from The Seasons are full bodied yet piquant. This is a treasurable disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss Congenialty is fluffy and sweet","review":"This movie ain't great art, and it's really pretty silly.

I'm glad I did....I promptly cancelled my DVD order. The movie is okay-at-best. If any other actress besides Sandra Bullock starred in this movie, it certainly would be shelved. Sandra plays a sloppy, unattractive FBI agent....and overacts in the process. The movie just tries too hard for laughs and fails. It's just not believable nor funny to see Sandra snorting when she laughs, stuffing her face while ketchup is dripping everywhere, eating with her mouth open, dressing sloppy & not brushing her hair, walking like a hood, talking with poor grammer, and the list goes on. I guess the major thing that bothers me is that she has no clue that she's a social joke yet she's an FBI agent so that implies she has some brains. The two aspects just don't mix. I think Sandra is a major talent but this movie isn't her shining glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so tired of unfunny movies like this one.","review":"What a waste of otherwise highly talented people. This movie is an embarrassment from beginning to end. The premise is good and, with something other than slovenly writers, it could have been great fun. But the lazy bums decided they'd give thinking a pass.

You'll laugh as Sandra Bullock becomes \\"a lady\\" while Ben Bratt stands at her side, or is thrown on the matt, as a fellow agent. It offers up comedy while giving an inside view to a rougher side of Sandra Bullock. Watch to see if she wins the pageant, or just whips the beauty queens butt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever Seen","review":"It is very comical and their acting were very natural which also shows the effort they put in their acting and they should be commended. Sandra Bullock is a very(x100000000) good actress and that goes for the same for Benjamin Bratt and Michael Cainel. Good job!

I think that I was able to tolerate her sweet nature in this film due to her part. She played someone that I could see her as in real life and that is what changed it all for me. The storyline was great and the characters were well developed. Everyone in this film did a great job in performing their parts. Candice was funny as the over zealous Pagaent opperator. Michael was superb as the person called in to change over Sandra's rough character, so that she could be in the pagaent. A fun film that will please over again and again.

First, the talent competition of the contestant making baloons reminded me of a real Miss America contestant singing she wanted to be a secretary. It was really bad talent and hard to believe someone would win a state beauty crown by making balloon animals these days. Second, I remember watching a runner up to Miss America making faces when she lost. Miss Texas just was wonderful in her dissapointment scene. This was hilarious and moved along very well. 100 points out of 100/ 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light hearted and enjoyable","review":"I believe that we need more movies like this one.

Rent this film...or better yet, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad","review":"I understand why Sandra Bullock won the Golden Globe for this movie. She is really good at physical comedy. While it is predictable, and has many faults there are several good performances in it, including that of Michael Caine. The major problem with this movie is the script and basic plot line. However, if you want a movie that will serve as some mindless entertainment it's a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light movie with very good comedy","review":"This is one of those kind of movies that you want to sit back and enjoy.

It's not just her looks, but her attitude. Sandra Bullock made this movie. She goes from hard-nose cop to beauty pageant queen in just a few days...but the outer transformation is way easier than the inner transformation!You've all seen the previews where she jumps off the stage onto a Texan with a gun, or the classic line, \\"You think I'm GOR-geous! You want to DATE me!\\" These are not the only funny moments in the film.The rest of the cast is excellent, too. Michael Caine, Benjamin Bratt, Candice Bergen, and William Shatner all do wonderful jobs with their roles. You also get to know the beauty contestants and (gasp!) come to like them! At least, most of them.This is a great feel-good movie. If laughter is the best medicine, this movie is good for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who approves this stuff?","review":"I rushed out to buy the DVD because I had heard it was a fairly amusing movie. Amusing? For whom? My eight year old? My five year old? It was inane and silly. I think Dr. Doolittle 2 rates slightly above this one and you don't want to know what I thought of that one. It makes you wonder what these guys in the studios were thinking when they spend thirty million dollars to make this movie! What a waste of money. Well, you can save YOUR money. You can have a better time watching traffic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Comedy","review":"This is easily one of Sandra Bullock's worst movies. Full of old jokes even to the point seeing the gracefull pagent entrant fall over not once but three times.I felt embarrased for Michael Caine who must gringe whenever he sees himself in this movie.How could a very average looking entrant who used that old joke about the ideal date win the pagent anyway.For a comedy this movie is a big joke on the public who paid to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Rubbish","review":"Never in my life have I felt so sorry for a talented actor as I did for Michael Caine. What a waste of a great acting talent. This movie was so dull and predictable it doesn't even warrant 1 star.

The script for this movie was unimaginative and dreadful (much like a Pauly Shore movie) If you are a fan of good comedy, avoid this film at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS...","review":"First, where did Sandra Bullock's career go? The swirling has stopped, I think with this one she's already well down into the septic tank. Did she do something while I wasn't watching to really deserve this?She seems like a nice enough lady (if not Miss Congeniality).Second, Name one thing about this movie that merits a sequel. I sure can't find anything--and I'm one of the people stupid enough to have seen the first one.Feel free answer these questions for me. It'll be time better spent than the time you wasted on the movie itself.I guarantee it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandra back on top form","review":"So she falls over more than once? Physical comedy is ALWAYS funny and in this movie Sandra proves she has the talent for it in spades. But it is the face pulling that I thought was the funniest. The scene in the bar when Benjamin Bratt brings in the girl is particularly good. Of course, I would liked to have seen more of \\"that dress\\". I watched the DVD and then watched it again with Sandra's and the writer's commentary. This is a very funny movie. And I as a rule don't like comedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Congeniality","review":"This film is by far the most interesting, funny comedy of them all. It's basically about a slobby FBI agent who goes undercover at the Miss United States Pageant. Gracie Hart (the slobby FBI agent played by Sandra Bullock) goes undercover as a sexy NEW JERSEY girl, who wants nothing but World Peace. This film is hilarious! If you loved The Incredibles, The Vacation Series, and Every Single FBI Film (that's a comedy), you will love this. The age range for this film is probably 11-Whatever. There are words in this film that you will need to understand (ex. white wine spitzer or the meaning of FBI). It is a fantastic fim! So, GO BUY IT! When you buy, make sure it has a FREE MOVIE PASS sticker on it! If the version you buy has that sticker on it, it means the DVD includes a free MOVIE PASS to Miss Congeniality 2 Armed and Fabulous, which is in theaters NOW! I hope this review was very helpful for you! SANDRA BULLOCK WILL LEAVE YOU LAUGHING!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-moving and lots of laughs!","review":"I was very surprised and pleased with Sandra Bullock's hilarious performance....Miss Congeniality is a lighthearted and fast-paced comedy with a lot of funny lines and some schtick, and good performances by all the main characters. Great to see Michael Caine, Candace Bergen, William Shatner in fine form! ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must see!","review":"the movie was entertaining from beginning to end. If you haven't seen it then your missing out on a lot of fun!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandra's best yet!","review":"I couldn't wait to see this movie when it came out on DVD, because I seemed to miss it in theaters. I went to the Blockbuster 3 weeks in a row and still they were all rented. Finally, when I got it, I was so happy and pleased that it was good, I went out and bought it on DVD!! Sandra plays a tomboy FBI agent who goes under-cover at the Miss America pagent to ensure the safety of the other contestants from \\"The Citizen\\", who turns out not to be who you think it would be. I recommend this movie to all ages!! ~Norms1gal"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn off your brain and let yourself be entertained.","review":"This film has a really horrible reputation, but it's actually not that bad. Once you turn off your brain and stop thinking about the story, it's actually quite good entertainment.If you hate Sandra Bullock, this film will probably do nothing to change your mind, but I watched it with very low expectations, and got a really positive surprise.Oh, and the scene with the talent show, at which she's wearing a tyrolean style dress and making the glasses sing - it's just worth the entire movie. I laughed so much I thought I might never stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly bad","review":"I love My Fair Lady type shows and thought the premise and cast of this sounded great. But I barely made it through the end of this movie. Only a few of the jokes were actually funny. Bullock's love interest only had a few moments when he wasn't being a jerk, and there was no reason to understand why she was attracted to him. Her turnaround in attitude about pageants, as expressed in the stage interview scene, must have been explained in the outtakes some of the other reviews mentioned -- 'cause in the movie it comes completely out of the blue. Worst of all, the whole theme of the movie is that the pageant contestants are fine the way _they_ are, but Hart can't be a complete woman and no one will like her until she douses herself in cosmetics. Granted her manners needed improving, but beyond that -- the message in this movie was amazingly heavy-handed, and NOT one I want to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor gracie,at the mercy of a bunch of male chauvanists","review":"Poor Gracie,she's a woman in a male FBI environment,and as my dad put t,she made a normal mistake by feeling sorry for a bad guy and the dumb men around her,save a few,don't seem to get it,how do they punish her?

And while most people are driven to the brink of insanity by William Shatner's \\"singing,\\" I find it amusing. Bullock's likable, as usual. Bratt isn't really but kinda, also pretty standard. Totally ridiculous, implausible, and old-hat, but not unbearable to watch on a slow night."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even worth 1 star!","review":"This movie was nothing like I expected. Sandra Bullock played a piggish type FBI agent that has to go undercover for a beauty pagent.

The relationship between Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt is not believable, the acting is fair at best.The only thing that saves this movie is Candice Bergen as the TV Queen Host of the Miss United States pageant, and Michael Caine as Bullocks Make-up diva, other than that this movie is a bust.Sandra Bullock has proved she is the poorman version of Julia Roberts, and with each movie she keeps getting worse and worse.This should of been a TV movie of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Guys stay away","review":"Women, don't torture your men. Rent it on girls night. It had a few funny moments, but the torture far outweighed the humor. The story was... not worth comenting on. Wait for it to come on cable (it won't be long).

Ive seen all the jokes, snorts, and falls a million times. I couldn't wait for it to end and had a hard time finishing it. I am usually a sucker for a funny movie and love all the great ones but this one failed to live up to an even slightly funny movie. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"The film starts out so improbably that I could never view the rest of it with any sense that it might ever happen this way in any alternative universes let alone our own. Sandra Bullock reaches adulthood without any sense of what her own looks are, even to the point of understanding simple make-up and clothing things that you would pick up from a stroll through K-Mart. Am I'm suppposed to believe this all happened because of an incident on a playground when she was 9 or so? Just not believeable, man. The rest of the it gets no better as she engages in some sort of magical transformation to a beauty queen while secretly working for the FBI...with behavior so dorky that I had to turn my face away from the screen at times. Come on, who was this script written for anyway? The eventual resolution of the plot had all of the conviction of a Barnaby Jones repeat. Sorry...this one's a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally unfunny movie","review":"the 1 star reviewers have said it all, so no need to repeat them.If a movie is nice, funny, enjoyable, good or terrific, you will watch it again (and again).Will I watch this one again?

It stayed dry inside even through moderate rain. No problems attaching it to the roof rack. I like that it folds up for storage, rather than taking up lots of room in the garage.

My score reflects the price I paid. If you tend to feel computer speakers sound dull with an over-emphasis on thundering bass, you might appreciate these speakers. I bought them because they were one of the few speakers I could squeeze next to my 42\\" LCD tv. I needed more dynamic, louder sound than my tv could produce. These fit the bill. They sound very crisp, bright, and detailed when compared with Klipsch or Logitech computer speaker. On the other hand, if you want powerful bass, get the Logitech. (The speakers look really cool and can be wall-mounted next to a flat panel- nice touch)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Acceptable sound for little speakers","review":"I have a good ear for music and the only computer speaker that sounded any good to me was the Altec Lansing on my HP notebook.

For some reason, the BOB books clicked with them, and they're now eager to read to us every night at bedtime. I thought the illustrations were a little bizarre, but the girls like them, and some of the stories are a little silly, which is fun. They also like the stickers - since both of them are reading through the series, they each pick out stickers to put on different parts of the book cover after they've read it. Multiple reads = multiple stickers.

O Duinn's tempos in both works are a bit faster than Thomson's, building up some excitement but also losing some of the lyrical flow of both pieces. Also, the sound engineering on Thomson's album is better, although the Naxos sound certainly is very good. This is my first encounter with the Irish Symphony. It's interesting to note that Amy Beach also wrote a Celtic Symphony around the same time, which was based on native material as well. The Irish Symphony, however, is the better of the two works. It has sparkle, especially in the second movement, and a wonderfully evocative and atmoshperic approach to the material. O Duinn's performance seems to me to be very good. His orchestra plays well, although I would really like to hear Bryden Thomson's version, too. Collectors wishing to experience Harty's music at Naxos's price need not hesitate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Irish flavored symphony","review":"This is a pleasant, enjoyable collection of Harty's best work. The highlight is \\"An Irish Symphony\\", where various Irish tunes are interwoven into the music. I immediately was swept away into visions of the countryside of Ireland while listening to this disc, and was impressed at the ability of the music to create such a strong visual picture in my mind. Harty based most of these pieces on themes and stories from Irish history. Strong violin pieces throughout, and a definite Irish flavor. A nice listen for days when you want to escape the busy, hectic, work related stress. I was a little disappointed by the recording itself (it's fair), though for the price, Naxos continues to be a leader in the field. Thus, for such a low price, definitely buy this one if you enjoy classical music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bosnia dvd","review":"was not what I expected.

The film manages to address self-discovery, revolution, the fact that things do not truly ever change as well as the incredibly damaging effect of some people's motives and ensuing actions on our environment, both physically and mentally. It does all this without forcing situations and uses the natural pace of the story line to accentuate the points it wishes to express. Truly amazing and despite its length one feels like it came and went like an hour and a half film.

For me, it has been a great benefit in my small shop. It took sometime to install it and make sure it is level. I needed another pair of hands to help with the process. It is easy to just build an out-feed table out of some plywood, but I chose this because it folds. I have folded it and raised it numerous times and it has held in alignment every-time. You have to be careful with one thing though. I ripped a 3/4\\" 4'x8' sheet of plywood down the middle the long way and as the plywood was coming to the end of the blade the weight of the sheet caused the table saw to start tilting backwards! I solved this by adding a pole that clipped on to the back end of the roller bracket with magnets. This solved the only issue I had with this out-feed table. Not sure if anyone else has experienced this."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid and useful outfeed table","review":"I recently installed this outfeed table - I believe quality outfeed tables essential when dimensioning sheetgoods. I have a one person shop - without the help of another person or a outfeed table like this one, there is elevated injusry risk.This product, sold by Grizzley seems to made by htc and often carries a higher price.One feature that is particularily nice is the ability to lower the table so that cross-cut sleds riding in yout t-slots to clear the table when executing wide cross-cuts.Installation instructions are fine though I found leveling the table with my table saw top challenging.Very good product at a good price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As close to fresh made as you'll get!!","review":"This is fresh tasting and has all the ingredients you'd want....the lemongrass and galangal are GREAT in the can...they only add to the flavor and are easy to pick out, and there's not too much that it's annoying or too filling in the broth content.I can't agree with another reviewers input on it being too spicy....unless you're just not used to Thai or Asian chiles in cooking, or are not used to hot spices. I actually added fresh hot chiles because I like it hot!As it is, this is a great base! I added some chicken breast and a bit of chicken stock, fresh mushrooms, fresh cilantro, some fresh chopped red serranos, squirt of lime juice and some bean sprouts and you've got a meal!

When you're reading to yourself, or reading aloud, that can be part of the charm. But when your kids are listening to 5 hours of audio book on a long car trip, you have to hope that the narrator doesn't lay it on too thick.As it happens, this narrator lays it on triple-thick: syrup on top of honey on top of sugar.

It's very easy and quick to move music from my home computer to the player. I hook the unit up to my office stereo, and my car stereo via the auxiliary input. The FLAC file playing capability was a must, and works flawlessly. I didn't even realize when I bought the player that I could record high quality AVIs from an external DVD player, or a digital video camera. And the ability to make MP3 recordings directly thru the built-in mike is very handy.However, there are a few things that could be better. Although battery life is advertised at 16-18 hours - in use it's more like 10-12hrs. Also, there's no way to save playlists on the Cowon that I can find. If you change the playlist, the old playlist is gone.

The same way it does when selecting folders. When in record mode it fades out to a gray screen and turns to snow. Several times when powering up the top of the screen would appear in the middle of the display and the top part would be fuzzy. The most fustrating aspect was the customer service or lack of. There is no working phone number to reach the company. You can however submit a service ticket which is low priority and work in progress. After 2 Months of no contact I finally gave up and returned the unit to Amazon which replaced it. The new unit had all of the same faults plus a few more. Returned to Amazon for refund.

Deep and contemplative and removed from time and place.A few years ago, Jordi Savall championed Marin Marais who wrote for one of the Louis's with similar solo musings.This music, however, is not written for a King, but for us.Try it, it's cheap but I cannot see anyone who likes any kind of music not thinking and feeling otherwise afterwords and wanting to listen again, and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plan Toys are great!","review":"This gas station is cute and fun!

The only nice thing abou this particular GH is that they included extra tracks on the CD, and Younger than Yesterday's \\"Have You Seen Her Face\\" is smartly included as a noteworthy Byrds tune.

However, I must say that I was dissapointed when I got a look at the book. I've grown up in evangelical churches and this collection is not aimed at this background. I have been singing hymns for over thirty years now, (and probably have the words of more than one verse for over 300 memorized) but I can turn page after page after page in this collection and not recognize a one.

Then there was the device itself. The dvd/cd just \\"rolls in\\" as if you were rolling it across the floor! Then, to expel the dvd/cd, a lever actually pops the side of the cd to make it come out of the slot.This isn't my idea of how to store my valuables.

Despite the fact that it's very dark and sexy, there's still a whimsical, innocent nature to it that no longer exists in teen novels. The author had a very interesting concept that was decently executed. To tell you the truth, however, I only read this series over and over again because I'm in love with Julian. He's like the Goblin King. (to all you Labyrinth lovers out there) If I were Jenny, I would have made different choices. =) Reading this again makes me wonder why Twilight is such a hit.

The book was long on emotion as to \\"how marvellous your wonderful new puppy is\\" but gave little practical information on what a new owner wants to know as far as puppy care is concerned(first night at home, house training etc) which were glossed over in a couple of sentences.

Now a guide book, by definition, is merely a way to GUIDE your travels. If you are looking for a book that will tell you perfect accomidations, restaurants, sites and activities, you are a naive idiot and you shouldn't leave the US. I thought those crazy cats at Harvard who wrote this guide were witty and insightful. If you are under 26, and especially if you are traveling alone, its very helpful. It would have been nice if they included more detailed historical backgrounds on each country, but considering they packed information about 20 or so countries in that fairly small book, I'll forgive them. I have traveled all over the world, and I've used a lot of different travel guides, but Let's Go is still my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deals with a lot of countries and places","review":"Very good in dealing with so many places and activities. But, I was faxing one hostel in Paris, The Three Ducks, and the rate per night has increased from 97FF (Lets Go Europe and the Internet) to 127FF. That's a very big increase from one year to the next. They said that it's the same price with or without breakfast. Can hostels raise their prices by so much and so abruptly?Otherwise, I'm finding the book very helpful to plan my trip to Europe at the end of July."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best student travel guide known to mankind!","review":"Keeping with tradition, LET'S GO EUROPE again makes it possible to do Europe on a student budget. This book is essential for backpackers and rail travelers. Excellent camping and hostel information. Brief language guides are also a plus. A must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative but lacks focus on Western Europe","review":"Over the years Let's Go Europe has attempted to add more countries to their Europe guide, at the expense of detail about more traditional destinations. In the 1998 edition, there is so much information on Russia, The Baltics, Poland, Bosnia (yep!) and the East Mediterranean that Western Europe is left with only half the book, and not enough detail. Since relatively few travellers venture into these areas, I question their decision to include them in a Europe book. I ended up buying their UK, France, & Germany books to provide enough detail to plan my trip. I'll still take Let's Go Europe with me, since it's a valuable resource, but I wish they had left Eastern Europe to its own book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise from an armchair traveler","review":"I just picked up the Let's Go Europe 1999 and am planning my trip to France and Spain. Unfortunately, it's taking me forever, because I keep stopping to read about all the other countries in Europe! The Let's Go introductions are so interesting, and I keep getting distracted by the hilarious gray anecdote boxes. I picked Let's Go because it has the best price information and nightlife coverages, but I will keep reading it for the excellent prose and the humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Europe book","review":"I'm using the book now to travel around Europe and I just love every word. It's really funny, and it brings you all the best places to stay and eat and see, everywhere you go. I've been from Amsterdam to Athens with this book, and I just keep thinking...how do they keep it so comprehensive? They even sent me to this Internet Cafe! That's right, they have complete and accurate listings of internet cafes in every major city. It's just totally the thing you need. Well, I'm going to stop writing now and catch a bite to eat in a Let's Go restaurant that is supposed to be really good. I believe it... every other place they've sent me to has been awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient, and Decent Coverage","review":"If you want a book that covers EVERYTHING you need to know about EVERY site in Europe, it would weigh 50 pounds. Let's Go is not perfect, but it is definately useful. Getting into Oslo at 5am, you will be the first one in line at the best hostel while others are waiting till 10am for the tourist office to open. This book gets you started, and tells you how to get the detailed info you need for that city. It is perfect for what it is, a guide that can help you all over Europe, it IS NOT and CANNOT be the all-inclusive guide to every city!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the extra weight in the pack.","review":"I just finish travelling through Europe for three weeks. On the road the book was absolutely useless. Any and every place that they recommend such as youth hostels and restaurants were completely booked and filled just about entirely with Americans. The book gives very little detail and information on the historical and important sites that litter every city in the book. We ended up using other books we had brought and tourist information booths located in just about every train station. To get information such as complete listing of youth hostels, maps, and what to see and do in the city. You are better off picking up separate guides for every country/city that you visit. That way you can know something about what you are looking at and can appreciate it. I recommend using it as place to start your planning for your trip and then leave it at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unoriginal Tour of Europe","review":"If you are looking for an adventure in Europe, I would suggest you look elsewhere- I would suggest Rick Steves or the Lonely Planet.

More than basic orientation.","review":"It's more than a basic guide for peopole who wants to travel in Europe with out schedules and on your own. The comments are very close to the reallity of any country or any city, that are include in this book. Of course that you will have to use your brain more than once, but I can garantee you that this book will help you to take the more intelligent decition, even in the most difficult time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Go get a second opinion.","review":"When I was in Europe over Christmas '97, I traveled almost entirely with Rick Steves, whom I highly recommend. But one of my friends had a Let's Go, and so we combined forces.After this experience, I have a few things to say about Let's Go. On the positive side, everything is cheap. However, often times it isn't only cheap in price but in quality. Because it is so popular, the hostels tend to fill up fast. Also, the directions are foggy at best and the information is not always accurate.In short, if you are going to Europe alone, don't let this be your only guide. You will wind up in trouble, and your guide book won't help you out of it. Go with Lonely Planet or Rick Steves--much more helpful in tight circumstances, and 98% accurate. If you're traveling with friends, take along a Let's Go because of the prices, but go to the last hostel listed first so you have a place to stay, and make sure you have a complimentary book with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth.

That includes hardwoods and MDF. I don't know why I ever used anything less than an 80-tooth blade for trimwork before. But, I can say I won't turn back! The only criticism I have of the blade is when first used it has a tendency to leave behind a bit of the red paint. No big deal, especially considering that comparable Dewalt blades leave their yellow paint for many, many cuts. I would definitely recommend buying this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diablo means the Devil","review":"It is a Devil of a good blade, sharp and smooth cutting .

Better to xerox the table of contents and find the source texts on your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minimal seminal","review":"The issuing of Tony Conrad's archival recordings was a gift from Heaven. Everybody'd heard about the bold avantgarde in the New York sixties, within or without LaMonte Young's Dream Syndicate, but few had actually heard the recordings. This instalment is the best. Why? Because (a) it offers the best mesmerising drones (b) it offers some \\"real\\" music too, and (c) it contains collaborations between John Cale, the minimalist visionary of The Velvet Underground fame, with his fellow (ex-)band members Sterling Morrison and Angus Maclise. So, this is a must-have for everyone who's remotely interested in either minimal music or the Velvet Underground."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I have no right to judge this book, i only read the first chapter, good read right before bed, makes you tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Not What I expected","review":"The only good part of this purchase was the efficiency in receiving the product.

This isn't really a problem, because the subtitles cover what you need to know; basically, if you have any sort of martial arts experience already you should have little trouble understanding this video.The style of Capoeira taught here is a mixture of various styles; it's not strictly one school or the other.The movements seem fairly clear, and the quality of the video very acceptable.

It's only about 150 pages, outlining concepts, running through examples and pulling together things you've already learned in arithmetic. The beginning of the book demystifies algebra, then Asimov goes on to show you how to work out all the a's, b's, x's and y's. This is not a textbook and it's not a workbook; it is a basic introduction to the subject. Asimov is a great writer and he actually uses English sentences to explain the formulas.If you are taking algebra for the first time or brushing up some rusty math skills, this is a great book to have. You'll definitely come away having learned a thing or two. If you are a publisher, please resurrect this book. It deserves to be in print.

For me, that was Asimov's brilliance--his ability to explain the how and why of math.

This should be required reading for students everywhere--although that might result in lay-offs of math teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best introduction to algebra ever!","review":"This book is the best introduction to algebra you could possibly find.

Since I've been applying it to my neck also, I've noticed that my thyroid surgery scar has lightened dramatically. I was amazed by this, as I had previously spent a few months religiously applying Bio Oil to that scar, which only irritated it and made it bright red.

I do think he was compelled to write a book about the human rights violations in those situations.Unfortuately he needed a good editor to help him reduce the novel by about a third by tightening up the prose and improving his style. The editor would also need to encourage Bennert to give his characters life. The characters seemed very cardboard to me.

I finished it when I got home, but I'd really like to see that part of Molokai after the descriptions.The author did a really nice job with the main character.

The storyline is great and it was a great choice for our book club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't \\"pass it on\\"","review":"Although there was a substantial amount of information in this book about leprosy and the treatment through the last century, the story, while compelling, was told in almost a \\"magazine\\" format. The author inserts his observations about a particular behavior rather than developing the characters well enough so as to allow the readers to inform himself and draw their own conclusions. Had the writing been less overtly sentimental and mushy, and the characters and events written more intelligently, this could have been a 4 star book. Despite that, after a slow opening, this highly predictable story does move along and it does inform; but, after reading it you feel like you've just had a very rich dessert. While you feel guilty for enjoying it you know it's not as nutritious as it should or could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stunning Story","review":"Prior to reading this novel, I had some idea of the exile of Hawaiians to Moloka'i, so I knew that I would find the subject matter of the story to be interesting.

Read this book to find out! I simply can't understand the high ratings for this book! The characters should have been sympathetic--spoiler alert!--they have leprosy. But I didn't care and I blame Alan Bennert for this. I think he took a great idea and then did not execute it well. The dialogue is flat, the prose is boring. All of these reviews of the book are more interesting than the actual book.On a positive note, you only need to read a few words per page toward the end to know what's going on. No attentive reading necessary!Will I read another book by him? No, and in fact out of principle I won't even watch \\"LA Law\\" anymore (he wrote screenplays for the show)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Dreadful -- One of the Worst Reads Ever","review":"The story of Kalaupapa and the people condemned to live there -- some of whom still do live there -- is a truly shameful chapter in the history of Hawaii, the US, and modern society. But that does not elevate this book. The characters are one-dimensional, the narrative is plodding and unimaginative, and the writing is at best only serviceable. Knowing some of the history, one can predict with precision the next tragedy to befall our characters, like clockwork. It is truly unfortunate that the real victims and heroes of this time are represented by such a trite, juvenile story.

Not only did I learn so much about the disease that ravaged so many, but I became totally immersed in the lives of all the characters, especially that of Rachel Kalama, as the book is told through her eyes.

I would put it at the level of The Help or one of the many Oprah's Book Club books, but it seems like this book never got the publicity it deserves. The reviews on here are all positive and a few members of our book clubs say that it is one of the best books they have read!If you are considering picking up this book, do it!

Girl gets leprosy and is quarantined. Nuns take good care of her, but her friends all die. Everyone close to her dies; she outlives everyone. She runs away when she is ten, she is awkward as a teenager, she falls in love with a man without the disease when she is 20, is a guinea pig for a research lab, marries, has a child which she can't keep, shows signs of deformity, all the while the world progresses around her. Oh yeah, she gets to meet the Governor of Hawaii. Isn't that special.There is nothing special at all about the protagonist, except she has leprosy, and about 150 pages into the book, I just stopped caring. The author really could have brought us close to her, but instead, spun a dragged out tale through the years, which left me skimming the pages just to see what else would happen.

Not only is it beautifully written, but the author skillfully keeps the time line moving so the reader is left with the big picture by the end of the novel. To think that just over a hundred years ago, antibiotic therapy was not advanced enough to spare those with Hansen's disease a life of shame, ridicule, and abandonment. I found myself reading more slowly as the final chapter neared so the story wouldn't end.

It begins with the story of Rachel Kalama as she is torn out of the fabric of her family in Honolulu at the age of 5 and taken to this faraway place.This is a heart-wrenching story, very detailed, and gives the reader a lot of information.

Having started out playing with Gabby, his sons Cyril and Bla, Alfred Kalima and Palani Vaughn, Peter, it was when Robert and Roland Cazimero (later known as the Cazimero Brothers) joined Peter and released albums such as Cracked Seed that the renewed awareness of Hawaiian music took off.Not just older Hawaiian music being re-released, their style re-shaped the music in a way that listeners appreciated and seemed to lead to a growing list of Hawaiian musicians that also became well known and further increased the awareness of Hawaiian music that spread beyond the island's shores.Definitely a must have album in a collection.

I desperately needed a magnetic solution. This worked perfectly on the side of my refrigerator. The magnets are pretty strong!Yes, it will move if you pull hard on it, but it stays in place pretty well with the rubber feet and angle it rests the feet. I choose to lift towels off instead of just tugging from the bottom on one side. I do use hand-towels while they are on the rack without problem. It does move down the side an inch or two over months of use in my kitchen and I easily just move it back up. Sure, if you pull hard on it, it will move, but for me under normal wear and tear, it stays put. Yes, the sliding magnets can scratch, but the scrathes for me are very tiny and barely noticeable. If you slide anything metal on metal, of course it has a potential to scratch. The rubber feet don't scratch. You can barely see any tiny scratches after a full year of use at my house.I am *extremely* happy with mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! A real joy.","review":"From the begining of this movie, when you spot Elizabeth Taylor having the temper tantrum of a lifetime, you *know* this is going to be a good time.I adored this movie!Kate and Bianca are sisters. Their father has decreed that the younger sister, even tempered Bianca, may not marry until her elder sister walks down the aisle. Unfortunately, Kate (Liz Taylor) has the disposition of a rattlesnake and is given to fits of anger. Thus far, it has put off any suitors, and Bianca frets that she'll never be allowed to marry. Then Pertruchio (Richard Burton) comes into the picture - a rather mad gentleman who is looking for a woman with a large dowry - and he pursues Kate, much to Kate's chagrin. Eventually, he tricks her into marriage. The honeymoon angst beings soon thereafter.Great acting, great sets, and beautiful costuming, The Taming Of The Shrew is a great time.

But oh you could feel the heat they must have been at like Klingons! This is their Movie, how could Shakespeare have known? Beautifully filmed and for those of you who think Shakespeare might be hard to follow fear not! And it's funny. Two watch those two throw jibs at each other with such accuracy! To see them secretly steal glances at each other when no one is watching. My favorite scene Petroccio watching over Kate while she sleeps. Now that's man in love. Kudos to the director,the other actors and the set and costume designers. They nailed it. Applause, applause!

I love to see Burton and Taylor play off of each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shrew worth taming","review":"A great version of Shakespeare's classic battle of the sexes. Great over the top performance from Elizabeth Taylor with lots of wild black hair and cleavage! This movie also features all the chemistry from Taylor and Burtons volatile personal relationship which also enhanced the performances in \\"Whose afraid of Virginia Woolf\\". Director Zeffirelli does a great job translating this play to the screen with two big stars while staying loyal to shakespeare."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Happened to the Color?","review":"While still appreciating the exuberance of Taylor and Burtonin their prime as well as the unbelievably detailed artdirection, I was somewhat disappointed in the transferfrom film to DVD. The original colors have been altered sothat the film no longer has the look of a Renaissancepainting come to life. When first seen the film was golden-filtered so that the wide ranging palette had a subdued glow which was quite wonderful. Obviously the current versionwas changed to fit a more \\"modern\\" scheme. Either thetranfer was done without the knowledge of the originalcolors or - more likley - it was decided that this changewould be more \\"palatable\\" to a modern viewing public thathad no knowledge of the original. I only hope that when theyfinally bring the original \\"Moulin Rouge\\" or \\"Reflectionsin a Golden Eye\\" to DVD they take into account the director'swishes more than they have with this realease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Acting","review":"I watched this movie only through Act II. I could no longer take the constant screaming and screeching by Elizabeth Taylor. I know that Kate is a shrew, and I've read the play several times, but that doesn't mean that the part of Kate must be played with continual screeching. There are other ways to manifest shrewishness without screeching (e.g., tone of voice). Also, why is there so much running around and banging when Petruchio meets Kate? It is unnecessary to the point of being slapstick, and it's distracting from the dialogue. Finally, this movie is not completely faithful to the play, which is something else that bothers me.I have watched three versions of this play (the Marc Singer version, this version, and the BBC version), and the Marc Singer version is the best one, IMO. In that version,the acting is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"asses are made to bear and so are you","review":"I was 'forced' to watch this for my english lit. A level. At first I remembered how much I had hated romeo and juliet, but once the movie started I was amazed! I actually ENJOYED a Shakespeare adaption. No doubt thanks to the gorgeous Liz Taylor and Richard Burton. Katherina is one of the most compelling characters to have ever been thought up, and as much as I despise Petruchio for his complete torture of kate, I find him an amusing and wonderful character. Unfortunatley the film is let down by cutting half of Katherina's lines, and becase they KEPT Shakespeare's appauling ending... (it's late and I don't remember accuratly but something to the effect of 'yeah, stand on my hand if it makes you feel better, Petruchio dearest.' Could that be any more degrading to such a strong-willed intelligent character?)Great film and play."},{"rating":"1","title":"late shipping","review":"I paid to have this come rush and it took 10 days the product itself was exactly what we wanted and great just too late in coming to be viewed before the audition,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beg to differ","review":"I really like Liz and Dick, but this movie is crap. Silly and dated direction, weak screenplay, and highly questionable post production make this one almost unwatchable. I really don't understand the four and five star ratings. Another lame studio product hiding behing the great the Shakesphere cannon. Check out \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?\\" Amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Adaptation Of The Play To Screen","review":"There are 2 good reasons to view this film. First it is one of the best movies that Taylor and Burton made together and they absolutely dominate the film. Burton in particular is very at home performing Shakespeare and seems to be relishing his role in every scene. Taylor also does incredibly well and the chemistry between them on screen should not be missed by anyone who loves good acting and film history. The color and settings are brilliant. Zefferelli's direction is spot on.The 2nd reason is that this film is one of the better adaptations of Shakespeare to screen ever made. While there are some creative liberties taken with the play they all work for me and I find the film enjoyable in it's own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to Shakespeare","review":"Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton are excellent in this film.

It's well acted and an excellent adaptation of William Shakespeare's play. The comic genius of both Burton and Taylor are evident here, testament to their good acting skills and superb directing of the director. They have an excellent supporting cast including a young Michael York.In the 16th century not many women, even if they were rich, had the ability to outshine their husbands in the intelligence stakes. But wily Kate shows that she's more than a match for Petrucchio using all the guile and wit she can muster.If you like humour, wit and intelligence, then this film is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but stupid","review":"The color cinematography in this Zefferelli opus is gorgeous, but the depiction of Katherine, the \\"shrew\\" of the title, is utterly ludicrous. Poor Liz Taylor spends the first hour with virtually no dialogue beyond scrams of rage. Why mount a movie of one of Shakespare's comedies if you're going to gag one of his most enchantingly verbal women?

It was very bad, and the acting didn't help. None of the 'brilliant young research students' seemed to have a brain cell between them, half the time nothing happened and when it did it was totally unconvincing. Richard Attenborough, who only appears for about five minutes, seemed to be playing Father Christmas once again and the only actor who was convincing was a James Faulkner as the token bad guy professor. Even he had to show a 'nice' side in the end and have an emotional 'reunion' with his ghastly daughter.

A problem of the books that came after the Casteel series has been that the young protagonists are too \\"wide-eyed\\" for someone living in the 21st or late-20th centuries.

It is not nearly as good as I remembered it being, and is nowhere near the level of Megadeth, Slayer, or old Anthrax. The musicianship is solid, you can tell these guys are talented, especially drummer Paul Bastaph. But, the guitar riffs are not memorable, the solos are not impressive, and the songs just don't stand out in any way for me. I kind of put this in the same league as, but slightly beneath, Exodus' Pleasures of the Flesh, which is another album I used to really like but hasn't held up over time.Overall a decent thrash metal album to check out but there's a reason this band never achieved the same fame as Slayer, Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax.

The problem is that the straps cut off the blood flow to your arms. Your arms start tingling and that's just the start of its uncomfortableness. After a while, the straps bruised my arms.

The design is very poor in practical wearing. The fabric under the arms resembles velcro and very irritating & tight, without any adjustment for the armpit area. The center fastener does not stay in place - level with the shoulder blades - which further irritates the armpits by continuing to creep up toward the neck. Agree with another poster, this would be much more effective with a front adjustable band/strap to keep in proper position. Wearing does make me more aware of my posture which reminds me to correct the \\"wing thing\\" by standing with shoulders back.

It leaves marks on your skin after wearing it for only a few minutes.It's also very hard to wear it like the picture. The band wants to crawl upwards to your neck, which in turn would pull your neck down, and hurt your posture!I'm just a average built guy, but I tend to slouch. So I think most people would experience the same difficulty with this as I did. The only reason I bought this was because I was intrigued after seeing it on a Sky Mall Catalog.

Very revealing under clothes. The left arm strap was actually constructed twisted which made the left side even more uncomfortable than the right. The straps roll into a cord regardless of an undershirt or near the skin, and the the section that attaches the hooks to the actual straps isn't as wide as the photo shown.

It's a little difficult to get off, but it wouldn't be doing you any good if it wasn't tight enough. You definitely need to wear it over a tee shirt, as it would leave your armpits raw otherwise. I have some neck problems, and found I could only wear it for a couple of hours without it putting too much strain on my neck. But that's been enough.

It was definitely as I expected- no miracle or anything, but after reading the review that says to make sure it's right-side-up, helped me out so much. I was aware of the possible mix-up so I made sure I was wearing it like the picture displays (no pic comes with product, just looking at the one online). Also, as others have stated, it serves more as a reminder to keep your shoulders back rather than actually doing anything.

In addition to the gratuitous \\"frame\\" for Aleko (the opera itself doesn't start until 6 minutes into the film), there are inexplicable & unjustifiable deletions from the scores of both operas - the Young Gypsy's Romance in Aleko & the choral sections of Kashchey.

I don't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Style!","review":"I read Dogeaters by Jessica Hagedorn for a report I have do for English class. I thought it would be helpful and give me different looks on Filipino society, I was wrong.This book was extremely hard to follow. Within the plot were a bunch of little ones, it was hard to keep track of which characters went where. Also Hagedorn used the language of the Filipinos in her book, so often I was very confused about what people were saying.The most disturbing part of this book was the cover. When I bought the book I figured I would recieve it with a cover such as the one pictured, but instead I got this awful picture of a woman on a cross holding a head and a sword, with a child in her womb. The whole thing was very disturbing and I was forced to put my own cover on the book.Overall I would not reccommend this book, unless you're up for a challenging confusing story line, and if you want it for a report on Filipino culture, pick another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so sure I'd recommend","review":"The cover art is very intriguing but the book itself is somewhat confusing to follow. It jumps around a lot and did nothing to shed some \\"good\\" light on the country of the Phillipines. If anything it fed the typical stereotypes about the people and culture and trying to get a good sense of the time periods it dealt with was really difficult. If anything, I would have enjoyed it more if the book was focused on only one or two characters and told a longer story about them instead of jumping around on 6-8 different people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need to know to start working with PMC","review":"if you are new to PMC this is the book for you, the instructions are clear and concise , it includes easy projects and is well illustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I have never been more dissappointed in a how-to book. All the instructions are drawings that look like they were done by children. There are few photos and they are mostly tiny black and white and fuzzy. This book is not helpful at all.

I was sorry that this book had to end. It kept me interested through the entire thing. I am also glad that there was a sequel for Bobby Dodge. Great book and I would recommend any of her books to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending and forced romance bring this down from 4 to 2 stars","review":"I was initially hooked by Hide as it has the premise for an interesting story. However, about half way through the book the author felt the need to force a romance into the situation, described in formulaic bodice-ripper, romance-novel style, which was superfluous and began the descent of my star rating. Then the ending, which seemingly came from nowhere and felt extremely contrived was the final star-dropper. This was a free download supposedly given away to entice more Gardner sales but it had just the opposite effect in my case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Crowd Pleaser!","review":"Alright, I've said it before, not much else to add. Lisa Gardner is a top notch writer.Entertaining! Entertaining! Entertaining!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of twists and turns!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have read a number of Lisa Gardner novels and I believe that \\"Hide\\" is the best. There were plenty of twists and turns but still the author kept the main character, Annabelle, at the center of this wonderful mystery. I won't go into detail about the book as there are many already, except to add that the plot is exciting and the story will keep you turning pages. I think one of the most accurate aspects of the book was that the characters are well developed and the conclusion didn't leave any loose ends. This is a wonderful, suspenseful mystery that I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twists And Turns Galore!","review":"Detective Bobby Dodge and Detective D.D. Warren are at it again. Despite the sexual tention between them they work well together. Lisa Gardner has a way of making these two characters so real that they jump off the page. \\"Hide\\" is the second of a series and I can't wait to bite into the next one. There were so many twists and turns I didn't want to put it down.Annabelle had such a life of running and running and always wondering why. She loved her father and trusted him no matter what. The ending left me with my mouth open. When that happens then I know I just finished a darn good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, haunting thriller","review":"The author maintains her high level of twists and turns in her latest novel. Annabelle Granger remembers leaving home at age seven and moving to Florida with her parents using assumed names. She remembers similar escapes to Arizona, St. Louis, Virginia, and other places. Once her mother dies, Annabelle chooses their next place, Boston. Her father is dead within 18 months. 10 years later, still in Boston, Annabelle is single, lives with her dog; too paranoid to have other friends besides the UPS man. State Detective Bobby Dodge gets called on a gruesome case, the discovery of six dead girls on the grounds of what used to be the Boston Mental hospital. Many story threads tie into one as the task force tries to locate the killer. Overall this novel has all the right elements for a terrific novel to recommend. The one minor fault was the ending, which felt weaker than the rest of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have found Lisa Gardner to be a good dependable suspense writer who offers up an enjoyable product. One complaint I have is that loose ends are not always tied up and the endings don't provide me with enough closure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mystery","review":"I thought the story line was great!

It will do you no good whatsoever. I tried it. This book keeps you on your toes -- if nothing else just trying to keep the changing characters straight. Names keep changing as well as settings. So, if you try like I did to cheat and find out the culprit, even after I found out the name of the character -- I didn't know who he was -- I had to read the book in order to find out what part he played in the plot.This book kept me reading well past bedtime and then I wished I hadn't because I saw shadows that kept me awake. The characters are well-developed as is the plot. I have found a new favorite author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hide by Lisa Gardner","review":"I really like Lisa Gardner books...this is the 3rd one in a row that I have read.

Lisa Gardner is a great author and her books really captivate you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"She spins many threads into a wonderful yarn. I've been spoiled by Jeffrey Deaver's books, but Lisa's are next in line for me so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I was so pscyhed!","review":"Lisa Gardner set up a great premise and wheezed the book to an improbable end. There is enormous promise in the primary story: what would keep a family on the run for more than a decade? Yet I found the end contrived. Given that this is a suspense novel, I don't want to say much, but I will say I have enjoyed Gardner's other books more."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read!","review":"Really enjoyed the story ... it keeps you guessing who's behind it all!!My only wish is that there wouldn't have been so much cursing. I understand you have to accurately display a character's personality, but I'm hoping one day they'll sell a \\"PG\\" version of these kinds of books. Oh well, just a thought. Aside from that, it was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hide","review":"Lisa Gardner is of my favorite writer .I have read all of her books and can't wait till her next one comes out. If you like to read James Patteson Books Lisa Garner is a must. This book is one of my favorite . Some of the story is from one of her other book but she explaines enough so you dont have to read the other book.( Alone)I would recomend that people do read it first so you get an understanding of Bobby and D.D. Great strory i was guessing the whole time while i was reading. Nice surprise on the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plot a bit contrived","review":"This was a good story, but---- Here's how I think the plot could have been better: I expected Christopher Eola to be Annabelle's mother's brother. I thought she was the sister that Christopher did something \\"inappropriate\\" to, therefore getting himself consigned to a mental institution. When \\"Tommy\\", Annabelle's father's sociopath brother, showed up, it just seemed contrived, with too many sociopaths in the story to make it realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I ever read.","review":"This book was absolutely amazing. Lisa Gardner's best. The characters, storyline, and writing were all amazing. I really connected to the story. I can't really find the words to describe how much I enjoyed it. It had action, mystery, drama, romance, and a little humor. When you close this book you will feel very satisfied.I felt able to connect to the characters. When they worried, I worried. When they were sad, I was sad. When they were happy, I was happy. Just an amazing book all around. Very 'Complete'. It had all the things a great book should. I can imagine myself reading this book again in a year just to enjoy the greatness all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down!","review":"I have to say this was much better than I expected. I will definitely be looking for more of Lisa Gardner's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved most of it but pretty confusing","review":"I'm not really sure how to go about rating and reviewing a book that I loved so much for about 3/4 of the book but then by the last 1/4 or so I was mocking it. I guess that's what I can expect from a quick \\"airport\\" read, fast moving, enthralling, pulled me in, but the ending is totally unbelievable and I felt like the writer just fell asleep at the wheel. Up to end, great book that I really enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book. I could not put it down. It was full of suspense and very entertaining. This is the second book in a series but you can read it even if you have not read Alone and will never realize it is the second in a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deus Ex Machina novel","review":"Good novels give you clues that you usually miss anyway, but they were there all along. This novel gives no clues of any kind and at the end the murderer not only turns out to be somebody out of the blue, but could have been anybody else as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Price","review":"I enjoy Lisa Gardner's books but her publisher charging full price for the Kindle book, more than the paperback costs at places like Walmart, is obscene. No printing, no distribution, no returned book costs. And if you think about it, you are really only renting the book. Unlike the paper book, you cannot lend it to others, resell it, donate it to a library, etc. Lisa's Web site invites fans to write to her; I did about this issue, but she never responded. This is not an Amazon problem. The major book publishers decided to force eBook prices higher. They are now setting the Kindle book prices, not Amazon. I encourage others not to buy a Kindle version unless it is priced significantly less than the paperback or hardback price."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for those who honor God","review":"I would rate this less than one star if given that option. I have deleted it from all my devices. I would liked to have seen how the tale unfolded. But for those who believe in the Commandment not to take God's name in vain, this book is extremely offensive. To purchase this book is to promote blasphemy. From now on, before purchasing a book from Amazon, I will do a search for the words \\"God\\" and \\"Jesus\\" to see whether their names are used as foul language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the D.D.

Even though paid only 77c (81 c Canadian) I regret every penny.I agree with some of the other low ratings that it was well enough written but the ending with its tearful out of nowhere duel confessions was a pitiful attempt to tie a runaway story line together.

Just when you think you have this book figured out, it turns and the plot thickens! I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes reding about murder mysteries!

If you do decide to get this one keep in mind that it is heavy- my arm got tired after about 5 minutes trying to straighten my hair. If your just looking to try out striaght hair on you, i reccomend this product because its a cheap way to see if you like striagt hair and if you like it you can buy a nicer flat iron.

I picked this one up on Amazon for free and it still was't worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was awful.","review":"I don't recall ever reading anything by Connie Mason before, but I am familiar with her name, so when I saw this novel for free on Kindle--and a Regency to boot--I downloaded it. I read about 20% before giving up on it. Lucas, the \\"hero\\" is worse than a Rogue. He is one-dimensional, and that one dimension is all about sex. Virtually all of the 20% was a description of his sexcapades, his sexual fantasies,and his constant state of arousal. Bliss seemed to have potential as a strong heroine, but she wasn't fully fleshed out in the portion I managed to finish, except as the object of Luc's desires. After he all but rapes her, I gave up completely on the novel.(Doesn't \\"no\\" mean \\"no\\"??? I'm sick of these kinds of \\"romances.\\") There seems little potential for love, and the characters lack development. It seemed hopeless, and I gave up on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Connie.. come on!!","review":"I have read tons of books by Connie Mason, which i was really excited to get this one on my kindle. Boring!!I didn't even finish the book.. no wonder it was free. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid book","review":"Seriously, this book should have been titled the rogue's arousal or some such. That's the one thing that was constantly mentioned throughout the book. I kid you not! I figured I should give it my one-star review anyway even though I really didn't want to waste my time reviewing it. I figured it would save some other poor soul the time they could spend reading something better.For a more detailed review on just how terrible this one is, please read Liz Baker \\"book lover\\"s review.

If I had one bit of criticism it would only be that most every example was either a fabulous loft or an 18th century house. Might have been nice to show a few examplesof the concepts within the walls of a mid century american house. Non the less, I loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Craven Money Grab","review":"A terrific disappointment. This game, unlike all of the other Trivial Pursuit games, includes a slim half-box of questions (compared to 2 full boxes for questions for other Trivial Pursuit games). Furthermore, the questions are geared toward movie minutae (for example, how many days did Sean Astin have to wear his hobbit feet? Who cares?) Tolkien's created universe is so wonderfully rich and complex, and I was looking forward to really testing my knowledge of elvish lore and Rohirrim geneology and the like. This game, however, ignores most of the mythology and the events in the novels, focusing instead on the films. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaaaay Too Easy","review":"One daughter and I played against the other daughter and her husband. We went first and completed the game on the first try. Then they took their turn and also completed the game. The questions are about the movie versions only, and none of us has seen the third movie yet, but the answers were obvious either from the books or from the way the questions were set up.If they ever come out with a Trivial Pursuit based on both the movies and the books--or on the books alone--with questions aimed at those who are very familiar with the material, I would buy it. This version is not something I would recommend for adults or for obsessive fans of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!!!","review":"Just received this game and played last night with my husband. The board and the pieces are beautiful, though I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a Legolas piece in with the rest. :) As mentioned, only one box of cards came with the game, I was expecting two boxes. I am fairly \\"middle of the road\\" in my LOTR knowledge, I've obcessively watched the movies and the documentaries, and skimmed the books. I could see this game being MUCH too easy for the more hard core fans, but overall, I give it a definate thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOTR Trivial Pursuit","review":"The UPS guy left my package out in the rain, so there was water damage. The fault in that lies entirely on UPS, but it was disappointing nonetheless. Also, it came without the pie pieces and how are you supposed to play without those? Maybe it said that in the description though. I'm not the most thorough purchaser. No big issues though."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Should Have Been Called a \\"Junior Edition\\"","review":"This game may be fun for the casual fan or family who viewed the films. For a devoted fan of the movies, the only challenging category is the one directly concerned with the technical aspects of making the films. Otherwise, it's strictly junior league. I hope the company will consider a real \\"Tolkien\\" edition, from Silmarillion to Lord of the Rings, to give the real fans a challenge. While I realize the game may serve to bring friends together, fans of the movies will quickly find their boredom meter pegged; the game does not have lasting potential for repeated playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Challenge","review":"I have never really played this game but I love a real challenge. I like to test myself and see just how much I know about the subject. I also LOVE the lord of the rings. So if you LOVE the lord of the rings and would like to challenge yourself you should get this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Don't expect this to be a game about the books, it is strictly about the movies. And if you have seen the movies at least once, chances are you will be able to answer every single question without difficulty. There is no challenge and the questions are frequently silly. It also seems to only cover the the first 2 movies. If you are big on movie trivia, then maybe you will like this, but otherwise, beware. I loved the movies, but this is a bit much and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"movies only?","review":"when i heard that there was a lord of the rings trivia game, i was pretty excited, but then i found out that it was only based on the movies. While i admit that the movies are indeed the only reason i read the books at all, i think that there is much much more challenging and fun trivia to be drawn from the books instead of the movies.make a book based lord of the rings game and i'll play it. but not if it's only movie based, since so much was changed and left out from the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game but missing a piece and one is bent","review":"This game was not in new condition- one piece was bent and one piece is missing. Still a fun game but we have to use pieces from our regular trivial pursuit to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately based on movies.","review":"We bought this and LOVE it. We knew it was based on the movies and we were fine with that. Although we read the books long before the movies were being made! The games pieces are made of pewter and you would need to expect to be gentle with them. The swords will bend if used as action figures. (we have not done this) but I can imagine little ones getting a hold of them and doing so.Granted the movie making category has rather hard questions, but if you have watched the bonus and extra DVDS, the information is in there. I am a 42 yr old mother and have played this with my oldest son, 20, middle son 15 and his friend and we had all had fun with it. If you are looking for a grand Tolkien experience, this game is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I bought this to cut Texas Rib metal roofing. It cut the material very easily. A few sparks but no heat build up. Use full face shield , long sleeves, hearing protection, gloves, etc... The blade sends off little shards of metal but makes an extremely smooth cut. The reason it is better than I expected is that it even cut the corners of the roofing smoothly and they are not supported well. I thought it might bend them up, but no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as advertised","review":"I bought this blade to cut holes in two metal doors for glass inserts. The first door went quick and easy. The second door was a different story. As soon as I started I could tell a difference in the cutting ability. The saw started to have trouble cutting, and I just did get the second door cut. The blade is totally useless after these two cut. If you need to do a small job then this saw is what you need but not very cost effective. From the other reviews I expected to get a lot better service but was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frantically Paced Excellence!","review":"Maybe you've bumped into one of Kevin's pieces on NPR (National Public Radio), or maybe you're a fan of story telling and thus are in that loop. I'm the former. I wrote his name after they aired a piece some years ago and uncovered it recently. So I looked him up and found this cd. So when it got here I was Ready! And I was not disappointed. KK is a northern nut with a GIFT! He's madcap and dead-on funny. His pacing is breakneck, his stylings are down (or in this case, UP) home, and his delivery is perfect. In short, he's a nut. The good way."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed...","review":"I bought this blade with somewhat high expectations. I figured the cut wouldn't be as smooth as the Freud LU85, which is twice the price, but had to be smoother than the stock 40 tooth blade that came with my bosch 4212L, which it was. One small problem - the blade did not make a straight cut. Every cut I made had a scallop at the entry point of the blade into the material. The blade was straight when checked against a straight edge so the edge must oscillate as it spins. A check with the stock blade and a new Dewalt woodworking blade confirmed that the saw cuts perfectly straight. I definitely won't buy another diablo blade. I would give 5 stars to Amazon for their return policy - they took it back with no issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't cut straight & dulls quickly","review":"I have had a very hard time with this blade. The first one I bought would be off by about 1/8 of an inch on a 5 inch tall board when cutting a 45 degree miter. I took this blade back to Home Depot and they exchanged it for a new one, (points to Home Depot). The replacement blade cut straight, wonderful! This blade however has gone very dull very quickly. I did cut some hardwood flooring that seems to be the issue, but it shouldn't be. I have several other Freud products that are all great, including a table saw blade. I can only think that this blade is made at a different factory or with different materials etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn Baby Burn","review":"Using this saw on my 12\\" Delta twin Laser for my rehab business, I have been dissapointed by it's tendancy to burn and/or its durability. While it is certainly possible that I or one of my crew cut something we shouldn't have this blade hasn't lasted as long as the two previous blades on my saw. Now when I try and cut anything wider than a 2x4 I get smoke, and If I am using the full crosscut capability we get so much that I need to open the windows.As I ususally don't need a real fine cut, next time I will get something more durable and with fewer teeth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"As always, works great! I operate a local handyman operation and go through a few saw blades. Freud has never failed me. I have Freud blades that have been resharpened 4+ times and keep on going. This new one replaces the one I used for finish carpentry. Perfect cuts....Every Time!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound with fun songs!","review":"Awesome CD, I found myself liking all the songs on this CD. All the lyrics are easy to understand and well written. The group has a familiar sound associated with all hit music, a terrific beat and a smooth harmony that is adventurous yet varied enough to keep you entertained for hours. I rarely let a CD play over but this one has been on repeat since I got it. All the songs (it's hard to choose a favorite considering it goes from one great song to another) have a certain quality that just inspire a smile and encourage fun thoughts (especially Blonde). I'm a soft-rock/alternative country fan and think it's just a matter of time before this band gets lots of radio play. I'm very happy I have this CD in my collection and can hardly wait for the group to record additional tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"very well satisfied, good bang for the buck!","review":"it works very well for plant usage, we are able to cut alum.or wood / sometimes we are cutting them both at the same time,also the thin kerf is alot easier on the saw motor, brakes etc.and at a glance, you can see the RED Blade, and know the operators have the correct blade for this operation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blade for super hardwoods","review":"This blade is perfect for cutting super hardwoods like lapacho, ipe, or any wood with similar hardness. I purchased it for an ipe floor that I am installing. When using with a zero clearance insert, this blade produces perfectly smooth cuts with virtually no tear out and stays very sharp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freud Diablo RULES","review":"I have used the 10\\" Diable combo blade in my table saw now for many years. Freud Diable is the only blade I will buy. This 12\\" blade, in my opinion, comes very close to the Forrest blade cut but at half the price. I use this on hardwood crosscuts in my DeWalt sliding miter with great results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful children's book","review":"This is a real gem.

I hope to see many more in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mathematical Elements for Computer Graphics","review":"While written over 24 years ago, I was hoping this book would give me an understanding of the mathematical basis (if not the current state-of-the art;) ) of computer graphics. Despite (arguable to many) years of university math courses, I found this volume merely humbling, rather than enlightening. If you are more comfortable with fairly advanced mathematical notation and concepts than most, especially relative to geometry, you may find this book useful. I found it only marginally useful -- primarilly as a reference to some concepts I had previously been exposed. Best of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Subtitles or dubbing","review":"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. This looks like it might bea really good film.

It is unbelievably hard to crank, he always had to do it because I literally could not turn the crank more than a couple of inches either way. It broke off internal plastic pieces the very first time we used it, and more pieces broke off each time, until after using it about six times, it was completely unusable. This is a very expensive ice crusher that looks like it is quality because it appears to be all metal. Do not be fooled. Many interior pieces are plastic, and break immediately. This was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID AVOID- JUST HORRIBLE,","review":"This DVD series is so disappointed.

When she inherits property in Natchez, Mississippi, she is intrigued by the secrets behind her aunt's murder and a neighbor's suicide. And, in 1933, the people of Natchez are still haunted by the ghosts of the War between the States, slavery, and their own losses. Two ex-slaves, Ezra and Aunt Polly, are the key to Nora's search for answers.Dallas brings her characters and 1933 Natchez to life in this atmospheric novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading","review":"This is the sort of book you can easily finish in a day. A good book for the Kindle to read when traveling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formula for Poor Writng","review":"Sandra Dallas tells good tales. The Diary of Mattie Spenser has intriguing turns. New Mercies has southern charm. Unfortunately, Dallas succumbs to decorating her books with the bric-a-brac of pseudo research--without integrating it into the tale. It glows like Mattie's silver spoons in a sod house. Dallas demonstrates no mastery of letting her characters speak --choosing rather to sprinkle the dialog with newspaper headlines and abrubt colloquialisms. One does not have to include every historical figure, building, or event in a book. Dallas has the talent to write well; it is unfortunate that she chooses formulas which no doubt drive and satisfy publishers but do not create good writing. A warning to readers--positive reviews can indicate that others have abandoned a book because it was not worth reading. Before you waste money on Dallas books, sample her writing from the local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"As with all of her books she takes you there!

The descriptions of southern living back in that time frame were very interesting and I basically really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Sandra Dallas Hit","review":"Once again Ms Dallas has provided us with an insight into the every day lives and the life style of the folks from the era.

The transfer engineer ,Stuart Rosenthal, has tried too hard to make these performances soundlike they were recorded in modern times. As the title of the CD says, these are the pre-war recordings of Hess's Schumann. Therefore, they should sound old, shellac hiss and all. Without it, you have a muffled, unmusical sound that sounds like the piano is in the next room. Usually Naxos Historical is superb (when Marston or Obert-Thorn does the transfers), but in this case I have to say pass. You can get a much better transfer of her Carnaval in her Great Pianist's of the Twentieth Century 2CD set.

At first look it seems a bit too simple. The hinges are only fixed into one slot, while the bottom point floats on a bearing against the mount. The weight of the tv keeps it in position when mounted. This design makes it very simple to tilt, with almost no effort, and yet the unit stays firmly in place when you get it where you want. There are pentagonal set-screws that keep the brackets in place, so would-be thieves might find it hard to unhook without the right tools. 3 pieces of actual hardware makes easy installation, though I would recommend that you invest in some better drywall anchors (the kind that pull back and spread out for better support, though you should mount this to studs anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product for real rooms","review":"Perfectly solves the problem of mounting displays in real rooms, where displays need to be mounted in places other than centered between two 16-inch on-center studs.

It would not sync to the computer for information exchange. Obviously I was very perturbed by this, so I called the company I purchased it from, and they sent me a new cable swiftly to fix the problem. However, when the cable arrived it had the same problem.

I personally also like the taste and I think it's good quality.The Tassimo machine is perfect for people who like to enjoy different tastes. Unfortunately it is not so fit for people who like the regular drip coffee cause that, too, comes out to a dollar per cup which is too high compared to what you would pay for a pound of coffee and use for many cups.

But the very elegant throws, done in exquisite fibers along with silk ribbon trim are unbelievable in their beauty.This book is not only about comfort throws, but the authors have included some wonderful comfort food receipies that 'add to the flavor' of the whole creative experience.This book is beautifully done - and once again, the artistic talents of Linden Phelps and Beryl Hiatt provide us with more fabulous and wonderful designs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your yarn","review":"As usual, these authors use the most expensive, luxurious yarns, but this time the results are not even worth a second look. Don't bother with this book. Unless your tastes are really wierd (or you are a University of Washington Husky fan) you won't want to make any of these murky, overwrought \\"concept\\" afghans. It's a pretty book, and maybe the recipes are OK. (Yes, recipes: \\"Salmon in Parchment with Wasabi Cream\\"!) As with their other books, though, the authors seem more interested in showcasing themselves, their store, their friends, and their lifestyle, than creating appealing designs. I've been more impressed with Herrschner's catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful throws, expensive yarn","review":"I bought my copy of this book from Tricoter, as well as the yarn for the project. See the finished product as the first (only) photo in the image section. The throw came out absolutely beautiful, and will definitely be a family heirloom. It's wonderfully soft and warm as well. The yarn cost more than $1,000 when bought from Tricoter."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"Who would put together such a inconcise compilation?

There are only a few words on each page, making it a quick read-aloud that will hold the attention of even very young toddlers. The text describes the different types of cars in a freight train, then follows the train through tunnels, past cities, in daylight and darkness. Satisfying and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Harry Choo Choo Romero is an amazing DJ.

I bought this on the basis of all the rave reviews it has received in the Music Press. Some of it may work in the clubs but as a listening experience it is grating and at times extremely irritating. The first 4 tracks on CD 1 are not that bad but the rest are just irritating nonsense. This in my opinion has been truly overhyped by the Music Press and does not deserve the rave reviews it has received. Next stop is a second hand shop for me and hopefully will get some money back on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"YIKES! Headless dancers!","review":"I guess I should have caught on to the play on words in the title - \\"Hip to Toe\\". I am a dance instructor looking for new ideas for my preschool and elementary dancers. This is NOT what I hoped for by any stretch of the imagination! The description claims this is an \\"Award Winning Rhyming Sensation\\" - how misleading! My children were NOT entranced with this strange combination of headless dancers tapping and twirling to spoken nursery rhymes. We were all quite turned off by the sheer weirdness of the whole presentation. YIKES! I would obviously not recommend this DVD to anyone in the \\"real\\" world looking for children's entertainment or training materials but it may have some \\"artistic\\" value for those whose tastes run to the \\"artsy\\" and unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Hard to Navigate","review":"My high school age son was interested in learning German. I purchased \\"I Can Speak German\\" based on the five very positive reviews listed on Amazon. After trying this program, I now think the reviews must have been written by the company.A language learning program should be close to intuitive to use. This cd rom was nigh unto impossible to figure out. Neither my very computer savy son nor I could figure out how to use it. I printed out fourteen pages from the Help section, made notes, but still found the program useless.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Program","review":"Do not buy this product, i urge you! Trust me this product is hard to actually use and i am very educated in computers. I should have listened to some of the other reviews, this one is definatly horrible. Not much on it and the German before you know it, program is missing a file to run it. Please save yourself the head ache and dont buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electronic Talking!","review":"As a huge clue fan I felt that I had to buy this because it had a talking gameboard. I was shocked when I opened it to find that it is practically nothing like the original clue. It has suspects, locations and weapons on cards still, but there is no dice and you have to \\"interview\\" all of the suspects (you look in their envelope which has a card in it...it's hard to explain). Since me and my college friends have nothing better to do we've played it almost every night since we got it. Its a really fun game if you go into it thinking that you are not really playing clue, and you are just playing some new game. But in the end, we have played at least 3 games every night, sometimes staying up until 4am.It's really fun but DONT THROW AWAY YOUR REGULAR CLUE!!(ps. one really negative thing is that since you aren't a suspect and you are a detective, there is a max of 4 players. One plus this that now you can play clue with 2 players.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"No one needs a clue to love this game","review":"Although I had never played the original Clue game, the talking version appealed to me. Clue FX is a fun game that is educational in two ways. It uses problem solving and listening skills which improve everyday skills as well. It says \\"more mystery\\" on its cover and it is true to its word. It has more suspects than the original game. To summarize: If you took the best features from every single game I ever played, plus added a few of your own that you never saw before, Clue FX adds up to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talking Clue is cool","review":"I love the way the narrator says weird stuff and such. I also like the way he says things.This game is a talking clue that is completely different from the quiet clue. It's only a 4 player game, but 2 (and only 2) players are able to play the game.It's a fun, durable game, but lacks on education."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best version of Clue","review":"I was only 7 years old when my mom introduced the original Clue to me. I absolutely LOVED it and my brother and I play it every night and it's so much fun!!! It's not only for adults considering my brother sometimes beats me and he's only 9 years old. It has a good educational value because you have to use logic. I highly recommend Clue FX although the voice can sometimes get annoying. It's quite suitable for all ages because like I said my brother and I play it all the time. Clue FX is definetly worth the money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kari's excitement","review":"My daughter was so excited to get this game. She had one but it quit working.

I already have a DVD copy. Why would I purchase another? As this is Universal's 100th anniversary, one would think the studio would have gone all out for a blu ray version.Thus 2 stars for impudence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Man Box","review":"This is a perfect film for any man who wants to be frozen in time. Every stereotype that a man should aim to defy -- strength through violence, sex through coercion, wisdom through silence and scowling -- is depicted in this film. Yes, it is compelling and hard to turn away from. I can't imagine many women would enjoy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clint's best western","review":"If you could take only one Clint Eastwood western with you to a desert island, I would recommend this one. It is a stark, moody, violent and compelling morality tale with outstanding production, fine direction, and uniformly excellent performances from a skilled cast. Clint adroitly melded techniques learned from Sergio Leone with his own unique vision to craft a true classic. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest!","review":"God Bless Clint Eastwood! This movie is one of the best damn westerns in the universe. The \\"Man With No Name\\" becomes an \\"Angel of Death.\\" This whole movie is a joy to behold. Any fan of \\"Shoot 'em ups\\" should snap this sucker up right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CLINT'S BEST","review":"A mysterious stranger (Eastwood) arrives in the desolated desert town of Lago in the 1870's. The silent drifter arouses instant suspicion and uneasiness among the populace. Almost immediately upon his arrival, he is harrassed and goaded into a gunfight by three bullies. The stranger astonishes everyone by outdrawing them and killing them without showing any emotion. The only clue to this man's past is a recurring nightmare that haunts the stranger as he sleeps in the town hotel. The gruesome dream depicts a helpless man who is whipped to death by three shrouded men, while a cowardly crowd of citizens refuses to help......... Part ghost story, part revenge western, more than a little silly, nonetheless, Eastwood the director gave notice of a solid and exciting talent; he emerged as a genuinely talented filmmaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Eastwood and Westerns this one is Cool","review":"Like the title said. I love westerns and Eastwood personifies them. If you're not into Westerns or haven't seen one in a while go see \\"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly\\"(GBU). If you don't like that you wont like this (and I don't know what's wrong with you if you don't like it). Like GBU the audio is in 2.0 mono track which sounds just fine. Like almost all other Universal DVD's the video is excellent and I believe some restoration was involved with producing this DVD, i'm not sure. The movie and story are both rough on the senses and funny. Eastwood plays a very unusual character in this classic western."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy or Tragedy?","review":"The many perceptive reviews here cover the film well, but I would suggest that much of the film, especially the first part, is really comedy. The opening scene is amazing. The Stranger rides into town. The populace gazes on him in apprehensive terror. He rides on. More fear and shuddering. On he rides, and on. Even more frightened glances from doors and windows... This goes on for EIGHT MINUTES, until the viewer has to either start giggling or stop watching. ...This is certainly a great and and thought-provoking film, worthy of all the other analyses found in the reviews; but I suggest that the comic/satirical element is not to be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eastwood's Postmodern Western","review":"\\"High Plains Drifter\\" (1973) remains one of the finest Westerns of the past 30 years, though it was sadly underrated during its initial release. The film's psychological and supernatural elements are much stronger when viewed in a modern context. Like his Oscar-winning \\"Unforgiven\\" (1992), director-actor Clint Eastwood utilizes the genre to explore the darker aspects of human nature. From a cinematic perspective, \\"High Plains Drifter\\" is superior to all the Eastwood-directed Westerns - with the exception of \\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\\" (1976) - and benefits from repeated viewings. Once seen, the dysfunctional town of Lago never can be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical Western...","review":"I typically hate Westerns. I usually find them incredibly boring. I've seen the old ones (Shane) and the newer ones (Unforgiven). I even managed to sit through The Outlaw Josey Wales because of all the hype I'd heard about it since I was a kid. Boring.High Plains Drifter is different; it's more than just a Western. I happened to channel surf to the opening credits when it was on TV years ago. I started watching it only half-heartedly, but to my surprise, I was quickly hooked. It's a very dark film with a somewhat confusing story at first, but that's what draws you in. In the end, it all comes together. Justice is served, both to the villians and the townspeople.If you see one Western, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"One of the all time best westerns. Even if you don't like westerns, you might enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up with the truncated run time???","review":"The out of print version of this DVD is 106 minutes, IMDB has a run time for High PLains Drifter as 105 minutes. The only available version is much shorter. Can someone comment on this, as there is no way I would ever buy a shorter version of a film, and no one else would either."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much Clint!!","review":"Most Clint Eastwood movies are great but this one is just too Clint for even Clint to pull off he tries to hard to be really badass and comes off just being a jerk, the plot lacks and they kept showing the same stupid flashback over and over it was about ten minuts long and they showed it over and over, slowing down the movie to the point where most of the people with me did not even finsh it. However there is a migget side kick so if your into that then this movie will probably be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Clint vehicle not deserving of its reputation...","review":"I'd read for years about how good this western is, but still put off seeing it. I'm glad I did though. I've seen it twice in the last 3 years, and it just gets duller and dumber. The supernatural angle? Painting the town red? Shades of Sergio Leone? None of this impressed me. Don't get me wrong, I love Clint. But, certain movies of his are just plain overrated. 'Unforgiven' is the same way. I agree with the reviewer who said to stick with the spaghetti westerns. They're much more entertaining and original, not to mention deserving of their reputation(s)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A NO BRAINER","review":"This movie (shown on TV recently) is without a doubt the most stupid, inane movie I have ever seen. I only watched it thru to the end as I wanted to find out what was going on............didn't work as I still don't understand what it was all about. Why the red buildings? Why the picnic tables? and on and on and on!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High Plains Drifter","review":"Another of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies. Good performances and well shot. Clint's character was neither good nor bad. He appeared as a living being even though the movie hinted he was a ghost back to avenge his own death at the hands of cowards."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Eastwood's best!","review":"This film really holds up. A great Western with a dark backstory, High Plains Drifter delivers on everything from suspense to action, one-liners to moral boundaries. A must-have for Clint fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Man with No Name\\" returns","review":"This movie is one of the best Eastwood Westerns that I have seen and is right up there with \\"Pale Rider\\" is supernatural quality. Clint plays almost an avenging spirit who returns to seek justice for a past crime and does so with his usual coolness. The movie offers a red painted town named \\"Hell\\", flashbacks showing a crime committed against Clint in the past and some awesome action scenes. Eastwood is wonderful throughout the whole film and even sports a pistol with a Cobra painted on the handle (cool! ). This is a great Western to add to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stark, shocking, and unforgettable","review":"If you're not sure what you're getting into, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER may repulse you. It's shocking, cruel, immoral, violent, and outright sadistic. Man, is it great! Eastwood takes \\"The Man With No Name\\" persona and pushes him into a new realm, sucking all essence of humanity out of him and creating a striking, mesmerizing, and unique \\"hero\\". The film almost becomes an oblique work of art, and this plus its harshness might turn-off the more conventional film goer. But there's no denying the film's power and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"This review is for Amazon.com, not the movie itself. I bought this dvd because the description said it was released in February 2009. This was not the case. This is the 1998 version. The aspect is 2.35:1, but it is not anamorphic. Played on my widescreen tv, the image was stretched out, so I had to use the fill screen mode, which cuts out some of the picture at the top and bottom. The sound was dolby 2.0 mono. The movie itself is great and I would give it 4 stars. I was only hoping for a remastered version with better sound and picture. Amazon needs to remove this listing if this version doesn't exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"180 N. Michigan Avenue redux","review":"For those who knew in vivo many of the characters forming the cast of this epic, reading the book would have an illusory experience of deja vu.Kohut and many of the members of the Institute for Psychoanalysis in Chicago had the courage to launch a new system that shook the freudian orthodoxy in its very foundations --- while in so doing managing to enrich this, until then, fading system.I highly recommend this biography as a fair and just assessment of the man (and of the men and women that formed his inner circle) and of his grasp on narcissim and empathy.Kudos to Strozier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Home Where I belong","review":"This is the wrong CD.

The sensor seems to work perfectly, causing the lights to flash for five seconds every time someone makes a basket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad","review":"This product is a good idea, just poorly executed. The batteries run out way too fast. Also, the net isn't actually illuminated, just a ring about halfway up the cylinder is. It goes off if nothing jostles it after a few seconds and you're back in the dark til you can sink one blind. On the \\"brighter\\" side, I can now shoot almost flawlessly in nearly no light!

His research is thorough and extensive and his conclusions on what we need to do to fix our K-12 schools are potentially revolutionary. His writing style is clear and concise. He includes personal anecdotes and timely references along with interesting observations about the central administration, teachers, classrooms and students which he surveyed. With the extensive data and common sense conclusions, parents and school districts should be able to fashion a better educational structure and thus a better learning situation for their students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as well researched as I expected","review":"This book contains many common sense suggestions for improving our schools; however, his figures for Catholic school spending are off.

As a parent activist and public school teacher, this book is a great handbook to revolution in the schools. An easy read, he highlights good things going on and tells you how to evaluate your school in simple words. He also grants permission to everyone and anyone to question the current system, and then take action to decentralize it. It is a practical handbook to empower the public and creat revolutionary change in public education. READ IT AND PASS IT ALONG TO YOUR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS TOO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bureaucracy Bad! School-Based Decisionmaking Good!","review":"Like many books in this field, things that should be considered obvious are presented like the author has discovered the mystery of the atom. Ouchi appropriately takes potshots at top-heavy school systems. He makes the case for school independence in direction and budgeting. All perfectly reasonable. Ouchi provides examples of schools that work because they went their own way, made their own choices. Unfortunately, the book is altogether too heavy handed. In the model schools, no one ever teaches a bad lesson and every child is smiling, while test scores \\"rocket\\" upwards. It is too much. One of his main case studies is Houston. Too bad it was revealed after publication that there was systematic lying going on in that system about graduation rates and who knows what else.

There is less nudity than in Bloodlust but the same cheapness about the segments. The zombies are done to death (figuratively speaking!) and so are comical rather than scary. The reason I am giving this two stars is only for one segment with the videotape showing the immediate future of it's victims.

That the movie lacks a story line is unimportant - the scores and lavish productions more than compensate in this opulent Victor Herbert musical.

Based on an operetta of Victor Herberts, not only is the music great but the plot and storyline are excellent. The plot concetrates on a theatre couple that is thinking of moving to Hollywood. The producers of the show think otherwise and devlop a plot to stop them, which makes the couple split up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Gem","review":"Sweethearts is seldom mentioned on the short list of great MacDonald-Eddy teamings, but it's a feast for fans: rich color photography, a funny script, and plenty of musical opportunities for the two stars, Victor Herbert purists might feel bemused to learn that this is not an adaptation of his show by that title. This film is a backstager about a couple starring in a long-running production that uses the Sweethearts songs (with some new lyrics), so it has a musical comedy feel to it, not that of an operetta. It's really a clever idea: to give MacDonald and Eddy a chance to play contemporary boulevard comedy yet include the kind of music they sang as well as, or better than, anyone else of the time. Lots of fun, too, with the in-laws sponging off them and never tiring of dredging up their old performances and shtick. Very well played by some \\"old pros.\\" What a relief to be able to own this wonderful movie outright, instead of having to wait for it to turn up on TCM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweethearts - will be returned to Vendor - can't watch","review":"I have tried to play this Video and it is impossible to watch. The screen is constantly moving up and down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Victor Herbert operetta Sweethearts","review":"This is not the Victor Herbert operetta Sweethearts. Yes, it has the name and the composer's name, but, as typical for Hollywood at the time, the story line and many of the songs that formed the basis of the operetta were discarded. If you want to see the operetta you will need to find one of the few companies that perform it live. This film is a Nelson Eddie, Jeannette MacDonald musical -- nice dancing, nice singing, opulent staging but little to do with the operetta that Victor Herbert wrote. Incidentally the color is gorgeous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radiation Hormesis - a one sided view","review":"I was very disappointed in this unbalanced view the author presented. It fails to present supporting information that refutes the concept of radiation hormesis. Many of the examples presented as hormesis are actually stress induced changes that may reduce the overall fitness of the organism. For example, the ecologic radon studies of Bernard Cohen which are stated to support hormesis have been shown by Drs. R. William Field and Jay Lubin to be without merit. However, I did find some of the writing heuristic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannon PP1 Gladstone-Style Pad","review":"This pad was horrible, and I ended up sending it back.

After about 30 minutes I knew I'd stick with the 750. Don't get me wrong, the Curve is also a nice device (the gf loves it), but I find the Windows OS user friendly and the phone keys + stylus navigation fluid. I'm not a big tech guy. I had a Nokia smart phone previously and never tied it to my email. Having every intention to do the same with the 750...within a day I had already signed up for the unlimited data and tied in my email account to the Treo. It's too good not to take advantage of. My only grief is it's somewhat bulky. This makes it hard to find a good case that's not attached to the hip.

This was after I'd already called FEDEX to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving.

I am, in fact, about to head out to my nearest cell phone provider store to switch it out with another vendor's PDA. The device just stops ringing at a whim. Then you can call certain people successfully, but not others. I've had to do a soft reset every day for the past week just to get the thing to receive calls, which is pretty pathetic for something which is supposed to function as my work phone. Before you buy this do a search online for \\"Palm 750 doesn't ring\\" and you'll see a myriad of complaints about this issue. Upon calling my service provider, they feigned ignorance about this issue which I am amazed about as how can one of the largest communication companies in the world not be aware of the hundreds of postings by people on the Internet about this issue?

After a 30-45 second hard boot you'll have to call them back and explain that your phone froze.After switching to the Palm OS version of this device I never had a problem. I love the windows interface, but it's just to buggy and unstable. (I could insert a snarky Microsoft comment here, but why beat that dead horse)PS...

But that's not really my complaint. There are nagging plot holes (like creating a whole army of feminine dolls from ONE SUPER CHIP...how'd they do that?), and the script is just so weak. I really liked the premise, but the film focuses way too much on human beings we don't really care about in the first place. Also, some of the violence is extremely out of place.

Where Toy Story had invention and wit, this film has sadism and stereotypical violence more suited to a R certificate.To call the film mindless \\"mind candy\\" is almost as worrying, if we do not \\"mind\\" such films being made, then maybe we will inadvertently condone their content.I truly hope not.The only redeemable scenes involved the Gorgonites, a film about them and their struggle to find their homeland would probably have put \\"bums on seats\\" throughout the world. But alas, that would have required skills of writing and character development, neither of which was included within the films handsome budget.Steer well clear and tell 10 people you know to do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied,","review":"vhs, i found to be in good use for my two year old, who can scratch dvds.

Even after evil toys(yeah, I mean evil small soldiers) almost destroyed their homes, checks of the evil business man can make the parents smile!(Was that 2nd grader who made this?) And the boy/girl, our main characters even smiled to this man. Do they think he is cool because he got power and money and smart plan to sell that deadly toys to south america as warfare? Very very weird. Lots of violence(Ok, there was no blood). The girl looked really wicked/pleasured when she was driving the mower to crush the toy soldiers.

Once the action starts, it's a very interesting story with fun special-effects, some good, funny dialog and some neat references to past films. Sometimes it's tough to catch them all.On the bad side, it features typical Hollywood portrayal of a family in that the film has stupid parents. Also, there are the usual anti-military messages and anti- Republican cheap shots. The story has The Commandos (military, which means bad guys, of course) against the Gorgonites (peaceful, different-looking creatures.)Overall, an entertaining film with a good mix of genres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chrildren's Movie","review":"Good for older children(8 and up) younger children might not understand the whole movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"This video really sucked","review":"At first, the movie was really good, but then it started.

It is a very mean-spirited movie and the values it espouses are not what I would want for my kids or anyone else's. The only characters with any decency of morals are the underdog toys whose names I can't remember. But I couldn't garner any sympathy whatsoever for any of the human characters or the soldiers. From the very beginning in which the boy acquires the toys in a dishonest manner, to the way people and toys treat each other throughout the movie, I was simply disgusted.

Consisting of seven songs that are mixed with monologues that move along the whole theme, \\"Pro-Choice on Mental Health\\" asks the question of whether mental health is a choice or is up to chemistry. Quite interesting and no words could do this album justice so pick it up for yourself.- J-Sin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter, are you kidding?","review":"Pro-choice on mental health by Peter Dizozza is a weird CD.

Well, they're back, and they're pissed off!! It's the best thing that could have happened to them. The new sound grows on one rapidly, and songs like the title track and \\"White Skin Black Heart\\" are great for their combined cerebral and visceral qualities. And \\"Cemetery in My Mind\\" is without question, the best Oil's song since D&D. Welcome back, boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midnight Oil has U2-itis","review":"That is to say, when Oil, like U2, were at their prime, they made some of the most exciting, beautiful, and meaningful guitars-keyboards-drum-vocal rock ever. And lately, also like the boys from Ireland, they've felt the need to experiment more and more with their musical sound, adding all sorts of synthesized or otherwise unnatural elements and thus destroying the essence of the sound that made Diesel and Dust one of the greatest albums of the 80s. The lyrics are still driven by real and aptly-put political and social concerns, but without good, interesting, and enjoyable music to back those lyrics up, it just ain't the same. I hope that both Oil and U2 return to their more acoustic roots very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment for a true Oils fan","review":"The only memorable tracks (What Goes On and White Skin Black Heart) were already released on their \\"best of\\" album. If you've got that album, you don't need Redneck Wonderland. In fact, save yourself the pain of listening to an unmemorable album that tarnishes an incredible career.I have every previous Oils disc and each one has its own character and depth. Unhappily, I found only tiresome power chords and uninspired filler on this album. I had a bad feeling as soon as I read the title. Depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"pitiful","review":"this album is by far their worst. melodies/rock edge are totally lacking. they are trying to be something they're not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Guys, this one is just plan BAD !!!!

I suppose, the fanatical Midnight Oil fan, who would gladly buy an LP of lead singer Peter Garrett farting and call it brilliant, would rate this rubbish so highly (and would explain the great reviews here), but this descriminating longtime fan calls a pass on this dud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pitiful","review":"This is simply put garbage. You can try to soften the blow by calling it experimental, but you still have to listen to it. They're missing the melodies/rock edge that make them so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"New style\\" not so bad","review":"Redneck Wonderland is a fabulous album. Some long-time Oils fans have complained about it being too techno-oriented, but I don't think so. Cemetery in My Mind is a great song reminiscent of the BSM-ESM period. Blot is about as techno as this album gets, but the Oils, in typical fashion, make the style seem secondary. It's too bad this album probably won't sell well in the US because the people at Sony refuse to promote it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile","review":"I'll admit that my first few listens to this one probably would have netted 2, maybe 3 stars. As a fan of this band for some 15 years it seemed a bit unfocused. But as time has gone by I have really grown to appreciate \\"Redneck Wonderland,\\" maybe not as the Oils best work, but an important work nonetheless. While it does not have the more assessable sound of the band's work from the late 80's and early 90's, this is an album that should appeal to fans of the Oils earlier work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patience","review":"Patience is a virtue.The first time I listened to this CD from one of my favorite bands, I was a little put off. It did not have the instant appeal of most of the band's previous work and the whole thing left me feeling a bit put off, alienated, and disappointed. But since this was the Oils I knew there had to be some redeeming feature to this.As I listened to it more, individual songs became to stand out. \\"Cemetery In My Mind,\\" for example has now become a favorite and other songs such as \\"What Goes On,\\" are well worth having.Admittedly, this is not the best Oils album, and certainly not the place to begin for neophytes. I'd prefer to be able to give it 3 and a half stars, but Amazon does not make this an option. It is, however, an album that has many rewards for the patient listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Step","review":"I saw the album at the record store, sat down to listen on a listnin' station, and couldn't listen to anything the whole way though. I love Midnight Oil from 79 to 90 but this was grungy pap with overdone bass and too much pop-grungerock. Even the lyrics were disappointing. I know their politics are still great, but the message was more muddled than I expect. My least favorite album so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oils trying too hard to be hip","review":"REDNECK WONDERLAND is a weak effort by the Oils. They apparently were angered by the election of a conservative prime minister, John Howard, and this anger shows, but is not effectively translated into powerful music.There is a good mini-album here if you listen to tracks #5,6,8,9 and 10. My personal favorite track is #9, \\"Seeing Is Believing.\\" The Oils have always made creative use of the studio, so the use of state-of-the-art techniques and producers (Magoo), is not the problem per se, but the album fails in the same way that U2's POP does -- it sounds like they're trying too self-consciously to sound like heavy metal, and like techno-rock, on some tracks, and others (the last two) are just lame.They made one more album after this one before breaking up, in 2002, and it was much better:CAPRICORNIA."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star might be too harsh, but this album sucks","review":"Let me start out by saying I am a Midnight Oil fan. I look forward to every release, run out and buy them on day one, then joyously play them for the next month solid.This one I ran out and got, put it on, anxiously pressed play, and couldn't believe my ears. I guess I should commend them for branching out a bit musically (like I think they were doing on the fine CD \\"Breathe\\"), but this was one branch they should have avoided. Their attempt at creating a different sound is an utter failure, and most of this album is unlistenable. There might be two good tracks on this CD, but I can't recommend that anyone get it for just two songs.In my defense of my one-star review, let me add that I periodically put it on (probably once a month) just to see if there was something I missed, but when it is over, I take it out of my CD player and say to myself, \\"Awful.\\" This is a very disappointing CD from a group that has previously put out only 5 star albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Midnight Oil's \\"Monster\\"","review":"While it's easy to condemn Midnight Oil for this loud, obnoxious recording and claim that they have lost their sound, let's step back a moment. Many bands have tried a new sound for one album and come back to produce \\"better\\" music on later albums. Look at REM. Frankly, \\"Monster\\" was a flop. If you don't believe me, check out any used CD shop. You'll find MANY copies of \\"Monster\\" and no copies of any of their other recordings. They experimented with a new sound and then returned to their roots. I think Midnight Oil is doing the same. Skip this album unless you are a die-hard fan and wait for the next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to refind their roots","review":"The lyrics on this CD are great, but the music leaves something to be desired. Oils have created great, addictive albums in the past, such as \\"10,9,8,7. .\\" and \\"Diesel and Dust\\", songs that hit with force from the beginning and had lyrics that made you think sewn in. They made you want to listen to that one CD exclusively for months, and then some. This just isn't the kind of stuff that made them famous. This is a grunge-like song that just doesn't go with Oils message or reputation. If you're looking for the sound of \\"Diesel and Dust\\", \\"Blue Sky Mining\\" or \\"10, 9, 8. . \\", then buy those albums, because you won't find that sound here. The sound here sounds just kind of trendy, early 90s stuff. They should take the lyrics from this CD and put it on a new one with a new sound; that sound being similar to the one they had back in their late 80s/early 90s or that of 82. I worship Midnight Oils, but this just isn't their greatest achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-Tier Midnight Oil","review":"This album rates with the best of Midnight Oil: \\"10, 9, 8...\\" and \\"Red Sails in the Sunset.\\" Like those albums it takes a few listens before you warm up to the layers, the intricacies, the detail, the craftsmanship. Then you're hooked.An excellent, intelligent, hard-driving album, with no filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but really good","review":"It's funny - all of us agree that this is a different sound but Breathe was a different sound too and that was great! After actually giving it a shot I find that I really like this aggressive effort by the Oils. It is not as pop accessible as Diesel/Blue Sky but it is a new sound and some of the tunes really are strong. A few of my favorites are Redneck Wonderland, Concrete and Comfortable Place On The Couch - high energy and definitely no room for being a slug. Nothing like cruising into work throwing back some java and getting fired up listening to the Oils unleash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Redder Shade of Neck","review":"Just when you thought Midnight Oil was the greatest group in the world, they release a lackluster album like 1996's Breathe. Thankfully, Redneck Wonderland forgoes the pseudo-country feel of Breathe and proves that Midnight Oil are still relevant. Songs like Concrete and Cemetary In My Mind shake you and almost force you to turn up the volume. This may be too intense for some. For Oil newbies, check out Earth & Sun & Moon, Blue Sky Mine, or Diesel and Dust first.[DW]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent new sound; intense; yet some songs miss","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the previous two reviewers -- this is a strong album, that with a little airplay and SOME work by Sony, would win some converts over to the Oils. If this new style could be compared to anything, I feel it would be Rage Against the Machine, but with intelligent lyrics and maturity. To put it quite simply, some of these songs rock so hard you'll wonder how your speakers can handle it; combine this crunching sound with lyrics that are at times angry, at times reflective, and always interesting, and you have Redneck Wonderland, a disk definitely worth buying. Unfortunately, \\"Return to Sender,\\" and \\"Drop in the Ocean,\\" are 2 weak tracks; on \\"RTS,\\" the Oils sound like a cheap Vegas lounge act, while on \\"Drop,\\" the style does not belong on this album. More power to them though, for the creative effort, even if I don't agree with those 2 songs. Check this out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough for my 2y.o","review":"Having been a fan since Garrett was a long haired surf bum, this was the first Oils album I shared with my son. He now asks for 'rednewunalan' and 'what goes on' and makes sure I dance (properly) with him. Living in Angola, it gives me the sound of home that 'Breathe' did not. Great stuff! I liked the experiments of 'Earth' and 'Breathe' but with this, the Oils are back. Play it loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Midnight Oil Album","review":"The first song which has the same title as the album cover, 'Redneck Wonderland' is one of the best Midnight Oil songs I have ever listened too. This song is followed by the strong 'Cemetary in my Mind' song that has some powerful lyrics. Peter Garret again excels as lead vocalist and is on par.The only two songs I felt were weak in this album was Return to Sender and Blot. The others were absolutely great. 'Seeing is Believing' and 'What Goes On' are another two strong tracks. Well worth listening to over and over. I know I will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suck City","review":"Sheesh! What the heck happened to Midnight Oil? Some awful grunge band has killed them and taken their place. This album really stinks. Long-time fans beware: this is not the Midnight Oil you know and love. There's maybe one or two tracks that won't make you vomit. As for the rest--well, enuff said. I think you get the idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"So I have to review this because Gerald Shapiro is my composition teacher, and more people ought to listen to his music. He is a very good composer, and this trio is one of his best works. It reflects a style born out of his serialist training, his involvment with the avant-garde during the heydey of minimalism and early electronic music, but also reflects the influence of everything from Bach to Jazz. Shapiro is not afraid to write expressive music with lyrical material, but as he said when showing this piece to our comp seminar, he makes the listener work for that lyricism, and this piece contains its share of crunchy dissonance and sharp rhythms. Of the other two trios on this disc, I found the Schifrin to be a little anemic in places, although the third movement has some lovely moments. Gunther Schuller's piece is much less accessible. Nevertheless all the pieces are played superbly by the Eakin trio. At this price, it's worth it just for the Shapiro piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item pictured was not item recieved!","review":"I ordered this massager because I had read great reviews about it.

Naxos has created a great recording with an inexpensive price. Although there are other recordings of the Tchaikovsky and Sibelius with Heifetz, the CD also includes a great performance of Wienawski. Being one of the earlier recodrings, it shows the musicality and maginificent technique of Heifetz. Even with its age, the music quality is still good and is still considered one of the greatest recordings of the Sibelius violin concert. This is a great CD to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ghostly flip-flop","review":"While, I found the book readable, I felt that it was in a \\"rough-draft\\" mode. The haunting that was described was scary enough, but the inconsistent telling of the story and the flip-flopping in the time line of events made it a sometimes tedious read. I felt that with the number of terrifying episodes this family went through in the years of living in this house, the book could have been far more richly detailed and I was somewhat disappointed in it's lack of real substance. The book was entertaining if you like a light read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving and tedious","review":"The story is more about the family's not too exciting life and relationships, than it is about a haunting.

However, it looks like the author published it herself, and as a result the book had little or no editing for grammar or content. The author's account of the \\"bumps in the night\\" she and her family experience in their upstate New York house is so belabored (anything unusual they see or hear seems to upset them)that in the end, nothing is very frightening.

I love murder mysteries, and though I'm not too much of a stickler for mystery novel \\"rules,\\" this book's ending broke them so badly I nearly threw the book at the wall. I can't say what this cardinal sin was without revealing the ending, but if you're an ardent fan of, say, Agatha Christie, because of the way she plotted her books, avoid this one.I'm back to reading Lovesey, and he is a wonderful writer.

Their blues are more of the modern upbeat blues, Johnny Taylor, Al Green, Marvin Sease style. Not my baby ran off and never coming back or my dog got ran over blues. I like this CD because it is jammed packed with a variety of sound. If you want to play this CD at a party and just mellow out, then some of the songs you can. If you want to get up and party, then you can. I especially like the tune Mustang Sally and Lawdy Ms. Clady. I will continue to look for more music from these two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel lacks the budget and performances of the original","review":"Although I really enjoyed the original movie, \\"Fortress 2: Re-entry\\" is disappointing in comparison. The film offers a promising storyline: John and Karen Brennick are shown 10 years later with their son, hiding from the MenTel Corporation. John is eventually captured and sent to a prison space station to serve his sentence for having another child, while Karen and her son are still being pursued by MenTel. Again, John is driven to escape from this dismal prison. The magic that made the first \\"Fortress\\" work is not present in this film. The special effects are of poor quality, and the actors' performances are not very good. This movie may be worth renting just to see what happens to the characters from the first film."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was never going to compare to the original I suppose ....","review":"All the same,this sequel to one of the greatest Sci-Fi/Action hits of the '90's is a big let-down.It looks almost like in a cheap video film the way it is shot,the budget restraints more noticeable than originally anticipated.The whole thing is acted rather blankly by all those involved too,giving expressionless performances,with the exception perhaps of Lambert and Patrick Malahide,giving a gleefully sly,condescending performance as the evil prison warden.But perhaps the worst thing about it is the dialogue.Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery and all,but there was hardly a word spoken in this that wasn't borrowed from some other flick,like ''perhaps instead of working against each other,we should work with each other'' and ''I never wanted it to end like this''.This is best admired on the levels of a respectful interpretation of modern action films,rather than anything like or resembling the previous film."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unbelievably bad movie","review":"Christopher Lambert has to be the only actor on Earth capable of escaping the first Fortress only to end up in another one. With the straight-to-video Fortress 2: Re-entry we are provided with the worst sequel since Batman and Robin, or probably even since Highlander II: The Quickening (the latter also starred Lambert).After a somewhat watchable start, this movie reaches levels of stupidity that I have rarely witnessed in a motion picture. Clichés all over the picture, hilariously bad acting, a script that looks like it was written by a 3-year old, zero-dimensional characters make this one of the most unbelievably bad pictures I've ever seen. \\"Highlights\\" include a wannabe-sad moment about the death of a cockroach (complete with sappy music!), a laughable plot twist about the internal surveillance cameras, and such a messy final escape you literally have trouble figuring out what the hell is going on.Flee, flee far away from this Fortress!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very bad sequel","review":"The first Fortress is quite good. It was directed by Stuart Gordon (of Re-animator). The sequel Fortress II Re-entry is directed by Geoff Murphy (who directed two very good sequels: Young Guns 2 and Under Siege 2) so I say to myself, it can't be that bad. Well, I was wrong. This is an awful movie. The action scenes are not realistic and plain boring. The plot, what plot? Not worth mentioning. It is a complete waste of time. Luckily, The DVD picture quality is good and the dolby 5.1 is not bad as well. But again not worth getting it not even a rental. Skip this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch it on fast-forward...Zero stars!","review":"Hey guys, are you serious? I understand it's a B-class movie (that's why I don't expect Oscar-worth performance), but I can't imagine what financial difficulties made C Lambert to appear in this laughable piece of garbage (the first Fortress was OK, I remember I saw it ca. 5 years ago). The actors are not acting, but fooling around, both bad and good characters are so poorly drawn that you don't care at all whether they live or die, the plot is.... nonsense (it's the mildest word).In short, if you had patience to sit through this movie on your coach, it's because you watched it on fast forward...Actually I'd beg you NOT TO BUY this \\"movie\\" to somehow discourage actors and producers to participate in such rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fortress 2","review":"As Fortress was an excellent film I was very disappointed with this sequel. The first one had nice ideas not in a realistic setting but in a nice way. This was just repeated and overdone in the second part so that it became ridiculous, e.g. fighting in outer space for hour without oxygen and in jeans? So I recommend the first part but forget this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I ordered this because I thought I was getting two of these, like the picture shows. They retail for 20 bucks, so the higher price made me think that also. What I got was ONE of these - for too high a price. One of my two kids was very dissapointed. Thanks.Oh, and when we tried to fill it - nothing. The water just leaks out the back of the head. This one must be defective, as weve had others in the past that worked. They really had fun with the ones that worked, hence the 5 stars for fun. But with this deal I paid 30 bucks (plus 4 for S&H;) for ONE defective worm, and wound up with TWO bummed out kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like","review":"Not what I expected.

Elli has a beautiful voice, but the music is a little too bossa nova for me. I was expecting early jazz fusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst movie I have seen","review":"I generally like thrillers and Clint Eastwood movies. But after watching this piece of dreck, I've temporarily lost my taste for both.It's a parade of unlikeable and overplayed supporting characters (George Kennedy is painful to watch); Clint doing an apparent self-parody; cheesy chase scenes; and women serving only as props to throw themselves toward Clint's bed. Some interesting scenery shots are the only snippets worth watching in these couple of hours.The #1 spot on my all-time worst movies list has, for years, been a tie between \\"Best Defense\\" (Eddie Murphy / Dudley Moore / truly awful) and \\"The Digimon Movie\\" (what a parent will sit through for his kids ...). But \\"The Eiger Sanction\\" is a worthy contender for the crown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, if you are a Clint fan","review":"Truth is: I've bought this DVD as a gift for my boyfriend, because he's a Clint fan...The movie in my opinion is laughable and outdated...

With supporting stars George Kennedy and Jack Cassidy, this big screen version feels much like a TV-movie anyway.Beautiful Swiss landscapes can't prop up a weak whodunit, diluted even further by time-capsuled character types and sexual innuendo.There are probably 40 better Eastwood movies than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hemlock","review":"Now did he throw six snowballs or was it only five? To tell you the truth, I kinda lost track myself in all this boredom.Hemlock? Leave it out. Whose called Hemlock? Do I look like a Hemlock? Yeah, more like Jack Crabsbelow.

I love this movie, the espionage story and the European scenes. Many people don't know that Clint Eastwood performed his own stunts in this movie since he was a real Mountain climber and assumed all high risk shots for the movie!! Highly recommended and the supporting actors including Keneddy are all aces!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality DVD","review":"This is one of my all time favorite movies but the picture quality on this particular DVD from Amazon is horrible - dark and grainy. I wish I had returned it when I had a chance. What a terrible thing to do to such a good movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten Eastwood film that also stars George Kennedy","review":"Simple plot but a nice change of pace considering his path of Westerns and soon to be string of Dirty Harry cop films, Eastwood is every bit his own man in this mountain climbing adventure. The film is based on a novel by Trevanian, and surrounds the story of a man sent with 3 other climbers. He is blackmailed to execute one of them while climbing with them in the Swiss Alps. Stormy weather, icy conditions and that brutal devil called gravity also prove not to be Jonathan Hemlock's friend. Eastwood plays the part of Hemlock and does so quite convincingly, but not only that this is a gem in which it was also directed by Eastwood himself! The drama that unfolds on the climb in the alps is nothing short of spectacular, and this is definitely a must see for Eastwood fans of a younger generation of his films that might have missed it the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Eiger Sanction video","review":"The picture is one of the best, however, the recording is one of the worst. It is supposed to be \\"widescreen\\" but the picture does not fill the full width of the TV screen and the aspect ratio makes the picture about as large as a thumbnail icon. Look for another version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Movie Even Though Dated","review":"This is one of those movies you can enjoy if you just let go and let the movie play out. The action keeps moving and the scenery is often strikingly dramatic and beautiful. Clint Eastwood plays the part of Dr. Jonathan Hemlock, an irresistibly handsome art history professor who finances a personal art collection by working as an assassin for a government bureau and for whom all of the women fall head over heels. The villains are suitably villainous and the Clint Eastwood character deals with them forcefully and firmly.This is a favorite oldie which still has a lot to offer the action movie fan. At two hours and eight minutes running time it takes the major part of an evening to watch, but it is fun to watch and I recommend it to the action movie fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular !","review":"Someone loaned me this book a couple of years ago......but the movie was not so easy to find.I loved the book - and I am no sucker for Spy Novels - so I was leary of the movie...they always disappoint.NOT THIS TIME.Eastwood was 47 when he made this movie - he plays a 35 year old, and has biceps (and all out body) to die for !The characters and settings are authentic. And the scenery is Truly Spectacular !Eastwood did a lot of research to prepare for this climb. And the research pays off.I love that there is 70s style fashion, and very little swearing -Who needs swear words ? We get the idea when George Kennedy says \\"screw that\\" or someone else says \\"Friggin\\" We get it !Best of all I rented this movie on my FIRE for $2.99 - the panavision fit perfectly and the definition rendered amazing visuals.If you every doubted Eastwood as a direector - watch this film.I highly recommend both the book AND the FIRE version of the movie.. can't say enough about either. ENJOY !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eiger Sanction - Worth Watching for Eastwood's Climbing Scenes","review":"Several movies about mountain climbing/rock climbing have been made over the years; the Eiger Sanction is probably the best as far as realistic climbing scenes go. The movie is older (1975) and suffers from some cheesy script at times, but there's enough classic Eastwood dialogue interspersed to make it worthwhile. I was intrigued to learn that Clint Eastwood took rock climbing lessons and actually did all the scenes himself--these alone make the film worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best climbing films ever","review":"This movie has some of the best vintage climbing footage ever. Clint's \\"training\\" climb in Utah is really fun to watch. It is a peek back in time at a sport that has evolved rapidly over the past 20 years. Hob nail boots, \\"bongers\\", manky pitons, and hemp rope make for some real nail biting footage. Clint leads a fantastic stemmed chimney (while on top rope?) were the camera man uses some ground breaking rope work.The footage of the Eiger is passable. It is interesting seeing what was considered cutting edge climbing back then. The pitches they were climbing would be considered novice routes today, provided the weather held.Plot? Who cares! It is classic Eastwood, full of meaningless one-liners. He's always retired from something, isn't he? One of my favorites. Got to love those bathing beauties at his buddy's \\"swinger's ranch\\"!If you're a climber or an Eastwood fan, you MUST check this one out! If you're not either, then odds are you won't appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Clint less the typical killing-poor audio (mono)","review":"If you're a Clint Eastwood fan, it is another must have, but with the video's mono 2 channel sound track, the DVD \\"experience\\" is a little diminished."},{"rating":"1","title":"New bottle, tint, and perfume","review":"I have relied on Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo for many years for its ability to clean my hair and slightly oily scalp at a reasonable price. It was an excellent alternative to theNeutrogena Anti-Residue Formula Shampoo.The last time I purchased this, I noticed that it was in a fancy new bottle and was tinted pale blue rather than being colorless. When I got home, I was dismayed to find that Suave has also added a vaguely floral and unfortunately artificial chemical perfume to the formulation that irritates my eyes and sinuses and gives me a headache.I can no longer use this product. I certainly hope that Suave will reconsider this change and go back to the original, almost-odorless formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior to previous product","review":"I used Suave Shampoo for Oily Hair for years and felt it was the best product on the market. Suave has dropped that product in favor of the Daily Clarifying Shampoo for Dry to Oily Hair. I have used two bottles of the new formulation and determined that a \\"one size fits all\\" approach to shampoo is destined to fail when it comes to handling oily hair. Despite washing my hair daily (as I always have), this new formulation fails to get me through 16 hours before my hair is a stringy, oily mess. This new and improved product is a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong shampoo","review":"You sent me the wrong shampoo. You sent the Naturals shampoo come on Amazon, get with it.

It doesn't foam up/lather much, so its hard to get it worked into your hair/scalp. 2. After one day, you will see oil building up again. I didn't notice much of a change in oil, and I've tried alot better products out that that will keep oil away for much longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what a great record is about!","review":"Kimbrough is tremendous pioneer in the North Mississippi sound and also a veteran bluesman up until his death in the late 90's. Do The Rump is a great record that captures the raw and drone feel of his music. This album is addictive (You listen to it once and you will be humming the songs), all the cuts are purely original (Most were written by Junior). They are I believe a shift to a more primal feel to the blues, one which hasn't been around for quite a long time. This record is a milestone in blues music, and deserves to be in your CD collection........BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Junior Kimbrough on record!","review":"This Cd is the Best Junior Kimbrough record;even though I love \\"All Night Long\\" and \\"Sad Days,Lonely Nights\\" the sound of this record is pure Hill Country Mississippi blues and has the deepest groove I have ever heard.

The gift of the Eucharist is a mystery that is well documented in the writings of the Early Church Fathers. Roger Oakland and Jim Tetlow have made it their mission to bash and misinterpret all things Catholic. Tetlow's \\"Queen of All\\" shows a lack of understanding of the person and role of the Mother of Christ, who is \\"she who crushes the head of Satan.\\"\\"Sola Scriptura\\" is a fallacy that denies the ongoing development and growth of the Body of Christ. Scripture and Tradition are both needed in discerning how the Lord is manifesting Himself in an ongoing way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it","review":"I have to agree with all of the reviews here, in some way. On the one hand, Russell DOES fall victim to a kind of flowery, ambiguous language. Like many of us who tend to write about art or film or whatever, Russell tends to get carried away with her theories and they become very self-enclosed the farther they go. BUT, I think this book is extremely useful in many ways. It really sets up the stakes for \\"postmodern\\" (ugh) ethnography and situates its filmic manifestation within our present situation. Her argument is brilliant when it shows how these questions of representation are implicit within almost any ethnographic film. On the one hand, don't read this as gospel (i dont think Russell is the kind of critic who would want you to). On the other, it is undeniable that this book is an important addition to film studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the 1star critic below for a slob's guide to an opinion","review":"on anything that he/she cannot comprehend.

It is played and sung with remarkable precision and flair, especially for a relatively unknown orchestra. Phillipe Entremont communicates his cultural roots to his forces with nothing lost in transmission. I would have preferred shorter breaths between the verses, but the energy of the performance and the spaciousness of the sound call up a vision of Berlioz conducting an outdoor performance in which the audience of thousands joined in the refrain! It was a breath of fresh air after seeing \\"A Capitol Fourth (2011)\\" with the finale accompanied by the singularly inappropriate strains of \\"God Save the Tsar\\" from Thaikovsky's 1812 overture. The rest of the disc's program is performed in a workmanlike but not inspired fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Macaulayite-Marxist Mishmash","review":"Thapar has missed a great opportunity to write a plausible account of early India. She bases her story on the discredited idea of the proto-IndoAryan people coming to India from the Levant! This theory, presented forty years ago is so much at conflict with linguistic and archaeological evidence that it has long been discarded by everyone but those in the Euroracist fringe. This edition will inspire no more confidence than her earlier text."},{"rating":"1","title":"biased, marxist representation of India","review":"Prof. Romila Thapar is a well known marxist and communist sympathizer from India. Her works have been biased by her marxist ideology and her communist background. Her works on India cannot be taken seriously at all. If you need to read what the Colonial powers wrote about India 200 years ago, and what has been seen repudiated in modern Indian history, then one should read Ms. Thapar's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time - with","review":"This author is incredibly over rated as an Historian, how else can I explain the \\"noise\\" made about this book. After reading this I have decided not to waste any time on her other titles. She shows no insight into her own people and even worse seems to provide lack of evidence as proof. I thought a newer book would attend to theories that have emerged recently and throw a perspective on it. It is too much to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good book","review":"Im afraid, Romilas out of date, marxist views of India are not in line with current scholarly thinking, in light of many recent archaeological findings.Tharpar is nothing more than the product of the British education system, that continues to perpetuates much of the coloniast attitudes on the roots of Civilisation in India.Books from Subhash Kak, David Frawley, Francois Gautier, Stephen Knapp really get to the heart of soul of India's history.India's history is much older than anyone dares to think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not highlight the right points","review":"I purchased this book keeping in mind the depth of knowledge of Romila Thapar, but was extremely DISSAPOINTED. The book completely underlights the Golden Period of India 800BC to 800AD and leaves off details like the discomfiture of Alexander (the Great :-0 ) and many other really fantastic details that could have been included. There is not much historic or literary value for this book. Not th e right buy for studying the history of India."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like It","review":"I didn't like the book because although it is comprehensive (excepting for science) it leaves one with the impression that Thapar is missing something. The book just doesn't jell with other accounts of Indian culture; it appears that using her Marxist categories, Thapar ends up losing sight of the soul of India."},{"rating":"2","title":"a brilliant work","review":"Romila Thapur is one of the greatest living historians of India. There is a misguided campaign by right wing Hindu nationalists, extremists who have no interest in a secular pluralistic India, to label her as communist, which she is not. Using the internet and other means such as some of the reviews here, they are attempting to distort her important message about the pluralistic origins of India. Her unearthing of Sanskrit texts, records and other evidence calls into question their claims that India's ancient roots are purely Hindi. This is a remarkable scholar, her work unparalleled for its rigor. Her long career demonstrates she believes in facts, not polemics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bling-bling paper towel holder","review":"The whole point of this holder is really for the bling factor. I've got one mounted on my toolbox, and while it's cool to look at, it's actually a bit of a nuisance to use.A full roll of the bigger rolls of paper towels barely fits, and don't feed very easily. Even regular sized rolls don't work that well. You have to pull the paper with one hand, and twist the roll with the other. This gets annoying.When inserting rolls, the tolerance is so tight that the tabs mash the towels and cardboard roll, so even after most of the towels are used, it still doesn't feed easily. Bending it is tempting, though then it wouldn't be dead straight, and there goes the bling factor. If it's bent too far, the short tabs won't catch the roll and it'll fall out.A cheap plastic dispenser is far better for functionality, but if it's just for looks this is the one. It's definitely not worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"voltron, blue lion","review":"i had not seen this in many years, bought it for my son, and he loved it. great sound, and picture. go 80's !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought this for my husband!!","review":"This was my husband's favorite cartoon when he was a kid, and I've gotten him the first 2 sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it !!!","review":"The cartoon was excellent. i truly liked the graphics and cannot wait till the other series comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"great show","review":"to think back to a simpler time called your childhood you can actually have a little bit back of it by watching voltron.

They dig it, and really got into the first few episodes, which was illuminating in its own right, to see how Voltron came about.The DVD's are well put together, great restoration process and clever packaging. However, I think thus far the DVD extras are fairly crude. They have an \\"amatuer\\" kind of feel to them, and though occassionally there is a bit of good information given, for the most part, the extras are fairly weak, and poorly produced. but, for the most part, I don't care, it is the series itself that is great.Add it to your collection, it is worth it.

As I had an excellent understanding of HTML already I skipped to the Javascript section and was sorely disappointed. As another reviewer has pointed out, there were several blatant errors in the code that were quite unbelievable. Surely the assignment operator (=) and the equality operator ( == or eq) should not get mixed up in a published book, yet in this case they were.

In short his inability and blatant disinterest in teaching are echoed throughout the book (and my university course).I am sure he has made a quick $buck through the sale of this book as a staple coding reference for many of the U.K. Universities and colleges (where his friends work - standard lecturer swindling technique!!), albeit at the expense of students education.My advice for any java/java applet code references is to look for SUNSOFT PRESS books (real-SUN), as they are fairly easy to follow"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are you buying this book???","review":"Is it because your professor told you to?

Earth, 6 million years ago, dominated by a malevolent alien race, enslaving a time-travelling humanity. This final book of the series handles its climaxes well and raises issues to be addressed in the future or the past -- certainly in the next series of books by May. Julian May's vision of Pleiocine Earth questions the heritage of the human race: past, present and future. It is intensely thought-provoking and draws from influences as varied as mythology, psychology, religion, politics and folklore. One of the best marriages of both hard science fiction and fantasy I've seen to date. The ending could use a bit more of a denouement -- it would be nice to have more time to savor the climax - but all in all, a masterful series that is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Climactic end of a great series","review":"The Adversary is the last in the Pliocene exile series anddelivers fireworks.

Usually if the first few books in a series are spectacular at least the next ones are decent and readable. These were neither.

It's set against the beautiful backdrop of Carmel, Eastwood's home town, and is, in my opinion, one of the most frightening films in its genre. Fans of Fatal Attraction should take a look at this movie. It's a much more believable, and much scarier, portrayal of a one-night-stand gone wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exciting Movie!","review":"This was a very exciting and scary movie. Our hero,ClintEastwood,plays the role of a radio disc jockey on a popularradio program. He has an avid listener who always requests thathe play a song named \\"Misty\\". Our hero Eastwood has a one nightstand with the fan. After Eastwood declines to carry the relationship any further the fan becomes psychotic. She harassesEastwood on a continuing basis. His girlfriend even draws theattention of the psychotic fan. The movie becomes frighteningfor the disc jockey. He begins to fear for his safety. The movieis nonstop action and very scary. It will keep you on the edge ofyour seat. Buy this movie and watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy \\"Misty for\\" Yourself","review":"Not only was this a SCARY, disturbing thriller, it was beautifully crafted and very well cast. Even the musical score played a part in the film (hence part of the title - \\"Misty\\") and Roberta Flack's romantic ballad \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\". But with music aside, this movie did not have an ounce of predictability the way many thrillers have. Instead it presented originality, suspense, drama, and wonderful acting and directing all in one complete package. This movie even took at artistic view at the backdrop and scenery (set along the beautiful Monterey/Carmel, California coast). By incorparting all these elements made this film a true complete work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Clint Eastwood...","review":"This is an excellent \\"flashback\\" of a very Sexy and Smoldering Clint Eastwood. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you longing for more Clint!!!! I am in love with the ward robe of the 70's era. And immediately wanted a trip to Monterey,California. Great cast, great screenplay and excellent location!!! I totally give this movie 5 stars and Up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play Misty for me","review":"You have to see this movie again. The reason I say again is because most of us BabyBoomers did see this years ago. It is as scary now as it was then. It's just the idea this could happen to anyone.So pick it up again and enjoy you BabyBoomers and sit back and enjoy the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Training Film for DJs","review":"When I first got into broadcasting over 30 years ago I quickly learned about radio groupies, the DJ's \\"biggest fans\\" who call the request lines to tease and flirt with the DJ in that seductive, yet deceptive voice. Because a friend recommended that I must see this movie, I, fortunately, learned the easy way how not to fall into the trap many many DJs have gotten into and continue to get into. I have in turn have suggested the same to new, up and comming DJs to watch, learn and heed. Although this does a good job teaching rookie Djs a course in ethics, the film as a film kind of stinks that's why the two stars. Poor lighting and sound makes this a true B movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I might be the only one who detests this movie. I detest it because of the way it makes me feel.You see, I identify with Jessica Walter, the female lead. She falls in love with Clint Eastwood after a very brief affair, and she wants to continue seeing him, and he rejects her.And after he rejects her she feels (as we all do) deeply hurt (the kind and intensity of that hurt varying from individual to individual).I know there is a certain decorum to reacting to rejection; there is good form and bad form. And JW followed bad form and was inappropriate. But I nevertheless identified with her, and Clint Eastwood's repeated attempts to \\"deal\\" with her made me despise him and feel all dirty inside and degraded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play Misty for Me (1971) - Forget about it","review":"This movie was terrible. It may have been tolerable in it's time, but as a movie to watch today, it was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walter's Star Turn","review":"I saw this movie again last night after many years and was pleasantly surprised that it still stood up so well. Jessica Walter's performance is creepy and compelling, and Eastwood is suitably baffled and unsettled by the way events unfold. An impressive directorial debut from Eastwood in which the star, at least partly, plays against type. Well worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Stalker/Thriller","review":"For the time period when this was made, this was an excellent movie.

When this arrived for my young children I was appaled at how much bust was showing on one figure and how many weapons were present. Add to that the \\"Poster Booklet\\" that would have caused my kids nightmares if they had been allowed to see it and I cannot understand why this toy is rated for 4 years and older. I passed the booklet along to my 13 year old neighbor only to find out his mother thought it was too much even for him!!! About all I can say is that the Spider-Man is great, but you could get more (even at this reduced price) purchasing a Spider-Man only toy of some kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Figure Set!","review":"This Figure set is an awesome one! It includes a repainted Spider-Man and Daredevil. A repainted Punisher with a cloth coat & new head sculpt and a repainted Elektra with a new head sculpt. The new sculpts are great and Elektra is just a beautiful figure! If having trouble with moving the joints just freeze them for about 15 minutes. Also stands and awesome poster book comes with this as well! Get these now for this extremely low price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Set","review":"Well, I'm not too fond of the characters in the set cause I generally just collect the female action figures, but this was a nice set of figures nonetheless. Elektra's new headsculpt is pretty weird lookin, but her costume looks great in white. Spiderman is a fun figure to pose. Punisher's jacket was unneccessary and Daredevil was a little too scrawny and short in comparison to the other figures in the series. It was a great price though and they are a nice addition to the Marvel Legends collection. Oh, and the figures arrived in great condition....the poster book bent on one corner though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool...","review":"Ok first off I wanna say that the parents that ordered these did not even care to look at the picture. Theres a guy with a bazoka ( this is a weapon used in war to BLOW UP enemys! ) And that guy is the only reason I bought this set. The Punisher is the name of this figure. He is a repaint of the Punisher from series 4. The head sculpt is really cool, and the bazoka really goes great with it. I don't care about spiderman because A) The character is a abomination to comics and B) Its a crummy repaint of a figure thats worth 25 cents. And because of this repaint I rank it down to 15 cents. Daredevil is HEAVILY shaded and you can barely see the DD symbol on his chest. Electra...I displayed her in a stabbing pose with my Punisher. Well I really wouldn't buy this set but if you really want the Punisher or any of the other characters then I would try to find it cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Senior Citizen Rediscovers Joy of Youth","review":"I am recovering from a head injury, from which I lost some of my fine motor abilities. Not very impressed with the standard occupational therapy fare, I devised my own exercise routine, which included Jacks, among other things. I was hoping that I would be able to tell which were the best Jacks by looking at the pictures online. Well, guess what? I lucked out! These Jacks are strong, sturdy, and large, just great to work with. They are better than the favored Jacks of my youth. I recommend Jacks playing for all types of neuromuscular development--this is not just a silly game. Not only are my fine motor (and planning and ocular skills improving,) but I am smiling more!."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost like back-n-the-day..","review":"exactly as described.. i'm the one who didn't pay enough attention to notice that, although these ARE metal jacks like back in the day, they are not the same size. so the person i purchased them for was excited to get metal jacks like we played years ago, they were disappointed that they were larger than what we had thus not as challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality jacks!","review":"I was pleasantly surprised when I opened up the pack of jacks and they proved to be of excellent quality. I have been using jacks as part of an American games workshop that I teach in Spain, and while I like the ones I've been using, they were either a lot bigger or a lot smaller than the ones I remembered from my childhood. These, on the other hand, are just the right size and I love their weight. I wish the ball bounced a little more, but it's okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jacks...And How to Get Them","review":"Simple, non-battery powered fun that brings me back to the bell-bottoms era. Jacks are a tad bit bigger than the ones of the middish seventies. Half are gold; the other half are silver. Directions are stated on the back of the packaging, and include an explanation of what a \\"miss\\" is in the game. Included muslin bag is sweetly nostalgic. Our ball bounced just great. I believe that jacks should still be an item at kid's eye level in every checkout lane in America. Sigh...the good ol' days. (Oh, and how to get them- just order them from Amazon; they are hard to find.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality","review":"I was very pleased with my \\"Jacks and Ball\\" sets bought for my grand daughters. The jacks are the weighted quality I would expect, and unlike some \\"Jacks\\" rubber balls, these are great - have the proper bounce needed for the game and no interferring seam to affect the straight up bounce required. I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"dislike","review":"they were not what i expected not colored jacks and they are not the original size jacks sorry i ordered them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"\\"Night Watch\\" was written by Alastair MacNeill from a story by Alistair MacLean. The plot involves the theft of a famous painting. UNACO, a United Nations detective team is put on the case. There's lots of action and locations that could have been taken from a James Bond movie, but the story is neither very interesting nor very well told. What starts as a mystery ends up as a halfhearted attempt at a spy story, and the writer adds lots of unnecessary details and a subplot about one of the characters' marriage, which slows down the pace. The book also lacks MacLean's trademark humor. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Drummer!","review":"Shelly Manne was always adding color and texture to any group he was ever in. Never over powering yet always in the lead - a total master of his craft. This LP was cut in 1967 with Conte Candoli, Trumpet, Frank Strozier, Alto & Flute, Mike Wofford, Piano & Bassist Monty Budwig. This was one of CONCORD'S earliest recordings,but not released 'til 1976. It's a nice listen thru-outand is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for older kids, not toddlers","review":"My child is 2 and he's a few years away from being able to follow the exercises on this CD. I put it in to listen, he quickly lost interest and left the room. Just for fun I continued listening and doing the exercises. I guess I'm not used to it because I got frustrated just moving my mouth so much and it got sore quickly (by the time song 2 was over, haha) Perhaps if a child is in Kindergarten or older and is used to intense speech therapy, this would be helpful to them. I wouldn't force it on any child, as much as they try to make it fun, it's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, considering it's a student film....","review":"Many great filmmakers rarely show their student work (if they have any). Even the great Kubrick, whose first film Fear and Desire is impossible to find, refused to have his first film shown widely (he called it a failed student exercise). But here is Andrei Tarkovsky's \\"diploma\\" film (as they called it in the USSR). It is wonderful. It's not Solaris, Rublev, or Stalker, but it's still worth watching over and over again. Tarkovsky was already showing his great individuality with this film. Usually student diploma films were 25 minutes and in black and white. Tarkovsky's film is 50 minutes and is in colour. The relationship between the child and the construction worker is very well done and believable, without any trace of sentimentality that always occurs in films with children (especially in American ones). When watching this, you could tell how talented Tarkovsky was. He's the rare filmmaker that never made a bad film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine First Effort By A Master","review":"This is Tarkovsky's film school production, but it already shows the storytelling skills and use of unifying symbolism that came to full fruition in his great movies.A fine children's film in its own right, and a must-have for Tarkovsky fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Discs","review":"So many discs to juggle, store and keep track of, but I guess until they put the clip art on the cloud, this is the only way to do it.

It's all the same photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I wanted","review":"It is what they said - clip art. I wanted actual full photos, these are lower quality photos of something and it is cut out of the actual picture instead of a full picture. Don't waste your money and time unless you actually want clip art retro looking graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I bought this book for a Mother's Day gift. No way will I give it to my mom. Graphic stories with sensitive content. Sure, it pays homage to mothers in some ways. But, I don't relate to it at all--not even on the \\"hispanic\\" level."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever","review":"After using gregorys/hayes manuals for my Landcruiser for the last 10 years this was like a big breath of fresh air. The detail is unbelievable and the book contains some really good pointers on how to tweak items to get them to fit not just how to put them together. Things like mm clearance on trim parts was great!! The book also has instructions that are very good for a novice car restorer like myself.Only thing that would be good is if a folder style version was available (like the original) so I could photocopy pages and take them to the workshop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully entertaining!","review":"Movie snobs don't bother--you have way too many rules for this fun little movie. I picked up The Big Tease never having heard of it so I was a bit confused at first by the documentary style. Luckily my husband (a major Drew Carey fan) recognized Craig Ferguson and I stopped trying to figure out what was happening and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The character Crawford Mackenzie is so likeable that the convoluted plot is irrelevant. There is something fresh and fun about the flick that elevates it above the slapstick and predictable laughs that plague many more commercial movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Tease","review":"This is one of the cutest 'unknown' movies ever!

I can see why the authors wanted to use the \\"good girl\\" theme as a hook, but both men and women get frustrated by negotiating. They know their stuff, from behind-the-scenes at funeral homes to scholarly research on negotiating.Their tips are very straightforward and right on. They understand the world of home-buying, car-buying and more. They are absolutely right: don't accept what's offered first.Get information. Find out what the going rate is and don't pay too much.This is a good book to keep on the shelf. Besides the general perspective, the authors offer direct guidance for specific situations. You never know which one you'll need next."},{"rating":"1","title":"written by journalist, yes...","review":"This book to me seems to written by journalist, yes.

I would like to know how many bargaining tables they have really sat behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"The book tells you what women do wrong but it does not really teach you how to do it right. The authors interview a lot of people who may know something about the topic but they do not do so in depth. They then string together a lot of quotes without real analysis and practical how to. I should have known from the introduction that the authors were not experts in this area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This book was not really what I was looking for. I wanted to think about negotiation generally, and how I as a woman am approaching it, and how I can be more effective. Although the book has some limited general advice at the beginning, almost all of the book focuses on specific situations (buying a car, getting a divorce, etc.) Since all of the situations presented were inapplicable to me, the book was of limited value. Readers interested in this title should check the table of contents and excerpt on this page. I would not have picked this book if those features had been available when I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good Girl's Guide to Negotiating","review":"For all of us who have faced the nightmare of being assertive in negotiations, in asserting our rights as individuals, consumers and professionals, this book is a must. I could readily identify with many of the issues confronting women in everday life. The methodologies for overcoming shyness and lack of confidence were extremely helpful, understandable and doable. All you need is a different mindset and approach to getting what you want. The authors are easy to relate to and thus their suggestions are easier to grasp. Through humor, the authors made their subject come alive.

Good quality, exactly what I needed for doors,"},{"rating":"2","title":"The right place to start","review":"This was not the first estate planning book I bought, but it was the best. Without dumbing the issues down, the author carves out manageable modules to make each chapter as clear and understandable as possible. The book features anecdotal paragraph case studies based on real-life examples to flesh out the major points. In contrast to more encylopedic approaches, and as part of the NOLO series, this book is for non-lawyers. It makes clear that estate planning is about how to avoid probate and how to arrange for the conveyance of your assets to your heirs. That is, estate planning not about tax sheltering per se. Obvious, perhaps, to a lawyer, but not to most people. Another strong point is the clear and cogent explanation of trusts. A trust is a written agreement that defines the relationship among the grantor, the trustee, and beneficiaries. Here as well, the book delivers big-time by rendering legal abstractions accessible to the general reader. What a great service!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date edition","review":"Unfortunately, this edition is the 4th edition, published Sept 2007, and the 5th edition was published Sept 2009."},{"rating":"2","title":"Might be the only estate planning book I need","review":"For those like me with fairly non-complicated estate planning needs, this book should suffice. It covers pretty much everything including how to name who will take care of young children.The major methods for avoiding probate are covered. I think these things could be done without an attorney for most people, although there are probably many ways to make regrettable mistakes. A lot of these things would never occur to me absent a crisis such as transfer of death car registration.My favorite sections are \\"Estate Tax\\" and \\"Reducing Federal Estate Taxes.\\" It's great to know that some people have an incentive to make cash gifts, thanks to Uncle Sam.This is an easy-to-read guide that will serve as a reference source for many years depending on how quickly the law changes with respect to estates."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Enchanted Castle","review":"This is a glorious pop-up book that enchants my 9th graders.

I mentioned the sturdiness or there lack of to the clerk and she told me alot of the cribs now a days have the plywood type supports.

It could have killed my baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great crib, Bad toddler bed","review":"This is a great crib, but, it claims to convert to a toddler bed and then to a daybed. However, the way it converts to a toddler bed is by just removing the sides. So, there is no protection from rolling off the sides of the bed. Plus, there is no different way to then convert it to a toddler bed. So, it's not a 3 in 1 crib, it's just a 2 in 1 crib. And as a toddler bed it's too high off the ground and has no side rails for protection. If you are just looking for a crib then great, but for a \\"3 in 1\\" it fails miserably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great crib!","review":"The Monterey crib is great. We love it. My son is still in it at 23 months old and it holds up so well. I love the white color because it looks good for boys and girls (a girl coming in a few weeks). It has been very sturdy - I catch my son sometimes jumping in it. It does rock a little which makes some noise, but that way I can hear that my son is awake when I am in my room. I would love to try it as a toddler bed if the new baby weren't going in it. But she will get to use it in all its stages. GREAT CRIB AND GREAT PRICE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Inexpensive Option","review":"We purchased both the Monterey crib and changing table. Both were super easy to put together with easy instructions. The crib operates like a dream and is easy to move, even on carpet, yet locks easily and securely. The changing table is large and has a lip on the shelves which is a nice touch to keep items in. I only gave 4 stars because there were a few small issues on the crib with the finish. These were so small that we didn't bother to send it back and no one else would notice. We chose this set as Consumer Reports rated the Monterey and the Jenny Lind by Delta as recommended picks. Sure, you could get a more substantial piece of furniture and you'll pay for it. We decided to go with a safe, inexpensive crib and buy the more substantial furniture for our son's later years. Overall, we love the set and it really makes the nursery cheerful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Crib","review":"I bought this before my baby was born. I didn't put it together but I was told it wasn't any trouble. My daughter Sophie is now 3 months old and I have had no problems with this crib whatsoever. I love it and it looks fabulous with the matching changing table. I bought the Laura Ashley \\"Victoria\\" crib bedding from target.com and it all matched absolutely perfect!! When I was picking out cribs I couldn't decide between this one and the Jenny Lind white crib. I'm glad I went with this one. NO REGRETS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice","review":"My father and I put this crib together in about 10 minutes. The assembly is extremly easy. The only bummer was the lever the lifts side up and down on one side was cracked. Its not a big deal we just super glued that one and won't use that side. The crib is so pretty and very sturdy. Everyone who has seen it has said they really like it alot and ask where I got it. I highly recommend it and the price is great as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks can be deceiving","review":"I originally started my baby registry online to save us some time. I had registered for this crib and was really excited about it until we actually went to see it in person. It looks wonderful online, but on the showroom floor you can tell that it's not sturdy.If you're looking for a crib that will last through your first child, this will definitely do. If you're looking for something to last through a few children, I suggest paying the extra $100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money","review":"You know, as an experienced mom buying her second crib, I found that many of the reviews have COMPLAINED about needing both hands to drop the side rails! Well, of course you WANT that to be a feature, otherwise your little angels will be able to drop those rails without much fuss and then you would really be complaining. Only adults can reach both sides of the crib at the same time. If you have one latch, those babies would be able to figure it by 6 months, then you will have them jumping the sides of the crib and falling on their cute little noggins. Trust me - the two handed latch is good! As for the quality of the crib, it is a fine crib that serves it's purpose very well. By the time the baby is getting ready for a toddler bed, the crib will be so worn out with stains, teething marks and scratches that you will want a new one for future babes... Good luck to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm...","review":"I just received this item today. Quick shipping and item was as described. I have noticed significant reduction of distortion when played loud. It seems that it is doing what it should, however there is one problem. It seems that on heavy bass tracks, when I turn the stereo up the speakers will just cut out. So I'm stuck I can't decide whether it's better to have distortion or to lose sound completely. I may have wired it wrong, but I doubt it.

I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This book just plain out bored me. What was the ghostwriter thinking when he wrote this? It made me wonder whether he was drugged out on narcotics or something. These books just keep getting worse and worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted Roots","review":"I thought this book was okay. The DeBeers series isnt my favorite series though. The 1st and second were rather boring. The 3rd was more adventurous but I didn't like Willow in this series. In the last 2 books she was so independent and actually had a personality. In this book she is bland and acts like a crazy person and a bad mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Mystery","review":"twisted roots, the novel that has caught many readers eyes, became a best selling book for its interesting plot. Its mystery and its details make readers want more. Twisted Roots is a story about a girl named Hanna, her life was a charm living in wealthy palm beach, Florida. this changed after the arrival of her new baby brother, who comsumed Willow (Hannah's mother). Now Willow didnt have much time left for Hannah, thats when Hannah decided to take a path on her own along with her boyfriend and her uncle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"Based on the title, I thought this was a medical-dental text on how to perform difficult root-canal procedures, but silly me, it's actually a novel.

Hannah is absolutely the least likable VC \\"heroine\\" ever. All she does is whine, moan, and cry. She is so spoiled and self-centered that I was hoping Willow would beat her. All the promise shown in \\"Willow\\" and \\"Wicked Forest\\" goes to the dogs with this one. Skip it...you won't miss anything...and just cross your fingers for Grace's story in \\"Into the Woods.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful followup book","review":"This book, Twisted Roots is part of the VC Andrews' \\"Debeers\\" series and is very good. Following through the series, you begin to hate that the series is ending. You know the characters and what to know what happens after the book end. A great read! Oh how I wish it didn't end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very creep!","review":"I was really sad in Willow for being so mean towards Hannah?

She whines and cries, feels \\"so unloved\\" and acts like a little baby. Stop calling her Mommy, you little brat! I could punch her! If I ever met someone like Hannah I would shake them and.... ugh. I won't even think about it. Hannah is NO protagonist! You don't care about her, in fact, you come to loath and dispise her, and not because she's \\"bad\\", but because she's boring and stupid! What a naive little fool!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!","review":"I usually fly through VC Andrews books but this one was a chore to get through. I was very disappointed. At one point I just skipped pages to get through it. I've read so much better, but this one is just blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannah cries when she's not the apple of parents eye","review":"Mommy? Mommy?? Mooommmy!!!This book is a snore in IMO. I too think Hannah is a big baby for getting so bent out of shape about a baby. The change in Willow is most shocking. I thought she was stronger then that! She acted like a complete wimp. Granted she suffered a great loss but you think she would have learned something about coping in all those psychology classes she had taken. Sure Ruby suffered after the loss of her ***(might be considered a spoiler so I won't put it) and sure she retreated to fantasy land but she would have been proud of how her daughter (Pearl) had reacted. Hannah on the other hand is nothing to be proud of. By the end of the book I was skimming because Hannah was just too irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATED this book!","review":"This is truly the worst novel ever written in V.C. Andrews' name. What kind of a protagonist is Hannah supposed to be? The whole time she is complaining and whining. So what - you're mom didn't breastfeed you? What sixteen year old acts like that?I am shocked how V.C. Andrews' name is getting more and more abused. It slowly started with the Landrys. The Logans were okay in some parts. I'd rather not talk about the miniseries and the Hudsons - but THIS is a joke! Don't even waste a second of your precious time reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannah Banana","review":"this book is typical of mr niederman's \\"vc andrews\\" books. full of whiny brats and lame villians. honestly, even the butler in fita was more evil than the halfbrothers. in response to casey snydets statement \\"what 16 year old calld her mother mommy\\" answer :ALL VC ANDREWS CHARACTERS!!!!!! seriously i stopped calling mine that when i was five. oh and mr neiderman please stop referring the male sex organ as \\"hardness\\" or \\"manliness\\" it sounds so...stupid. and please stop having the characters go into detail about their periods and the proper way to insert a tampon. a real woman knows sbout this and does not go out of het way to mention it. whats next - a character who vividly describes her bowel movements?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Using V.C.

The writing is not the same as her writings either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The first two novels in the De Beers saga were wonderful. I highly anticipated the arrival of Twisted Roots from Amazon. The beginning was okay, gave a good insight to Linden and Willow and Miguel's relationship, as well as Hannah's relationship with her father. However, I was very disappointed in the end. This book did not have a single thrilling aspect to it. And to be honest, it was a bit of a snoozer. I was even more disappointed to find out that this is the end of Hannah. Her appearance in the De Beers saga was definitely short lived as Into the Woods features the beginning of Grace Montgomery's story. If you decide to read this saga, read the first two, skip the third and head straight into the fourth. You won't miss anything, believe me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twisted Roots","review":"My sister warned me about this book. Told me it was stupid. But I read it anyways. And I have to say she was right. It was very boring and took me longer then expected to get through it.Willow was an idiot for some of the things she said or did to Hannah concerning baby Claude. But Hannah was also a big crybaby. Having a younger brother and sister in the home is a big adjustment no matter what your age. It's only happend to billions of other people in this world. So what. Why does Hannah have to be any different? Deal with it. You aren't the only one.I will continue to read these books. No matter how bad of reviews they get. This book was one of the of worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone's beginner book!!","review":"I just began taking private lessons. This book is invaluable and very easy to navigate your way through it. It's informative and I carry it with me all the time.I had taken a course in 1998 at an Adult Center and did not have a book, just hand outs. This book makes you want to keep at it even when you feel frustrated withthe grammar. I highly recommend this publication to anyone who wants a knowledge of the language or want to eventually be fluent.I purchased it on Amazon in the \\"used books\\" section. It arrived as a new book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable resource","review":"I read this entire book across two college semesters before moving to Italy. After having spent $500 or so on Italian language books, this is one of the few that was worth the money. Even though I speak fluently, I still refer to this book frequently to resolve difficult tense questions or clarify grammar details. I highly recommend this book to any serious student."},{"rating":"1","title":"too detailed grammar, bad vocabulary","review":"I am teaching a beginner 1-year long course to college students from this book. I find that this book over-emphasizes a lot of grammar points (which would not be used by the language learner for a long time to come), and at the same time the vocabulary items are almost useless (I ended up skipping them altogether for the last 3 chapters). There would rather be a need for words from everyday life than the topics given importance in this book. Plus, the examples it gives to explain grammatical points should be a lot simpler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This product didnt work at all.

Easy fun reading. I enjoyed it so much I'm now on book 4 of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cozy mystery","review":"At Home in Mitford is the first book in the Mitford series. It introduces you to the major characters (and quite a few minor ones) that Karon develops in the later Mitford books. I didn't continue to turn the pages of this book because the plot was so riveting I couldn't put it down. I kept reading because I needed to know what happened to Father Tim and the other citizens of this charming little town. Karon does a wonderful job of making the reader care about these lovable characters.Think of this book as a cozy mystery with no dead body. It does, however, have a jewel theft, a kidnapping, a runaway and several medical crises to keep you turning the pages. If this isn't enough, there is also a romance and an old secret that comes to light, so it has something for everyone. I can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"a refreshing treat","review":"I've been drawn to the Mitford series each time I visit a bookstore in search of a new read. I finally took my chances (funny how I think only Oprah can pick a book these days) and bought the book. I read it in 3 days and loved every minute of it. Not being a religous person I found the religion to be uplifting and non-invasive. Jan Karon needs to keep writing this lovely series. To all the people who said it was sickening sweet, well stick with Oprah, she can pick a depressing book at any given time. Lighten up and enjoy a funny, heart warming book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is better than the tape","review":"Most of the other reviews refer to the book version. A lot gets lost in the abridged tape version, more so than with many other books. This series is about character development, charming stories, detailed descriptions, etc. What you get in the tape is just the main plot line and conversation. No depth. You're better off with the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Edition Not Up to Snuff","review":"As a late-in-coming fan to the MITFORD series, I met the audio book with leaps of joy... after all, hearing the words in the author's own voice is a rare treat! Unfortunately, the abridgement that is so necessary to keep the listening time and cost manageable makes it almost painful for a true fan to hear... you are excruciatingly aware of each and every edited scene, and every cut rankles more and more. Jan Karon is a joy to hear, and the book remains among my favorites, but for my grandmother's Christmas present, I'm looking elsewhere. At least one other audio book producer has all of the MITFORD novels unabridged, and while they're decidedly more costly, it's worth it. Listening to an abridgement of a work like AT HOME IN MITFORD is like drinking flat ginger ale... or like eating at the Grill when Percy ain't cooking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Book CANNOT replace the real thing!","review":"I have read all of the Mitford series books out so far and LOVED them all! Excellent reading. I was excited to by the Audio Books in order to share the loved experience with my husband. So I bought the abridged audio cassettes read by the author. What a let down! You want to talk about abridged! This is very abridged. For a book that takes a lot of its basis on \\"taking your time\\" and \\"stopping to smell the roses\\", the audio book went too far in leaving entire chunks out! You do not get a feel for the characters or events. It's like Cliff Notes for \\"At Home in Mitford\\" on tape! I do not recommend the abridged version of these audio tapes. Made me feel very rushed and left my husband very uninterested! I rated it 2 stars instead of 1 because I did enjoy hearing how Jan Karon \\"personalized\\" the characters. I especially liked her rendition of Mrs. Sadie Baxter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite book of avid reader","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books and I read a lot. I enjoy anything from Grisham to Nora Roberts, and I just can't say enough about this book. I can't wait to get the others in the series. I was reading this on an airplane and I found myself laughing out loud. Very spiritual book! Made me do some soul searching. Read it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I just finished Mitford and I already miss it!","review":"I cannot wait to collect the whole Mitford series and continue following Father Tim's adventures. The gentle spirituality of this book is a tonic. I thank Jan Karon for introducting me to Mitford. I encourage everyone to visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleepy Town Excitement at its best","review":"My aunt raved about this book when I visited her last Christmas. I wish I would have read it right away. This book is fabulous! I could not put it down. The characters could have been my neighbors, the situations were realistic and the solutions to problems were uplifting. It reminded me of Cold Sassy Tree by Olive Anne Burns. It is amazing how much can happen in an \\"uneventful\\" mountain village. I can't wait to find out what happens when Father Tim returns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Americana at its best","review":"This book was a pleasure to read. It is well-written and easy to read. The characters are not fully developed but they don't need to be. This is a slice of life book about a country pastor and the folks in his town. This story demonstrates the faith in a higher power felt by most Americans. The beauty of this book is the way it is subtly inspiring and faith promoting while delivering a great story that keeps the reader coming back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sweet, too simplistic, too juvinile-lacks real conflict","review":"This book was required in my book club and I felt like I was swimming in molasses it was so sweet except for the gross descriptions of Dooley's dumps. How can adults spend their time on such juvenile reading? It's not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"its not Mitford, its Stepford","review":"I don't know how so many people love this book. There is no story, no conflict that can have a satisfying resolution, no challenges, no passion- at least not up to page 155 which is where I bailed out. I thought perhaps when a new neighbor is introduced, she would discover the alien pods lurking in everyone's basement, but I see from the back cover, she actually marries the main character. They must have got her too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"I seem to remember hearing that a book had to have some tension in order to have a plot. If this is the case--At Home in Mitford has no plot. Several members of my family recommended this series to me. They were all in the 60-plus demographic--could that account for our differing opinions? I wouldn't recommend this series to anyone. The characters are one-dimensional and barely discernible from one another. The writing is simplistic and unimaginative. And as I have mentioned, the plot is nonexistent. I won't be reading anymore about Mitford--well except if I need a good sleep aid..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"I am still wondering when the book will actually begin. What is it about? There doesn't seem to be a protagonist, antagonist, plot or story line. I keep looking for a conflict of some sort, character development, etc. The characters are so predictable and sappy. Any thought provoking ideas here? I think not. I really can't figure out why thousands of women like this book so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satanism","review":"After reading this book I considered converting to Satanism just so I wouldn't be associated with these people or thier creator, Jan Karon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickeningly sentimental fantasy which disappointed me.","review":"I am usually a sentimental and empathetic person, but with this book I found myself feeling manipulated and quite unmoved. What was the time and place supposed to be - an English village of 50 years ago? It was not believable as a present day American town, I don't care how rural it is! The dialogue never rang true and the characters were just too quaint and folksy. I felt like I was trapped inside a Thomas Kinkead painting. I enjoy the folksy thing as much as the next person but let's have a bit of reality. Show me a twelve-year-old boy who talks the way this one did. I was hoping and wanting to like this book but was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly-written waste of time","review":"Jan Karon has a hard time keeping track of her characters names - at least two first names change throughout the book and one name vacillates on spelling {Jena/Jenna}. The author's overuse of the word \\"he\\" is more than just irritating; it is confusing. Numerous times, \\"he\\" refers back to the wrong antecedant. And, a small \\"h\\" is even used when referring to God. The plot, if you could call it that, is boring, and the characters are unbeleivable. Catherine isn't described fully to us [as a blond] until the book is almost over. If J. Karon wasn't going to describe her characters when they were first introduced, she should have continued to stay mute instead of dashing our own creative images of the characters when the tale is nearly through. I had to read this for our book club, or I would have stopped after trying the first hundred pages. My open-minded husband disliked the book, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Too Quiet Life","review":"First off, I want to say that I did enjoy this book to a certain extent. It is pleasant to visit a place where neighbors know and care for each other. I especially liked Father Tim; it is rare to see a positive portryal of clergy in fiction books these days. Yes, Mitford is a pleasant place, nice and quiet. Too quiet.Near the end of this book, I must say the story was becoming dull and too sugary sweet. There are now seven (?) of these books--which proves you only need one idea to make a living as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"We all agree this book is complete schlock.","review":"My women's book group at church read this book because we heard it was so popular. We all agree it is one of the worst books we have ever read, a complete waste of time. It is true that this book is like candy, empty sugar, no value. There is absolutely no depth or meaning to this escapist nonsense. One of the parts that really points this out is the fact that the pastor finds out he has diabetes and begins his exercise program by jogging a mile up a hill on the first day! This author can only appeal to those of little faith who cannot accept and live in the world given us by the creator but instead want to live in a sappy dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version too expensive","review":"I was shopping on Amazon for Kindle books, and noticed that the paperback version of this book is cheaper!How can that be, unless Amazon or the publisher is gouging the consumer!? The whole point of buying a Kindle was advertised as a way of getting books at a pretty standard price. Thiskind of pricing is a cheap shot at the consumer. I will not buy this book for my Kindle, unless the price becomes in line with the original claims of pricing for Kindle books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quiet type of book...","review":"My mother recommended this book to me, as I am constantly sending her books via Amazon.com! For me, it is much slower paced than many of the books I usually read. It began so slowly, I put it aside for awhile, but after reading all the enthusiastic reviews, came back to it. Mitford is truly one of the quiet towns that many of us dream about retiring in, where everyone knows everyone else. As my parents both hail from that exact type of Southern town and are very active in their church and social lives even today, I can see why Mom enjoyed the books so much. I'm looking forward to see what happens next in the lives of Father Tim, Dooley, Cynthia, and of course Barnabas! This book is perfect for evenings before bed or whenever you need to be assured of goodness in today's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Home in Mitford - By Jan Karon","review":"The book gets right down to LIFE.. it is easy reading, and I found myself saying \\"I will read just one more chapter...\\"! (could not seem to find a good place to stop.) Was also so nice to read about LIFE ... Life the way it is.. or at least may I say, the way it used to be... I I loved it.. I have now gone on to the next book \\"A Light in the Window\\". Seems the next book is ever bit as good as book number 1...Thank you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome To Dullsville","review":"This is the most boring book I have read in a very long time. The chraracters are all introduced as if you already know all about them; there is very little depth to the character development, even for the main characters. They are all \\"nice\\", which is very dull when it lasts throughout the entire story. And where's the plot? The preacher wanders the town, out of touch with all reality except that of his little sphere, and minor things happen to him. Pointless. Skip this book and read something with substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointing","review":"I so wanted to like this book. I live near the area that inspired the Mitford series and for years have meant to get around to reading the first installment. I was shocked to discover how tedious and poorly written it is. Karon doesn't seem to have a natural feel for engaging plot development. Her narrative is forced, contrived and often full of holes. Her characters are disappointingly one-dimensional and her belabored efforts to capture regional dialogue are shameful. I imagine it is possible that this series improves as it moves along but I found At Home in Mitford so painful there is no chance that I will continue. My hat is off to the powerful marketing minds that promote this series because they have definitely spun a silk purse out of a sow's ear. My recommendation is to not fall prey to the advertising hype. Borrow, do not buy, the first book. If for some reason it clicks for you, then you can invest in purchased copies of the subsequent books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Depth","review":"I read At Home In Mitford and though it a book without depth. It reminded me at first of James Herriot's books. His books I liked; this I didn't care for too much. There were no surprises. Also no suspense throughout the book. I knew what was going to happen. There would be a new heart for Olivia. Emma would marry her much younger man. I actually had to put the book down when the man came out of the bell tower. Not really. Would a real preacher want a wife who lets rollers in her hair? It is cute for the story but not in real life. All in all I simply didn't seem to be able to get in this book. It was a cute read. The end"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"My husband and I have a basic rule for movie or television watching, and I'll pass it on to all of you : \\"Never keep watching a movie/program about people who are more boring than you are.\\" After just a few chapters of Mitford, I'm ready to extend the rule to books. The Mitford people are the world's dullest! I'll never be able to finish this book, and wouldn't want to -- there are too many interesting stories in the world (fictional and nonfictional)-- why waste time with dull ones? (PS. Like the characters in the book, we live in a small southern town and we are Episcopalians. I don't recognize either the atmosphere of the town of Mitford or the characteristics of the people.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"I've seen these books everywhere, (That should have been my first clue - truly excellent books don't end up in the dollar resale bin) so I was looking forward to reading this when it turned up on my book club list. If you ever find out you have two weeks left to live, move to Mitford because every day is a freaking eternity! I would not have finished this incredibly boring, preachy, plotless book if it wasn't required reading for the book club. Needless to say, I'm not interested in the rest of the series. If you want to read about a bunch of lily-white, holier-than-thou, cutesy, unbelievable small-town folks (who must have some secret income somewhere, because their jobs and their lifestyles are completely incompatible), then this is the book for you. I thought it was one long snooze."},{"rating":"1","title":"One visit is more than enough","review":"I agree with the negative reviews ... poorly written, boring, flat characters, utterly predictable and annoying. However, I also somewhat understand the appeal of this book. Warm, safe and comfortable.It is a chore to \\"keep caring\\" up until the end. One of my problems was I hated Cynthia. (Tim's love interest) WHAT A SILLY PUTZ.\\"You were wonderful\\" she coos to Father Tim after he plays the \\"knight\\" and rescues her cat (again) because \\"oh Lordy pooor Violet\\"\\"You're lovely\\" she says to Father Tim. Who goes around saying \\"you're lovely\\" to people they hardly know?She acts like a child half the time. She actually cried when she burnt supper and knightly Tim has to rescue her once again. Blech and double blech. I kept hoping she'd die or fall in love with someone else.I am utterly aghast that this book has turned into an actual SERIES. YIKES. THAT is going TOO far. I would never read another Mitford book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland beyond belief","review":"I had such expectations for this series, hoping for a good readable story without all the unsavory things that turn up in books these days. Well--lucky for me that I checked the first one out of the library and did not waste my money. The characters are flat, two-dimensional, and do not think or speak as real human beings. I was stumbling through, forcing down a few pages each night, but after the insufferable brat Dooley appeared with his \\"poop\\" obsession, I gladly gave this one back to the library. Everything in this book is lame--characterization, dialogue, plot (if there is one). This one is bland beyond hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"The nyquil of recent fiction","review":"I wanted to like this book. I like series, I like small town America, it seemed that this would be a perfect book to curl up with. I actually feel guilty that it just didn't grab me. The idea of a pastore in a town that feels hopelessly out of date sounds good, but Karon didn't quite pull it of. My biggest complaint is that it is boring. I just didn't care what happened. There was very little excitement, substance, or even plot to keep the story moving. It seemed that the general gist was that Father Tim wanders around town and then goes home. That's it. A disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the other side of dull","review":"This book was so boring. Nothing happened, dog barked, pastor took a walk, rode his scooter, visited the hospital...If your looking for an exciting/drama filled book you will be disapointed. This would be a good book if there is nothing else to do and you just want something very calming to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A caveat...","review":"This book is an incredibly well written prose tone poem. I admire the craftmanship... I admire the beauty of the subject... but I have rarely been so bored in my life. I'm going to finish the book though. I think it probably is good for me. But... there are no gladiators, no high speed chases, no Andu'uvian death rays, no smashing planets, no knights at war, no.... well you get the picture. I don't know how to rate it. I want to give it a \\"zero stars\\" and I want to give it a \\"five stars\\".... I do honestly think that many people would enjoy this book. It's restful. There is much love portrayed here. But... there are no gladiators."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Song","review":"Having read the 5th book in the Miford series first, I appreciated the character reviews that Jan Karon gave. I got so engrossed in those characters that I am now starting the read At Home In Mitford and intend to read all of the Mitford books. As I grew up in a Methodist parsonage, these books with Father Tim are very heart warming to me. I'm glad Karon gave those small character reviews for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"need more large print books and magazines!!!","review":"This book was fine for my sight impaired mother..... however the packaging from Amazon was very poor....two loose books in a cardboard box. substandard for Amazon!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written","review":"This book has it all---good plot, great characterzations, and humor. I could not wait to follow up the book with the another one--to \\"visit\\" Mitford and all the people that inhabit this magical place. Each book has new intrigues to keep readers motivated to come back for more.Like many things I find myself doing, I began reading Jan Karon's books, backwards---that is, I started with HOME TO HOLLY SPRINGS. And that might be the best way to do it. I was so captivated by Father Tim's character that I could not wait to go back to the first book in the series. I have not been disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flaw in Kindle Version","review":"Jan Kaon's vignette style depends upon frequent use of white space between sections. The Kindle version of this book does not incorporate white space the way Karon intends--or at least the way the original print version did--and this causes awkward (and sometimes confusing) transitions between story threads."},{"rating":"2","title":"At home in Mitford","review":"this was a gift sent to the jail near me, for my nephew he received it in a timely fashion but refused to read it. I love the story and have a copy myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Home in Mitford","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It was a very \\"peaceful\\" read. I could pick it up and continue any time and just enjoy where the story took me. I liked the main character Father Tim. The other characters in the book were equally fun. I am considering reading the rest of the books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Town NC - reality","review":"From having lived in a small town in NC (as did my entire family) this book is quite accurate in its detail, thinking, talking, and the interactions between the people. It isn't too heavy but it isn't insipid or too cute, either. It is the book that finally makes you feel good and lifted up."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are 50 + and raised in VA or Carolinas, READ THIS!","review":"This is a terrific book and it was shared by my sister, my Mother, my daughter and myself! If you grew up in the south, this is a town you can identify with OR lived in!! I would love to move to Mitford and go to that church with Cynthia and Dooley and Ms. Sadie. Not to mention eating at the Main Street Cafe (is that the correct name?) Anyhoo, it is one great set of books that I have inhaled and I'm passing them on to my seniors to read. I WANT MORE!! Thanks for giving us great summer reading, Jan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on home!","review":"Jan Karon creates an absorbing cast of characters in this novel, the first of the Mitford series.Central to the story is Father Tim Kavanaugh, bachelor priest at the Lord's Chapel Episcopalian church in the small mountain town of Mitford, North Carolina. Father Tim leads a quiet life. That is until Barnabas the dog and Dooley Barlowe the pre-adolescent enter his life, and he begins to develop a friendship with his neighbor Cynthia Coopersmith, and countless professional and personal concerns intervene.The plot is interesting, but the book stands out for its likable, true-to-life characters, and for the peaceful atmosphere that permeates it. Father Tim, with his unflagging devotion to God, is an inspiration.Jan Karon's books have entered my canon of \\"comfort reading,\\" perfect for a pick-me-up when I tire of the darkness and dysfunction of many modern novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"Let me say that 50 pages into this book, I knew it was going to be an alltime favorite. As I reached the halfway point, I was sad to know that I'd soon be finished. I am cheered by knowing that I have 4 more books in the series to go.This novel has opened my eyes to the beauty of small town life. I have also looked for ways that I could show such care and kindness for those around me, even though I'm in a big city.The characters are so real--with flaws which just make them more human. I laughed at loud many times, especially at the only thing that controlled Barnabas the dog.If you are a Christian, familiar with church politics; from a small town or with ties to one; a Southerner; a dog lover; or a human being, you will find something that grabs you in this little town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mild but MARVELOUS","review":"Granted this is a mild easy-going book but it does such a great job in building the characters! I was captivated the entire time. How could a book be so interesting with out murder, scandal, and sexual tension? There were no sex driven lords and cheating ladies. I praise the author who can write a delightful book without using too much sex and drama. Love this book. If you like this series, you should read M.C. Beaton and McCall Smith."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd like to escape my corporate world to live in Mitford","review":"People seem to have a have a love or hate reaction to Mitford and little in between. I fall into the \\"love it\\" category. I work in a very high pressure corporate job and find the quirky, imperfect, loveable characters an appealing reminder that there is another way to live. I read to relax and recharge and have come away from these books re-energized. What a differnce from some popular, but depressingly bleak books that are out there (on my \\"yuck\\" list, A Thousand Acres, She's Come Undone). Come to Mitford and remember that there are good people in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Home in Mitford","review":"Sweet series of books, but copied ... from the older Thrush Green books by \\"Miss Read\\", the English writer. Check them out on Amazon.com and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The characters in Mitford are generally a sweet lot but have no dimension. I could not, in good conscience, recommend this book to anyone. I understand why people have been drawn to Mitford and its inhabitants. Everyone there is nice to one another. Everyone knows everyone's name. Sort of a \\"Cheers\\" without the beer. If you feel that you must read this book because your friend thought it was \\"fabulous\\" borrow her copy. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sweet","review":"I was excited to read this book after hearing so much about it. I was sorely disappointed. The plot was transparent. I don't mind a page-turner, but this book totally lacked substance. It's not that I require blood and guts to be satisfied with a book, but this book was so saccharin-sweet that I needed to brush my teeth.One of the most annoying things was the author's method of writing dialog (\\"'at ol' dog...\\") ... it was cumbersome to read. The way the rector kept quoting scripture was too contrived ... as if each day the author read a Bible verse and forced herself to incorporate it into the story.Beyond my distaste for the unbelieveable sitatuions, I did not think this book was written well (case in point, is the character \\"Jena Ivey\\" or \\"Jenna Ivey\\" ... we see it both ways)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"After hearing all the uproar and seeing the multitude of book store displays devoted to Mitford, I found the actual book to be trite and contrived and (gasp!) not at all well-written. Karon has somehow misplaced her village--is it Yorkshire? is it New Hampshire? Certainly, it isn't North Carolina. Her dialect was unconvincing and at times downright confusing, her characters were all too pious, and her village a bit too idyllic for my taste. I also found the book to be edited carelessly--someone referred to as Leo is referred to as Lou several pages later. It's all a little too white bread for me (in fact, the only African American character is a domestic and is quaintly referred to as a \\"raisin\\" by Our Hero). If you want small town life brought to life with humor and charm, check out EM Delafield's Provincial Lady series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is like a breath of fresh air.","review":"This is the perfect book to take on vaction. The author creates an engaging picture of a small North Carolina mountain town. The hero is an Episcopal clergyman in late middle age, and he is surrounded by all sorts of entertaining villagers. The writing is suffused with a gentle humor. What is unusual is that the author treats religious people with respect and seriousness, and even manages to teach some spiritual lessons, albeit in an understated manner. This book will make you laugh, and may even bring a tear to your eye. I am telling all my friends to rush out and get this book, and I look forward to reading the other books in the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring boring boring","review":"Well, I finally finished slogging through Jan Karon's \\"At Home in Mitford\\" more than a month after starting it. I haven't found any book to be such a chore to get through in a very long time. If you're a fan of good literature, don't believe the hype and AVOID THIS BOOK LIKE THE PLAGUE. If you're offended by anything and everything the secular world offers up, then by all means visit the local library and check this out in order to be clubbed over the head with 450 pages of inoffensive drivel. Just don't tell me what a wonderful book this is. Because it isn't. THIS IS NOT A GOOD BOOK. PERIOD. No plot, poorly written, and dull, flat, one dimensional, forgettable charcters. Need I go on? And there are eight books in this series? I can't even imagine. Marketing genius but little else.For a vastly superior series of novels set in rural America with a religious theme, check out anything by Jon Hassler. He blows this Mitford nonsense right out of the water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow as molasses on a cold morning....","review":"...applies to this writer's attempts to evoke a 'folksy' ambience in her Carolina mountain town. Unfortunately, what little plot there is seems very contrived; attempts at representing vernacular speech are awkward; paper doll characters plod through the standard \\"village locales\\".The premise of following villagers' daily lives is similar to the PBS tv presentation of the series 'Ballykissangel' but without any of the hilarity, pathos or conflict which that series so ably portrayed.I'm pushing through to the end, reading aloud sections in the evening, during which my husband invariable drifts off to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"My teeth are disolving","review":"If you get down to this review,you just like reading reviews, but as I went down through the reviews I found a trend: Those that listened to the audiobook didn't like it. I listened to the audiobook and I didn't like it either. It's abridged and read by the author. I usually like that arrangement, because I feel the author won't read it if it's too badly abridged. This is one of the worst abridgements ever! The story jumps from one situation to a completely unrelated subject with no transition. This was a book for our book club. I'm glad I'll miss the discussion session for this book because it was AWFUL! The writing is stilted - even people from the Ole South don't talk like that any more, and the story, as you've read above, is pure Mayberry - but this show wouldn't have lasted a season, even if it were the 60s."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Harmony in Mitford","review":"I read all of Phillip Gulley's books about Harmony. He writes from the minister's viewpoint. This author is not a minister, and while she has a great command of the language, it takes her too long and too many words to describe what is happening. And what is happening, for the most part, is not usually consistent with the life of a minister, which I've been for over 30 years. Almost all of what Gulley writes has or could happen to any pastor. However, this book is written well, and is in the style of a novel. Parishoners will find this more appealing than would pastors."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT HOME IN MITFORD","review":"I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS BOOK, IN FACT THE WHOLE MITFORD SERIES BY JAN KARON, TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS A GOOD WHOLESOME TALE, WELL TOLD AND WITH REALISTIC, LIKEABLE CHARACTORS. BY THE TIME YOU HAVE FINISHED READING EACH STORY YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU ACTUALLY KNOW THESE PEOPLE, AND HATE TO SEE THE BOOK END."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peaceful Retreat","review":"This is the book that hooked thousands of us on Father Tim and his adventures in this sleepy town. I could see the town and all of its characters, especially the diner. Thanks Jan for sharing this world with us. I read the whole series and enjoyed it immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressively Superior!!","review":"No other series of novels captures your heart like the Mitford series. They are the paramount of penned fiction on the market. You easily believe the characters, merciful Tim, uncivilized Dooley, and artistic Cynthia are totally real and so is their quaint charitable town. It is far superior to Mayberry! You will enchantingly sit down and open \\"At Home in Mitford\\" and believe you are a resident watching the animation of winsome daily life unfold.Due to his pastoral commitment, Timothy places you in captivating unfolding mysteries; making your spirit churn in anticipation of the next unraveling segment. It just takes this one book to hook you on the delectable bait of sequels.I live in Idaho, but was recently in North Carolina where I tried to depict amiable Mitford. You do want to believe it is real!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel through Mitford to Bliss","review":"I'm a big Mitford fan. Have been from the beginning. It's so nice to find a retreat from a tough world. Having read every Mitford book, I was delighted to find another book that travels the same course. (I needed a new book to read). If you love Mitford, you'll love Bliss, Mississippi in the new novel The Town That Came A-Courtin'. I have read an advance reading copy and strongly recommend it to all who love Mitford. We cannot have too many books with Christian values, quirky characters and pure fun and joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful, heart-warming inspirational book.","review":"Jan Karon I hope you keep writing this series foras long as your able. I feel like I know thesequirky characters and I love them like family.This is truly one of the best books I ever read.I am now going to jump on the second one and savorit as I savored the first. This is the kind of book Oprah should honor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Syrupy, insipid, predictable","review":"A rather insubstantial, predictable lightweight novel. I would suggest readers try reading \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" to get a better picture of small town southern life. Way too heavy on the religion too - I wouldn't have bought it if that had been apparent in the reviews"},{"rating":"2","title":"gave me a good, warm-fuzzy feeling that stays with me still.","review":"This series was wonderful! Such an idyllic world we all long for but never seem to quite find. I didn't want it to end and hoped to find more by Ms. Karon. Jan Karon, you are truly blessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energizing, Fulfilling, Just Plain GREAT!","review":"If you want to relax and put your worries away, read any (and all!) of Jan Karon's books. They challenge you to remember that there is good out there - and revive your Christian spirit. A sure-bet, can't miss read. Read \\"Miss Fannie's Hat\\" - or give to a child - heartwarming. The best around! I almost jumped out of my chair when I saw her latest coming in April - my book seller will be relieved now that I no longer will harass and ask for any information on a new release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Characters you want to stay in touch with.","review":"It is true you become a part of these people and the town.

My aunt bought me At home in Mitford and I absolutely loved it,it is like eating candy.I really reccomend this to readers of any type!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoy Visiting Mitford BUT The Main Character Is Boring","review":"I have read the first three books of the Mitford series and I am more interested in Cynthia, Miss Sadie, Rose, Billy, Puny, and the group at Main Street Grill than I am in Father Tim. I think Tim spends too much time wallowing in self-pity. Tim even admits to wallowing, but does nothing about it - except say thankful prayers for having Cynthia and the others who put up with him...then he continues to think of himself. Tim is a weak main character that has yet to gain any strength.I do enjoy the Town of Mitford - I hope Jan Karon gives Cynthia, Puny and the characters at the Main Street Grill a voice - I am tired of hearing about them through Father Tim.I highly recommend the Miss Read series of which J. Karon has spoken. Miss Read is a strong main character with that wonderful English wit - that only the English can master."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of Faith, in a town, and time which is pure fiction.","review":"Mitford is town in the South, in which, I'm sure, everyone has blond hair and blue eyes.Ms Karon has managed to fictionalize a revisionist view of the South, in a town in which no evil exists, and everyone Loves everyone - except for the newspaper editor.Whatever evil exists, is extrinsic to Mitford.Tensions, when they are occur, are quickly resolved.The amount of sugar in this book is enough to send any diabetic's blood sugar soaring.One trip to this town was all I would want, or could take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable and Light but Enough Already","review":"This was enjoyable and was a light read, despite the dog who understood scripture, which was a bit overdone. I wasn't able to get past the first 3 pages of the next book, A Light in the Window, because it was just too much of the same 'ol same 'ol. I'd recommend this book as a light read in between really good literature, but save the sequels for once a year reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your life is hectic, try this at the end of a busy day","review":"I loved the Mitford series. At times, they are somewhat slow but I found them all hilarious and relaxing. No confusing plots, no fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants love scenes, no complex characters, which, in this day and age, is somewhat refreshing. I found myself smiling a lot and laughing out loud many times. Father Tim is a friend to all and we should all be so lucky to live in a town like Mitford."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeeelightful!!","review":"If you like \\"feel good\\" books, like to laugh, smile, chuckle and just be thoroughly entertained by a book.....then you will want to read this. Then you will get to know the people so personally that you will also want to read ALL of the books in the series. I am now just beginning the second one, \\"A Light In The Window\\" and am looking forward to it. There were times in this first book that I laughed so hard I had to put the book down until it passed. It's like visiting with much loved neighbors and friends each time I pick up the book. OH...it also has some suspense, intrigue and most other things you find in just every day life with every day folks. A totally delighful find in a series. And....as an added bonus, it also gave my faith a much needed shot in the arm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitford and Jan Karon have a special place in my heart!","review":"As a voracious reader, having read hundreds and hundreds of books over the past twenty years; I can honestly say the Mitford series has been the best yet! Never has a fictional book touched my heart as these have. As I began reading the series, I found myself making changes in my life brought about by Ms. Karon's writings. Familial relationships, friendships, my faith, and my personal contentment have all been enriched by Father Tim, Barnabas, Dooley, and the gang. Thanks to Ms. Karon for empowering her readers to find peace, happiness, and contentment in their own lives through the lives of her gentle characters. I'd like to correspond with other readers about the Mitford books if anyone is interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing after a daily dose of reality","review":"Yes, it's syrupy and a little hard to imagine at times, but it makes for a great escape after a hard day at the salt mines (or the middle school). I thought the characters were lovely, and most of them reminded me of individuals with whom I grew up in a small town in Tennessee. I also appreciated the Bible passages sprinkled throughout the book. It seemed as if Father Tim, Cynthia and Olivia were quoting scripture to meet my needs. Perhaps we cannot yet find Mitford on a map, but Karon encourages us to keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous!","review":"This is the town where I want to retire when my time comes!

Too wholesome and preachy!","review":"This book is just too nice. And I mean that in the blandest sense of the word.

Don't Read It!","review":"I was actually looking forward to this selection of my reading group and planned to read the entire series. It was agony getting through this book - simplistic and dated language prevails. I kept thinking I was reading about a priest in the 1950's rather than the 1990's. In fairness, it had some nice moments, but there is not any depth to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starry eyed author with predictable characters","review":"I read this book upon the recommendation of my godmother who lives in North Carolina. Perhaps being a resident of that state makes this syrupy saga more palatable but I found it discomforting that the solitary \\"outreach\\" program the church promoted was a bi-annual visit to one homeless person carrying some food. It was also disheartening that the only black in the story was the town matriarch's housekeeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read.","review":"Really enjoyed this book.

Anyway my husband finally found a stargazer Woody (who only says one line from the movie, the rest are new phrases) and I had already ordered this one.We gave this one to my 2 year old and the other to my 3 year old and this one gets more love (carried around most of the day by 2 year old) than any almost any toy he has had so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Toy Story Woody","review":"This is the second Woody doll my granddaughter has received.

The rose gold colored band makes it quite unique and really sets off the dark blue watch face. I have already received numerous compliments on the watch. I had to make the band smaller and brought the watch to a jeweler friend of mine. He was not familar with the Invicta brand but said the watch band was very well constructed, reflective of a high quality watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating \\"Affairs\\"","review":"If you like Regency romances, spies, and intrigue, Leslie Davis's \\"Dangerous Affairs\\" will keep you up way past your bedtime. It's hard to put down. The heroine, Kit Winslow, visits England only to get (literally) tangled up with a spy--Sir David Sherwood. She is both fascinated by him and frightened of the danger he represents. She is tricked into an unwanted engagement to David's cousin, fights off kidnapping attempts, and insists on continuing her dangerous investigation into David's activities (as, of course, their attraction for one another grows). The suspense keeps you turning the pages until all the subplots are finally tied together in a very satisfying ending. Suspense, romance, a bit of humor, and a pleasing ending--an excellent summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book with a good lesson","review":"The Pearl by John Steinbeck is a very good book. I would recommend this book for everybody because it is a good story about how a person's life can change so quickly. A poor Indian family didn't have the money to take their sick baby to the doctor until they found \\"The Pearl of the World\\" and it turned their lives around. Kino (the main character) doesn't think twice about all the things they can get with it. Greed starts to take over Kino and the pearl turns to evil. At the end Kino finally realizes that the most important thing to him is family, but it's too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful lesson to be learned!!!","review":"The Pearl is a capturing tale. It shows how good things aren't always good and how they can bring bad things into one's life. Kino killed for the safety of the pearl. This book shows how evil arose in a man by a simple thing of value and beauty. Money doesn't buy happiness, health or love, we have all been told this and The Pearl is a perfect example of this. Everything has a price and Kino learned that that price was high. And he learned that price cost him alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good moral, but couldn't relate to the book.","review":"I liked the book but not that much. There was a good moral.

They went to see the Doctor, but the Doctor dont want to see them because they dont have any money. Then Kino found the great pearl. He thought this pearl will make his family happy. But this pearl brings them many troubles.If you want to know more just read this book. You will like it and you will learn many things from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pearl","review":"I thought that The Pearl was boring. There were only a couple of exciting parts, but the rest was boring. The story teaches a good point, though. It teaches that riches can't buy happyness, but can ruin a family. I think that Steinback could have said the same thing, but made it more interesting. The story could easily be a true story, and I'm sure its based on one, but it isn'y really a likable storyline. I think that the story was supposed to be symbolic because every sound that happens is translated into music. Kino, the main character hears the \\"music of the family\\", the \\"music of the enemy\\", the \\"music of the pearl\\", etc. so it gets kind of boring. Every so often, there is a word in Spanish, and if you don't understand Spanish, it is a little confusing. The book is okay, but I definatly wouldn't recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Basic","review":"This story has a basic moral to it.

Its is very interesting"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was horribly boring","review":"This book was a very classic american tale.

The Peral discusses behind the scenes political ideologies, corruption by money,economic theories,and the political ideologies are particulary specified about the theories of that time. Though if you want a blatent action and chase book with some violence this is also a great book for you. The Pearl was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Greedy Person","review":"I thought that this book had a good christain moral to it. It talks about how a person like Kino who had found a pearl and became a very greedy person. Someone who is greedy, is a person who wants that object all to themselves and share it with nobody at all. I like this book alot and it shows us the difference between right and wrong. I didn't like how Kino treated Juana and his people. I also didn't like the fact that the people in town treated Kino and his people like dirt and also like they were a nobody. When Coyotito got stung by the scorpion and they took him to go see the doctor and the doctor didn't want to help them because they were Indigenous people and he will only help them if they had money. Kino and Juana were poor people, they didn't have alot of money and they wanted the doctor to help Coyotito get better and not die for this scorpion bite. The doctor was mean and rude, he didn't want to help Kino and Juana, just because that they are Indians."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TOWN'S GREED","review":"This book \\"The Pearl\\" by John Steinbeck is a story about a family of three that live in poverty but they have thier morals to live by. On one tragic day Kino and Juana's son Coyotito got stung by a scorpion. For them to be able to pay a doctor for a cure, Kino and his wife Juana went in search of a pearl. After they found what was said to be \\"The greates pearl of the world\\" every one in town wanted part of it. So greed aroused in La Paz. Kino's family was attacked and tricked. Accidents,murder,rage and drama happend throughout the book.I gave this book two stars, because this book I would say is for bigginer readers or for a younger audience. It was an interesting novela. If you're a person who doesn't read much you might find it very juicy and full of suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"-","review":"I can enjoy a moral or allegory as much as the next man, but I wanted something more than this from Steinbeck. The novel seemed stripped down compared to his others, like a skeleton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise, but a one-time read.","review":"The premise and plot of The Pearl is excellent. The struggle of man against money and other man is a hard one, and this book brings it all out. However, the dialogue is very dry, and there's hardly any of it. The book is enjoyable in some parts, but only some, and you find yourself reading to finish it, not reading to actually enjoy the book. I have to give John Steinbeck some credit for expressing the thoughts and feelings of the characters through the music of Kino, but, bottom line, be glad its only ninety pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry I read this book","review":"John Steinbeck took an interesting folk story and thoroughly overprocessed it. He doesn't spoonfeed you the morals of the book, he uses a big shovel. That poverty is blissful, and wealth will only destroy happiness, is ground in from page one. It doesn't take long (a few days?) for anonymous residents of Kino's otherwise utopian village to burn his house down, steal his boat, try to kill him, and chase his family out of town with horses and guns. All for a pearl which the brokers won't buy....To achieve a similar effect, hit yourself on the head with a rubber mallet and read a few chapters of the Bible. This way you will experience tedium, moral lessons, and a headache without paying ... for an 80 page book."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEADWOUND","review":"This book seemed very passable to me. I had nothing but criticism for this book because i was honestly very dissapointed. The dialogue seemed very repetitive, with Kino continually saying,\\"The song of the [insert noun of choice here]\\" throughout. It seemed very redundant. Also, the story dragged and I was just waiting for something big to happen the whole time. In my opinion, the only redeeming feature about this book was the moral. It maintained a good moral; Money can ruin you and your family. But honestly, i expected more than a fortune cookie moral out of John Steinbeck. Truly a dissapointment, and ultimately passable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"In this book, the theme \\"Wealth and Materialism will destroy\\" is drilled in repeatedly in ways that don't vary too much from each other. It had a weak plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!","review":"I read this book when I was in 7th grade and I still have not forgiven my teacher. I can honestly say that this was the worst book I have ever read. Maybe I would have enjoyed it if I was a little older, but I found the characters and plot impossible to relate to.

It is stupid, and pointless. Some parts of the book are good and entertaining, with good suspence. But there are not many parts like that in The Pearl. The best part of the book was when the baby got his head blown off, hiding in a cave... in the last chapter in the book. The book ended on that sad note, which I dont like.

The book is so small at only 90 pages, although the pages are fairly long...but still, it was a short book. In my opinion, I would NEVER recommend this book, unless you HAD to read it for school.

Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed. I dearly beg that any who read it do not judge Steinbeck's writing ability by it. The only way to describe that thing is lame, lame, lame. Many have claimed it to be as good as Of Mice and Men, but how it is even comparable is beyond my mental capacity. This story was a required reading for my Sophomore English class, and it definitely turned off quite a few of the students to Steinbeck's writing. It lacked his flourish with detail and his wonderful analyses of the human psyche. If you want to read something short by Steinbeck, I would recommend Of Mice and Men. His stuff is a little bit deep, so don't bother if you just want a casual read. For those who wish to spend more time, I HIGHLY recommend The Grapes of Wrath. It is an awesome book, prolly one of my favorites at the moment, but it is rather long."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT READ!","review":"The Pearl, by John Steinbeck,was a book I decided to read after a friend told me about it. It was fairly short and didn't hold any meaning. I truly think that this was Steinbeck's idea of Indians' poverty due to white man rather than a great idea for a novel. He used the two different societies and the doctor's greed to show how the white man tore the Indians apart. I think he chose a pearl as the jewel to be found because it is pretty close to white in color. The evil pearl buyers were also implied to be white people trying to kill Kino and his family for the pearl. The basic storyline could have been a descent novel had Steinbeck not thrown in all the other stuff. I would not recommend this book to anyone due to the content implied on the white man. If you must read this book, get it over quickly (you could probably finish in a day or so) and read The Count of Monte Cristo."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull and boring","review":"I am in grade nine and was literally forced to read this book by my English teacher.

I don't hate because I was forced to. I actually enjoy reading and try to be positive about each reading assignment. However, this is a clear abomination. First of all, the story goes too slow with forced dialouge. Plus, the ending was very sad. Perhaps I shouldn't always expect a Disney ending, but come on! But what drove me nuts is how the neighbors had to FOLLOW THEM EVERYWHERE! And they had to get into a big stir over something they wanted that belonged to the white man. Sheesh! Leave the family alone for crying out loud! I know I won't get many helpful votes for this review because there will be English nuts on here who think that any time spent not interperting the meaning or symbolism on so much as a cereal box is wasted and that anyone who dosen't think that is the truth is an ignorant bum, but I had to say this.

Although I must say that the one highlight was the very end because it was surpsising and for once actually interesting, although it should've been more detailed. I would recommend this to only the type of people who enjoy reading a book for the descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm....","review":"k so this book was okay...but id take a good mystery book any day! it has some good point but it was a bit borin...but i think this book is more for older people and not for like us teens...i mean im 14/f and sorry to say i realllyyy thought this book was borin...i readi it in 7th grade and i cant remember anything (so i kno itz outright boring) definately suggested for older people"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, But Schools Ruin It","review":"This is without a doubt one of those books that many of us had to read while going through school. For me I had to read this for a freshman year English class. I decided that I would re-read this book, because I knew I had enjoyed it. Without a doubt it is still on of my favorite books, but is by far one of the most depressing books that I've ever read.If you don't know anything about this book, it focuses on a husband that is also a pearl diver and how his life is impacted when he finds \\"The Pearl of the World\\". If you are looking for some happy reading, feel free to get a different book. But, if you are looking for a great classic and a story of light and dark, pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book about the way men and women act","review":"This was a great book to read.

The book was not at all interesting and it took me about a week to finish it b/c I could never sit down long enough to be that bored. If u are assigned to do a report on this book, beg ur teach to let u out of the assignment. I'm definitely not exagerating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, you can't get much better","review":"I decided to read this book after a friend had suggested it, and I am so glad that I had done so. This is one of those books that in order to get the full feel for it you should slow down while reading it. Though you can't seem to you always want to know what is going to happen next. I feel this is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical of Steinbeck's work","review":"This book is...okay. If you're into Steinbeck. Unfortunately, I think that after OF MICE AND MEN, the man had nothing new or more to say. Nonetheless, the idea of a precious little bauble like a pearl bringing such tragedy and unhappiness is an intriguing one, and had it been handled by someone other than Steinbeck, it would have made for a more powerful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Meaningful","review":"I believe that if you truly understand literature, and spend enough time really reading this book with care, you will realize what a deep and true meaning this book holds. There are lots of hidden meanings, and much that shows humanity and truth about people. It was very beautifully written, with clear images and detail. It was fun to read, and had a lot of inner thoughts that you'd have to read carefully to grasp. I really recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Goodnight Pearl","review":"If I didn't go to sleep with this book, nothing has ever made me sleep before. No wonder The first book by Steinbeck wasn't a hit. If Night pills don't help you get your zzzz's, this book will.

I liked when Kino, went diving in the ocean to find, the \\"THE PEARL OF THE WORLD\\". This book can also show you how money can turn a man into a very greedy person. It also shows how a family should stick together even if something goes horribly wrong. The Pearl also shows that you can have a Pearl or somthing else worth alot, but if you have excessive greed its worth nothing. Is it really worth losing your family, and freinds over money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, short read","review":"In The Pearl, John Steinbeck keeps the story very short. He doesn't waste words with filler, yet he provides thrilling images, complete details included. The concise, almost perfect word choices keeps the reader hanging on every word, no matter how near or far the plot is from the climax.The short-story, full of twists, turns, and heart-stopping suspense, is about a three-member family led by a poor pearl diver, Kino, in a Mexican community. After the young couple's baby child is bitten by a poisonous scorpion, the two do whatever they can to save the infant's life. A tale of struggle, surprises, and social discrimination takes the reader through the changing lives of this Mexican family. A great, easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting find.","review":"When you read this book you might find it boring and dull, and maybe even sad, or think it is uneventful. When I read it that is not what I thought at all. John Steinbeck wasn't trying to make you happy and have the book have a Hollywood ending. Steinbeck was trying to make a point. If you can't handle reality then I wouldn't recommend this book to you.Something else you think about when you read this book is the style of it. Steinbeck uses a lot of descriptions and a lot of simililies. When you finish the book if you think back to what you remeber you'll see you have remembered some powerful stuff. There are sentences that stick to you like gum to the bottom of your shoe.The reason I liked this book so much is because it has a great affect on you. You learn a lot of lessons. You might not the ending or the plot but what you learn from it it's worth it. That is why I recommend this book to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSICAL STUFF---AGAIN!!","review":"READ THIS 20 YEARS AGO---JUST---RE-READ IT AGAIN.SCOUNDRELS---THE WHOLE BOOK IS LOADED WITH THEM---KINO INCLUDED.

This was a terrible and disturbing book that was awful I reccoment highly that you do not read it because it is messed up and awful. The ending is also terrible because it is a big disapointment and you realize how much time you wasted reading this book in the first place!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal Short Story","review":"This is a very short work, more accurately labeled a short story than a novella, easy readable in 1-2 hours. Its theme is as old as the hills, \\"be careful what you wish for, lest you receive it.\\"Kino and his wife Juana live a hardscrabble existence with their newborn son in a straw hut on the beach, where Kino scratches out a meager existence as a pearl diver. Kino's discovery of \\"the pearl of a lifetime\\" changes his life over night. Kino imagines all of the positive things the pearl will make possible, while his wife soon recognizes it as a source of evil which soon gives rise to a string of disasters which they struggle in vain to overcome.Again, there is nothing original in what is essentially a parable of untold age. It has been compared in style, setting and theme to Hemingway's Old Man and The Sea, but in my opinion, it suffers by comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courtesy of Teens Read Too","review":"Kino and his wife, Juana, have a beautiful baby boy, but one morning he gets stung by a scorpion.

You'll have to read this classic novel to find out.THE PEARL is a very short book that, honestly, I wouldn't have chosen to read except that it's for school. It's a very basic story, but everything in the book also has a double meaning, which is thought-provoking.Reviewed by: Taylor Rector"},{"rating":"1","title":"An over-rated story that benefits only from being short","review":"This repugnant insult that Steinbeck has slung upon his readers has nothing to recommend it except for the author's name. This short, nasty and brutish little tale is completely predictable, and I expect that this was the case when Steinbeck first foisted this on his unsuspecting public. It is only 90 pages, which means that the misery does not go on for too long. Teachers like to assign it, which no doubt helps explain the popularity of television among the adult population. (If this is \\"Literature,\\" then give me a nice \\"ring around the collar\\" commercial, please.) Although many people refer to small books as short and sweet, this one would be better described as short and shoddy. Our copy went on top of the junior high school's roof, where it doubtless is now enjoying the lofty station that it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book and every sentence was painful","review":"I really do not know why this is considered a \\"great\\" book. It was written very poorly and had many mistakes. I thought it was a rule to not start your sentences with AND, its a conjunction! I have not done any research to this book but I really hope it was translated or something. Honestly the ending did not phase me. It was supposed to be sad or tell a lesson but it didn't for me. I wouldn't have finished this book if it wasn't an assignment in English. This book is for someone much younger than me but the concept at times is too mature for elementary school. I like books to I'm not some TV loving teenager. Just don't read this book you have a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is boring,","review":"but it has a surprise ending.

It took me about 10 pages before I got into the book. Even though it does not grab your attention from the start it gets it around the beginning.I don't like scorpions at all myself; so when the scorpion attacked I was in !!KNOTS!!. The whole time Steinbeck is talking about songs I'm wondering, \\"What can the meaning of this be.\\" Indeed Steinbeck uses a lot of hidden meanings and foreshadowing in this novel.I was very disappointed in this book as in \\"Of Mice and Men\\". The story is fairly exciting but the ending leaves more to be desired. I felt like there was not very much of a good point in the story. Maybe in the meaning, but not in the story. I felt like I was walking in circles as I read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike's Review","review":"I feel as though John Steinbeck did a wonderful job writing this book. This story gave real instances that happen everyday to different people all over the world. He did a good job at keeping the book interesting. I was never bored at all throughout the book, from cover to cover. The book was filled with excitement and action. He didn't start the book out with a bunch of boring, meaningless details that no one really cares about. In the end of the book John ends it very tragically with the killing of his son Coyotito. Kino goes through many difficult situations in the book, and selects many different ways of acting in them. All this just shows that money does not mean happiness, and John Steinbeck did a great job at getting that point across in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeper concepts that really hit home","review":"I must say that I really did enjoy this book. It was rather short but I found this to be a good thing. It doesn't drag on or draw anything out. It has a lot of deeper meanings and teaches a lot of things that most people learn through their own mistakes. It shows a lot about primitive society and how greed rules people. How in our lives we are consumed by our fast paced society or the things we think we need but really only want and sometimes forget about the things that are true. How things that can seem so pure and good can really be evil and bring destruction. This book shows how money does not equal happiness and trusting and listening to those who are closest to you is an essential. This is a definite must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too descriptive and not enough dialogue","review":"This book is meant for serious readers who like the feel of getting into the book.

This is a very intriguing book that all readers are easily to relate to. In this book the people who were very poor and didn't have much to choose, from so whatever they had they made good use of it. The wealthy tried to take over the poor by looking down on them,and at one special moment the poor had something great the wealthy wanted so they tried to trick the poor into giving them the great thing. The great thing in this story caused family to slighty fall apart in ways that result in death. Something so great can cause a father to be keep and then risk his child's life. After reading this story you will see that everyone is created equal, but some don't seem to think so at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting study of circumstances..","review":"The story of Kino and his wife, Juana, and their little baby son, Coyotito, and of what happens when Kino finds a pearl in an oyster bed.

Then the family goes out to the oyster bed and Kino finds the biggest and most splendid pearl, the Pearl of the World. He goes later to the pearl handlers and they only offer him 1500 pesos when he thinks it should be worth 50,000 pesos. Someone or several someones attempt to rob him several times and at one time, Kino accidentally kills a man, so the family goes on the run to the big city. They hide in a cave in the mountains, and the trackers almost catch up to them. The story is complex, with a moral and fantastic descriptions of the surrounding countryside and the culture there. I would recommend reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book; poorly bound","review":"I love this book but wish Penguin would put a bit more effort into a decent binding job. Charging $9.00 for a slim paperback that will often not survive a single reading in the hands of one of my students seems excessively high."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pearl","review":"The book, The Pearl by John Steinbeck, is an excellent story about how greed can corrupt an innocent man. In the story a Native American man, Kino, his wife, Juana, and their infant son, Coyotito live in an Indian village in Mexico. One morning, a scorpion stings Coyotito. Kino and Juana rush little Coyotito to the doctor in the nearby town, but are turned away because they are too poor to afford the doctor's services. Later that morning, Kino goes diving for pearls and he surfaces with the biggest pearl that his family had ever seen. The rest of the story regards Coyotito's intensifying illness and other people trying to get the pearl. The book has a rather depressing ending but the moral of the story about greed and human nature is extremely apparent by the end of the novel. I highly recommend this book to anyone with two to three hours of free time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I ordered this for my grandson (we share Kindle access) and read it myself.

Steinbeck wrote this rubbish to be made into a hollywood movie, and the hacked cliche ending makes M. Night Shamalas look like a visionary genius who takes risks and doesn't make stupid last second endings that make absolutely no sense.Now Steinbeck is arguably the best storyteller in post1492 America history. Read Grapes of Wrath, Winter of Our Discontent, Cannery Row, the Red Pony, East of Eden, Travels with Charlie, Tortilla Flat, Of Mice and Men, even To A God Unknown, before you even pick up this book if you must.

I thought that the beggining led into the story very well and there was a good plot line. It flowed well until the ending. I didnt like how The Pearl ended with Coyotito dying, and Juana and Kino going back into town. I felt like the story was missing something. But i guess that is my own interpretation. Steinbeck was writting more then a story, he was trying to express his beliefs and personal feelings on the matter. I think that the economy at this time also played a big part. It was the end of WWII, and money was a bigger deal to people.I think that the pearl represented a lot money, and kino found the pearl and then became distracted by it and was greedy and didnt care as much about his family. I thnk that Steinbeck had great ideas and should be commended for his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Johns best...","review":"The Pearl is about a man who finds a pearl while diving for clams, and his life gets worse from there. The pearl that he found was bad luck from the begining, and the book only gets worse. Steinbeck descirbes in great detail, but it takes him two to three pages to describe the kitchen sink! Also, the story is very depressing, and if you need an uplifting book, this is NOT the one to read. I have found that almost all of his work is like that, and find it unappealing. Even though, the story has good morals, money is not everything in the world, and the main character in this book finds this out the hard way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greedy","review":"The Pearl is a timeless classic about how much shame greed brings.

One day it comes knocking and eventually tore them apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"No wasted words in this novel","review":"The plot of this novella is simple and fast paced. What makes \\"The Pearl\\" a worthwhile read is the author's exceptional writing. Steinbeck is one of the best fiction writers that I know.

The descriptions are just enough to transport the reader to the location and time of the story but at the same time not too detailed to be boring.

The plot of the story and its lesson is nothing you couldn't pick up reading a children's fable. Not only this a children's fable is more amusing considering it has more likable characters.I have never believed it to be a good thing when halfway through a book you're rooting for the main characters to die. Not only this but die in some completely random nonsensical way so that you can at least have the fun envisioning a family swallowed whole by a swarm of rabid ducks.This story although very brief with scant few pages failed to keep my interest past the first chapter.

I wish I could at least say one good thing about this book but sadly nothing comes to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crummy parable glorifying poverty and ignorance","review":"John Steinbeck wrote several bad books (The Red Pony, Tortilla Flat, The Grapes of Wrath...), but this one just might be his worst. His message to the poor and ignorant: \\"Be glad you're not rich and smart---money and knowledge are the root of all evil and only lead to misery, so take comfort in your community of poverty and ignorance!\\" Leave it to a successful, well-educated \\"humanist\\" to write an absurd, contemptible little parable glorifying these things. It isn't even well-written (even for Steinbeck), and the story is truly ludicrous.At least Steinbeck wrote some good books too, books like Of Mice and Men, The Winter of Our Discontent, and East of Eden...pick up one of them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pearl","review":"Tanya WilliamsThe Pearl was the most boring book I ever read in my life.

The ending was the only good part, because it was hardly expected, but the rest of the book was a huge dissapointment.

Our English teacher sure loved it, I don't know what was going through her head. Not only is it boring, the moral is so head-scratchingly complex that it is simple beyond words. This book digs into reality and comes up with dysfunctional characters in a completely pessimistic view of the world. What the author was trying to accomplish was realization of what can happen when you're not compassionate and greedy. Yet Juana, Coyotito and Kino demonstrated something more relating to hell. Certainly do not read this if you want a happy ending, for there is none. However, despite the mediocracy of this book, others by John Steinbeck aren't nearly as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a boring book!","review":"I believe The Pearl is a book that could have had great potential, if it would not have been so depressing. I also believe The Pearl was very predictable. In my opinion the author didn't put too much thought into it. I know a 5th grader that could have writen a better novel. Most would say The Perl stunk, well i say to those people, \\"Right On.\\" If you are made to read this book over the summer i will tell u right now try not to read it.

This demanding work of Bach may be regarded as one the most treasured pages of the musical literature ever written.His prodigious musicality and above all, the phenomenal lyricism displayed around every single piece, admirably played, without those traditional poses of reluctant exhibitionism, make of this set a must-have in your valuable collection.Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarah Bernhardt Plays the Piano","review":"Picture a middle-aged silent screen star leaning, half-collapsed, against a table, the back of one hand pressed tightly against her forehead, emoting for all she's worth. That's what the playing of Elizabeth Rich reminds me of. There's a lot of sighing, swooning, calling out in alarm, crying buckets of tears. This reminds me - sans the wrong notes - of the willful playing of Vladimir de Pachmann, the great pianist-ham of yore. In fairness, there is less chewing the scenery in the 'Novelettes' but in 'Carnaval' one hardly knows from one section to the next what is coming. There are languorous moments with wobbly tempi followed by flurries of notes that blur accents, harmonies, melodies.Pass this one up, unless this old-fashioned and highly individual style of playing appeals to you.Scott Morrison"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funeral Parlour Vampires","review":"The pillars of society (sheriff, doctor, funeral director, ambulance driver) in a small town turn out to be members of the undead. Still alive accident victims are pronounced dead at the scene but are taken back to the A.Lucard funeral parlour where the above's bloodlust is satiated. Why does an old woman who has been turned into a vampire die when hit by sunlight yet the main undead characters walk around in daylight with no ill effects? The undertaker applies mortician's wax to his face the same way people who go the beach apply sunscreen. As if this would protect him from the rays of the sun!

The cap itself is sold stainless steal and will most likely last for years.My only negative about this purchase is the same as everyone else. I had read the reviews before purchasing and thought to myself the plastic cannot be that bad... I cannot stress to you enough how bad the quality is of the actual plastic air gap piece. I had tightened everything down by hand only, then when moving the flex drain tube to attach to the garbage disposal... POP!! there went the threads on the air gap. So I ran over to OSH and picked up a better one for $5.99 and just put the stainless steal cap on that instead.IMO, the cap itself is worth the 15 bucks.

However, this held two bikes securely to the back of my car. I was careful to tighten all of the straps and had no issues on the interstate or over bumpy roads. The only difficulty was that it's really not made to hold small bikes and I had some trouble mounting my five-year-old's bike to the rack. However, with perseverance, it worked eventually. I used the extra length in the straps to secure the front bike tires while driving. I am happy with this rack and with the price offered by Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low cost, effective, fairly easy to install (once you RTFM)","review":"Given the price point, this is a hard system to beat. I don't really recommend it for two bikes (it seemed to bounce a bit on rougher roads, and that made me a little nervous). But for single bike users, it's great - takes about five minutes to get set up, and folds up for storage in the trunk.

Furthermore, three bikes barely fit on this thing, half the time the pedals or handle bars are jamming into each other. The pedals would also hit my read bumper and leave scratches because the rack is TOO SMALL, and too DANGEROUS. They should seriously discontinue this piece of garbage.

His pedals had to go through my spokes......NOT A GOOD IDEA! Easy enough to install but with only having 3 straps to secure it to the trunk of the car made me nervous. I wish I would have shopped around more and did a little more research before purchasing. Would love to return it if it were an option.

The inside bike holder is too close to the vehicle so your bike will rub, bump, and just generally destroy the back of your car. I have a nice car and now there are scratches, scrapes, and a place there the inside bike bumped up and down repeatedly, leaving huge pock marks on my bumper.

This is per the instruction manual. Without tying knots, the buckles WILL slip. I barely made it 5 miles before having to adjust the rack as it shifted, and I wouldn't even dream of ever riding on the highway with this thing. I am returning it immediately, as I don't feel that asking me to tie a knot after the buckle is acceptable for this type of device. My recommendation is to spend a few more bucks and get something that holds securely on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for in-town use.","review":"Fits perfectly on my 2005 Honda Accord. It is SUPER easy to put on and take off. I usually just remove it and store it in my trunk while riding to avoid theft. When I transport my bike, I use the outer-most spot to avoid having my bike rub against my car. I also use a couple of extra elastic straps to secure the tires/handlebars. I have a women's trek mountain bike, and did not need to purchase the women's bike adaptor: it fit without it. I haven't tried it with two bikes yet, but I question whether it could accomodate two bikes comfortably?? I use this rack for short distances (5-10 miles, in town at lower speeds), and I also question whether I would want to use it for longer distances or highway driving....seems it might be a little more unstable for that purpose. Bottom line, if you are looking for a easily installed rack for in-town transport, this is perfect....highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap unstable rack.. NOT recommended!","review":"I am extremely disappointed with this rack. I got it because it was cheap, and it is precisely that: cheap, and unstable. On a recent trip, it came loose and my bike was dragging on the road, scraping the tire and burning it. I should have sprung for a better rack; this cost me a whole new tire, rubber and metal. With that money, I could have got the rack I really wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty much what I expected","review":"So this bike rack is pretty much what I expecteds it to be for the price. But it works well enough once you know a couple of tricks.You need to put felt down under the metal hooks so that they don't scratch your car, you need to tighten the straps to within an inch of their lives, You need octopus straps to secure the front wheel/handle bars/peddles while you're driving, and you can't speed along bumpy roads while it is on.I have found that it is ideal for driving in the city, but as soon as you can speed up it gets a bit jumpy.Also I have a hatchback car, and there is no way whats so ever that I will be able to get 2 bikes on it. Whick doesn't worry me so much, as I only have one bike. But If you needed to put 2 on all the time, I would invest in the 3 bike holder.I am really happy with it,it's easy for one person to put on/take off once you get the hang of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+ Awesome, Cant beat it for the price!","review":"Works very well on my hatchback, 1991 VW GTI. Solid, feels very secure, simple easy installation. Have hauled 2 bikes with no issues at all. For the price you cannot beat the functionality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well on '04 Cadillac SRX","review":"This was exactly what I was looking for in place of paying for/having installed a trailer hitch. The carrier is as stable as your placement of the metal hooks and your ability to tighten the straps. There is excess slack in the nylon straps so you can make it even more secure by tying a knot. That being said, I have comfortably carried both a hybrid and mountain bike on the highway. Hybrid ways 26 pounds and mountain bike is probably around 35 pounds. This is an excellent bike carrier for the money and a viable solution if you don't have a trailer hitch."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORKED FOR ME","review":"I WAS SCARED THIS RACK WOULD NOT FIT MY CAR OR THE BIKES I WANTED TO PUT ON IT, BUT IT DID.

While entering a parking lot, I crossed a speed bump at 5mph and the plastic buckle snapped in half. My bike hung a bit but it didn't completely fall off. At least I can still carry one bike on my formerly two bike rack. I'm not too confident about it though :-/."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job","review":"I hesitated to buy this bike because it was so inexpensive....but I read other reviews and went forward and bought.

I've gone up to 75mph with one and two bikes (hybrid and comfort bikes, about 35lbs each.) After many uses, my trunk has light scuff marks where the roller pads contact the paint. Maybe if my car was brand new I would care more, but it's not a big deal. Although I haven't had any problems, I still always pull over if hit a dip too hard or a bumpy patch. The bikes do wiggle a bit back there so I never completely trust it. Curved freeway offramps freak me out because I think they're going to slide off to the side. It has not happened, but I can't help being paranoid since there are no side straps. After I get the bikes on there weighing it down, I pull down on it a little harder before fastening the bottom strap. That seems to really hold it snug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bike rack","review":"I bought this for a friend and he seems to be very happy with it. It arrived in a timely fashion, and was as described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor Dilemma but Great Product for the Price","review":"I have a license plate cover so when I mounted two bikes on the rack it smashed the cover breaking it. Minor dilemma for me because not everyone has a license plate cover, however it is a great product for the price. Not safe to leave on the car since it can easily be removed which I don't like that too much because safety is a big issue where we live. (South FL!) And I did have some trouble mounting my mountain bike (24 inch schwinn) its made with the center bar slanted down so it was a little difficult to figure out how to mount without the bike looking lopsided, but it did the job got us to the trails and thats all that matters. I'd recommend this product with CAUTION! But it is a great product, gotta love Amazon and theyre awesome prices thats for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Worries Rack","review":"This thing is great. Relatively simple to set up (do a dry run before your first trip), functional for two mountain bikes, no extra strapping or tying needed. You will have to watch out that your pedals don't scrape your car, but the rack itself is totally sturdy. A nice product at a nice price (with lots of buying options)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to carry two bikes","review":"I've had two problems with the Allen bike carrier. When I took it out of the box, apparently fully assembled, it would not fit on the car. I had to take it appart and reverse one set of contact pads. Fine, and it was a nice light and easy to put on carrier. Then came the show stopper, when the second bike's pedal jammed into the deraillor of the first bike. I tried reversing the second bike, but then the handle bars interfered. The Allen carrier's bars are too short for our two normal road bikes, and we have since bought a larger and heavier trunk mount carrier that is a much better design and fully supports both our bikes much more stably.

However, the first time I used it, I put 2 bikes on it and drove toward the beach. At the first bump in the road, one of the plastic buckles that are supposed to hold the bikes to the rack broke and flew off leaving the bike dangling and dragging on the street. Luckily, I had a piece of rope in the car to re-tie the bike to the rack and got home safely. The rack is now headed for the Salvation Army. It is clearly grossly under-engineered to handle 2 bikes. Recommendation: DO NOT BUY THIS RACK."},{"rating":"1","title":"my two bikes fell off from the rack on the high way","review":"my two bikes fell off the rack on the highway. the cost of repair is over $450. such a bad product, such a bad design. this one only has four straps and the bottom two strap at the bumper. I prefer the rack with six straps, which all can be hooked to the trunk, not the bumper. Tightening your bicycles along the high way is once-in-a-life experience. pretty scary. From now on, i will not transport my bikes again by myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak materials, poor design","review":"Pros: Cheap and available.Cons: Weak materials, poor design.The pins used to hold the carry arms out are weak and do not lock in place in any way. They are supposed to use their elasticity to stay in place, but with a two bike load they bend and the whole system falls apart. Even with one bike and following the directions exactly, the straps come loose quickly. It's hard to fit two bikes on the rack in the first place (to be fair, my main bike has an unusual shape to begin with, making it hard to strap on)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!","review":"It works perfect for our SUV and our two bikes for all our little trips.

The cushions are plenty sturdy to hold up to the weight of two (pretty heavy bikes) and no scratches or dents thus far.I would like to see a better design on the two main support flat-hooks. A more rounded hook would be nice, or perhaps some rubber padding for underneath. I have yet to see any scratches or have any issues with jamming but I'm just being a bit picky.The utility of this product certainly warrants the money spent!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Weak","review":"First the Pros:Very easy to set upEasy to mount and removeAll one piece out of the boxFree shippingCons:Too weak to hold 2 mountain bikes,Forks have a terrible time with a full suspension frameSpring arms are MUCH too weak, they came out of place will holding 2 bikes on the 101...thank goodness for traffic!

Traveled 400 miles with 1 road bike on the rack on my Jetta averaging between 70-80 mph and not one single problem although there were parts of the ride that was bumpy, regardless, I didn't have to tighten any of the straps throughout the journey (make sure you tighten all the straps all the way down to avoid any issues...). I also placed a microfiber clothe under the rubber wheels to prevent potentially dulling up of the paint or potentially melting and leaving an imprint on a hot day - no marks were left behind on the truck because of this.Pros:- Easy to install (5 mins)- Light- Holds up well for long journey- CheapTip: Make sure to secure your front wheel from turning with some bungee cord and lock your rear and front wheel along with your frame to the rack to prevent someone stealing your bike with unattended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rack","review":"After reading the reviews, I was skeptical about buying this rack. I took a risk, and it payed off. Sure, the rack isn't a Thule, but the price doesn't rival a Thule either. At around $30 you get an exceptional value. I am leary of putting two bikes on it, because the bikes can get pretty heavy for this bike rack. But for the short distances I drive to the trails to ride, it is worth it and works great for my needs. Friends cannot believe how little I payed for this bike rack. It fits nicely into my trunk when I park at the trails, and it goes on/off in a snap. Realistically, as much of us understand I cannot afford a $200 rack, so this is exactly what I need for an inexpensive way to keep in shape, and enjoy the scenery. I recommend this product, just be smart about how fast you take turns, and the weight of the bikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for a basic bike carrier.","review":"I use this carrier on my 2004 Chevy Classic/Malibu to carry my Raleigh Talus 2.0 and a Trek 850. Setup is quite easy, just three straps. My car does not have a metal area under the bumper to hook the downstrap to so I just use the alternative method where the stap is placed over the two support beams and then clipped to the bottom of the trunk.I have heard people having issues with straps loosening up, damage to their vehicles ..ect but I have not experienced any of this. There have been no marks from the rack on the car and the straps didn't get loose on me either. However, I do use a bungee to secure the front wheel and another one around the pedal and around the bottom supports of the rack to keep the bikes from swaying. However, the bikes will not come out of the rack and the rack will not loosen up if installed properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Bike Rack","review":"Fantastic bike rack! Purchased it to take a 30+ pound Fuji bike from Michigan to California, and then used it to take 2 Trek road bikes from California to Georgia (by way of Oregon). Rack was used on a Honda Civic and Subaru Outback.Through 40+ mph winds in Wyoming, the rains of the pacific northwest, and 16 days of driving (5-9 hours a day) across the US at 65-75 mph, the most significant problem I experienced was having to slightly re-tighten the straps (a 30 second procedure) when stopping for gas, especially rough roads and high winds.Being sure to mount it correctly and securing the straps well, I have never had a problem with this rack. I was worried buying such a relatively cheap rack to take my bike(s) back and forth across the country, but it has proved itself to be very clearly up to the task."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing allen","review":"I was a little hesitant since some of the reviews said certain bikes don't fit and it doesn't work on all cars, etc. But at 39 bucks what the heck. We have two adult size mountain bikes (male and female) and let me tell you they mounted perfectly, like rocks. No swaying or banging and fit together great when you mount them pointing in opposite directions. Yes, pay attention to the pedals because they can come close to the body of certain cars so just put an old sock on them if there's a question. Not a problem on our 2004 Corolla. It was so easy to mount I had to look back at the instructions because I thought I did something wrong. Nope, I didn't, it's just that simple. Super rack that anyone can afford. Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"I have had two of these now and took both of them back. The plastic clips used to fasten the bikes to the rack are very cheap and poorly constructed. As a result, I have broken a few of the clips while tightening the bikes to the rack.

I would try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it for my small car","review":"I like that it folds up into my bag, flew with it cross country in my carry on bag, and used it on my rental car and with rental bikes for a Florida adventure.

However, the first time I used it, I found that it would gradually slip down the trunk. As a result, my bike tires ended up dragging for a while, destroying one tire (fortunately not the wheels).

It fit my car pretty well, and installed easily. I hung my bike on it, but couldn't figure out how to hang my wife's bike on it. Women's bikes do not have center posts - um, duh! This rack does not work for bikes without a center post. You have to purchase a separate adaptor, the Allen 900B. So, this really messed up my day. We weren't able to take the bikes to the state park as we had planned, all because Allen didn't realize that a typical couple might consist of a man and a woman, and the woman might actually have a WOMAN's bike. Very frustrating. I've now ordered the adaptor (which should come with this rack if you follow my drift) and in a few days, we'll be able to put both our bikes on the rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install on vehicle","review":"It comes fully assembled. The only thing you have to do is snap the support pins in place (be careful I pinched my fingers everytime I do). The only thing I am concerned about is hooking the bottom strap to a plastic bumper that it will not hold. I can't seem to find a better place to hook it underneath my car.Just a word of caution, do not leave on vehicle when you take the bike off. It is easy to remove and someone might steal it. I recommend putting it in your trunk. It is only for temporary transport since you can not use your trunk with it attached.I haven't actually used it with my bike on it yet, so I can't say how stable it is yet, but when tightened securely it doesn't move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!","review":"This rack is a great value for the money! Since I'm new to riding and working on acquiring all the necessary equipment (not cheap!), I wasn't too excited about about spending $100 or more on the car racks I'd seen at the sporting goods store.

I think not! So that alone proves Mariah's sucess and talent. Listening to GREATEST HITS will bring back memories. I'm sure that everyone knows at least ONE Mariah song so this is a great collection. My only problem with this collection is that \\"breakdown\\" and \\"the roof\\" didn't make the final cut. Also, no new tracks but it's no big deal.

Mariah Carey is a pure talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Hits","review":"This is a good Greatest hits but most were already released on the #1's collection starting with 1990s \\"Vision of Love\\". This is a two disc set and features many top songs but the new ones are top ten hits. This album did poorly on the charts debuting at 53 and falling fast, I just hope that Mariah can come back from the slump that she is enduring or she may be ancient history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Retrospect of The \\"Old\\" Mariah Carey","review":"I absolutely cannot stand Mariah Carey's new music, including the hoochie-mama image that she puts with it. Its not for me.But, Ms. Carey's greatest hits album is definitely worth the buy if you are into her older songs. \\"Greatest Hits\\" is like a revamped \\"# 1's\\" (Her first Greatest Hits album).This album is much more thorough than \\"#1's\\" and really showcases Mariah's amazing voice. The first disc is my favorite because I grew up on some of these songs so they have become a part of my life. Disc two is pretty good, but she started to become annoying to me around that \\"Honey\\" stage. \\"My All\\" and \\"I Still Believe\\" remain as some of my favorite love songs.I'm glad that this album was released and full of songs that were left off of \\"#1's\\". I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys Mariah Carey and her wonderful voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"my opinion!","review":"greatest hits albums are my way of 'either gettting all the songs, from an artist, thatwere popular, or my way of replacing what i lost, when my CD's were lost during moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Hits","review":"The title says it all.

I can listen to this CD over and over and never get sick of listening to it, that is how great Mariah Carey's voice is. My 15-month old loves to watch and listen to her, he gets so mesmerized when he sees her videos on TV! My PC scratched the first 2 songs, but that's okay, I'll probably end up buying another CD. Overall, I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has some fabulous songs","review":"At first I didn't understand all the hype over Mariah's voice, but since having listened to some of her songs, it has grown on me and I have realised that it is indeed a very nice voice. My favourite dance-type tracks on the album are 'Someday','Fantasy' and the fantasticly (is that a word??) bouncy 'Emotions'. Her voice is obvioulsy best known for powerful ballads and there are plently of them on here. Her famous high notes really do hit the spot, and (if you're like me) you will be trying (but probably not succeeding)to imitate them for days. A must for all fans of Mariah, and also recommended for those people just being introduced to her - although I doubt there are many of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariah Carey Greates Hits","review":"Not sure why...but i can not play this on my regular CD player....All of my other CD's work but they are at least a year old.

It's not up to par with other releases from other professional singers out there.

No new songs. All of her ballads are repititious and the dance tracks are forgettable. The only good song: um, there actually aren't any.Almost makes you wonder how she convinced people to buy her records in the first place. I think that once she became a \\"butterfly\\" and people got to know the really \\"mariah,\\" they realized there was no substance in her music, and she was just a piece of fluff. Some people may think i am too harsh,but the way she dressed in her Loverboy video, made her look like an unintelligent 2nd rate hooker.You have completely alienated your fans Mariah.

And if you can put up with the overabundance of dated early 90s treacly ballads, you get to the good stuff, which is primarily on the second disc.One small problem: not enough remixes, B-sides, unreleased tracks, or rarities. You may as well buy #1s, as this is essentially a repackaging of that 1998 set. Except it costs less. Hence only a 4-star rating for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"This set reminded me of how talented Mariah Carey is. All the songs are fantastic and you can see how her style has changed over the years. The only song that it is missing is Open Arms from Fantasy.

Add a lot of music, car chases and swearing, and you can probably fill the details in your mind.Classic Music.In interviews, the creators highlight the music they wanted to introduce to the world. Some of the musicians were already popular - Ray Charles and James Brown needed no introduction. Some had their careers reinvigorated as a result of the movie - at the time John Lee Hooker was so forgotten they didn't add him to the soundtrack.

It's a classic. Great music, great cameo's and a mission from God. Let's talk about it. Sure it is silly. After all how many car chases have you seen on the evening news that run through shopping malls. . . or how many cops have you seen who fire their pistols willy-nilly into a crowd to stop the infamous blues brothers. . . or car pile-ups that defy imagination. But then there is the blues. . . not only the great music, but Jake and Elwood Blue themselves. Two men on a mission from God. . . seeking redemption for their lives that had gone bad. Not too bad of a theme. But what is that sub-plot about Jake's ex (Carrie Fisher) about? It adds nothing to the movie. But then, even great movies has their flaws.

Their characters meet every seemingly insurmountable obstacle with the same deadpan bravado, and there is a revolving door of humor stemming from their characters, musical numbers featuring the great living blues icons, and action scenes, the emphasis being on Smokey and the Bandit-style police car chases. The action scenes are so dated that they're mildly comical; the music and the comedy have borne the years well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One-of-a-Kind Musical","review":"The musical was so out of favor by 1980 that had Universal advertised \\"Blues Brothers\\" for what it was it would have done even more poorly at the box-office than it did. But time has righted that wrong and Dan Ackroyd and John Belushi's wacky star turn has taken it's place beside the other great examples of this unique American film art. It's too long, the colossal car chase near the end is a bore, and it's based on the mistaken notion that church property in America is taxed (something Canadian Ackroyd, the main scriptwriter, apparently assumed and nobody else caught). But there are so many other wonderful moments of singing and dancing and left-field comedy that everything else is forgiven and then some.

So, he will think this is funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the classics","review":"If you want to get a taste of whatthe late 70's and early 80's were like, you must add this movie to your collection! In the spirit of an adventure movie, the two heroes, played by Dan Aykroyd and the late John Belushi, are looking for money to save their old orphanage. Along the way, they pay homage to some of the best rythmn and blues music of the 20th century. With performances by notables like James Brown and Ray Charles, this movie can't be beat. The movie is worth its price and then some for just the final half hour alone. This is the \\"good version\\" not the cut-up one they play on TV all of the time. R rating is more for the language and the cartoon-like violence, but is reasonably appropriate for age 13+. There is no sexual content and, unlike most \\"comedies\\" today, there's not a fart joke to be found."},{"rating":"2","title":"both versions are on this 2 disc set!","review":"Don't let the fear of only getting the extended cut stop you from picking up this dvd.The original theatrical cut is included as well.As a fan of the film and the music, it will be worth it for the extended musical performances alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"this DVD malfunctions","review":"Like another reviewer, I found that the DVD freezes after about 1.5 hours. The DVD is two-sided, with the theatrical version on one side and the extended director's cut on the other. Both sieze up and just stop playing. The scenes that are ruined are: when Jake and Elwood meet that country band in the parking lot, the steam room scene with Steve Lawrence, and the run-up to the big fund-raising concert. The disc is poor quality and very disappointing. Unfortunately I did not save my Amazon receipt..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry white toast, 4 fried chickens and a Coke","review":"John Belushi (Jake) and Dan Aykroyd (Elwood) are the Blues Brothers, period.

This title will only have lossy(compressed) audio on it instead of having an uncompressed audio track. This means that the audio on this disc will be no better than simple dvd quality instead of the uncompressed clarity that blu-ray can offer. Given that this is basically a musical and the music is a huge part of the story and the movie itself, WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU RELEASE THIS ON BLU-RAY WITHOUT HD AUDIO?!?! This is completely intolerable and I recommend anyone who's ordered this to cancel their order because Universal really needs to be sent a message that this is absolutely inexcusable on such a beloved title. Would you release West Side Story with lossy audio? Would you release Sound Of Music with lossy audio? Would you release any musical whatsoever in lossy audio?

Who will find them first? And once found, who's to say they won't immediately disappear again? The book is a brain storming season for crime lovers, it portray a special suspense for book lovers, the scene has a beginning but by the time you must have closed the last pages, you will be grumbling for the end of the drama but you might by sad to find none, because the drama continues even as the pages ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Clear and Less Profound","review":"This book is a groundbreaking book; however, I did not enjoy it as much as other books by Arendt.

In short: forget your 'banal' bourgeois 'jobholder' worries about material things! leave issues of redistribution or poverty to the animals! instead, stick your toga on, leave the slaves and wives indoors and ... let's do manly politics! Arendt should have ditched this hyper-masculinist, romantic Grecophilia after it got us to Auschwitz. Go read Hobbes or Montaigne if you seek a far more humane perspective on life after human carnage (in their 'bourgeois' determination to keep romantic-mystical yearnings out of the public sphere). Physically, this book just about slips inside Arendt's larger monograph on the origins of totalitarianism.

The noodles were super fine, which I like; however, I couldn't get past the super slimey feel. They almost seemed like they had a glue-like consistency.

It had the potential to be good whichever way it went, but it never lived up to it in either one. The sex jokes were uninspired and the situations felt awkward and forced. The romance wasn't really emphasized and just not done very well, I felt. Normally, you're rooting for the boy to get the girl, but, in this film, I didn't really care. I felt nothing for the characters; I didn't even find myself rooting against the \\"villain\\". Be it the writer's or the director's fault, it was just very badly done.

Shane West could have become a serious actor if he would keep looking for roles like the one he has on the ABC series \\"Once and Again\\". The same could have been said for Marla Sokoloff who seems like a pretty good actress on the ABC series \\"The Practice\\". Jodi O'Keefe can't seem to get out of teen angst.

Like we haven't heard this story before. It tried to be the next \\"American Pie,\\" which wasn't that great of a movie either... but compared to this, it's a damn film classic.

I think adults would enjoy it more than kids though.My main complaint is that to move, you have to memorize a lists of 2-5 things. Each list comes from 2 small booklets. Unfortunately after you finish all the lists in the booklet, you're screwed (sort of). There are enough lists in these booklets, and although from game to game you may forget the specific content of this list, if you play often enough it could become an issue.

The appropriation of black hip-hop culture by privileged white teenagers should prove interesting ground for storytelling, but James Toback's film is undermined by the lack of even one likeable character. It's very hard to care about the motivations or destinies of people you hate. Maybe that's the point? If so, fine, but it still doesn't make for a very substantial film.

I think not!Take a look at the top selling DVDs or the box office receipts and you'll see what Americans like, an easy to follow story line, lots of conflict, a few burning cars and shoot em up scenes and of course, a happy ending, one in which the conflict is resolved.This flick is none of these, rather it's an experiment, one that flopped horribly in the box office. I've come to learn that many of the best films fail to make money. Spiderman.....please give me a break!If you enjoy film as an art, buy this flick and you won't be disappointed.

His writing is sharp, if a bit messy at times, and his hand with actors is sure. This is one film where things are not as simple as, well, black and white.

For anyone who hasn't senn this, my recommedation is to just rent one to watch, with no need to to own one. It is very interesting to see how the director mixed real and scripted plots or things together to make such a film, which in a way is pretty raw and unpolished. Also, amateur and professional actors are mingled together, which makes the stories sometimes like a documentary and sometimes not. Some acting was fantastic or hilarious, like the scene Downey with Tyson, and the scene Downey leaving Sheilds, and the blackmail detective (Stiller) scenes. I would give those actings 5 star, but for the whole film, only 2 star. It is an interesting film, which shows a lot of interesting parts and yet doesn't really seem to form an integrated film.

In defense of the film, let me say that the Mike Tyson scene IS worth the price of the movie, but there's more to this pic than slice of life, cinema verite, docudrama hypermodernism. The strength of this film is that it tells the truth (just not in a very clever or appetizing way). It sort of just throws it out there for the viewer to judge. We do not actually \\"watch\\" this film, we instead are invited to \\"visit\\" this world, and for what it's worth, real life is not . . . plotted. In fact, the parts of the movie that bothered me the most were the \\"plotted\\" scenes, which seemed stiff compared to the extemporaneous scenes. What the movie needed was \\"less\\" control, not more. Just put the principle characters into the scenes and let them live and breathe.

I'm sure the filmmaker was trying to make some really profound point, but it's totally lost in the swirling, directionless flow of ... that is this movie going down the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want two hours of my life back!","review":"This should have been a good movie - great cast, director, the camera work is glossy and gorgeous . . . but there's just no plot. There are too many characters, and none are given any depth - as an audience you just don't care about any of them. If you're a fan of any of the cast, and are hoping to buy this to see them (like I did for Elijah Wood) then DON'T. Chances are, they'll have only a few minutes of screen time.The highlight of this movie was the sheer comedy value of watching Robert Downey Jnr flirt with Mike Tyson. The downside to this movie is . . . every other minute. And why Tyson should be given any screen time is beyond me. He is just as obnoxious and base as in real life and should not be glamourised in any form - which this movie threatens to do.I'm sure there was a noble idea behind this movie, but it seems to have been lost.

While all the black kids act ill without an intelligent bone in sight. Mr. Toback do some research!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted","review":"This movie was all over the place. I wanted it to be good because it was an indie film and I like almost everyone in it. I mean, Elijah's always good, Brooke is usually pretty good, RDJ is always good, and Jared is almost always good, too. Sometimes a good performance can save a not-so-great director if there's a good script, but the writing was just okay, so... what the hell, man? The flow SUCKED and that was the editor's and director's faults.REALLY...

I would recommend it to my friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely hostile but not to be missed","review":"It may be uneven, but this is the kind of challenging film that you nearly never see. Challenging in an almost hostile manner, it's an examination of race at the street level. White kids trying to be black, rappers trying to make sense of it, black girlfriends jealous of white lovers. I was fascinated and repulsed, and that's rare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great intent, delivery falls short","review":"This film did not live up to my expectation. It lacked a much needed authenticity. I found the flow of the movie to be choppy and inconsistent. The subject matter is begging to be explored; this movie only exploited it. At the end, I was left feeling teased and unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Illogical Chain of reasoning","review":"When I read this book, I was amused by it. To say that the disorder in Africa benefits someone--e.g., via corruption--has been around for some time and is nothing new. To say that this disorder somehow makes the societies \\"work\\" is new but illogical. For something to \\"work\\" for the continent as a whole it must have positive net benefit. Right now, the disorder in Africa is such that the benefit to those who gain is far less than the loss to those who lose. This is a well-known research result. Africa doesn't work; the disorder results in a net loss to Africa. Why Africans do not do enough to change the institutional and organizational order is an interesting reasearch topic. How one can help Africans do something about this predicament is also an interesting research topic. But to say that the disorder works is illogical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Gabby","review":"I love Hawaiian music, especially Gabby Pahanui.

It provides good maps, directions, time/distance estimates, and descriptive narrative about each hike.I've used it on three hikes and my only complaint is that it needs a new, updated edition. It was published in 1997 and some areas have changed in the last decade. I learned this the hard way half-way through my latest hike on \\"The Springfield Trail\\". The author might have been the last person who hiked the full trail.

Some of the Tassimo drinks have a chemical-ly aftertaste, and this is one of them.I then tried the Mastro Lorenzo crema and it is MUCH better. You can buy Mastro Lorenzo crema at the Tassimo or Gevalia websites, though I hope Amazon will pick them up soon. They're priced about three bucks less than the Gevalia crema.

But the haphazard writing, weird dialogue, and sub plots that go nowhere mark the movie as an abject failure. The picture includes meaningless rambling dialogue. This is the kind of thing that pretentious people tout as meaningful while, in reality, it is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Perhaps the worst feature of the movie is that it ends leaving the viewer without hope or satisfaction of any sort. It is not (as touted) so much a condemnation of war as a condemnation of human beings in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"get it in original 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen from the UK","review":"Columbia has elected to release this beautiful Panavision film in a pan-scan transfer here in the USA, an abomination for which I don't recommend buying the domestic disc.

But an \\"anti-war\\" film? In my opinion is has nothing to do with pro OR anti-war...it is an examination of what people stand for; in this movie the choice is between pricelss artworks kept in the castle, and the priceless value of humantiy. How each soldier makes his choice is what this movie examines. An allegorical tale that asks you to make your own decision about what matters the most to YOU. (and the book is even better!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately...","review":"... Columbia-Tristar had an opportunity (really, an obligation to its movie-going and disc-buying audience) to remedy 30+ years of pan&scan broadcast/tape versions of CASTLE KEEP -- which was originally exhibited in 2.35:1 Panavision, contrary to what another reviewer here remembers -- and have instead elected to preserve a p&s presentation for the DVD release of this excellent and important Vietnam-era film (set during WWII).

This movie is one of the best examples of early 1970s excess. Terrible writing, directing, acting, special effects, and musical score.

And yet, they put into power in the 1930s a left-wing jewish prime minister. When the Nazis occupied France,antisemtism once again becma acceptable. The vichy government not only handed over foreign jews from eastern europe, namel poland, they also handed over french citizens who were jews. Few french movies dealt with this shameful catastrophe. This movie is an apologetic theme for the antisemitism in vichy. Not all the criminals were prosecuted. They were allowed to live out their natural lives.

Every senator (except for Jefferson Smith) is portrayed as a corrupt, petty windbag. The senate floor is inundated with overanimated children (literally) who seem to control the proceedings. The president of the senate is constantly giggling at Smith's antics and appears to be the only senator sympathetic to Mr. Smith's cause.

Maybe Capra realized it was long enough, but there were a lot of things unresolved in the ending.The acting is great as well. The vice-president, for example, did an exceptional job as being a sympathetic figure.

Much longer than most pictures of the time (though for some unknown reason shortened by 20 minutes on this DVD release, an unfortunate decision disparaged by other reviewers here), the movie tells a vivid story with the camera. There isn't much plot, but various incidents - a buffalo hunt, an Indian attack, a near-disastrous crossing of a rain-swollen stream - are all captured wonderfully on film. Unfortunately, the spotlight that shined so brightly on Wayne here flicked out after the picture was released, and he would be relegated to churning out numerous quick oaters and action flicks for the next nine years before getting another big break in STAGECOACH.

This was the original aperture/original image size - the widescreen version of the film was not a matted version of the full screen as stated on this review page.

These filters are made specifically for it. Together they make the best coffee I have ever had. I typically use a dark roast such as a French Roast. These filters give a robust flavor with out an acid bite. The coffee is very smooth. It seems to filter out the oils that make the coffee turn bad very quickly. Using these filter I often make a pot in the morning and save some to warm up in the microwave at dinner, something I would never do with my other coffee maker. With my other coffee maker, by evening the coffee would be very stale tasting, even if it was stored in a insulated container. I wondered how a folded square filter would work compared to a cone, but it is very simple to use and the corners give you something to grab when you toss out the filter. I'm hooked on the Chemex system of making coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"an awful paper taste","review":"I am not sure whether the problem is with the product or with the particular batch I purchased, but coffee made with the unbleached filters is absolutely awful, infected with a foul paper taste.

The Miami Herald review reminds that it was Gerstner who personally obstructed Black's attempt to access corporate archives, and then oversaw the launch of a disinformation campaign that has been unsuccessful. Gerstner's book should have dealt with this very public issue squarely instead of pretending it did not.

The section on Strategy and culture was quite educating for a CEO who wants to keep his company sane and the employees he reqiures. It is worthy of note though not all his decisions were the best around, but he was decisive and that is key for leadership.Very Good book on Management and especially visionary leadership, though he belived more in strategy than vision!I particularly liked what he said about Compaq!

IBM technology organized the concentration camps and the Extermination by Labor campaign. Instead of simply owning up to the history and apologizing, IBM, under Gerstner, blocked access to records, launched a disinformation campaign, refused to apologize to survivors and consistently claimed the firm simply had no information on the topic.

I for one can tell you the turnaround was occurring before he showed up to take all the credit. He never responded to any of my emails while I was an employee and hasn't responded to any since my retirement. HR did respond to the emails that I submitted and their response was that \\"it was OK that I had sent the email to Lou\\". HR then went on to reiterate the company line.

Its amazing how much bitterness still remains from those bloodletting days as shown in the previous reviews. All in all though, despite the pains from the early days and the constant critiscms from both inside and outside of IBM, Lou has done a really good job as CEO and this book simply explains what was happening at the time and why some decisions were made the way they were made.

While he took from the corporation others had major salary cuts and layoffs. People have committed suicide because they lost their jobs.

I think that is the hardest thing a CEO can achieve. His vision, his attention to details but still seeing the big picture amazed me. No wonder they picked him as the great saver of the IBM legend.The book is long and sometimes repeats itself, without going into details.The part I enjoyed the most was his e-mails. How encouraging was he after 9/11, he mentioned employee names and all the things they did both to help and also to get their business going. He sent e-mails to his 300.000 employees.

Perhaps less moves per \\"routine\\" or less complicated moves overall.I can't say I was impressed, I was more frustrated then anything because they went to fast for it to be possible to catch on.

It's that slow.Maybe, only maybe, I could forgive the lack of workout if the dancing was fun. It isn't. Nothing about this experience feels like a party. The background music is minimal. The dance moves aren't impressive, but you do have to slow down to follow them and it would be hard for beginners(lots of single-single-double).

Sony/Columbia are to be complemented for this! As to the film, itself, there are some very magical moments and excellent cinematography that aptly show off Frank Capra's great talents as a Director.Too bad that Hollywood seems at times so evident in Capra's depiction of Shangri La. The buildings look too incredibly artificial, as if the stage for a 1930s musical. Also it is obvious that while Shangri La was to be supposedly in the region of Tibet, the native costumes are Chinese and surroundings look like Art Deco meets European Gothic. The acting though is quite good and storyline interesting. Worthwhile to see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Adaptation Ever","review":"This film should have been left to the ravages of age and studio neglect. Why anyone would want to restore this abortion of an adaptation is beyond me. Although the story line is largely intact, many of the characters have been changed. The Chinese girl ... I don't have the book before me so can't remember the name ... is replaced by a Hollywood nymphet with a supposedly nude bathing scene. I defy anyone to suspend disbelief when confronted with this sort of baggage in deepest Tibet or wherever. Another problem is the rather hysterical acting although some of the actors are credible and sympathetic.This book has not fared well in Hollywood ... this adaptation is the worse of any film I have seen ... the later musical [!!] adaptation is the next worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"One of the best 10 movies ever made.

I still remember parts of this film and I really loved Dimitri Tiomkin's score. I now have a better understanding of what he was trying to accomplish after seeing Frank Capra's images again (along with some I do not remember or have never seen).

It seems the book was geared more towards the whiney kid in the story and silly bodily function sounds than in educating about digestion and/or nutrition.

Chapters cover important family events ranging from family moves, new pets, shoppping, new bikes, school, camp, vacations, etc., etc. All aspects of daily family life and how they affect youngsters and parents are covered with an abundance of Yiddish speech and Jewish family attitudes.

This movie should be only funny for people who have lowered their expectations to the point of unconsciousness. As bad as it is, this movie has the ironic potentials to be a cult classic in the future. When something gets this bad and this unpopular, it'll come back and embraced by the cultural cultists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny as hell movie","review":"\\"I was scared!\\" (desklamps) This is definately one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.

Norm McDonald plays a much abused 2nd generation servant for Ms. Crock, a mean old pie baroness. Dave Chapelle plays his equally dimwitted friend. Together these two bufoons concoct the idea to kidnap Ms. Crock's beloved dog. The plan goes awry and people think that her servant, Norm McDonald has been kidnapped. Chapelle and McDonald have to adapt to their scheme to convince Ms. Crock, who really couldn't care less, to pay the same ransom for a human. Things continue to go wrong and it's one hilarious blunder after another.This is basically a very fun movie and I would recommend it for young children if not for some of the sexual references.

Brewster, Bradford, Standish... all wiped out to make room for King Phillip... who is really the star of this story. The title of this book gets little coverage compared to the war that came fifty years or so later. It's a great history, and the author knows his stuff, but the book only briefly covers the subject that I at least hoped to read about. I'm also annoyed at the constant comparisons the author makes to claim it was one of the deadliest wars in American history based on the percentage of casualties. If he's so concerned with bringing that event into view, he should have started with naming the book with a more appropriate title."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Best story of the early settlers ever written/told.","review":"5 Stars is not enough.

Chilling and magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting nonfiction","review":"This book was very well written. Often nonfiction can be very \\"dry\\"--not able to keep my interest. This book kept me wanting to read it from day one. I began with an interest in an ancestor from that time period, but I kept reading it for the interest level. I did quit reading it before the end, though. When the last part about all the Indian tribes came, I became confused and disinterested. The same thing happened with my husband.I would highly recommend this book for the first 2/3 of the book alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factually incorrect","review":"Contrary to the myth that Philbrick puts forth, the landing of the Mayflower was not the beginning of the United States -- that honor would go to the Lost Colony in North Carolina and to the settlement of Jamestowne in 1607 by some very courageous individuals, long before the Mayflower set sail. Likewise it has been documented that the first Thanksgiving did not take place with the Pilgrims; it took place around 1607 along the James River (then called Fluvanna River) in what became the Colony of Virginia. The site for that first Thanksgiving is believed to be on the property of what is known as the Berkeley Plantation in Charles City County, Virginia, just up river from the Jamestowne Settlement. I hate to think what other myths are being perpetuated by these gross historical inaccurancies and flights of fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third Time","review":"If Mayflower is as thorough and enjoyable as his last two, readers are in for an extremely good read.

Perfect for any history buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mayflower, A Must Read","review":"This book was particularly appealing to me because I am from Massachusetts. As a boy, I went on many school field trips to Plimoth Plantation and Plymouth Rock. I am familiar with the various towns with English names like Weymouth, Duxbury and Kingston. In addition, towns with Indian names like Narragansett, Cotuit, Massasoit and Squantum are familiar to me. You can't travel very far in Southeastern Massachusetts without finding a restaurant or hotel named after Bradford, Standish or Alden. In the 60's and 70's, before political correctness became fashionable the Massachusetts Turnpike logo was a Pilgrim Hat (the kind with the buckle above the brim) with an arrow through it. Now the logo is just a hat, the arrow is long gone. The whole concept of Pilgrims and Indians in Massachusetts has become very quaint and commercial. Philbrick took my simplistic childhood image of the Pilgrims and the First Thanksgiving and smashed it into a million pieces. Wow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"This book was excellent!

Philbrick writes very clear prose and his portrayal of Benjamin Church, \\"King Philip\\" and other Pilgrims and Indians are well wrought. My disappointment was with the subject matter. A great share of the book is a blow by blow, battle by battle, rendition of King Philip's War, between the Pilgrims and some of their Indian neighbors. If you enjoy well-written battle stories took even-handedly you will be impressed. If you are hoping for about the \\"community\\" than the war you, too, will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put this down!","review":"In school, history was my worst subject. However, I found this book by Philbrick to be a very interesting and vivid account of the first decades of our country. His re-telling of the Pilgrim's crossing - where I felt I was on the Mayflower - to the fear and concern of the first few weeks and months in the new world were gripping. I knew nothing of the Indians' history and was fascinated by the relationship with the Puritans and new settlers. Strongly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A very worthwhile read despite their being plenty of information already about the founding fathers and the Puritans. The book goes into a lot of detail about the dissonance and misunderstandings between the Indians and the Pilgrims that occurred in the seventeenth century, a subject that is not usually dealt with by most history books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great discussion of Native American-Pilgrim Relations","review":"This exceptionally well written popular history includes a great deal of coverage of the technology of 17th century sailing and a good deal more coverage of the cultural conflict between the English intruders and the Native Americans, flaring to the vicious bloodletting of King Phillip's War.I gave the book only four stars because I thought the absolutely necessary coverage of Puritain theology and 17th century politics was scanty in the extreme. We needed to know more about what motivated Puritains to leave Europe for the New World."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a definitive piece of work","review":"Someone else will have to write \\"the\\" Mayflower book as this author just didn't get it.Philbrick refers to the Pilgrims as \\"Puritans\\" a name they not only didn't use, but eschewed. Indeed it was the invasion of Puritans beginning in 1629 as they settled their \\"Massachusetts Bay Colony\\" adjacent to Plymouth (\`Plimoth') that motivated members of the original colony to move on and settle Connecticut, largely to escape from the dreaded Puritans.No mention of the Rev John Lo/Lathop - a major figure and an unforgivable oversight."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that was written about the Mayflower","review":"It's so much more than just about a boat named mayflower. it's a book about the beginnings of a nations. and what in turn that means over the hundreds of years since it originally happenns."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MANY \\"CHARACTERS\\"","review":"Ok, I will be the descending view on this novel.

While I did find bits and pieces of what I was seeking, it was surrounded by SO MANY indian names, tribe names,colonists names, their lineage the towns they founded that I found myself lost. This is not a book for someone with little background about this time period. The author mentions people as if the reader should already know who some of them are. I am not a historian and was truly trying to further educate myself. Unfortunaly I came away frustrated. The author knows his \\"stuff\\" and the book is extremely well researched.

Yet, Mr. Philbrick's narrative brings the reader close-up to the struggles these brave people faced, not only when they crossed the North Atlantic, but the problems they faced when they came ashore.As an American History Teacher, this is probably the best book on the subject I have read. A terrific read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mayflower","review":"Overall it's a good reading. I knew of course the basic story, but I learnt many new details - I have now much more sense about who these people actually were, their personal story, like this of Bradford who was the governer. I also have the insight from \\"the other side\\" - the natives view of the events, who were the persons there and what their feeling were. The book proceeds to the story of King Philip war on 1675-6 which is also a part of history about which I previously new only the basic facts and now I got some more details.Problem is that sometimes there were too many details about specific fights that got somewhat tiresome and on the other hand I would have likes to read more about the feeling of the ordinary people there, not only about the heros - like Benjamin Church - but also about the day to dat life in these small towns in such times.

I have lived in Massachusetts for about 10 years and am increasingly interested in the history of the region. This book presented a wealth of information about the Pilgrims, Puritans (I never drew a distinction between the two), and the various Indian tribal cultures -- describing the way they lived, what they ate, how they went to battle, and the outside impacts they dealt with such as the weather and disease. If you like early American history this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, readable, informative.","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the story of the Pilgrims and the English beginnings in our country. It is very readable and gives lots of information about the reasons and organization of the trip to America, events of the crossing in the Mayflower, landing on the cold shores of Massachusetts, and the first year here. I have always been interested in the story of the Pilgrims and have visited Plimoth Plantation and the Mayflower II, but I gained a much more realistic view of the people and events. We tend to idealize the people but this book shows them as real people with strengths, flaws, and temperments. I enjoyed this book and felt like I was there. It reads like a historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filling In A Big Gap In American History","review":"I grew up in New England, thought I knew our history, but have to admit there was a big gap for me between the Pilgrims 1620/Mass. Bay colony 1630 and Lexington/Concord in 1775. I knew vaguely about King Philip's War and occasional Indian raids on outlying farmsteads, but this new book by Nathaniel Philbrick really fills in the gaps and is a fascinating treatise on what happens when invaders settle in a foreign land.I had not appreciated how decimated the Indians were when the Pilgrims arrived in 1620, which made it a necessity for Massasoit and the Pilgrims to get along with each other. Philbrick writes a wonderfully detailed story of how this relationship evolved over 50 years and how the next generation forgot all that had been learned and killed each other off. The losses on both sides were truly staggering. I am amazed that this story has waited so long for the telling in a most readable and well documented epic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"History That Reads like a Novel","review":"Outstanding piece of work that makes history read like a novel leading the reader to a new and deeper understanding and appreciation of the Pilgrims, the Puritans, and those who settled this country...It wasn't easy and they almost didn't make it, but therein lies the story, and, to a great extent, the greatness of this country.This work humanizes the Pilgrims and gives them flesh and blood and makes them human--not pictures on a felt board. The Religious Right and purists probably won't like the fact that our founding fathers--the ones who gave us \\"Thanksgiving\\"--were not perfect, but therein lies the story and the greatness of the country.Great Read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misnamed and Disappointing","review":"Some of the reviewers have recommended this book for teenagers. I say, 'Good luck on that!' To me, history is a living entity - as real to me as, well, myself - and Philbrick made it dry as dust. No teenager would read beyond two chapters. 'Mayflower' is not, in fact, about the Mayflower, as has been pointed out; it is about King Philip's war and the colonists. I suspect, however, if Philbrick had used an accurate title, sales would have been much smaller. I finally started scanning pages looking for the meat. Didn't find a lot. Just got older and didn't add to my meager supply of wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads like a novel","review":"I was fascinated by the stories told about the Plymouth folks, before the voyage and long after settling in.

As a side benefit, the book provides ample fodder with which to skewer those self-righteous members of the Mayflower Society when they deserve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plymouth Myth","review":"Excellent and informative.

Brad Pitt, Rade Sherbadgia, Jason Statham, and Alan Ford give the four best performances as the almost intelligible gypsy bare knuckle boxer Mickey, the crooked Russian gun salesman Boris the Blade, boxing promoter Turkish, and ruthless gangster Brick Top, respectively.

I love watching British crime & caper/action films and \\"Snatch\\" is one of the best to cross the pond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam","review":"I love this movie. Just reading it without seeing it on the back of some dvd case -You wouldn't think much of it. In my opinion,this is one of the greatest movies I've seen in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Paced Action Flick!","review":"This Movie is cool, more than cool it's fresh, it has a great direction. Even tought I've heard it's very similar to \\"Lock, Stock...\\" also from Guy Ritchie, I haven't seen that last one. Anyway... this DVD has a few featurettes, deleted scenes and the very welcomed \\"pikey\\" subtitle option (used when Brad Pitt's character speaks). It even has an option where you can play the deleted scenes where they were suposed to be (even tough the deleted scenes look horrible) my only complaint would be its lack of spanish subtitles. Again the R4 edition is a Single Disc Edition and I don't think it has all the extras this one has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic film!","review":"Guy Ritchie has done it again - a great follow-up to his 1999 star debut \\"Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels\\". \\"Snatch\\" is masterpiece of a film, full of fun characters and a great intricate plot. It may seem a little confusing at first, but it all comes together for a great ending. This movie is a keeper - buy it and u won't ever get tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mickey Makes the Movie","review":"Although this isn't the best or funniest movie I've ever seen, it is definitely worth a watch and a purchase at a reasonable price. Brad Pitt's character Mickey makes the movie memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snatched by brilliance","review":"\\"Snatch\\" is a British crime-fiction film which contains a multi-layered story featuring several characters.As has become a trademark with Guy Ritchie works there is interaction amongst all the protagonists which shapes the narrative, and this at times is presented overtly and subtly.The casting of Jason Statham (as Turkish) and Brad Pitt (plays Mickey O'Neil) was masterful and both provide tremendous resonance to the story.It is a lively movie with plenty of surprises as the narrative unfolds and reaches a dramatic ending.Nicholas R.W.

At some point I am confident this fad will run it's course. But until then, i am sure we'll see a lot more of these lumps of coal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand....","review":"What makes this film so great? I have read every single review here and everyone seems to like this film alot. I thought it was okay, but it wasn't great. There were a few funny scenes in the film, maybe I just don't get British humor like others do. I did think Brad Pitt and Dennis Farina were both very good in the movie. Farina was by far one of the funniest things about this film, I would say the dog that squeaks is the other. I was not a fan of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrells. I fell asleep. I fell asleep in this one too. It picked up a little bit half way through, but it was by no means a true comedy. It was just your typical \\"Heist\\" kind of movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Superbit??????","review":"I have the original DVD version of this movie and the Superbit version. I cannot tell the difference between either. Resolution and sound are equal, at least to me. My rating is not for the movie, which is hilarious. It is for what I perceive to be a lie perpetuated by Columbia that Superbit is a superior DVD choice when, in fact, it appears to be nothing more than a re-packaged version of the same. I have not compared all original DVD versions currently available in Superbit, but again, where is the incentive since I already feel ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical","review":"This is one of the most interesting films I have watched for several reasons. Its film progression/story line/screen shots could begin a cult following by themselves. It is along the lines of Pulp Fiction in it's unique format. Genuinely unique. However, you have to watch it more than once to really get all the elements hidden through Brad Pitts well done dialect...which makes it all the more humorous! He achieves the effect that his character is truly hard to understand! If you don't like re-watching movies and want to hear everything perfectly the first time, don't bother you will be bored. If you have an eye for the unusual and you like an original story line, watch and re-watch with pleasure!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bargain price","review":"For a very good, low price, I got a new, special edition of the DVD, Snatch, Guy Ritchie's first major film. Excellent company that delivered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snatch--an American perspective","review":"Very good movie and an interesting and engaging plot. Very good acting. But I had a devil of a time understanding anything anybody said--especially Brad Pitt. Maybe that was the point, but I feel that unless I watch this movie about 5 more times, which I ain't gonna do, I didn't get as much out of it as I could. Can't imagine how anyone from Mississippi or rural New England will be able to see this as anything but a foreign language film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Would Have Settled For A Caravan","review":"A great follow-up to \\"Lock/Stock\\".

First the combination of London gangsters, Gypsies , Jewish diamond merchants and dogs contribute to some of the sharpest and memorable exchanges that I've heard in a movie since Pulp Fiction. There are many funny lines that will stay with you a long time after watching this. Brad Pitt does a fabulous job as a gypsy bare knuckle boxing champ with an inscrutable accent. Dennis Farina is great as the only American character in the film. The rest of the cast is what makes the film tick Jason Straham as Turkish the narrator and small time hood is the glue that holds the whole thing together.Snatch may not be for everybody but if you like Tarrantino you'll like Guy Ritchie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and Off-beat.","review":"From the other reviews here, you either loved it or hated it. Personally...I loved it. There are several interconnected storylines that play off of each other, creating the movie. If you don't like deadpan/British humor (verbal and action), you probably won't get half of the jokes. Guy Ritchie made an extremely clever movie that's enhanced by the sndtrk and the fact that the actors fit their characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible movie...","review":"I heard from my friends this movie was amazing, great, fantabulous. But when I rented this movie and brought it to my house, I was just disappointed. There was swearing every three seconds and tons of senseless violence.The swearing kept on coming, and the act grew old. And you know what? I think they used the word \\"F*CK\\" more than they did in Blare Witch. It was an absolutely crapped up movie, and I wouldn't watch it again unless someone put a gun to my head. I hate this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply One Of The Worst Movies Ever Made","review":"I had (notice the past tense) a girlfriend who loved this movie and brought it over one night for us to watch. The way she described it made me really want to see it. Unfortunately, her sales skills far surpassed anything the movie had to offer. I was under the impression that this was a comedy - and I really enjoy comedies - but the comedic moments were few and very far between.Part of the fault for the sad overall outcome of this movie must lie with the editor. The movie could have flowed far better, been easier to follow, and been funnier with proper editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME DISNEY STYLE FLICK!!!","review":"this movie just makes me angry i dont know how the talentless director Guy Ritchie would make an action film with out any blood or gore. this has less sexual tension then monsters inc. and toy story combined. this movie was a serious disapointing to an evil,sick and sadistical gore hound like myself. if you wont to see a better film watch irreversible,i spit on your grave or salo and the 120 days of sodom."},{"rating":"1","title":"holy crap what a waste of film","review":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen, period.The plot: oh wait, there wasn't one.The theme: let's make an even crappier version of Ocean's Eleven, use almost the same cast, make it even more boring and pointless, and throw in some black guys with British accents.The characters: wise-ass Brits that try, but really really fail at being funny (this it the kind of movie that morons say is \\"hilarious,\\" but trust me, whenever something is \\"hilarious,\\" it's not funny at allThe style: a bunch of really crappy cuts that are supposed to make you feel like the movie was cutting edge or some crapThe music: not bad, wasn't an abortion like the rest of the movieThe ending: the bringing together of a bunch of trivial crap that no one cares about. It's supposed to make you go, \\"Ohhhhh, wow!\\" but it made me go, \\"Oh...okay...so?\\"The verdict: seriously consider suicide as a better option than this movie...it's about as exciting as a ten minute crap"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I love this movie! It has the humor and the action! Great plot as well! I think all I need to say is that! BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER PULP CLASSIC!","review":"OK so ive seen Guy Richie's Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and agree that Snatch has many similarities to that but that doesnt mean that this is a bad movie in any sense of the word. Now with a similar plot comes some similar characters. But the characters (even though you have your stupid bad guys, real bad guys, and stuff) are very diferent. Or maybe its just that i think Guy Richie is up there with Quentin Tarantino in creating memorable characters. This movie is hilarious and smart at the same time. Fans of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels will love this movie. And will like the film quality upgrade not seen in Lock, Stock. This film offers funny characters, a cleaver plot, and a lot of smart dialouge. Now i agree with Amazon's reviewer that Guy Richie needs to switch it up a bit! We love your style Richie, now lets see what else you can do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a re-release of the deleted first special edition!","review":"This new version of Snatch is a re-release of the original 2 disc edition that has been off the market for the past 2-3 years. This one has added a little poker set (bad cards and a dealer chip) as well as a booklet. The problem i have is that in the one i bought, the superbit version was included as the first disc - not the one that was supposed to be there with the commentary and branching features. Don't know if this was widespread or not.The cards are terrible. The Suits are diamonds (like in the film) but also boxing gloves, guns and the dog. WTF mate. Also the numbers are in a bad font - stretched thin and difficult to read. The booklet replaces the on disc filmography i believe and adds some production notes - its good looking and a nice edition.If you have the deleted edition there is no need foir this - if you have any of the others this one is better than any other version and its pretty inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Really like this movie. Great heist movie; very tongue-in-cheek at times. It was hilarious. Be warned, it doesn't shy away from horrifying realities of gore and the like, so not for the weak of stomach on the whole, but this is confined to a few scenes, so it's not a \\"Gore everywhere! All the time!\\" type of movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one COOL movie","review":"One cool movie. No doubt about it, if you enjoy an action movie with a good strong plot and a good amount of comedy (who doesn't) then this is the perfect movie for it.

Ritchie went with what worked from his last film and incorporated it into a different story about a diamond. Ritchie likes to get into detail with each of his characters. Each gets his own intro, and some get their own themes. This helps the audience relate better to the characters and understand them better.Overall, there are a lot of sub-plots and stars in this great flick about the search for \\"a diamond the size of a fist\\". A lot of action, snappy dialogue, and plot twisting is involved.But be forewarned, if you don't like films where most of the characters have accents, use a lot of slang, and try to kill people .... then go watch a freakin' Disney movie and keep living in happy happy land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeper that delivers","review":"I seen this movie a lot of years ago. Everytime I passed it in the movie rental store I would smile and remember the talent of Brad Pitt. He is as believable in this role as he was in 12 Monkeys. The music is a major part of this movie as is the haywire plot.This film is still being shown on HBO and reveals a side of the British that is funny, serious and strange.Great to have in your DVD vault."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Number One Movie Of All Time","review":"When people see the title of this review they will probably think I am crazy, but its no joke...this movie delivers on all aspects, and is a true gem that I wish everyone would just give a shot...fans of Guy Ritchie will find nothing new in the flow and style of the movie but the characters in the movie is what truly makes it something special...you will find yourself rooting for some and jeering at others...Guy was able to successfully create a different personality for every character and give them their own identity. When you are dealing with so many characters that is def hard to do and pulls it off with this one...the cast and the story are spectacular and I feel that if given a fair shot with anyone, they will enjoy this movie all most as much as I did"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a hoot!","review":"A few things drove me to see this movie: I'm a bit of an Anglophile, since \\"Ocean's 11\\" I've become more of a Brad Pitt fan, and I had heard great word-of-mouth about it.This is great stuff. Even though Pitt spends a bit too much time with his shirt off (my wife loved that part), it's difficult to describe him as \\"pretty\\" in this movie. His performance has further won me over to his side - he's an absolute riot! Thank God for the subtitles!There are many memorable characters in \\"Snatch\\", and many great lines. The jump cuts and Brit slang, which some previous reviewers have criticised, are, to me, a big part of the fun. I found myself laughing out loud at several points, and smiling the whole way along.Never a dull moment! I'm looking forward to Guy's next effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"brick top is the man!","review":"this is such a fast-paced movie with so many over-the-top characters that you can't help but pay attention the whole way through. the dvd even has an option for special subtitles that only appear when brad pitt's character mickey is speaking, how funny is that? bottom line: cool story, cool music, cool characters, and a cool dog...what else do you need in a movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty with a Whole Lot of Violence","review":"Guy Ritchie knows his way around a movie camera. His last film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, handed us a bunch of guys down on their luck and out a couple of grand. In this movie we get a group of all-star competitors all on the hunt for a diamond the size of a fist. Brad Pitt, a bare-knuckled boxer gypsie? Dennis Farina, a crime boss? Benicio Del Torro, a crook with a gambling problem? You better believe it. And you have to see it to do so. The editing of the film is exquisite. Every scene you either laugh histerically or you cringe at the gruesome violence. You have to own this one. If you loved Lock, Stock, then you this movie is a MUST own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heard Bad Things but,","review":"It was suprisingly good. There are so many twists and turns it really holds your interest. The only thing that was difficult was trying to understand what in the world Brad Pitt was saying three-quarters of the times, bravo to him for pulling off the \\"parkies\\" accent! It was a marvelous perfromace by Pitt and his co-stars, it is a hetic, super involved kick butt movie. I would highly recommend it for all you sitting home on a friday night :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Snatch this one up (forgive the annoying pun)","review":"To start, Snatch is a movie that you have to watch multiple times. If you are unfamiliar with british accents and their slang, you will DEFINATELY need to watch it multiple times. Guy Ritchie has the habit of making things jump around unexpectantly, and you could possibly miss something. If you watched Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, you know what you're getting yourself into, mind you though, that while may of the same actors are in both movies, they don't play they same characters. This is a funny, chaotic film that will keep you locked onto the screen. I was very impressed with Pitt, I've never been a big fan, but this popped him higher on my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this DVD!","review":"If you are a fan of Get Shorty, Pulp Fiction, or other crime-caper comedies, get this movie. It is hilarious, it is entertaining, it is awesome. All the performances are good, from Brad Pitt's accent, to Denis Farina being himself, to Vinnie Jones' tough guy. This movie is good from start to finish. This is a solid DVD as well. I listened to the Dolby Digital track and the sound was near perfect. The picture is very, very clear. And the second disc is loaded with special features, including some interesting deleted scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the 2 Disc Deluxe Edition","review":"I loved this movie, so much so that I wanted to get the \\"behind the scenes\\" 2 disc edition to learn more about how the story was written and how the movie was developed. In my opinion this is a good example of how NOT to do a 2 disc edition. Long on storyboarding and deleted scenes and short on \\"behind the scenes\\" stuff. What a disappointment! I'm keeping my single disc edition of course, but the 2 disc edition is going right back on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild and wacky, action packed movie.","review":"Sorry, I don't agree at all with the editorial review. This film keeps one's attention glued to it as the various story lines and characters interact. I found this movie not only to be action packed, but hilariously so. While Brad Pitt is genius in the role of a gypsy bare-knuckle fighter, Jason Statham, with poker faced portrayal of a illegal fight promoter is his best role yet. He makes you laugh with his slightly sarcastic remarks and his seeming confusion about just how he got himself mixed up with this crazy gypsy and the most dangerous fight promoter by the name of Brick Top who has an unhealthy affinity for pigs. I never tire of watching this movie and find myself laughing each time I do. I highly recommend this movie to all those who like action and humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"English film made by the director of \\"Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrells\\". Lock Stock was a classic and did well in most countries but America.Snatch is not a follow up but a film featuring similar elements. It is set in an English underworld of illegal boxing matches hit men and Jewel Heists.The film is in reality a comedy but it is a violent one. It has a complex structure which is the interweaving of of three basic sets of characters who are invovled in fixing a fight and trying to recover a stolen diamond. Unlike many comedies it falls outside the normal formulas and the twists and turns of the plot have you in stiches.The DVD is probably better than the film as it is easier to understand the dialogue using the subtitle function. Even Brad Pitt is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"rock 'em, sock 'em fun","review":"This movie is a fast-paced, fun movie.

WISH THAT GUY WOULD MAKE A 3RD (NOT COUNTING REVOLVER) FILM INCLUDING MANY OF THE SAME ACTORS LIKE BRICK TOP AND BULLET TOOTH. YES I WILLL STRONGLY RECOMMEND.

AWESOME COLLECTION !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever, witty and funny","review":"You don't see many movies like Snatch. There really isn't a genre to put this in. There is so much going on at one time, yet its never confusing. Plus, there are quite a few important characters to keep track of, and they all have their own proper place in this film. Even with 1 less actor, it would seem incomplete. This movie flows perfectly. Basically, the plot sort of revolves around a large diamond. Its not necessarily a heist film. Nor is it a 100% comedy, though, you gotte love that British humour. And no, Brad Pitt isn't a main character, however, he is a great, essential character. There are actually quite a few different nationalities in this film. Its all very interesting, how all the characters interact with one another, bantering, or threatening each other. Its alot of fun. The movie has a great soundtrack as well that really adds to the mood of the film. Its really an impressive film that would appeal to many people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I beleive Brad Pit is at his Best in this Movie.n The entire cast is Great.I would Recommend this movie to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie","review":"I bought this movie as a gift for my fiance.

One thing that hasn't been emphasized is that you can watch this movie more than once and still be entertained so it's worth buying.BUT...I was less than impressed with the \\"extras\\" on this DVD. The \\"Making of Snatch\\" featurette was okay, but the \\"Cast and Crew Commentary\\" was the worst I've ever heard. Guy Ritchie and the Producer were either hungover or extremely tired and really had very little to say about what they were thinking about while making this great flick. Too bad.So if you get the VHS version instead of the DVD, you probably won't be missing too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special Ed. fatigue...","review":"My god, people...

We laughed once in a while, ok maybe you wanna say it was over our heads- but we wanna say it's the worst movie we've ever seen and we don't think anybody should see it although for some reason you ppl gave it a million good reviews.

I feel guilty even spending any time thinking about it, so low on the hierarchy of artistic achievement does it sit. But it manages to be bad in several very interesting, novel ways. It's a new form of terrible. The movie is beautifully shot, for example. It has learned how to be flashy and shallow from a generation of music videos and special effects. Wow. Bravo. The plot, too, is reasonably interesting. There are certainly too many undifferentiated characters, but overall, the story could have been adapted into a good noir type movie. But instead, Guy again tries to appeal to the surface generation, and succeeds in making a movie about as deep as a kiddie's waiting pool, and with as much intellectual value as a Burger King placemat."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I thought","review":"Usually, when I purchase Ghost Story books (short stories) they are \\"based\\" on true stories.

Written and set at the beginning of the 20th century, the explorer of the title is an anachronism, the sort of blood-and-guts 'pacifier of the natives' who invaded east Africa 20 years earlier in the 1880s. Yet he is the character we have to take seriously as the hero and the center of the heroine's life. A lot is made of the beauty of British suppression of emotion, which was practiced and glorified for many decades, thankfully no longer, and from which Maugham himself, especially given his sexual feelings for men, must have suffered a great deal. The heroine is an annoying cipher whose principle activity is clenching her teeth and not crying. Finally, there are two civilized creatures of leisure who befriend hero and heroine and presage Maugham's later witty couples, but here are only mutually insulting, not amusing. This must have been a bad time in the author's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I bought this kit as a gift for my niece, who loves art projects and coloring. However, I was a little disappointed when it arrived. There is no outer package around the product, so the inside of the kit had spilled out into the shipping box. The sketch paper pad was completely detached from its backing, and there is no way to re-attach it. The color wheel is not attached to the tri-fold either, although it looks like it should be because there is a little cardboard \\"pocket\\" around it that has glue lines on the back. I will still give it to my niece because I don't think she is old enough to recognize the way it should have been put together, but overall the quality of the product was sub-par. There are also no instructions, so I didn't realize the product was not meant for use on the skin (found that out after reading some of the other reviews).

I use my other shampoo first on my scalp, and then I use this shampoo on my ends (and a little on top for good measure). I like it because it's effective, cheap, and it doesn't smell girly -- just clean like a waterfall (corny but true).

The organic chem review section is a joke, and is only a few pages long. The practice tests have questions that are not representative of those appearing on the actual exam. The only section in the pratice exams that MIGHT be remotely useful is the verbal section. But even here, while the passasges are okay, the questions are not very representative of those on the actual exam. With horrible review sections and practice tests that are even worse, this book is a complete waste of your money.

There is not one single likeable person in this tale, including the kids, who are well on their way to becoming complete brats by the conclusion--thanks to their father's lack of discipline and their mother's constant absence. I didn't find it amusing that he let his kids run all over the place in public, or that bedtime was never enforced.

They will parade their children around to boost their egos but when the time comes to actually parent, no one is around.

The story moves so quickly, and so much happens to the author and his family, that it didn't hit me until the final pages how this book was really an elegant and deeply-felt love story of a man and his children. I was very moved by the author's brutal honesty about how difficult his marriage is and how his emotional relationship with his children becomes the central fact of his life. It's a wonderful book, I laughed and cried and was sad when it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do Yourself a Favor","review":"Having just finished reading this book, I must admit that at times I felt like the authur was way too hard on husbands and blamed them for all the problems in marriage. Surely wifes desire some blame in difficult marriages! Yet, the more I read and opened up, the more I felt his assessment is fair given our God given responsibilities as the head of the home. But, be warned; the lessons in this book will only work if you are committed to living a Christian lifestye. Although there are many type-o's throughout the book and it is a bit rambling at times, as my pastor says, \\"you need to eat the hay and leave the sticks\\". If you are able to be objective and set a side your natural defensiveness as a man, you will find many useful lessons in this book.

In the 1970's, the Capitol Center (which is where this event takes place) used to set up three cameras (one on the middle of the arena floor and two at each side of the stage) so that the concert could also be seen on the overhead big screens for those poor fans sitting up in the rafters. Basically this is a DVD of the footage from those video cameras, which accounts for the poor quality. Still, it's a rare glimpse into a band that was just about to break it big."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"I had heard about this concert footage a couple of years ago and was never able to track it down. Glad i finally found it. The quality of the audio is dubious at best but for hard core BOC fans that should not detract from the overall pleasure of this movie. I saw the tour that this movie was from about 2 weeks before it was shot and from what i can remember its pretty close to the way it was back in the day. The problems with the audio probably have to due with the line to the tape machine. i cant believe that the concert would have gone on if it sounded like what was being recorded. fyi the soundman was probably listening to the feed coming off the main board going to the tape machine and not what was being recorded. as for all you people that disses this disc i ask have you listened to Areosmiths live bootleg lately? how abot The Song Remains The Same? anyway i was extremely glad to finally add this jewel to my dino rock collection and would gladly buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soon to be a collector's item","review":"I believe this has been discontinued. Probably a must-have relic for hard-core BOC fans, pointless for anyone else.

My attention wandered constantly away from the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"General comments","review":"Even BOC has admitted to the equipment problems of the mid 70s. The performances of that era (and I've seen several) were stellar. It's good to hear a review from someone who was actually there. I haven't seen this video but I own the CD. Disappointing. I don't expect the video portion to any better. Even if you consider the technology of the time, I'm upset that a band of BOC's stature allow thier name on such a bad product (no matter what format). Besides, John Fogerty wouldn't allow CCR's \\"Woodstock\\" performance on the soundtrack or film because he was unhappy with the sound. Integrity vs cash I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for true die-hard fans.","review":"I wish I had read the review @amazon.com, before buying this DVD.

I am a fan of Blue Oyster Cult and this recording is an injustice to the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blue Oyster Cult Caught In The Act!","review":"They may be old(er), but any glimpse of the Cult of the Blue Oyster is worth it. For the price of an audio cd you get to see the artists where they are most at home; on stage. The audio quality is a bit off, but think of the audio from their first few albums. Project your mind a little. It's like a good book. Your mind fills in any gaps that technology in 1976 couldn't. I never got a chance to see the band in their original line-up so this DVD brings some of the magic home. I enjoy any chance I get to sit back and listen to BOC, but it's even better when you see them interact as a band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for a flashback!","review":"I am a huge BOC fan... And the Amazon.com editorial is obviously written by someone obviously rather ignorant of the band... But truth be told... This DVD is pretty horrible. The sound mix is dreadful as it appears to be from the soundboard without a decent remix, and the pic is so grainy and dark it's as if it was transfered right from a 2nd generation VHS tape. On the plus side... The set list is pretty good despite the before mentioned problems in quality (Included is the rarely played 5 Guitars), but the band performs without their usual tightness. Also of possible interest is the fact that this performance is a flashback to the Oyster Boys laser days showmanship before hitting the club scene... But personally, I found my money WAY better spent on BOC's \\"A Long Days Night\\" DVD! Now there is a quality BOC DVD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good does come from this poor quality source tape.","review":"Yes the video quality is less than you might expect and the sound? Well it seems to me that a few people and some equipment are responsible for botching a recording of an otherwise great concert. I attended this very concert and I can assure you it did not sound this way during the actual performance. The recording sounds like a unremixed straight sound board recording with levels from various channels going up and down at random. The bass suffers the worst and sort of sounds like cabling to the sound board was to blame. Overall if you can forgive some of the sins of the recording job, this is a nice piece of BOC history and hopefully another from this era will be released which will make up for this ones shortcomings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless on DVD","review":"I must preface this by saying that I have been an avid fan of B.O'Cult since 1979. I've seen them perform live three times. I love their music and the mystique. If I had purchased this on VHS I would have thought the numerous audio problems were a manufacturing flaw. There is no reason for this to be released on DVD. Or VHS. Seeing the original lineup is a thrill, but the limitations of the recording (both audio AND video) is pathetic. You should purchase this ONLY to have the complete collection. By the way, anybody out there know where I can get a copy of the \\"Black and Blue\\" tour film?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and unique","review":"\\"Cockpit:...\\" is a collection of sharp, full-page color photos of WWII cockpits, accompanied by good quality period photos, a surprising number of which are also in color. A brief description of the aircraft is included along with a few paragraphs by a former pilot or other aircraft expert.Having a collection of cockpit photos from the major belligerants together like this illustrates the differences and surprising similarities in thinking about the pilot's environment.The two major gripes I have is that (1)there is only one view of each cockpit, which often leaves out considerable detail of the controls and indicators that are located on the left and right sides of the pilot and even behind him. (2) There is only one Russian type represented, just four Japanese aircraft, and no Italian machines.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Photography","review":"Great reference for aircraft interior from a pilots viewpoint. Excellent photography of a confined dark space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, unique book, but could've been better","review":"I'm ... only giving it 4 stars. Nijboer and Patterson came up with a great idea, but missed a little in the execution. As a modeler, I'd like to see more details of the entire cockpit, not just the instrument panels. Also, I realize Mr Patterson is an accomplished professional photographer, but I was a little disappointed with the nature of many of the shots. I think he was trying for dramatic lighting effects, but ended up with many parts of the cockpit in dark shadow or nearly washed out by flash. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Hallmark Dots","review":"Other folks have weighed in on the content of the book, so I have no need to do that. My comment will center on the aspect of the photography that spoiled the book for me. The crew obviously had applied little colored circular stickers to the various instruments so they could be coded for the captions. That was all fine and well, but 75% of the photographs were taken with the stickers still in place. It was sloppy work. Carping, perhaps, but I expected better. The same comments apply to the volume dealing with Cold War aircraft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expand Your Holiday Music with the McGarrigles","review":"I found out about this album from an Orlando Sentinel review. They particularly liked Emmylou Harris' contribution on \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem,\\" but it's hard to choose a favorite. Others participating in the music are Martha and Rufus Wainwright (Kate McGarrigle's children).Once you listen to the CD, you'll agree with Jim Abbott/Orlando Sentinel, \\"there's not a clinker on this beautiful holiday collection.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised and disappointed","review":"I was not pleased with the quality of this recording. The McGarrigles are just wonderful, but the sound engineering of the album is a disaster. The first and last cuts seem OK, but the ones in between are overridden so badly by the heavy-handed instruments that it all just seem noisy! The piano in particular was so loud that the songs were unintelligible. I also didn't appreciate the sisters' reworking of several songs I already love from \\"The Bells of Dublin\\" (some of the best Christmas music ever recorded). The sparkle I longed for just isn't there in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time line?","review":"I thought it would be intersting to read Grace's story, but you almost already know everything about her through the other books. I prefer all the books in the series to stay focused on one main character like Willow and not about her mother or her daughter. I read a lot but this book bored me! I just finished reading, EVEN ANGELS FALL by Sherry A. Mauro whose writing style is a lot like the old Virginia Andrews. I highly recommend this author to any VCA fans. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Many, many issues","review":"First off I didn't have to finish the book because you know what happens if you read the rest of the Willow series (which was ok until the book about her daughter). This book goes more into Grace's story and what exactly happened to her. There were some interesting parts but then it got silly and you knew that her mother would change after the father's death and she would be misunderstood in Palm Beach.Unless you read all of her novels, this might not be the book for you. I agree with the other readers that either the ghost writer should stop using her name or go back the the stories taht are like Flowers in the attic and the Cutler series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the Woods","review":"Having read the first three books of the DeBeers family, I found the fourth book to be perplexing. Why did they take us back in time to the life of Grace and her mother. Why not have made this the first book in the series?If one has read the other three books we are more than saturated with the story of Grace, her mother and Linden.What was this book's purpose. Seems it was made for the sake of another book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the Woods","review":"I have read every V.C. Andrews book and was so bothered by the incorrect timeline that I have not been able to finish the book. The time that Grace was a teenager would had to have been around 1965 at best. There weren't any DVD's CD's, legal abortions or date rape, as a matter of fact lasers were just becoming a reality. So when I began reading Into the Woods I was terribly disapointed. I really was looking forward to reading about Grace, but there were so many inconsistancies that the book now just sits in my bookself. I would only recommend this book if you've not read the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great Book!","review":"The book, Into the Woods, was a great book. It really showed me that fame and fortune aren't everything. In fact, they can be the worst thing in the world. It also showed me that life is important and that you should stand up for yourself. V.C. Andrews has become my favorite author of all time! I love the De Beers Family series. Anywayz, read this book! It's the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"its not that bad...","review":"I understand what all the others are saying about the book. How the time warp thing messes up the reader. But I thought maybe Grace lived in the present time, while Willow was supposed to be more into the future.Anyways, apart from that little thing, the book was great! Twisty plot, some characters to stir things up a bit. I gave it a four because toward the end it started to drag, and I found myself just wanting to put it down because I already know whats going to happen to Grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters","review":"Into the Woods carries on the wonderful characterazations and intricate plotting of past best selling V.C. Andrews novels. The people who are bothered by some of the historical errors are like people who really miss the forest for the trees. It's so minor and isn't important to the storyline and the characters developed here. And how about the depiction of Palm Beach? This is a terrific read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really terrible","review":"Is it just me or are her books getting worse and worse? I've read some of the other reviews of \\"Into the Woods\\" and I agree with the time line. CDs, Shania Twain, ... (was she even born yet?). This is all wrong! Whoever the author really is should STOP using VC Andrews' name!! I wish he/she would do some research before they start writing. YOU'RE DESTROYING HER REPUTATION! I'm glad I didn't buy the book. Everything is so predictable now. I don't think I'm ever going to read another VC Andrews book anymore. This was a total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent enough. But when does this take place","review":"I finished reading twisted roots and that was entertaining enough for a Vc Andrews novel but then they throw this book in and I'm reading it and isn't Grace supposed to be Hannah's grandmother? Why do they have the internet in her story, and rufies and a Shania Twain song playing on the radio? ... OR, Hannah lives years and years in the future where everything is just the same as now... Former VC Andrews books with the exception of Olivia, which carried writing and attention to detail which was just as bad, attempted to portray the history of a place through various generations of it's inhabitants. The place was a large part of the aptmosphere, whether it is an old plantation \\"The Meadows\\" or the wartime bayou add a large part to the story for me, and both the Landry series and the Cutler series was careful to portray a specific time frame. The real VC Andrews of course, was never as careless. Her works were meticulous and original and utterly amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time frame is totally out of kilter","review":"In the last deBeers novel, Grace was a grandmother with two grown children. In this \\"prequel\\" she seems to a contemporary of her own granddaughter while living in the same time period. Would someone old enough to be a grandmother be still high school/college age and know about the Internet and CDs? I don't think so. It would have been much more interesting if it had taken place during the late fifties/early sixties or thereabouts. The publishers/writer/editor should have been more careful. This time warp distracts from the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I saved money...","review":"by not buying this. I read it in the bookstore. Well, I didn't read it, exactly, I skimmed through it; that's all that needed to be done to get the tripe story figured out. While better than the dreadful Hudson series, I would rather have had something as good as FITA or Heaven in my hands. And this wasn't up to par. Sorry, GW, but you should seriously turn your job over to someone who knows how to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I'm not alone","review":"After reading Willow, I was desperate to read the rest of the series, I bought the whole series from the USA as it would be quicker. All was great until now, where I am in the middle of Into The Woods. I was so shocked to see internet and Shania Twain and other modern things, that I promptly got on the internet. I thought that surely there must be a mistake, and if I read further that all would be explained. As I can see, there is no mistake. All I can say is I am VERY disappointed, as the reason I read Virginia Andrews books is the familiarity.(Although I agree we need fresh stories).

The sexual tension between Max and Logan dissipated in the second season, since Logan leaves his wheelchair and has to deal with a genetically engineered virus. Agent White as a villian to replace Lydecker (who never was proved dead, mind you) didn't have the same menacing presence.

Because any bit of Max & Logan is still good. If it's the first time, try season one first. Season One is da bomb.There are 3 commentary tracks, which are helpful if you want to know plans for season 3 and beyond (this was one of main reasons I wanted this set).

It covers WAY too much material, only a small portion of which is actually relevant to the test.

The information provided was more inclined to give information on how to start any business, with only a small portion dedicated to the bookstore business specifically. The same information could be received from the SBA's website and other sources. It appears that the authors just took the basic \\"How to Start and Manage\\" series that they write and added a chapter on bookstores. I would not recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic information","review":"Lewis and Renne have produced a series of how to books. I have seen about 15 different titles in the series. They are almost all carbon copies of each other with the type of business, eg. book store, plugged in to the appropriate places in the text. The information is basic, simplistic and useful, but it is not tailored to the particular business except in a few of the manuals where a small amount of particular info is allowed to intrude on the boilerplate text. If you really want to know how to start and operate a bookstore, don't go to this manual that is not its purpose. If you want general information on starting a business, there are meatier offerings for the same price or slightly more. If you value books for the help or wisdom they offer, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"problem not resolved for weeks. Customer support needs improvement!!","review":"The games are good.

Along with the math, spelling and reading sections, I particularly like the fact that the games promote good listening (i.e. following directions) skills. The kids have \\"tasks\\" to complete in order to open different sections of the world, rather than just wandering around aimlessly playing games. There are also parent reports that enable you to see how they are progressing (i.e. where their strengths & weaknesses are). You get 2 adventure packs with this software and then you can go to the website to order a new pack to be automatically downloaded every month (costs about $7.99 per month). I would definitely recommend these products. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was long to install (first instance only)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great program but awful support","review":"When the software works, I think it is great. It combines the fun of playing a game with educational activities in reading and math. However, buying the CD is just the beginning, you have to really sign up for the monthly subscription for it to go to other levels. The program is poorly written and if you don't exit it properly you are completely messed up and have to uninstall and re-install the software and you child has to go over everything again. This has happened to my son 3 times and it is very frustrating. I think they just don't want to fix this as it keeps the usage/subscription going for a longer time.

Apart from one or two good tracks (Mass, Enae Volare), I found them to be dreadfully insipid. They seem to me pretty close to an easy listening version of Christian rock (if this is not a redundancy). They seem to be making use of Gregorian chant in some tracks but I find there's no animus in their music, no heart or soul, just clever syncopation. They don't move me.

I read the reviews and I thought I knew what to expect. Many people said the book was filled with generalities and wasn't useful to anyone with graduate or real world business experience. I took that into consideration but being a 2nd year undergrad I thought I should find at least a few enlightening ideas. Some people even recommend it as useful for the \\"16-21\\" crowd, but I would charge even for the average achiever in college the book falls short of expectations and is not worth owning.

On the other hand, you do get some sense of McKinsey's internal workings (eg. getting assigned to a project, career development, etc).It's an easy read, a few hours at most, but unfortunately the true amount of useful information could be summarized in a first semester MBA student's 4-page book report."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time it takes to read and it doesn't take long","review":"Nothing special in this book -- I would be more than happy to send my copy to anyone that wants it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Lack of Useful Information -- Not worth reading","review":"...

If McKinsey would like to take credit for the 80/20 Rule, as the author implies, perhaps they should take that up with Pareto who first suggested the relationship in 1897. In a rapidly moving business world, there simple is not enough time to waste on lightweight books like this. Tom Peters is a much better representative of McKinsey and his books will give a clearer, more useful picture of the quality work done by that consulting giant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its full of common consulting, no McKinzey way consulting.","review":"There are a couple of really good books on general consulting process - much better than Mr Rasiel's. Mr Rasiel has just cheated the customers in getting them to purchase the book by putting the 'McKinsey' name on it. Other than on the cover, there is no'McKinsey way' inside the book. Its a fraud.I have a better mind than to agree with the author about the McKinsey Way! I am sure McKinsey is much better than what Mr Rasiel's book says. The author needs to be sued, for misleading the readers. I guess, he is a disgruntelled employee of McKinsey and very subtly made money off his employers organization and in the process, achieved his objective of tarnishing its image."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected to go \\"Wow\\" but instead I went \\"Huh?\\"","review":"I bought this book because I am considering a career change from molecular biologist to management consulting and McKinsey & Co. is one of the firms that I am targeting. I call this book a case of \\"Shameful brand exploitation\\". It was truly an embarrassing read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really the McKinsey way","review":"This book claims to provide an insight into the skills and tactics that McKinsey consultants use. However, it rarely goes beyond generalities i.e. you would find some business concepts that business school grads (and many others) would be well aware of. Not really the McKinsey way."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wrong Way","review":"Though the author offers a few unique insights into the way the world's premier consultancy operates (such as the thirty-second test where one has to tell his boss all key suggestions between floors in an elevator), a two minute conversation with someone who has worked at McKinsey would do the same, if not better. The only true way to understand the \\"McKinsey Way\\" is to hone up your interviewing skills and try to land yourself a job. Otherwise, if you are only interested in business advice and presentation skill enhancement, there are countless other books to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter rubbish...do not waste your money","review":"This is the first time I have felt the need to write a review in many, many years of buying books on Amazon. I think most of the points raised by others who have written scathing reviews capture the crux of why this book is such a poor investment so I won't repeat them. What summed the book up for me is the advice on page 148 of the edition I wasted my money on. We are told that 'treating everyone with respect' is, 'possibly the best advice in this book'. REALLY? If you want to be told the blindingly obvious, feel free to buy this book. If you want to learn anything of any value that you will be able to use in the workplace, you should avoid this book like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection of repetitions and buzz words","review":"After a very bad experience hiring a McKinsey team, I was hoping that the quality of the firm under other circumstances would be better. However, if this book reflects the depth and insightfulness of that firm consulting worldwide, I am convinced that these people do not have anything new to offer to the corporate world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with conventional wisdom, definitely not worth the $","review":"This book reminded me of term papers I used to write: wide margins, lots of white space, big font, and much repetition. I bought it because I thought it might provide insight, instead I was bombarded with conventional wisdom. I think the author is brilliant; he is going to make some money by throwing a book together in a week or so and adding the McKinsey name to make sure it sells. I bought this book at the airport in London, so I can't take it back. If anyone wants a copy, pay the shipping and I'll send it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight","review":"Well-organized book with a useful albeit cursory look into the world of management consulting as a McKinsey veteran.Recommended for any one looking to learn more about the field but not for anyone looking for the key to the McKinsey thought process in detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull McKinsey self praise","review":"This book is written by someone who is more interested in portraying himself (and \\"The Firm\\") as extraordinary rather than communicating anything remotely useful to the reader.Unlike many excellent publications from ex or current McKinsey-ites this one does no favours to the brand name of the firm.Pick up any good old Dilbert comic book and you will find yourself more enlightened than with \\"The McKinsey Way\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing you couldn't guess","review":"this book was a complete disappointment. it claims to educate business professionals about The McKinsey Way of solving problems.

Don't waste your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Must Read for Sure...","review":"I picked up the book with a hope of picking some cool fundas in Consulting and was very disappointed. I would put the book as a small collection of \\"Common Sense\\" and none of the methods to be really extra ordinary.

This is the second time i've blindly bought a trance cd, and I was hoping I could press my luck in my satisfaction level (the first cd i bought out of impulse was BT: R&R and I am really really happy). Anyway, the cd is pretty good, the first cd has that Ibiza feel with all the house and dance music. The first 5-7 tracks are really good. I still need to study the cd. The second cd is also good, and has more dance/trance feel (I'm surprised they added \\"Castles in the Sky\\" a really good song, but overplayed in America), and I am kind of sick seeing Paul Oakenfold's remix to the classic \\"Planet Rock\\". I really like Oakey, but some things need to be left untouched, and also, I hope not, but I feel he's losing his touch. In general, it's a really good cd, but it's not something to spend all your money on. This is my first purchase from Cream, and I think they did a good job, not a breakthrough job, but would consider another from their series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect monster has no end","review":"I can't believe their have been no reviews for this excellent overview of Roky Erickson's catalog. This is a nice single disk overview of Rocky's best stuff. It starts with two 13th floor elevators songs and has seven well selected solo gems. I also really like that it has 3 very rare acoustic home recordings included on this soundtrack only. You even get to hear Roky ask if one of them was recorded after he finishes singing. The \\"I Have Always Been Here Before: The Roky Erickson Anthology\\" 2 CD set is a better value but I like the Stu Cook produced version of \\"Two Headed Dog\\" better on this CD than the original single version included on the 2 CD set.

For example, in Super Mario Sunshine, when you press R2 Mario will react as if you pulled the Gamecube controller's R trigger all the way.But, it works exactly as I'd hoped, but just putting that out there for those of you who wanted to use it for their Gamecube games."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK WITH THE NEW MODEL WII'S","review":"Beware that the latest model of Wii, the \\"Family Edition\\" that is currently bundled with Super Mario Bros.

It is a great controller, but sometimes you want something without a giant button surrounded by tiny ones. The PS2 to GameCube Converter solves that ailment perfectly. There is no confusion using this device. Just plug and play. The only issue is that the default button layout may not feel right.

His story of his life as a soldier during WW 2 comes as no surprise. Now it is fashionable in America to talk of post traumatic stress disorder but the same conditions have existed on every battlefield from the beginning of time. Mowat vividly brings them to life as many writers of wartime do. This is an intensly personal and moving story and should be required reading for every 17 year old itching to go into the army. The title is especially evocative since Mowat is a naturalist and everywhere he goes, he looks for local birds. In spite of being in an exotic place, he would collect no new species there"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful and all true","review":"Many books have been written about and by law-enforcement officers who have gone undercover as bad guys, but DONNIE BRASCO deservedly sits at the top of the heap. The story is so engrossing, you might have to stop and remind yourself that it isn't fiction. Special Agent Pistone gives the reader great insight into the psychology of undercover work and the dangers--physical and emotional--a person in his position must endure. The movie version was entertaining, but this is the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This was an amazing book.

They are both great stories,(Undercover FBI Agents infiltrate the Mafia and are proposed for membership) The only difference is that FBI Agent Garcia worked 5 other Undercover investigations at the same time that he was infiltrating the Gambinos. A truly amazing feat. Both Agent Pistone and Agent Garcia are true heroes and Patriots in the war against organize crime. I strongly recommend reading both books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great account of the FBI's penetration of a Mob family","review":"Pistone's account of the time he spent infiltrating the Bonnano family was truly spellbinding.

This CD contains her two late 60s albums for PZAZZ records. With some exceptions (\\"I'm Wishin'\\", \\"Help Me\\",) this is no 'must have'. Too many confusing Jive/Blues/Rock etc.etc.etc. arrangements, too much end 60s-Sarah Vaughan or Roberta Flack style singing, especially on the second album.

I found them right here. These speakers are great. Granted they run off of 4 AAA batteries and my ipod (4th generation)doesn't really set right in the little platform for it. BUT the sound is more than worth it. The speakers work great for low level music at my desk to blaring over the shower in my bathroom. I am BEYOND please with this purchase. So to recap:Pros-Great soundcord wraps neatly around the device in a grove just for it.When folded the speakers are a nice compact little square.Cons-Doesn't run off of device battery, but 4 AAAs instead.stand/platform for device is really more of a sliding box (But if your device has the headphone jack on the side or on top it shouldn't make a difference.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"For the very low price I did not expect much.But it works just fine.

It is not well made and it is designed to break easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot and Lukewarm","review":"Every time I listen to this album, I am either beyond impressed or of the mind that the disc is better than good. It certainly isn't bad. Like most of what Thrice releases, how you feel about the songs is going to depend on what kind of mood you're in when listening. Since so much of what they do is experimental, it's harder to know how to pin the correct mood for listening down. That is especially true with this cd. It's punk-metal that doesn't always follow the song outline most of us have grown used to. That is generally refreshing, sometimes flooring in its deliverance. But it's hard to know if this album is a 3 or a 5; so I'm giving it a 4 for good measure. Give it a listen. Better yet, give it 3 before you make up your own mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exit door procedure at 30,000 feet","review":"When first I heard of Thrice, I was left with the impression that they were another gutter hardcore punk band. Not true. After sitting through \\"Illusion of Safety\\" I'm sold. The disc has the feel of a sideproject containing members of Atreyu, Saves the Day, and The Used. This disc is melodic emo-metal at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"AFter giving this one close examination, i've come to another conclusion...these guys rock.Deep deep lyrics. thats what makes these guys so incredible. very deep lyrics that are just too incredible to overlook.some hard guitars and some screaming. not my favorite combination but they are needed here. thrice mixes a good combinationt of screamy hardcore with melodic emo. very good mix here and they do it with stylesee you in the shallows is a pretty sweet track.in years to come is also a very sweet track.deadbolt is the only song that has a little bit of air play. not much though. and its a good songi recommend this as well as their debut, \\"Identity Crisis\\"perfect 5/5later"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the last lp","review":"One of the best melodic hardcore albums i have listened to in a long time. It is definitely an exciting lp with a slight emo edge to some of the songs. If you are a fan of either melodic hardcore in the vein of 88 fingers louie, or perhaps straight up punk rock like the Lawrence Arms, but are also an emo fan this album is for you. Great hooks, especially on the tracks So Strange I remember you, and the Beltsville Crucuible. Definitely in the running for punk album of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"The future of punk music","review":"Something new is going to hit the rock world like a bucket of water and this is it.

Thrice was a great band, Illusion of Safety is one of the most incredable albums ever. Now they sound like every other band out there today. Personally I Hate emo, I grew out of that crap along time ago. I'm sorry if I offend people in saying that. I just dont see any talent in it. Thrice used to be my favorite band. Being a guitarist myself, I enjoyed Identity Crisis' true hardcore sound, and Illusion of Safety's amazing creativity, but the Artist in the Ambulance and this new CD are crap. If your emo, then give it a shot, but if your sick of the new-age emo crap you can't avoid every time you turn on the radio, put this album back. It's time to move on Thrice fans. They came.. they rocked.. there done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suck","review":"Bands like this truly make me furious. This is not what rock is about. Rock is about haven a good time not lying on track and letting wolves tear you apart. Thats gay if you think that this compares in anyway to your life than you are severly screwed up and you ve got big issues. Listen to some AC/DC and Van Halen or even led Zepplin or kiss or Ramones then you will get a taste of rocknRoll at its finest gothic hsve screwed up rocknroll in the sence that they all want to die and are all against athoritie you cannot have it both ways.

However, that isnt the feel of \\"Illusion of Safety\\". This album feels like a side project starring members of Saves The Day and Atreyu. It Emo-core at its best. The Disc begins with a deceptive 30 seconds of aggressive metal and moves seamlessly to a melodic chorus full of pop sensibility.Thrice may not be all too unique in a genre dominated by sing alike-scream alike emo bands, but \\"Illusion of Safety\\" is well worth a thorough listen just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Album Ever Made","review":"Aight everybody. This album is off the hook peepz! If you truly like rock then you will fall in love with album. Thrice's best songs are on this album and every single one of them are awsome. The next best choice you got is their album The Artist In The Ambulance but this album is far better! If you don't believe me then fine. I dont care. You are just missin out on the best band that ever played. Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Solid Release","review":"First off, Thrice is a great band. I love Identity Crises. Hands down one of the best records of last year. Anyway, The Illusion Of Safety is Thrice's Second Full length album to date. I am not very impressed with this release. Thrice got rid of alot of thier poppunk and replaced it with cheesy Metal riffs. There are no songs on this release that are up to par with past songs like Identity Crises,Ultra Blue,To What End,A Torch To End All Torches, and T@C. The last five songs on the disk are pretty good, but the songs don't measure up to Thrice's earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"talented but not particularly creative","review":"I really dislike the direction most punk has taken in the last few years, now that it has become a radio genre. There is nothing different style-wise that Thrice offers versus any of the ... you hear on the radio. It's the same, lame formula.The only reason they get two stars is because they play their instruments with a lot of energy and talent... but if you are a long-time fan of punk, are tired of what is being generally consumed by the public, and are looking for something new... this isn't it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"this album is great, i have listened to the illusion of safety 1000+ times and it is still enjoyable. trust is the only song that i wish wasn't on this album. buy it you wont regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only question is....what lies ahead?","review":"Let me cut straight to the point. The Illusion of Saftey is simpily amazing. It's probably one of the best albums I've heard the past couple of years. The guitars are amazing, the bass and drums are great, and the lyrics are extremely heart felt and strong. This album shows a lot of maturity from Thrice's first effort, \\"identity crisis\\" ..which buy the way is still really good. There new album, \\"The Artist in The Ambulance\\" comes out July 22nd and sounds like it will be a hit. But first, do yourself a favor and buy this CD....you will not regret it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"thrice is the new wave of the future","review":"This album stands alone amungst the crowd and is a different, yet better style of music from the traditional thrice. It may be a little more fast-paced than their older stuff, but the music is very respectable and in my eyes has evolved in many ways. Listen to the instrumentals and then to the lyrics and you will be amazed. They are truly ahead of their time with variety of music that ranges from hardcore to mellow, while at the same time executing both beyond expectations. And if you think they are good on CD, then you should definately see them in concert and you will be amazed by the show that they put on. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From Start to Finish, The Greatness Doesn't Stop","review":"Ever since I heard \\"Artist in the Ambulance\\" I had to check out all their other stuff, so I went out and bought this Cd and every little bit, I loved!

If you are looking at this review to decide to buy it or not, this is Thrice's best album. The other two albums are definitely worth owning too, but I place this cd slightly above the others.

Teppei is a guitar god. Theres lots of fast and slow songs, so theres somethin that we can all like i guess. You can tell that theres more metal influence but at the same time punk influence in this record. Whats cool about this record is the songs aren't the beat through out the song. Like one part it's real fast then it becomes slow so you never know what to expect. Great great record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now thats better","review":"What an improvement.This album is so much better that Identity Crisis. I loved it mainly because of the talent involved. The drum work is catchy and fantastic and the guitar just blew me away, and trust me, being a guitarist, i would know. As for the lyrics, it sounds as if Dustin has been writing songs for over ten years. its fantastic. he's songs actually mean something, unlike most of the crap out today. The highlight tracks for me were, Kill Me Quickly, Deadbolt, A Living Dance Upon Dead Minds and So Strange I Remember You.Dont be put off by bad reviews... go and buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter for the neo-emo kids","review":"This is a bands that handles itself well.

I have never been so disappointed in any present I have ever received. This book serves as a reminder of everything that has gone wrong with the game. Baseball was once the game of the common man. A game of honesty integrity and spirit. Reading this book reminded me that the important legacy items of the game are now in the hands of the superwealthy and can only be accessed by the interviews of another super wealthy man - Wong.

The game's artifacts extend way beyond the cards and gimcrack collectibles sold at the ballpark, and Wong has deftly toggled his focus from collectible to collector and back again, providing a memorable prose portrait of the lively game played off the field.

BUT now I am beside myself I am so livid and doubt I'll get another Sony anything!! It's become almost impossible to watch because the tv loses picture and sound for about 30 seconds and then it comes back. The standby light blinks about 38-42 times while this is going on. Sony \\"customer support\\" was no help and it's likely to fix it is going to cost an exhorbitant amount of money. This is the second Sony tv I've had crap out on me like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAVEAT EMPTOR : Know what you're getting yourself into.","review":"First let me say that the sound quality and the picture quality are above average for televisions made at this time. But it would be irresponsible for someone to sell you this television with telling you about the known issues associated with this model. First and foremost, the optical block will not last very long. This is the main image creating device for this model. To replace and/or fix the model will cost upwards of a thousand dollars. Also, the bulbs only last a few years if you're lucky, and those run around 150-250 a piece, depending on whether you buy factor or after-market parts, and if there is service involved.Do a google search about the 'optical block' and 'Sony Grand WEGA' or 'kdf-55wf655' for yourself before buying this one. It's a shame because when it does work, it really has a beautiful picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"Sony tvs have a design fault in the optical block that is uneconomical to repair. There was a big class action lawsuit. Sony showed itself to be a company with no real care for its customers. We are out $3500 after only 6 years of tv use. We also have 2 Sony cameras that failed prematurely. Sony does not equal the quality we all thought they were."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been very pleased.

Barry Fienstein was along for most of the 5/66 tour and his pictures are mostly brand new and very very exiting. I was a little disappionted by the lack of preformance pictures included, but that's a minor gripe. Overall an essential picture book for any Dylan fan, new or old.Note: Barry Feinstein's pictures graced the booklet that went with the CD \\"Bob Dylan, Live 1966\\".

This game is perfect for begginner Role Playing Gamers, with an easy to learn D6 (six sided dice) system. The book is clean, colorful, and easy to read. It teaches you how to play, create adventures, and lots more. Probably the best part of the book is the numerous examples of gameplay. Give the author a pat on the back for that, time after time in other RPGs Ive been annoyed by the lack of examples of play. No need to worry here, there is an example for almost every skill or rule in the game, so you don't have to second guess the book's quality.

Some of the guitar resembles that of Sonic Youth (I think so, maybe others wouldn't). The vocals take some getting used to, but eventually I grew to like them. They aren't beautiful so much as they are impassioned, perhaps that is why they make some people cringe.These songs are well thought out and, although it is apparent that this album is kind of dated (it is a very 90's sound, even if it's from the late nineties), I for one really enjoy and value it.This is my first Sleater-Kinney album.

The film is full of Rube Goldberg type gadgets to make life easier and the sub is always handy to provide for every need.

Doyle has a wonderful ear for the cadence of Irish speech, a real gift for making his characters come alive on the page, and a story to tell of a remarkable young man who lives the history of Ireland during its most turbulent times. His powers of description --of the grinding poverty of the Dublin slums, especially- are masterful. In giving us a history lesson, he also tells a tale of betrayal, loyalty, honor, and love.

Doyle comes from a long tradition of expert storytellers,and even if the reader doesn't know much about Irish history, the tale is compelling.As a glimpse of Irish political figures, the book made me want to read up on early 20th Century Ireland.Like all of Doyle's protagonists, Henry Smart is no victim. He has an inner strength and confidence that keeps the reader cheering--even if he does engage in criminal activities like murder.I can hardly wait for the next two thirds of the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm a huge fan of Roddy Doyle and was excited that there was to be a trilogy of new work - now I look forward to the trilogy being well and truly over and Doyle, hopefully, regaining his senses.

I could barely make myself finish it as it is full of foul language.

Henry is a hard man and becomes involved in the troubles, eventually to be consumed by them.You do not need any expertise in this period of history to understand or enjoy the book. In fact, unless you are very knowledgeable, you will probably learn a few truths.

He could have continued to crank out more of his hilarious, winning Barrytown books, but he decided to grow as a writer, and we're all the beneficiaries. His latest book is audacious in the scope of its ideas -- and contrary to appearances, this story of the birth of the Irish Republic far from \\"a well-trodden path\\" for an Irish author. Doyle's unflinching view of the Rebellion and especially the IRA may anger many people in his native land; they opened my eyes. I'll recommend this book as often and as highly as I can."},{"rating":"2","title":"A star called Henry","review":"Thank God! At last,a book about the 1916 Rising and the War of Independance that doesn't try to portray the Irish as brave, selfless heroes, and the British as cruel but cowardly oppressors.This book is a triumph, and Mr. Doyle certainly has a way with words when it comes to describing lustful sex scenes set in the basement of a besieged postoffice during a rebellion against an imperial government.A funny, insightful and utterly brilliant book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"horse-celtic fans","review":"my mother in law who is a big horse and celtic fan was very pleasd to recieve this unusual gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had greater expectations","review":"I didn't feel let down, but had greater expectations.

His voice is just perfect to get the message out of the song. No, his songs weren't political but more romantic and light-hearted in tone and harmony like \\"It would take a strong strong man\\" to never let you go or \\"Whenever You Need Somebody\\" as well as others on this compact disc.

Last night, I was going through some old CDs and put this one on. I don't know if I'll ever be the same. This is absolutely wretched. Vile. Hideous. Mr. Astley sounds, through his vocals, as though he is being tortured and is, for some reason, compelled to pass the favor on to us, the innocent music-buying public.This is a bad album, performed by a minor talent.

My 19 month old just likes chewing on the controller."},{"rating":"2","title":"good toy, but not for young children","review":"We recieved this toy last Christmas for my son (6 months old) and he was deathly afraid of it! It is the only thing that I have ever found him to be afraid of: except for the vaccume cleaner. I put it up and waited until his first birthday and showed it to him again. He loved it, but not the toy itself; he liked to be in control, he wanted to hold the remote and \\"drive it\\". He still likes it, and plays with it almost everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the 10 month old, the 3 year old and the parents too","review":"As with all toys, it just depends on the interests of the kids.We all play this toy together as a family and sometimes by ourselves. SOmetimes I just sit and play with it while the kids are playing with something else.The controls are supper easy (foward, turn and beep-beep). Even the 10 month old figured it out and he was so happy to make it work.I love the fact that when you tip it upside down or sideways, the wheels stop moving. So little fingers don't get caught.The toy can be played in two ways - one as a remote control (and the kids love to chase it) and if you put the remote on the toy and press a button music comes out of it and goes crazy.The music is not annoying and not loud either. I am super happy we got this for our sons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Toy, But It Broke Very Easily!","review":"I got this toy for my son, who is 1 1/2.

I wish I had taken it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute, but not as fun as I thought","review":"First off, I think this is the most adorable toy & it definitely captures my little guy's attention. The remote control use of the toy will be super easy as he gets older. The automated operation is kind of goofy though. It only runs in a straight line, does a couple of spins then stops or it will stop after hitting something. My understanding was that it would turn itself & keep going. I do think it is a great toy and extremely unique especially for the price. It looks like it will become a favorite for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic first remote-control toy","review":"I bought this for my son's first birthday, and he absolutely loved it!The toy has two remote-control stages. In the first, the remote control sits on the toy. Your child can make the goofy giggles move around and giggle by pushing any of the three buttons. My son was able to figure this out very quickly and was so proud of himself for making the toy move. At this stage it moves in a random pattern and my little boy thought it was hysterical if the vehicle seemed to be coming toward him (or even better, the cat!).My son is now almost two and he uses the remote control separate from the car. He has had no problems using the buttons to control the vehicle.We also have several different flooring types in our home (carpeting, tile, and hardwood) and the toy moves from one to the other with ease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes too many batteries and sucks them down!","review":"The other reviews are right, this is a FUN toy, when it's working. It uses 7 batteries, yes that's right 7! Not to mention, I found myself changing the batteries every 3-4 days. It drains batteries worse than any other toy I've seen. I finally gave it to charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - Treads will hurt fingers","review":"I bought this toy for my 9 month old son and he loved it. When we first gave it to him, he chased it and mashed the buttons to make it giggle and go. Within 2 minutes of playing with it, he picked it up and promptly got his finger stuck between the tread (which has plastic teeth vs a rubber band) and what I'll call the wheel well. One thing that is cool about this toy is that it moves very fast on a variety of surfaces, which means that those plastic teeth are moving pretty fast and really hurt. When I placed my finger next to it, it caught me and I could feel where it was ground by the teeth for at least ten minutes; not constant pain, but I could tell where it had got caught when I cared to notice.I was very surpised with this because it is made my Little Tikes. We have a lot of their toys, etc, but I cannot recommend this one.We have talked to Little Tikes and they are sending us another toy as a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"We like !!","review":"My Daughter just recieved this for her 2nd Birthday. At first she was scared and ran to get on the couch, once there she proceeded to call it a \\"Shark\\"! After we showed her it was o.k to touch and it isn't a shark, she loves it. We do have a house full of carpet, but have had no problems with it running. It has been very all-terrain for us. The one problem we had was right out of the package. Fresh batteries and it did not work. My Husband had to pull on the springs in the battery compartment in the main unit to get a connection. Simple to fix, but still a pain for a brand new toy. Ours was maybe a defective one? Now it works great and I think this is a fun toy all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goofy Giggles spazzes out!","review":"I originally bought this for my daughter to encourage her to crawl and she loved it! But after ten minutes of using it, it suddenly died and it would only giggle when I pushed the buttons. I had used brand new batteries(alkaline as it recommends) but nothing so I turned it off for about an hour and then turned it back on, but this time it did the complete opposite and flipped out! The thing just went crazy and was going so fast and spinning so fast that it flipped over and wouldn't stop until I finally just turned it off. Well I tried it a couple more times and it just did the same thing either wouldn't work or just went so fast it toppled itself over, so I just gave up. Bummer, my daughter really enjoyed it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"It goes on our carpet and baby's not afraid","review":"Naturally not every situation is the same. I was a little surprised by how many other reviewers had problems making this toy go on carpet. It works on our carpet just fine.Our 16 mo old is not afraid of it but she does prefer to hold it, touch the wheels and carry it around instead of using the remote. Daddy likes playing with the remote and Baby likes it to \\"chase\\" her. It goes from carpet to tile and back to carpet with no problems (including over the carpet strip).It does make our dog bark and get between the toy and the baby. Otherwise, it's a fine toy for a baby who likes \\"clickers\\" and things that \\"go.\\"Note: This toy sets off our smoke alarm / carbon monoxide detector. Not that it smokes; something in the remote does it."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it !","review":"After reading some reviews, I was afraid that it might frighten my son, 8 months old, as he is very skittish.

It can read smaller/cheaper mp3 players and some USB cameras - but both source and target devices must be FAT32/vfat formatted, which makes those devices somewhat less useful with your computer. The documentation and packaging fails to mention this important limitation.Another thing the packaging doesn't tell you is that this is a USB 1.1 device, thus the transfer rate is too slow for anything but small devices unless you have access to AC power and plenty of time.With USB-2.0 and better compatibility (NTFS, and maybe some config software so you could choose the source and target directory/folder structure) this would be a great device at twice the price.

What begins as an interesting story of two reluctant spies suddenly deteriorates into a sadly naive and blatantly sophomoric anti-American screed ending in an outlandish climax derived from the depths of some personal hatred rather than the genius of a fertile imagination. It is sad to see how low this once great writer of fiction has fallen"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am devastated","review":"I have always felt that John Le Carre was one of today's finest authors. His works about the Cold War and such characters such as George Smiley have provided endless hours of enjoyment.For the first 400 pages of Absolute Friends, it seemed as though LeCare had found a new arena for is writings. It's only in the last 60 pages that the book trails off into the sort of cynical, paranoia that has become so stylish around the world.It's sad, but I will never purchase another Le Carre work again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I've liked most of Le Carre's books, the spy novels as well as the others. Absolute Friends is an interesting and mostly enjoyable read for much of the book, but the author permits his almost extreme anti-American views to take over the last 50 or 60 pages of this novel, creating a wholly unacceptable and bizarre ending.

In fewer than twenty pages the reader can predict the outcome but it takes a good three hundred pages to begin to get interesting. That fades quickly with le Carre's ham-fisted slamming of the West for everything wrong with the world, a numbing tirade that seems to be the only purpose for the novel. It certainly isn't to tell a story. Le Carre fails to use even the slightest subtlety in either character development or plot. What happened to the master story teller? He certainly abandoned his craft to write Absolute Friends.My copy went in the recycle bin. Don't waste your money. You'll get better value out of spending it on toilet paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel betrayed","review":"I enjoyed le Carre's cold war books very much and had read everything he's written except Absolute Friends. I am about the age of Ted and Sasha and remember much of the times described in this book. I couldn't be of a more opposite viewpoint than the main characters.

Definitely the last of his books I will read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raving leftist (very) rant","review":"I loved his \\"old\\" books. The more recent ones have, IMHO, been going down hill. This one has me off Le Carre forever. First, it was very slow going, very hard to get into. It finally grabbed me (well over halfway into the book), but I'd see little bits of what was to come at the end -- a political rant. I thought no, surely he's not being that jaded. Well, that doesn't begin to describe the rant at the end. The ending of the story is positively ludicrous. (BTW, I am very middle of the road politically.) I think anyone who is not on the very far left would find the ending completely implausible. After that, he goes on an unabashed political rant that has only a tenuous connection to reality.

What is this author trying to do, reincarnate Shakespeare? Why are there no headings at the beginning of each chapter to give me some idea of a dateline? Instead I'm forced to use hidden clues such as the age of Mundy's wasted son to determine how much time has passed. Lecarre has to give it up. Amongst modern history, the Berlin wall is a speck of dust. He'd be better off writing about Panama or Grenada. Writing about the Berlin Wall segment of the Cold War in the 21st century is like beating a dead horse. The characters are ridiculous. If this guy Mundy is so smart, why does he worship Sasha? Why? Did they just smoke so much dope together in their days of protest that their brains were that fried? These two are modern day hippies! Losers!

I read about 120 pages into Absolute Friends before putting it down in disgust. It went nowhere -- no plot, no substance, shoddy character development. In the past, I have persevered with slow-moving books which picked up at the end, but with Absolute Friends, it was Absolute Disgust.

Murdoch may be a great writer but it's not evident in this book. Remember those writing classes where the prof told you to \\"show, not tell\\"? Murdoch must have decided to see if she could write a book using the completely opposite method. There is no reader interaction required here at all - you are supposed to be an open, empty vessel into which Murdoch pours an unending analysis of each character and each action. Nothing at all for your brain to do. This book is great for insomnia.All the characters in the book are, quite simply, crazy. Not one of them is the least bit believable. They are completely and utterly self centered and about as interesting as a laundry list. If you are interested in philosophy, this book will show you just how irrelevant and silly it can be.

Norman is certainly entitled to his philosophy, and I have much respect for the women who chose to model a lifestyle after him (with submissive tendencies myself), but isn't there a point where you are just beating the proverbial dead horse to an even bloodier pulp?Also, please tell me how many people have actually read the portions of the story where he describes a game of Kaissa or the measurements of the war ships.

(im not kidding there were actually dinosaurs......dont ask me how) if ou really want a good action anime that has at least some semblance of a story line get akira or outlaw star. if youre new to anime steer clear of this one lest it tarnish your opinion of the genra forever..........but seriously get akira.......it rox!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.

Believe me many elementary kids could and have written better things than this. It's not even worth pointing out the lowpoints. Believe me you will be kicking yourself if you buy this.

An almost criminal waste of quality animation on what must be the most ill-conceived storyline and characterization ever to inflict itself upon unsuspecting audiences. How Mr. Otomo could have allowed himself to be involved in this production is simply beyond me. Thank God it was never released to the movie-going public in the States. It's not even fit for the arthaus/independent film circuit. If you want interesting characters or involving plotlines, check out Akira or Ghost in the Shell. Spriggan is best left on the shelf to gather dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this rated so well!","review":"I would like to comment that the rebuttle that it's an action anime and hence doesn't need a descent plot or character development is totaly bogus. Heck Johny Numonic, Total Recall, and heck even Fortress are all better than this movie (though IMO none of them are good). Yet I guess there are simple minded moves for a reason.If you really want an action get Golgo 13: The Professional (not Queen Bee), good action, great car chase, some reasonable plot, unique characters. Just keep in mind that it came out in '83 and the CG scene at the end was cutting edge at the time._spoiler, maybe_Back to Spriggan, what the heck is up with the ending, aside form being mildily crazy the Colonel is so overwhelemingly powerful how the heck did he lose.

As in live-action features, anime can be subdivided into a variety of different tiers: drama, mystery/suspense, horror, action; etc. To say a film isn't any good because it doesn't wholly encompass all these different genres is quite simply asking too much. Spriggan is the action movie that all action movies aspire to. Character designs are excellent, the animation is incredibly fluid, and the story, unless you're an infant, is quite easy to follow and is intriguing to boot. This movie is for those of you who like to shut your brain down for a time, and just enjoy the pure visceral thrill that a good action flick can create. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great action and visuals, but thats it!","review":"Let me start out by saying the visuals are stunning and the action is good, but there's one major problem... the story ...!

I received the DVD as a present. Itami is one of the greatest modern directors in Japan who unfortunately committed suicide. This movie was enormously popular in Japan and deservedly so with its many touches of black humor, story, writing, acting and direction. The VHS is quite watchable. However, when I put the DVD on I immediately had to adjust my picture settings to even see the picture. It's unclear and fuzzy throughout the movie. In all of the film the English subtitling is difficult and sometimes impossible to read. I would say it is a prime candidate for a recall by the company. Since I can't give separate ratings for the movie vs. the DVD treatment I'm forced to give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant Movie-- Rotten DVD","review":"I must add my voice to the chorus of complaints about this product. I paid a premium price for this DVD, and received a bad product. The transfer is lousy, in fullscreen, and yes, the subtitles suck. I have to wonder if the Yakuza have mounted a campaign against Itami's work, permitting only poor copies to make their way to the West. Hell, it's so hard to find this man's movies in the U.S. I have to wonder if this is a pirate copy, elaborately packaged and sent out to deliberately frustrate Itami fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent farce","review":"This film was my introduction to Itami Juuzo's work, and I couldn't help but be impressed. Much as Lumet's NIGHT FALLS ON MANHATTAN derives its thrills from long periods of silence punctuated by bursts of action, MARUSA NO ONNA derives its comedy from sudden, out-of-place bursts of violence (cf. the pachinko parlor owner's hilarious \\"I'll do anything to keep a million dollars\\"). Itami knows his story inside-out, however, and never lets this technique get out-of-hand.

This shaving gel actually seems to hydrate my skin for a more after lotion, smooth feel. Satin Care comes out as a gel but quickly becomes a creamy, thick foam as you spread it. Many other brands I have tried become very thin and run off before you have a chance to shave. Not with Satin Care! It stays on until you shave and really helps act as a buffer to your skin.

Even Wings Hauser as the big bad guy has his moments, so all is not lost.However, the script is full of bad 80s slang. Characters make decisions that do not make any logical sense. One early section of dialgue is so bad that I had to stop the tape. And the music is bad 80s hair-rock.Beastmaster 2 is similar to Highlander 2. The second movie of each series is almost unrelated to the original movie.

The strap that came with it isn't very sturdy. The plastic piece broke when my husband was tightening it.

The story often rambles away from talking about piano, and towards the LL Bean, chocolate lab, yuppie lifestyle of the author. This one sentence from the book sums it up:\\"The Inn is lovely -- I especially like the lighting in the bathroom; it makes me look happy and rested...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"piano playing sans piano teacher","review":"mr. adams book was a sad disappointment to this adult beginner piano player. his chapters follow the calendar year beginning with the purchase of an expensive piano. for the next 9 months he tries to learn with a computer program and audio tapes and by interviewing pianists and piano makers. perhaps he thought the latter would transmit their skills by osmosis. i wondered after finishing the book if adams, as a successful broadcast journalist, avoided a piano teacher because of the very real terror of failing every week, (so far in my first 3 months)to get anything right. the hints about practise and technique i was hoping for, were sought in vain. as i said a sad disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Piano","review":"I was instantly intrigued by this book. I was disappointed that of the 242 pages, it take until page 181 for him to decide to even play Traumerei for his wife.Quite frankly, this book is filled with self indulgant nonsense. If Adams had stuck to the idea of writing a book about just learning piano , it would have been fine. Instead he meanders onto subjects such buying boats and taking trips. What does any of that crap have to do with playing piano?I think Noah Adam's experience is very indicative of the \\"I want everything now with little work\\" philosophy that pervades our country. I have very little doubt that the exquisite Steinway he bought has either been sold or is gathering dust. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ironic title, but a good read","review":"The irony of \\"Piano Lessons\\" is that it's not about taking piano lessons at all, at least not weekly piano lessons with a teacher, and so you might read this book as a primer on how NOT to learn to play the piano.That said, I enjoyed this book and found it to be a lovely meditation on the beauty of the piano and the difficulty of fitting an amateur passion into a busy, career-laden schedule. I thought to myself that if a fine writer and talented journalist such as Adams could take such a weird approach to learning to play - erratically using music software and turning his back on his lovely new Steinway! -- then I shouldn't be afraid to try. It's been a year since I read \\"Piano Lessons,\\" and I now own a piano, am six months into weekly piano lessons and am at the skill level where I could play \\"Traumeri\\" (although I haven't tried to do so). \\"Piano Lessons\\" helped kick-start my own musical adventure.How's it going with you, Noah?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long On Talk, Short On Lessons","review":"I was interested in reading the book becasue I recently returned to playing the piano after 30 years and I thought it would be fun to read someone else's experience on the trials and tribulations learning or relearning the music and buying a piano. Unfortunately, Mr. Adam's short reminisecne was short on information about actual playing and such and more about his very busy life with NPR. His book also suffers from \\"name dropitis\\" and a sometimes an elitist tone. Passages about \\"overfed\\" mall shoppers in \\"stonewashed\\" jeans -- followed by the author's refuge to an organic juice bar was plebian writing. I was most appalled by the fact that Mr. Adams purchases an incredibly expensive piano before even being able to read music!

Everybody else, read \\"Men, Women & Pianos\\" by Arthur Loesser for its wit and depth,even if it is way out of date.

As one of the characters in the book said \\"it just feels ancient\\". And it does. There are tiny and lovely B&B's all up and down the road right across from the Forest and compared to London are quite inexpensive. Nicer too. At times you sit under the huge tree at the entrance (also the road to the Abbey) which sits on top of a hill and just gaze out on the tree tops.

I managed to finish the book despite the horrible writing, which goes beyond punctuation mistakes and repeated information. It is full of non-sequiturs, parenthetical notes (that do repeat the same information they are describing), subordinate clauses that do not refer back to anything, and a terrible overuse of the \\"etc.\\". This all makes for a very confusing read. Fouse is not a writer or scholar - he is a former customs and DEA agent turned ESL teacher (check out his blog \\"fousesquawk\\") and is now a dilettante who chose a very interesting topic and bogged it down in such poor writing as to make excruciating.

It rinses clean easily, is simple to use and comes for a great price.My only complaint is that it's a little too bulky for me. I wish they came in slimmer and shorter sizes, as it would be easier to move around my mouth and use a bit less floss. I do have a relatively small mouth though, so this shouldn't be much of a problem for the average user."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Great product, wished I bought the 3 pack instead of the 1 pack but most likely it will still be avail when I need another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Floss and snap","review":"I purchased the Flossaid Dental Floss Holder from teethnthings.com through Amazon.

Easy to install with regular floss, no special floss heads like the other brands. Long handle to reach the back teeth and you can adjust the width of the flossing arms (just tighten the floss).And it is well made and will give many years of service. This is a great device that cost the same as one bag of floss picks!!

I think this is a fine product and will last many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste a lot of floss","review":"These floss devices need to be able to rotate the floss around so you aren't using the same small section of floss for your entire mouth.

Better to use your fingers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved these since I was a kid.","review":"I have been using this style of flosser since I was in elementary school, and Flossaid's is great. Basically, you take a piece of floss, wrap it a couple times around the circular knob, stretch it up and over the forked part, and then bring it back down around the knob a couple more times while pulling it tight.I really don't like flossing the usual way (i.e., by wrapping it around both index fingers) because it cuts off blood circulation in my fingers -- not a very nice sensation. This little contraption maintains the tension of the floss without putting pressure on my fingers, thus allowing me to take more time to floss thoroughly and comfortably. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who finds flossing unpleasant, as well as to those who don't mind flossing. It does take an extra 5-10 seconds, but it makes the flossing process very easy and comfortable. Also, it's really cheap and lasts a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 months old and snapped","review":"After only 4 months my flossaid snapped by the brass rivet , I did write to the manufacturer to complain and I sent them a photo of the broken flossaid but they did not reply.

If it was an issue with the masters, I know for a fact that this series was aired in full as recently as 2004 on Nicktoons Network because I mastered my own DVDs using my home computer, and they look pretty darn good scaled to 1080p on my current monitor (watching one of the missing episodes NOW as I type this)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of?

There are two 30 minute tracks on most of his CDs.It is difficult to know what real effect these recordings have on our brain waves but if nothing else they provide some non-distracting white noise.

But it is better than nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a pleasant experience","review":"I have no doubt that there is something in the tones that affect you. The problem is that, with me, the effects were negative. Maybe it is just a matter of it affecting different people differently, or maybe it's a matter of how fast you fall asleep and if you are in the right state as the CD advances. For whatever reason, the longer the CD went on the worse I felt. It was like a weird sensation building in my head. I tried this several times to rule out a fluke, but each time it was the same. I never got fully asleep with this CD. The most I got was a half awake, half asleep state that I had trouble waking up from. It was a creepy and unpleasant feeling.

This CD is awesome. How Dr. Jeffrey Thompson puts all these sounds together is always very beautiful and harmonious -no jolting sounds, so it's a smooth slide into dreamland. On this CD there is a more celestial vibe to the music, like your floating out of body deep in space, in the universe's womb (silly sounding but that's the image it conjures up for me). I can see how someone having trouble falling asleep would want this CD, something about it just makes it so sleep falls easy over you-one minute your awake and the next your deep asleep. I'd fall asleep with this CD on but I'm a side sleeper and the headphones would end up digging into my ears. If I had detachable headphones though I would listen to this CD every night.

Be warned: The Delta Sleep System is NOT designed for a room-sized music system; in fact it can be downright irritating coming through big speakers. It works best with a headset on personal players like ipods and mp3 players. (Yes, you can fall asleep wearing headphones - if you use the in-the-ear buds instead of the monster head sets.) My biggest gripe is that the recording has an abrupt break in the middle - like the company is still making vinyls with only 30 minutes per side, not cds. Wish they'd made it a single, seamless recording. If I'm not fully in the zone, that break is especially annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sleep Aid","review":"I have found when I have used this CD that I have had a very deep sleep and awake fully rested. Fortunately I'm not a chronic insomniac, but occasionally when I've needed a bit of help to unwind, I've found playing this music to really assist me falling asleep and staying asleep.The music on this CD is electronic sounding, so if that doesn't appeal to you, then it may not be relaxing. However, I've found the music is best played at a fairly low tone (ie. not too loud). Basically you only need to be able to just hear it.

I intended to be able to push (roll) her around until she was able to ride herself. However, the foot pegs would not stay down and kept disappearing underneath, so if you are not watching, your child's feet or foot will get rolled under.(ouch) Since the foot pegs didn't work, my child tried to keep her feet on the peddles which turn as fast as you try to walk (and steer) and she could not keep her feet on the peddles either. Also, if your child is still learning how to steer, it is virtually impossible to push down the street safely. For the extra money, all you are getting is a sound effect gadget that is not very audible outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock, Roll and Ride Delux","review":"We bought the Fisher Price Rock, Roll and Ride Delux for my son shortly after his first birthday. He has only used the toy indoors in the rock mode, being that it was winter when we purchased it. We bought the Delux model because my son loves lights and sounds. Immediately when we bought it we noticed that the lights and sounds options did not function in the rock mode like they were intended to. The lights are supposed to go off when your child rocks it. I even got on it (I weigh 100 lbs) and rocked and couldnt get the lights to come on. There are little buttons in the steering column that seem to control lights and sound function that arent working properly. We are a bit disappointed seeing how we bought the delux version for the lights and sounds which dont function well."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Seat Belt!!","review":"How can you make a trike for an 18 month old with no seat belt, especially if you are going to use the bar and push the child.

He has been climbing on it by himself before he could even walk. This is a great toy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The foot pedals disappear and my sons feet drag and go under if parents don't notice right away which is painful. The handle for parents doesn't stay in place which is a pain. And it is almost impossible for parents to turn when they are dealing with kids who still can't steer or pedal yet. My husband and I took our son outside with it once and never again. It isn't safe since it is such a struggle for parents to turn we have to practically drag it from left to right and since it doesn't have a seat belt my son almost fell off the side. He only uses it to rock on at home and will not be using it outside until he can pedal and steer on his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"I love this album.

A lot of singles came from this robust album... \\"I Love you Like A Ball and Chain,\\" \\"Would I Lie to You?\\", \\"There Must Be An Angel (Playing with my Heart),\\" and others. The icing on the cake is the duet with Aretha Franklin on \\"Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves.\\" Melodic tunes such as \\"Better to Have Lost in Love (Than Never To Have Loved At All)\\" and \\"Adrian\\" really tie this package together.

The author is writing from his own experiences and boy does he have some great experiences to share! I find myself wishing I could be him, on a boat sailing around the Gulf Stream searching for Tuna and Marlin and pulling in hundreds of pounds of fish a day. I only wish the book would have been longer and gone into more depth. Either way it's a great book you won't regret buying and you won't soon forget.

This album makes you wonder if the great tunes Pye Hastings wrote before this aberation (\\"Memory Lain, Hugh,\\" \\"Love To Love You,\\" \\"The Dog, The Dog...\\") was just a fluke. Trust me, after you play this one, you'll be running back as fast as possible to your IN THE LAND OF GREY AND PINK album and wonder how the group that recorded BETTER BY FAR can actually call themselves \\"Caravan.\\" Raised a star because I have a soft spot for this band and can't convince myself they can actually record anything worthy of just one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful, intimate, fun and heartwarming","review":"I could not waite to call my own mom and my nana of 93, hold my children and tell all my friends about this sentimental, informative, intimate look at what we all desire to work and hope for in our most precious of relationships, nana, mom and mother hood,,, thank you Ms. Garner you touched it all from first to future...

The programming language is only useful for algorithms these days, as most professionals havent got the time to be debugging code all day.

It seems though to be useful to have on the shelf since I am pretty new to SAS programming and don't like most of the resources available.

Notes: (a) The book does not cover every option available with the SAS procedures - this is actually good in an introductory book because it keeps the reader from getting confused.

However, at the end of the chapter where there is a list of supplements to take, most of the time she doesn't include the ones that she wrote about -- leaving one to wonder about the dosage.

It has great insight into all foreseeable problems of someone with MS. Although it takes care to explain mainstream medicine, it doesn't reject a person's right to try alternative medicine. Some of this stuff in this book is available elsewhere, but it is great to have reminders under one cover.I don't know the authors, but they did a great job.

This booklet contains a full page calendar for 2002, 2003 and 2004 and, of course, each page thereafter is each week of 2003 from Monday to Sunday (Dec. 30, 2002-Jan. 4, 2004). There is plenty of space to write birthdays, anniversaries and your own personal notes. Included are the holidays, International and Jewish holidays, moon phases and time change for April and October.

It is reviewing a different clock! It states that the hours and minutes can be set with buttons that move the time up and down. Instead, this clock requires you to go through 23 hours if you accidentally overshoot by one. Worse, if you overshoot the year by one, you have to go through 99 years to get to the correct one.The clock is also essentially unusable by anyone over 40. Reading glasses will allow you to read the alarm-time digits, but you will not be able to see the alarm-time PM indicator.Timex, a few years ago, did sell a clock that had the interface described in the top-rated review, with up and down keys and 15-minute fast advance.

Don't be discouraged by the three-star average rating, which is simply the result of fans' resentment at a critical examination of their hero.This book view of Lou Reed is not pretty, but is unsurprising to anyone familiar with his history and his own account of himself in interviews, where he regularly appeared as self-aggrandising and insecure (although without seeming to realise it ...)Anyway, his character deficiencies needn't undermine your appreciation of his music.The book has some marvellous anecdotes and insights, for example, relating to the woman who inspired several classic VU songs and an amusing attempted interview by Lou Reed of Vaclav Havel.

Havel terminated the interview as Lou was clearly too incompetent to perform it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"great inside in who is lou reed, the hard copy is a great product and not very expensive, is a really joy to read the book , it starts from lou child hood to almos 2005 i think"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Bockris hates Lou?","review":"When I finished \\"Transformer\\", it leaves me a bad taste that Bockris was kinda foe of Reed, that he really hates him. The book tries to glance Reed from the outside, not getting very involved in nothing, but describing coldly all the bad things that Reed has done. If you dont know anything about Reed music, this book is very boring. If you have enjoyed his work, this books dissapoint you, gives you the impression that Lou is just an asshole with nothing to do but drink or snort drugs. Bockris avoid every sensibility that Lou may put in every one of his albums, just making poor critics of the technical aspects or what the press said.

Yes, there are some good points on the album, but in my opinion there are no stand out tracks, none of the songs do the band justice.

When my anger subsided,I headed to the Record Shop and bought \\"Your Majesty\\". I am an impatient person and usually listen to the first 30 seconds or so to get the vibe of a song then skip ahead to the next track. But I ended up listening to it from start to finish. The album moves from gloomy to bright and anthemic without feeling stilted. I knew from the start that \\"Sweet Marie\\" was a rockin song. I was impressed that they kept up with the pace of that song for the rest of the album.

One of the biggest was Charlie Chaplin as autographseeker and director King Vidor at the end of the movie as himself directing a movie with Billy and Peggy (Marion Davis).Other cameos have: Douglas Fairbanks, John Gilbert, Eleanor Bordman and many more.Nice Joke: Peggy Pepper is in the studio lot and is seeing famous actress Marion Davis!!!DVD: this is a silent movie which contains sound effects.The Picture quality is more than ok.

If I needed a refresher on the \`ls\` command, I don't need to pay (money) when I can use \`man\` for that.If you are like me, a senior-ish SA who doesn't get that much exposure to the Sun Apps and OS based security tools, then this book will be a waste of your money.

Despite the dates that Amazon puts up, it's actually Grimm's third CD and the two before it build up to it.

This CD is put out by a company who also makes Karaoke CD's, so there's a clue right there. Granted, it might be the original artists, but i doubt it, unless when they all showed up to sing and they all had colds. Just my opionion, but hey, if you want to blow money on it, well...The song by Garth Brooks \\"When you come back to me again\\" really sounds like Garth Brooks, and Toby Keith sounds like Toby Keith, but that's about it. To sum it up in a few words, very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly","review":"This is a very helpful book and I will be a better coach for reading it. The most valuable points concern the limited time for practice and what to focus on. There are many interesting concepts in the book that are full explained.However, the book was tarnished on several accounts. It was filled with details of Mr Reed's dubious adult baseball career that I really didn't need. His constant negativity and bitterness towards the players, fellow coaches, league administration, volunteer umpires,etc.... got to be too much by the end. All of this complaining done while reminding the reader it is for the kids. I ended up questioning why Mr. Reed spent so much of his time doing something that caused him so much unhappiness.Read this book it is worth it. But, be very careful of adopting the attitudes and feelings conveyed in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is better material out there","review":"I just wanted to let readers know that there are several other books and resources out there with much better content and organization for less moneyHaving been involved with my own kids in different facets of kids baseball I am always on the lookout for new or original material.

Although he is not the only explorer to go through tribal initiation rituals, the ritual of scarfication he submitted to seems quite extreme for even the best of them! Returning to England with a raised pattern on his skin resembling that of a crocodile must have shocked more than a few people!Having read several of his books, I admire his approach to adventure, relying on his ability to enlist the aid of people he meets along the way. His comfort zone is very large, and his openness no doubt appeals to the indigenous populations. He does not present himself as a larger-than-life character, nor does he adopt a macho facade. He is a human among other humans, which is precisely why I enjoy traveling with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"US G&S","review":"I thought that an American version of G&S favorites, especially under the direction of Mark Elder, would be an unusual delight.

Some of the clues are hard, but there's stuff in there for all generations. We bought this after hearing it being played on a local radio station. Great party or family game (probably teenage and up)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game! The Timer is what gets you!","review":"I won't repeat what others have said, but what I will say is two things:1. Use an electronic kitchen timer. This will save squabbling and gives the cluegiver a better judge on time2. This game would be easy without a time limit. It's the 45-second limit which makes this game so hard. Having to decide when to give up the ghost on a clue and go on to the next is part of the fun. I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Expecting","review":"I thought some of the words that were selected were kind of silly and most people in our group could not answer the buzzword without including it in a phrase.

Some of the cards were pretty easy. It's one of those things where you've either heard of the phrase or you haven't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to Catchphrase after this","review":"The cards limited our enjoyment of this game. You are restricted to only reading the clues on the card. The fun of games like Taboo and Catchphrase are that you can make up the clues yourself, and if someone is having trouble guessing you can taylor your clues to their personal knowlege/experience. Here, you are stuck simply reading what is on the card, and if they have no idea they are totally out of luck. This especially limited the enjoyment of the older grandparents, younger cousins, and friends for whom English is a second language, because their knowledge base was more limited/specific than what was generally provided on the cards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game","review":"This game sounded fun. We played it on Christmas evening. It was a fun, fast-paced game. We were playing with family aged from 17-82. There was a little bit of \\"trivia\\" from all age groups.

Smooth, rolling renditions of some of the classics. I love them all, and the production/recording quality has become part of the sound for me--no bother at all. The bar sounds and buildup intro to \\"Fat Lady of Limbourg\\" is fabulous.In short, if you love Eno's big four (Before and After Science, Here Come the Warm Jets, Another Green World, and Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy), and especially if you are a fan of the renowned \\"801 Live\\", (these tracks have a very similar feel to that concert), you owe it to yourself to get a listen to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced bootleg","review":"This can be found for under 10 bucks at the larger music shows.

Very shallow - I expected to find more information in HBR.2. Example of balance sheet does not correspond to example of PnL (in real life and in most of the books they correspond each other)3.

As has been noted here previously, nothing Niles has put together here contributes anything whatever to the ripe field of artificial resurrection, and the ending has all the feeling of an uninspired, lazy tack-on.

This is simply an excellent rendition of Beethoven's immortal symphonies.Technical note: Even though this is not an SACD, I would recommend listening to the CD using a DVD player with HDMI cable connection to a receiver and with headphones! You will hear nuances you missed before with analog cables and speakers. In fact, I am rediscovering my entire CD collection in this way.

He and the heroine made a great couple, even if he thought he hated her for most of the novel. Even if their first love scene was a bit... rough. Also, though the amnesia plot has been done before, this book made it fresh and interesting.But as I read on, I kept shaking my head at plot holes, subplots that went nowhere, and secondary characters that were wasted. (Sometimes literally!)On top of all that, the Big Surprise is too incredible to believe. It hinged on too many HUGE coincidences."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Nude is old school rap and it is outdated","review":"Luke really messes up with in the nude because the music is from 1993. 7 year old rap is very exstinct and it shows. The album cover is very explicit judging by it's title. The music is slow paced and there's no real music to be found. Luke wastes his talent by rapping not very rapidly, very slow paced. The whole album is taken in slow amounts. It is not a classic I suggest you buy the The Wu-Tang collection instead a much better rap group then Luke"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking good","review":"My husband is a Master Automotive Technician and he wanted something that would with stand the damage of his profession and this titanium ring does just that. After a while is does lose it's shine, but with a polishing rag the shine comes back. This ring is light weight, beautiful and you don't even know you have it on. Everyone that sees our rings are amazed at how pretty this ring is and wants to know where I got it at and I let them know where I got it at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great words from the Great Communicator","review":"This book is one of those I refer to as a bathroom book. It is 175 pages of short stories, quotes, quips and speeches of and by the Great Communicator, which makes for perfect reading when you are ,&#65533; well, you get the idea.A beautiful and loving introduction by one of America&#65533;s finest First Ladies, Nancy Reagan, sets the tone for this insight to the former first family, whose love for country was only eclipsed for their love for one another. The book concludes with a devoted after word by Peggy Noonan. Everything in between is pure Ronnie.If you admire Ronald Reagan, and since you are visiting the Junto, chances are, you do, you&#65533;ll want to add this book to your collection. Get to know the personal side of this great man."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grand Illusionist","review":"Nice pictures. Amusing anecdotes. Stories that tug your mouth upwards.

I used to use it all the time and it is the best for restoring hair to good health. Then I could not find it in the stores or online. So pleased to be able to purchase it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap!","review":"This toy is great if you only want your child to learn 10 letters! Because the other 16 don't seem to matter. It either got the letters wrong or just didn't even try and made some musical dismissal of them.I bought this to help my 4 yr old, who has told me she wants to learn to read, learn her letter sounds. This was her Valentine's gift and now we had to package it back up and it's going back to Target.I looked at the Word Whammer too, but no way, not after this fiasco. And whoever said it comes with the numbers was wrong, we got the newest model and there were no numbers for it to fail to recognize.I'll just get her something for her LeapPad or her V-Smile. I just feel bad that she knows her Valentine's gift has to go back. Very disappointing. LeapFrog is usually much better than this. We have Baby Tad and we have the My First Leappad and the regular Leappad and the talking Globe. This is our first disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"We love leapfrog in general and this toy was a great addition to my 2year old daughters collection. She got the farm animal one last year for Christmas and has played with it for hours. Now we'd like to improve her alphabet knowledge and this set is great. We did have one small issue when first purchased. Some of the little prong things in the main unit were stuck down. I just used my finger so they all popped up and haven't had a problem since. They all work perfectly. We'll definitely be moving up to the Word Wammer once she's got the letters down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Educational Toy","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said 500 times before? My son (now 3 1/2) got this toy at age 2. He been watching the Leapfrog videos with his older brother since he was a baby. He adored this toy when he got it, and he still plays with it today. The letters have put up with being dropped, thrown, washed (I even submerged them, though I would not recommend that), lost under the fridge and recovered, and one even got dropped into the crab's tank. Anyway, I'm a faithful Leapfrog customer now (especially since my 3 1/2 year old is reading at kindergarten level)."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 out of 4 of my kids love this toy!","review":"My household recieved this product as a gift when my 2nd child was about 13 months old. As I was teaching the oldest how to sound out words, the youngest would say \\"Wait! I know!\\" then if he could not rememeber the sound, or if his sister didn't get it right, he would bring us the toy and place the appropriate letter in the magnet frame and play the song. We have had this toy for 6 years and still I love it. My children learned alot at young ages from this toy and they have never had any trouble with pronunciation. It has never varied in performance unless batteries needed replaced. My children all love Leap Frog products and I have also found their customer service department to be well staffed and ready to help."},{"rating":"2","title":"LeapFrog Magnetic Letter Set","review":"This is a perfect way for toddlers to learn the alphabet letters. The voice and music are very clear and catchy. He's singing the letters when he's not even playing with them because of the tune. Gav recognizes many of them even tho we have not taught them to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"I bought this for my two year old niece and she loves the whole concept of refrigerator magnest so this is not only fun as she can play with the magnets all days but she now also knows the alphabet, I would recommend this to anyone who knows a child eager to learn and play."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Grandson loves the ABC song","review":"This is a very convienent toy. It is up on the frig, and my grandson loves the ABC song, and will put the different letters into the spot and he will push for the song. He is 16 months old. If I can say anything negative, it would be that each letter has the same phase after the initial sound for the letter. Overall it is worth the purchase. The letters alone open up an opportunity for learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Education Can Be Fun!!!!","review":"I bought this for my little 24 month old niece for Christmas. She can already sing the ABC song, but didn't know her letters on sight. By the end of the day, she could already point out some of the letters and memorized them. I can't say it was her favorite present, but she really enjoyed it and watching her learn in front of our eyes made it an extra special day. The quality is great, but it is a Leapfrog product, so I knew it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all ages!!!","review":"I recently bought this for my 18 month old daughter to teach her the letters. Within the first 20minutes after opening the box she was already singing part of the ABC's. Also, my son who is in kindergarten has really been struggeling with letter recognition loves it and it has really been helping him also."},{"rating":"1","title":"it only sings for 2 letters!","review":"We bought this for our kids at Christmas, thinking it would be a fun, educational toy. They needed something to occupy them in the kitchen while I am cooking. They loved the letter E song while the toy was still in its box, but that's when the fun was over. When we opened it up, we realized that any other letter that was put into the toy, would simply play a musical tone (which must mean that it can't read the letter), or the F, L, or E song, regardless of which letter was actually inserted. Imagine the confusion of my older kids who put in the letter B just to hear the letter L song! I am very disappointed with this toy, and will be returning it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth every penny, great learning tool","review":"I bought this for my daughter 2 months ago, when she was 20 months old. It was love at first sight. At first, she just enjoyed putting the letters in and taking the letters out. Then she became interested in pushing the letters to see what sounds they made. A month ago (one month after receiving this), she started pointing out letters on signs and in books and telling me what they were!! She continues to play with this every single day, and she is now trying to sound out letters wherever she sees them. This is, by far, the best \\"toy\\" we have ever given her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"We purchased a Leap Frog Fridge Phonics Alphabet and Numbers took it home and found it to be defective. 26 of the 36 characters told you the wrong information. We placed the \\"T\\" on the toy and it told us it was the number 7. We placed the number 8 on the toy and it told us it was the number 10. We returned this product and purchased another, same kind of defect, but it was telling us different letters and number than the first. I contacted Leap Frog about their defective product and have received no response. I think this is a wonderful product if it worked. I do not want my child to learn incorrect information!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a cool toy","review":"That is what my 2 1/2 year old said when we opened up the new fridge phonics. I have told all my friends about it and they cant wait until it comes off of backorder. It is very durable, she has thrown it a few times, and it has a strong magnet. I had three kids under five yesterday fighting over it. Several times one of them would run by the fridge and brush up against it, but it never came loose. I love the fact that it is in the kitchen. She can play and I can cook and clean and know where she is and what she is doing. Great Job Leap Frog!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was 10 months. She loved it. She played with it everyday. She knew her ABCs and phonics when she was 18 months, about the same time she started talking."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great!","review":"My 3 year old daughter got this at Christmas and she uses it all the time. I've never had any trouble with any of the letters making the wrong sound or any problems at all with it. My daughter will come out in the kitchen with me while I'm cooking or doing dishes and she'll put a letter in and we'll start singing the song and dancing all around.It's a great teaching tool and lots of fun. I highly recommened it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best toy I have purchased","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was 15 months old after seeing it at a friend's house. She absolutely loves it. Every morning the first thing she does is go to the refridgerator and plays with it, and she goes back to it often throughout the day. It's a great thing to keep her occupied as I prepare her meals. Within a couple of weeks, she could already identify 3 letters when we ask her to pick them out. Really, a fantastic toy and learning tool. I will be buying this as a birthday gift for many of my friends' children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable results and fun!","review":"My son received the the Fridge Phonic Magnetic Letter set 3 weeks ago for his 2 year birthday. Before he had this he knew about half of the letters of the alphabet. He now knows them all and the sounds they make! I never expected him to catch on so quickly! Now when he is in the car he says the letters he sees on signs and makes the sound that they make. I only wish they made letters in lower case to go with it. He is ready to learn more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn phonics without even trying!","review":"I just bought this item for my 3 and 1/2 year old son, and he loves it. Instead of just singing his alphabet, he's also singing \\"'K' sounds like 'kuh'.\\" I'm loving it! He's learning phonics a lot quicker than with his flash card set.Because the letters come in four primary colors, the toy also gives children a chance to sort by colors, which he also does. He's also sorted out the letters that have two sounds versus the ones that have one.It's a great way to repurpose the traditional letter magnets. It also keeps him from peering into the fridge every five minutes to see what snack he wants."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Will Play With This Toy, Too!","review":"This is my daughter's tenth electronic, (the fifth LeapFrog), ABC toy and this is by far the best! Though it stays on our fridge, this toy travels with my daughter on all of our road trips. I love the volume control, the clear enunciation of the letter's sound, and its catchy tunes, (I even press the ABC button when I pass it by, even though my 2 yr. old daughter is not around!) She plays with this toy with no encouragement from me, and it is so cool that it draws everyone near to sound out the letter or sing the ABC. An exceptionally FUN learning toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"makes learning fun!!","review":"We just got this toy and my 2 year old loves it! He likes being able to change the letters himself, and he likes the repetitive nature and rythmn. I feel confident the use of this toy will engrain familiarity with the alphabet. Just seeing how he likes it and knowing the its content is so useful is very exciting! For [the price] I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a GREAT way to learn your ABC's","review":"My twin girls got this as a gift for their 2nd B-day. With in a month my girls not only know most of the letters, but the sound the letter makes as well.

This is a toy they play with pretty much every day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have.","review":"I bought this for my 20 mounth old son and it is the best educational to I have purchased. He will run into the kitchen and put a letter in and push it and run back to the living room to do the sounds that the letter makes. I do have to admit that he has started to just use the letters that is can identify so I have taken most of those off the fridiged so he will learn the rest of the letters also."},{"rating":"2","title":"I CAN COOK","review":"I bought this product for my 2 year old daughter for CHRISTmas 2009, she will be 3 in April. My son who is 7 loves to read, so i figured let me jump start HER now! She loves to put the letters in the the sun and press them to hear the song, or the letter sound etc.If you don't mind hearing the alphabet song, the whole time your little one is using the toy....then you as a parent will make out FINE!I have mine on the fridge and YES I CAN COOK!!!! without worrying where she is."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great","review":"i love this thing so much!!! My lil sis got it and she loved it. Infact she's playing with it right now. we got it when she was 2 years old and now that she just turned three, she uses it. She learned every letter from it and now knows how to write her name \\"lili\\" and she is turning 3 at the end of january. She can write her name and she imitates how it is written on this product.These are the kind of toys you would want to buy for ur children"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and educational","review":"My 2-year old loves this thing, and it's really helping him learn his letters AND sounds.

It has definitely helped with her ABC's ... especially since she loves to sing out loud! In the last year, we've only had to replace the batteries once. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift!","review":"My daughter actaully got this as a gift for her 1st Birthday. I liked it so much that I bought it as a gift for someone else. She plays with it a lot. We actually have it hanging on our dish washer and not our fridge, but it works great there too. Keeps my daughter busy while I'm working in the kitchen. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, still in use after a year","review":"This toy was purchased almost a year ago and my daughter (now 2) still plays with it. The letters are great and have helped tremendously in her being able to identify each one. She still sings along with the song and has started to pick up a letter and make its \\"sound\\". This has been, without a doubt, one of the most useful learning toys that she has.It has also survived being dropped, being walked upon (not just by my daughter...), and the general mayhem that a toddler brings to most toys. I've been very pleasantly surprised by how well it's endured all the playtime over the past year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with their new DVD!!!","review":"I've had this for a while and my 2 year old has always loved it. It single handedly got her singing her A,B,C's in a recognizable manner. Then, we bought the Leap Frog Letter Factory DVD and the results were amazing! She recognizes letters and knows their sound. It's so fun to see her have fun and truly be learning some thing she needs! I just want all the parents out there to know and be able to share the knowledge with their little ones, when all they're doing is loving another DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy","review":"My child loves to play with this toy. She is not even 2 yet and dances and sings the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Toys","review":"We got two of these for our twins just before they turned 2. It is a great tool that helped them with practicing their letters. By the time they were 2 they recognized all the letters and their sounds thanks to this toy and the Leap Frog Letter Factory Video. I love the Leap Frog prducts and they have helped our boys so much. Great for when they are not wanting to pay attention to mommy treaching them and I comfortable with it because I know they are playing with something that is going to teach them without it being a chore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phun Phun Phun!","review":"Fridge Phonics is PHUN!!! My son (now 15 months old) is thoroughly entertained by the magnetic set of letters and musical magnetic device. Not only does he enjoy the sounds and learn the letters of the alphabet, but he improves his fine motor skills as well by adding and removing the letters from the music base. This has everything - educational, musical and entertainment appeal. Quite possibly the perfect toy for little ones...not to mention the dogs who get a kick out of it as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 year old knows all her letters","review":"I love this game, not only does my 2 year old now know all her letters but she knows the sounds the make as well. This is a great investment, if you have more than one child also. I bought this for my 4 year old when he was having issues with the letter sounds and my 2 year old ended up learning from it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun learning toy!","review":"Fun for my 3 year old! Fun for his younger sisters. We like the big letters that decrease the likelyhood of choking. Like all Leapfrog products, it makes learning fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fridge Phonics","review":"My son is 2 1/2 and he plays with this all the time. Repitition is a great way to learn. He is now making sounds like the letters should sound. It is great to see him learn something so fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"My son really likes this toy. He dances to the music, so cute. I didn't know it until it arrived but it was a year older for his age range, suprisingly he eventually figured out how to use it. I like it because it does sound out the letters, and I think that is important to learn early. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"now we're talkin'!","review":"My two year old really loves imitating his 4 year old brother, who speaks pretty well. This toy actually encourages him to speak on his own, rather than only imitating him. At 2, he's able to identify specific letters *and* their sounds. My four year old is less impressed with the toy, but has begun using the letters to put words together visually, with hints from the phonics part. The best part? The volume control - two settings for loud and quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work!","review":"Fresh out of the box this toy wouldn't recognize most of the letters. Poor quality. I'm sure it's educational if it WORKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading teacher/grandma loves this one!","review":"My two year old granddaughter received this set for her birthday. She loved handling the letters and the console, which were all just her size. I am a reading teacher, and I wish all of my students had been able to use this set when they were toddlers. It repeats the ABC song, so alphabetizing and looking for research information in alphabetical order becomes easier as the song is learned. (You can't imagine how many kids don't know this song!!) Each letter tells the sound it makes when the letter is pressed. Both long and short vowel sounds are given. What a simple, excellent learning tool for toddlers and preschoolers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS EDUCATIONAL DEVICE!!!!!!","review":"I really enjoy this educational device for my daughter. It helps her with the alphabet as well as pronounciation and learning what letters make what sounds. She can use it at anytime, it's on the lower part of the refrigerator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I know my ABC's","review":"My 2 year old daughter loves this toy. It keeps her busy when I am in the kitchen cooking and it has taught her the sounds of letters as well as the proper way of singing the alphabet song."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was skeptical, but my son LOVES it!","review":"I thought this toy was a gimmic to spend more on an expensive version of the old-fashioned magnetic letters. He received it as a Christmas gift and loves. He is just over two and played with it for at least an hour when it was first opened. And after playing with it that hour, he could sing the entire ABC song, and he couldn't before that.Each letter, when put on the machine, sings a song about its sound. Eventually, I'm sure it will help him phonetically, but for now, he likes to sing along with the song. He sings \\"T says ta, T says ta, every letter makes...\\" and doesn't even realize that he's learning the sounds of the letters.My only complaint is that when you push the letter on the player machine, if the child hits it more than once, it starts the song and then immediately restarts it again. Perhaps this is the only way they could design it, but it frustrates my son because he starts to sing and it will start again."},{"rating":"2","title":"good one............:)","review":"Good to initiate the learning process..my kid loves it..But letters are smaller than what we expected...bit disappointed.

She loves to dance to the music and is learning the letters and their sounds. Great buy to help teach your child their ABCs."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Toddler likes it!","review":"Bought it for my 20 months old daughter. She loves to spend time in the kitchen when I am cooking, so I wanted a toy which would keep her occupied in kitchen. I have placed it on our fridge and our kiddo is loving it so far. Worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Letters? What are they?","review":"We purchased this product for christmas for my son. Well, It only recognized half the letters and when I contacted the company they wanted me to send it back. Fine but they wouldn't pay for shipping etc. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. It's more trouble than it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Letter Sounds","review":"I purchased this toy for my daughter for Christmas thinking it would be great for her to learn her letters while I was trying to get things done in the kitchen. She loves the size of the letters because they are easy to take them off of the fridge. The only problem with it is that the letters do not give the correct sounds. When we placed the O in the reader it thought it was a Q. Very dissapointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Letters were misread! Very disappointed!","review":"I purchased this toy for my two-year-old son for Christmas, knowing that he would absolutely love it. But when we opened it Christmas morning, my husband and I were so disappointed. It misread some of the letters. For example, \\"A\\" was read as \\"K\\" or \\"D\\" as \\"G\\". I'm not sure if this is just this one particular box, but I just read a review of this toy at Target, and it seems other parents complained of the same thing, though those who purchased it before this year, seemed to be satisfied and very happy. If you plan on buying this toy, however, I would advise you save your receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the letters are wrong","review":"I bought this for my daughters third birthday.

However, I have to strongly disagree with the phonics of this toy. I only tested 2 letters, \\"A\\" and \\"W.\\" After I heard the them both, I decided not to test the rest and package everything up for a return to amazon. They do not sound adequate for teaching purposes. I really don't understand how this item gets a 4.5 star rating. You guys have to be kidding me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, bad product","review":"This concept is a good one, but the item does not recognize all the letters properly. I dont think a product should be teaching the Letter R is a U!!!!!!!!! Too bad, I had hoped for better. Aprox 50% of the letters were wrong, or unrecognized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality doesn't hold up","review":"I bought this toy for my 3 year old son for Christmas. As of last night (one week later), the toy no longer works. The main box will not stick properly to the refridgerator, it slides down to the floor and only half of the letters give the correct answer. The letter recognition is a tab system that I have seen on other toys and have never had a problem before. It has brand new batteries so I don't see why that could be an issue and I have checked to make sure that there was no debris or crumbs or any juice that may have made the buttons sticky and not recognize the letters and I have NOTHING. The toy should be 100% operational. Hopefully I received a faulty unit and my experience does not reflect a normal quality level for this toy. I will be contacting Leap Frog and Amazon for a replacement unit. Fingers crossed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just my daughter","review":"This toy got great reviews and I had thought it would be great as well. Unfortunately, my daughter just uses it to press the ABC song button over and over...without actually listening to the ABC song. She has no interest in putting the letters into the toy...maybe this toy just isn't for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"price disparity","review":"I like this product. However the same product can be purchased at a national retailer for $19.95. I cannot believe their is such a disparity in the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Educational.... and Annoying","review":"My son received this as a gift when he was 2 years old. I really do think it is helping him associate sounds with letters. It's been over a year since he's been playing with it. We've never had to change the batteries and it looks brand new (and he is hard on his toys).I just wish it was a little less annoying. The tune gets stuck in your head... and it's really hard to get rid of.That being said, I would buy this again, and have given it to several people recently."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware!","review":"I ordered this for my 6 year old niece who is having a hard time learning her letters and sounds. It sounded like a perfect learning tool. As soon as it came, we started playing it, and the machine would say the wrong letters and sounds! I cleaned the batteries like it said too, still nothing. I returned it, rcvd a new one, (at least that was easy enough, thank you amazon), then the second one did the same thing. I sent it back again and got a refund. I was extremely disappointed and if any has this, please check it constantly before your little one gets screwed up and never learns the alphabet. A great idea if it had worked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor manufacturing","review":"I was excited about this product and so was my 20 m/o. Until we opened the box and found 14 out of the 26 letters gave improper responses or no response at all. I checked online to see if others had similar problems and there was quite a lot of people that had the same problem. When I returned it I asked if there was similar problems and was told that most people were returning this and that replacing would probably end in another faulty product. It would've been a great product if it had worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!!!","review":"We bought this 1 1/2 years ago for our daughter who is now 3. I know other parents who have bought this item and have heard nothing but positive comments. 'Little Leap' played a big role in my daughter learning her alphabet. I like almost all of Leap Pad's products, but this is by far my favorite. My daughter really enjoys it and plays with it for at least a little while almost every single day. My 6-year old has also been caught playing with it, quizzing himself as he learned his sounds, and now as he learns to read. I recommend this to anyone with a small child."},{"rating":"1","title":"says wrong letters","review":"My daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday, and she immediately loved it. It worked well for a little while, but for some reason started telling her the wrong letters. For example, she would put in the letter \\"B\\" and it would sing the \\"X\\" song. I tried cleaning it and changing the batteries, but was unable to get it to sing the right letters. I didn't want it confusing her so I eventually threw it in the trash.

The alphabet button works fine (so at least my child can learn the alphabet) but none of the letters work - a litle musical tone is all that plays, and that's hardly educational. I cleaned the battery contacts and replaced the batteries as directed in the users' guide to no avail. Unfortunately it stopped working at 5 months after light use (and warranty ends at 3 months) so there's nothing I can do since Leapfrog doesn't even offer any sort of repair service. It was a good toy before it mysteriously stopped working."},{"rating":"2","title":"best toy i ever bought!","review":"christmas shopping for my two year old daughter, I ran across this and on a spur of the moment decision, bought it. My daug8hter LOVES this toy, and so do I. Sha had already been introduced to the alphabet, but this is the most interested I had ever seen her in it. That same day ahe was doing what I had been trying to get her to do for a while. She was walking all over the house saying all her letters, and showing me the \\"O\\" for her name, Olivia.

I got it for both my 2 year old daughter and nephew, and they both love it. I like the size of the magnets, great for little hands and they don't dissapear under the fridge. We haven't lost a letter yet. I am definately getting the next toy, the one that makes 3 letter words. (I can't remember the name of it) One suggestion for Leap Frog: I would love to have a large cling mat with all of the letters so my daughter could do matching as well. It would be an inexpensive accessory that I think many parents would love to have, and if it is that clinging vinal material that wont harm the fridge that would be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"My 2 year-old likes this toy.

It didn't recognize some letters at all and others it mistook for different letters.

It is such a great learning tool. One problem some of the letters don't work. They say o for a. there are about 10 letters like this.

My granddaughter really likes to play with this she repeats all the sounds of the right letters and she knows which ones are wrong. Thank you J.Newman"},{"rating":"2","title":"A+","review":"My 3 year old son loves these magnets. He can easily turn it off and on. I like that there is two settings for the volume. He pushes the letters to hear the sounds of the letters or he can sing the alphabet song. The letters are a big hard plastic, not the cheap ones you find in the store. If one gets knocked off the fridge it will not dissapear under the fridge because it is too large for it to get under there. What a great learning toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mommies helper in the kitchen","review":"My son got this gift for his first birthday. He loves it. He doesnt really know how to put the letters in correctly he does try tho. He does press the letter and hold down making the letter repeat but thats ok he is learning. He dances to the song that plays with the letter or if you press the music note. I can get thru preparing a meal with him in the kitchen playing with this toy.

My 18 month old repeats the sounds!","review":"I received this as a gift for my son when he was only 14 months. At first I had it on the fridge and it held his attention for a while, but then the letters made a mess on the kitchen floor. Later, I put all the letters in a bucket along with the base unit and he plays with it anywhere! He also recently started repeating the sounds that the letters make.. I think this is a GREAT learning tool! Also, it plays a little jingle for every letter which we DIDN'T seem to find annoying which is nice.. It also has a volume control. The item is small to fit in a diaper bag...

I totally believe it had something to do w/shipping it in the winter. After I sent these 2 back to you I went to Walmart to get one and had it in the trunk for a while (when it was very cold) and it didn't work right either when I got it home. I actually took it back and got another one (vowed that was the last time and it was) and put it inside the car in the warm and went straight home and it works great! I just think the cold did something to it cause it would give you the wrong letters for what you put in or nothing at all for a couple of them.

K: \\"M says mmmmmm\\". Y: \\"Three says three. one, two three!\\" \\"E\\", the letter used as the display letter you push at the store was one of the 3 letters that worked. Coincedence?

However, when it arrived, it only came with uppercase. This was very disappointing. Then I found out that you have to purchase the lower case letters but I cannot find them in stock anywhere. I still have not opened the package because I wanted to exchange it for a lowercase version, but it is not available. Why is it being decided for us that children should learn uppercase letters before lowercase letters...when they learn to write and read they need to be familiar with lowercase letter forms.

I would say 20 out of the 26 letters said the wrong letter name and some didn't say a letter name at all (they just beeped). Thinking I just got a bad toy, I exchanged it for another. I tried it as soon as I got back in my car (I couldn't bare to see a disappointed look on my daughter's face again). Again the toy did the same thing.

Thinking that the demo batteries were the problem, I changed them. Still would not work properly. Took it back to the store to get a new one and still does not work properly. As someone else posted--SAVE THE RECEIPT AND BOX. I am going to make my third trip back to the store to purchase something else.

Our son gravitates towards it because of the music and easy manipulation/grasp of the letters. I like it because of the: 1:1 visual and auditory letter name and sound correspondence, raised letters for tracing and easy grip, and repetition for learning. My only concern with it is that the letters are in uppercase instead of lowercase. Ask any educator versed in early literacy, and they will tell you that knowing lowercase letters will get you a lot farther in reading than knowing uppercase letters. Fortunately, there is an expansion kit for this play set.Fridge Phonics Lowercase Letters Expansion PackI just purchased it on-line and I will be exchanging the letters when it arrives.

I'm not big on electronic teaching toys for kids, but this one is great. Both my boys learned their letters and letter-sounds this way.

But the knowledge sticks with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"kids LOVE this and it helps learn","review":"This is a great product for learning the alphabet. My 22 month old loved it from the moment we pulled it out of the box and plays with it daily. She has genuinely learned so many letters and sounds. It isn't just rope memorization like some of those toys do, they can put any letter in, so they learn them separately and can identify them out of order. My daughter can point to tons of letters now in any context-public, books, keyboard and say the name and sound. Other kids love it too and is a big hit all around. I don't find it annoying, she could be playing with worse things.

You would put a \\"G\\" in and hear \\"J\\" for that letter verbally. This was the case with more than half the alphabet. I called the company who had me on old 45 minutes because the Fly Pen was eating up their phone time with other problems. They told me to take a Qtip with alcohol on it and clean the prongs in the window where the letter goes, then use a tweezer to pull out the prongs that were too far in (brand new prongs out of the box mind you). This was only ruining the plastic prongs and not working on loosening them up for the tweezer to pull out. Returned for refund to the store and explained it to them.

However, all of the one-star reviews were posted within the last year, which leads me to believe that Leap Frog changed this toy's design or maybe the toys just sat in a warehouse for too long and the chips/magnets were damaged.We also received the Learning Friends Phonics Bus.

Or she can push the other button to hear the jazzy ABC song. She does like to sing along.But I concur with the earlier review about the \\"learning songs\\" teaching only so much.

I didn't want my daughter to be confused, so I called LeapFrog and told them about the problem. They told me to clean the tabs with alcohol and then pry any loose tabs up with a some tweezers. I did this and then all the good letters became bad and the bad letters worked. I eventually sent the unit back to the factory and they sent me a brand new one. I opened up this unit and it had the exact same problem. I opened up the entire unit, unscrewed some of the electronics and then approached the tabs from the inside - this seemed to fix it.

Just this morning she exlaimed \\"Emmmmmmmmm!\\" and pointed to the M on the fridge.The only thing they need to do better is the clarity of the recordings. \\"D says Duh\\" sounds kind of like \\"D says Buh\\". And when the kid says \\"A\\" it sounds like \\"Eh.\\" But I'm not going to quibble too much... it's not like it's the fridge set is the ONLY way they're going to learn letters and sounds. And most letters sound as they should. It's a neato toy--and durable too. Our daughter is slamming it around and, so far, it's taking a licking and keepin' on ticking. I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy! The kids love it!","review":"We bought this toy for our son's second birthday. He loves it and plays with it daily. Our four-year-old loves to play with it as well.Several reviewers have complained about it saying the wrong letters. We had this problem too. I called customer service for help and they told me about the prongs. Our prongs popped up without a problem and it has worked perfectly ever since."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],x={key:0},H={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-07dc3c67"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/54.md","filePath":"glossary/54.md"}'),R={name:"glossary/54.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
