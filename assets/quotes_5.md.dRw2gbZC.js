We first picked up this book last summer. It regained popularity when the animated features on Playhouse Disney began rolling this June. Both the book and TV versions show Shanna, with large, expressive eyes and plenty of sass. Little brother Shane (same name as the illustrator, by the way) and stuffed critters Dinah-saurus, Ducky, and Tiger complete the quirky ensemble cast. Each story is told in catchy rhyming verse printed both in bold, easy-to-read font and speech balloons (like in comic strips). The book gives 5 clues, the TV show only 3. I like the problem solving skills it develops as it challenges readers to figure out what Shanna's occupation could be - a princess, ballerina, teacher, or doctor. The story also encourages creativity. My girls, ages 4.5 and 2.5, are often inspired to put on their own shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shanna's Show","review":"Little girls like to dress up and conduct princess shows.

MacNutt is a decent writer, but he is careful not to get bogged down in the opinions of what he thinks. Because the Bible is incredibly vague on the specifics of demon possession/oppression and excorcism it's very hard to find a person who isn't either totally denying the presence of demons or blaming every little happenstance on demon possession. Whenever MacNutt mentions his own opinion which isn't mentioned in the Bible, he always points out that it is his opinion, unlike many other authors who try to slip theirs in, unbeknownst to the reader. Very imformative book, probably the only spiritual warfare book I would read in a group setting because any others are too far-fetched and people quickly become uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliverance and Healing Go Hand in Hand","review":"I have had this book in my collection for a long time now, and I have been in the Deliverance and Healing \\"business\\" for a long time now.

This should be in every person's collection, especially for the ministerial body, but there are other books that may lend additional insight to the relationship between medical illness and spirits of Darkness. Here are a couple that I recommend - The Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed and Lorraine Warren, and The Power of Divine: A Healer's Guide - Tapping into the Miracle by Tiffany Snow.

Countless stories have been told of similar tales that seriously lack the nuance necessary to convey the characters' humanity in all their absurd and fault-ridden conclusions to life's predicaments.

I couldn't agree more:\\"Authors Garlow and Jones seem a bit reactive as they attempt to set straight the historical record against the \\"smear campaign\\" by Brown's novel. Brown, they say, uses \\"venomous language\\" when he accuses the early church of being misogynistic. This dumbed-down tome states things too simply. The authors beat readers over the head by including fear tactics - cheesy fictional vignettes of \\"Carrie,\\" a modern-day coed who struggles after reading \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and is nearly swayed by her lesbian roommate, but eventually sees the light. There is some good historical background, but it's hard to get past the authors' exclamatory tone.\\"I am waiting to get The Truth Behind the Da Vinci Code by Abanes. Shorter Cheaper. And seems like it might be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging fiction represented as fact","review":"I like that the authors stated at the beginning of the book that they only decided to challenge Mr. Brown's work of fiction when he stated on National TV that what he had written (excluding the characters and their actions)was based on facts. Very loose interpretation of facts on Mr. Brown's part. This book separates the facts from the fiction in a way that is easy to read and understand. I would recommend reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The spokesman for the Church","review":"This book is merely a hundred something pages long and yet 99% of what the two authors said are in defense of the traditional church doctrine. The only credit they gave Dan Brown is the fact that he stirs up the debates reguarding Mary Magdelene. That's it. The rest are just praises of how the church's version of the history makes better sense, has more morality and is more ethically-oriented. They completely dismissed any Gnostic ideas. You don't need to waste a few dollars on this book when you can attend the church for free and have the pastor tell you the same things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"Almost two hunded pages of nothing new for $11 bucks?? No wonder there are already three used copies for sale. But still, even used, pick another option. This book is severely flawed in its composition in that the text does not seem to really address the issues MOST people really want to have discussed. And the authors just go on and on and on and on. They could have said what they needed to say in a far shorter book. They also did not write for the masses, but rather, wrote for, well, I'm not sure. maybe a classroom of some kind.Too bad. I was hoping for better. Maybye I'll pick up one of the forthcoming books-Bock (another professor) or Abanes (a popular writer with a dozen or so aother books)."},{"rating":"1","title":"More fiction than The Da Vinci Code","review":"I really didn't get anything from this book other than the authors dislike for The Da Vinci Code. If you're really looking to learn more about this mystery, I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A biased, poorly written book","review":"This is just a terrible book. Don't waste your money. There are few facts in this book, mostly just preaching. The \\"narrative\\" story line about a confused college call with a chain-smoking women's liberation Mom, and a lesbian roommate is offensive in its use of negative stereotypes.An unintentionally humorous part is when the author manages to brag about being a friend of John Lennon's and claims that he might well have become one of the Beatles. It has no reason to be in the book of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brief review of Cracking Da Vinci's code","review":"As with many other reviewers I think is book is a total waste of money.

What I paid for is unabashed preaching on how the Gospel can be spread through never re-interpretting or revisiting the collection of stories called the Bible.These two theological scholars don't add any additional light to Brown's story nor do they actually show proof that the DaVinci Code couldn't have been true (which, in fact, I agree that most of Brown's work is fictional interpretation.)It seems like another opportunity for Christians to talk to themselves and reinforce a narrow viewpoint through villianizing the \\"mass media\\" and the general population. Pure back-patting fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Paper","review":"This book is a rag. The title makes one think it is an unbiased critique of the Da Vinci Code and the associated conspiracy theory. IT IS NOT! It is a piece of disguised, and very poorly written Christian Propaganda that does not address the historical flaws of the Da Vinci Code's idea, but instead goes on a long rant about the Da Vinci Code's \\"attack on the Church.\\" I am very disappointed. This was a book of whining not a scholarly debunking of the \\"Holy Blood Holy Grail\\" myth.I would say to anyone who is TRULY interested in a scholarly criticism of The Da Vinci Code, where evidence is produced to debunk its claims... try this book insteadThe Da Vinci Fraud: Why the Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction.Don't waste your time on this waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, a recommended read","review":"I didn't find the way this book was written particularly impressive, but it still contains some useful and interesting information. I have not read any of the other books out there that debate Dan Brown's ideas, so I have nothing to compare this book to, but the fact remains that Dan Brown does not have everything correct.

As such, the authors spend considerable time attacking this so-called agenda and little time on a detailed critique of the \\"Da Vinci Code.\\" Clearly the intention of the authors is to promote their Christian Right agenda.I bought this book to help me to prepare a discussion on the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" at my church. I did not find it helpful. I am not a fan of the \\"Da Vinci Code,\\" nor am I a fan of \\"Cracking Da Vinci's Code.\\" If you a looking for a book that provides some careful analysis of the \\"Da Vinci Code,\\" look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faith & Truth","review":"People who have faith in God will believe no matter what is said, done, proved. There are many \\"Truths\\" in the universe and everything is based on perception. Maybe the Davinci Code is fiction or maybe a clever way to spread the \\"truth\\".

I wanted to read a book that would address some of the more egregious examples as well as answer questions about Da Vinci's art, the Priory of Sion, and the Council of Nicea. Instead I read a book which (a)did a fairly decent job of explaining Christian theology mixed in with (b) a cheesy narrative of one-diminsional stereotyped characters and (c) an obvious bias against anyone who did not follow the authors' prescribed beliefs. For example, every time the word \\"feminist\\" is used it is preceded by \\"radical\\". Hilary Clinton is even mentioned because she is friends with a pagan! I am a deeply committed Christian and I found this book to be offensive. If the intent of the book is to evangalise, it will fail because of its shrill voice.

TDC was a great read with many intriguing elements to it while the Breaking Davinci code was a thinly veiled theological rant. The authors were guilty of the exact same things Dan Brown was accussed of meaning they presented their \\"truth\\" with paper thin proof. It is a very weak minded and preachy book written by authors who do not hide their prejudices. They needed to show better proof and be objective not supremely opinionated. They also needed to keep in mind that the dan Brown Novel was a work of FICTION. Most educated readers know this and they expect the intriigue that was presented to them. While some of his ideas on TDC were far fetched some were plausible and deserve exploration and THAT is the point of reading to get the mind going and to explore different ideas and topics not to be so singled minded that dogma blinds you. The authors of breaking the da vinci code should keep that in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip off!

Lost focus often. I think they tried to extens the material beyond where it needed to go (to be expected from Ph.D.s).- Attempted to wrte in a popular style, but missed it. Sounded like a droning research paper (although it did try to stay light at points, but again, it was clearly not the natural style of the authors).- Didn't tell me anything I didn't already know (anybody want a used copy, cheap?)Too bad.

This author acts as if he has a personal vendeta against Dan Brown's Davinci Code.Look, fiction is fiction.

I changed the battery, but the result was the same. I exchanged the product in store (Guitar Center), but the moment I put in the battery and turned on the 'new' amp, the problem was immediate. I suspect I picked up a refurbished one. I don't know if buying the AC adapter would fix the problem, but if I have to use one to play, then my purpose for buying this is lost.

The Colors jump off the screen and every detail is lush. This looks just like it did when I saw it on an HD Channel a few years ago. This looks to be very film like but the film grain does not distract from every detail in the movie. The only thing I did not like was the fact that the BD Live function does not work on the menu. My internet connection works fine but the disc will not take the update when I click on \\"BD Live\\" on the Main Menu. Boo to Sony for that problem with the menu.

Adam even looks like he hates it. He hardly even smiles. The little boy is annoying. Who on earth convinced Adam to be in a movie like this. A CHICK FLICK! It tries to be sentimental and make you care for the characters but I certainly didn't care. The characters are the most Stereotyped People ever put on film. (eg. Adams Gay friends, The foreign delivery boy) This could be forgiven if they were funny, but they simply arn't. I had to watch HAPPY GILMORE 5 times just to restore my faith in Sandler. If your a REAL Adam Sandler fan, Steer clear at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross, unfunny, sloppy, annoying","review":"Big Daddy started out depicting Sonny (Adam Sandler) as your typical distastful bachelor brainless wonder searching for the good life with a beautiful girl by his side and ended with him having it all (the money, the friends, the wife, the kids, the status) while still enjoying the pleasures of singledom. The plot was okay, but the language and the content was disgusting. You must have a strong stomach to watch this movie. There was no real comedy. There were real issues brought to light, but no real examination of them. It was depressing and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"i didn't like it","review":"even though the sprouse twins are cute, the plot sorta sucks. its not really funny, and obviously the directors did a poor job with poor effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Funny Movie.","review":"I don't know what makes this movie funny to people.

This was a 3 star movie - a marginal recommend - until the movie wraps up. I'm all for a happy ending but this was ridiculous! Our hero gets married, now works as a lawyer, has a child of his own, is still best buds with his original \\"son\\" Julian, and to top it off he can have a laugh at his ex-girlfriend working a menial job at Hooters with the guy she dumped him for.

My husband and I watched this movie recently, and we had a hard time staying awake. Sandler's character is an obnoxious, aging adolescent; his character is unlikeable and bordering on child abandonment in his treatment of his young charge. Maybe with a young actor playing Sandler's role, this story could have been believable. I am glad that we did not waste any money buying this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parental Failure","review":"So many critics have called Adam Sandler's work subpar, and I couldn't agree more. His only joke is that funny voice he makes; just watch him--in every single movie, CD, and SNL skit he has done, he does that pathetic excuse for a funny accent. It has worn thin, and so have his movies. \\"Big Daddy\\" is disturbingly irresponsible. Critics that call his character \\"a good father in his own way\\" must not have seen the movie I saw. Adam Sandler crosses a line and does not make light of it or even acknowledge it, whereas good comedies like \\"There's Something About Mary\\" recognize that they have crossed the line, but set the tone correctly as to make the audience feel good about laughing. Laughing at \\"Big Daddy\\" just doesn't feel right. To see a movie that finds humor in the more disturbing things in life, rent \\"Happiness\\". It's an example of how to set the right tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Duddy. . .An Unfunny Waste of Time","review":"What a waste of talent. You've got the funny Adam Sandler, the witty Jon Stewart, the sweet Joey Lauren Adams, the strange Steve Buscemi, etc. . .and you get this. This dreck of a movie. Name one funny scene. I dare you. Name one creatively written scene that is truly funny. And no, I will not count Sandler tossing sticks at rollerbladers. Did a four year old come up with that one? Some one got paid for writing that? And what about Sandler peeing on the building. ha-ha-ha. . .zzzzzz. This is comedy that is completely uninspired. It's as if a witless pre-teen about to enter the 7th grade wrote a screenplay and somehow got it produced. If you want REAL COMEDY, get \\"Bowfinger\\", \\"The Muse\\", \\"There's Something About Mary\\", \\"American Pie\\", \\"Kingpin\\", \\"The Jerk\\", etc. . .This film is so unfunny. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dysfunctional idiot and kid","review":"This movie was a pathetic attempt to grab our heart strings, but was only effective in loosening my purse strings. It's about a very dysfunctional idiot (Adam Sandler) who takes on the job of setting the absolute worst possible example for a child. This movie is a joke and everybody who watches it is a victim. I generally think Adam Sandler is funny, but I didn't laugh once. Note to self: never watch another Adam Sandler flick again. Note to Adam: Get some new material. Two thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bad movie with Adam Sandler...","review":"It never changes, casting Adam Sandler gets you one of the dumbest movies one can see. It was bad enough Wedding Singer was made, but they keep getting dumber. In this one he watches over a kid, who probably has a higher IQ than him in reality.

Unfortunately, it's not. \\"Big Daddy\\" has it's moments, but not enough to save it. Even Adam Sandler himself can't save it. When I saw it advertised on TV, I liked the idea because it looked and sounded funny. And you'd expect it to be. I mean, Adam Sandler's characters are nearly always silly, childish and immature and you can just imagine him trying to take on the responibilities of caring for a little kid. You just can't help but laugh. However \\"laugh\\" is what I didn't do as much as I expected to when I saw \\"Big Daddy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"No one over the age of 13 should watch this movie!","review":"Many people, mainly Adam Sandler and his few friends, thought that this movie was funny - it isn't. Look Who's Talking is funny, Three Men & Baby is funny, more recently Ace Ventura and The Mask are funny, but this isn't. All the best bits, which everyone's seen in the trailer, seem long winded and drawn out in this movie. Big Daddy Small Laughs I'm afraid. Sure kids will love it, anyone under the age of 13 will laugh at Sandler's goofy face, it's just all-round hilarious kids movies have been made before and are at the cinemas now, don't waste your money or time with a half-witted video that your kids will grow out of in less then a week.

Lots of laughs and crude humor in a movie about Sandler unofficially adopting his friend's little boy. After he becomes attached to him he goes to court to be his Big Daddy. Cast includes Joey Lauren Adams, Rob Schneider, Steve \\"Egg Mcmuffin\\" Buscemi, and Allen Covert. Big Daddy has heart and a load of laughs, continuing in the Adam Sandler tradtion.Two places you may want to eat after seeing Big Daddy? McDonalds and Hooters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it to me Big Daddy!","review":"I loved this movie! Ofcorse, it is probably not all that realistic, but remember it is a comedy and it is Adam Sandler. Adam Sandler can make any movie funny, but in this movie he was funny, cute, and you just wanted to give him a big bear hug. You laugh, you can cry, but you will have a good feeling inside you. You will be repeating some lines from the movie over and over just because they were so clever and funny. Its an all around good humor movie and any Adam Sandler or even non-Adam Sandler fans would like this.

Then, the Sandler character, in part because he wants to impress his girlfriend, decides to raise the child as his own.The movie is very funny, well-written, and a joy to watch with your children. I was also impressed that the film depicts homosexuals in a very positive light and even shows two beautiful men (friends of the Sandler character) kissing, allowing young children to know that being in love with someone of the same sex is alright and not abnormal.The movie comes with a slew of bonuses including a Sheryl Crow music video, HBO featurette on the making of the movie, and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Adam Sandler at his best but close enough","review":"New York tollbooth worker and failure to his family Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) who really has not decided to take the next step in life and become a successfull something or other as opposed to big overgrown kid still living off leftovers and pizza has a son, Julian, of his roommate's dying wife show up at his doorstep moments after his roommate moves to China. Sonny really has nothing going for him whatsoever, his girlfriend has just left him and now he has to support a hyper, five year old running throughout his apartment. This movie takes on a more happy loving feel than other dumb funny Sandler movies. Renee Zelwegger plays Sonny's new girlfriend who loves Julian, and loves Sonny. This movies happy feeling is sure to have a smile across your face for the majority of it and has a great ending, and will also make you laugh throughout much of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"not my favorite but a good one","review":"this comedy, as all Sandler's movies, is to have a good time. Adam Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a single guy who ilegally adopts a little kid, and this last one will eventually become a part of his life. To take care of the child he decides to make a fantasy world without rules and obstacles; in other words, he loves the boy in a very special way. What makes you wanna keep on seeing the movie is that the central theme is seen as something not necessaryly serious, so it is fun to see what's gonna happen next with this particular pair of \\"clawns\\". I recommend it because of its joy-transmition and pretty funny ex SaturdayNightLive-actors. You won't regret seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely one star....GARBAGE","review":"This movie is mystifying. How could a movie about a grown man with no job raising a kid as if he were a dog, be funny? There is nothing funny about this VERY juvinile movie.

I kind of liked it. I thought it was pretty good. It didn't have good acting but it was good. It was called kidnapping when he wanted to keep the kid because he was trying to find the natural parents for him. I also think the title should be changed because he wasn't a daddy he was just looking after him for awhile. Some of the scenes were funny but not that funny. The kid did a good job for his first acting career. Adam Sandler was allright. He's not usually good in his movies but he is funny.

The use of transparent overlays is superbly done. The reverse side of each \\"film\\" reveals another aspect to the scene. We see the duck diving in the pond, her bottom in the air. Turn the page and we see what's going on under the water.This classy book has an unashamedly Continental style with an almost earthy flavour. What a great way to introduce children to the \\"facts of life\\". We see the mating rituals of the farmyard poultry together with cows, sheep and pigs all seen suckling their young.This would have to be one on the most sophisticated \\"picture books\\" ever published.

It should have been more honestly titled: \\"Archaeological Evidences for the Book of Mormon that Even Mormon Church Authorities Regard as Dubious.\\" Most of the book concerns hoards of supposed ancient Jaredite artifacts discovered in caves in Utah. According to this book, knowledge of the artifacts is being suppressed by a conspiracy that includes the Church hierarchy, Brigham Young University, and the Deseret News. This is certainly not a group that you think would suppress such finds - if the finds were genuine.

It then constructs and analyzes operators (addition, multiplication, and the like) on the plane. It devotes a good section to discussing the Desargues and Pappus properties and their fundamentality in most geometries. A good treatise of projective geometry follows, and the book ends with a quick skim of metric geometries and non-euclidean geometries.

The \\"Iscariot Conspiracy\\" has everything in it from car bombings to kidknapping of a Boston Detective's daughter as revenge. What intrigues the reader during this story is the possibility of international war and the changing of the 2000 year history of the Catholic Church.

Matthiesen does an excellent job in portraying a region, its inhabitants, and one person who has a strong effect on both. The character of Watson is fascinating: dangerously violent (especially when drunk),yet capable of generosity and of fathering and providing for a family, aided by his entrepreneurial skills. He is, as one of the earlier settlers in the Everglades describes him, \\"accursed:\\" someone who is fated to bring trouble on himself wherever he goes. He may have killed Belle Starr in the Oklahoma Territory, and is the author of at least a few killings throughout the book.

Peter Matthiessen recreates the characters and families that participated in the killing, which was perceived as a necessary evil to rid the community of a vile man. His writing is immediate; his telling creates the scene and pulls the reader into the necessity of killing Mister Watson. It is fine reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the Light","review":"A beautiful album. The Sixteen are wonderful and Kaori Muraji is incomparable. Her guitar matches perfectly with the quiet, antique-flavored music. This CD is a happy combination of well chosen music intelligently arranged and presented in a sumptuous package of beautiful vocals and that quiet, supportive guitar. Lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational romantic suspense","review":"Tess Carson is called from her New York home to a remote California town when her sister turns up missing. But when she arrives in Mountain Bend to look after her sister's daughter, she realizes there is more to the disappearance than appears on the surface because Tess knows her sister would never leave her daughter behind. But her sister's boss is dead and her sister is a suspect. Tess turns to an unlikely ally to clear her sister's name....the dead man's son, Grant Weston, who is haunted by his own demons. And there is something else haunting Tess. Something forcing her to experience strange, terrifying hallucinations of another time and place....over one hundred years in the past.This is the first book I've read by Erin Grady but it definitely won't be my last.

It's impossible to be authoritative when you misspell the name of the bar you're slamming.This enterprise reeks of ambitious New Yorkers who hoped to repeat the success of their book from that city. I sure hope that the writers aren't Chicagoans - anyone who misspells \\"Comiskey Park\\" and \\"Harry Caray\\" in the same book would be drawn and quartered in Chicago, where people have a strong bulls**t detector.This book certainly rates highly on mine.There's a little red book that came out a few years ago - THE OFFICIAL CHICAGO BAR GUIDE - that did it much better, quicker, funnier, and more accurate. Let's only hope the brains behind that book decide to update it, and fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEAD ON","review":"What's lame is lame and what's fun is fun, these reviews are blunt but funny.

This book manages to take the colorful underworld of Chicago nightlife and make it boring. I agree with the earlier posts that it's mean-spirited and sloppy, and many of the reviews are so off-base it makes you wonder if the author actually visited the bar.But there's good news - the infamous red book (\\"official Chicag bar guide\\") that an earlier poster raved about *has* been updated. I just found it a minute ago. It comes out December 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you, Spider","review":"First - this book, while given a marvelous base premise, is way too shallow and superficial for what I generally expect from Mr. Robinson.Second, maybe Spider needs to leave Canada's California and move back East. I don't read fiction in order to get politics, liberal OR conservative, shoved down my throat. And Spider's gratuitous poke at Condoleeza Rice was just that - ugly, gratuitous and not what I'd expect from someone who has generally steered clear of politics in his fiction - except for non-partisan excoriations of failure to back space exploration. Furthermore, it was flat out ungentlemanly.Wake up, Spider, or you are going to lose at least one \\"faithful reader.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I wanted to try and give a chance to this man whom I have been seeing his name whenever I open the Stand's Amazon page because though King is my all-time favourite it would be interesting to have a look at the writing of counter-opinion author but...Is this the man who scathed the Stand and King's writing? Better take Creative Writing courses before slashing real talents in publishing world.

It's a fun read. When I was done, however, I found myself disappointed. The concept of a suicidal writer teaming up with a telepath and a female cop to catch a psychopath is a good one. The \\"suicidal\\" part doesn't affect the plot at all, which was too bad because it could have been interesting. The end came too quickly, especially considering all the time he spent on his character battling bureaucracy.The most annoying part about this book was how it was used to beat the reader over the head with how \\"marijuana is great\\". I don't smoke it and I'm neutral on the subject myself.I expected more imagination from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not another Callahan story","review":"Great novel! Easy & enjoyable to read straight through. Like any science fiction, you're required to accept one unbelievable premise, in this case telepathy. Spider builds strong characters - our heroes are flawed but likeable, the villian is a little over the top, but not enough to distract from the tale. Set in western Canada, the descriptions make me want to spend a long vaction there. I may not agree with Spider's politics, but he doesn't preach enough to matter.Have fun..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Album!","review":"My little girl Anna loves the song I met a bear!

In particular, the Beethoven concertos (still the best stereo cycle of those works), the Grieg/Schumann concertos (still at or near the top), and the Brahms concertos (along with Gilels, the best pairing of those). Fleisher & Szell were quite a dynamic duo. Now over 40 years later comes the best stereo recording I've heard of the piano quintet (yes, I like it better than Pollini/Quartetto Italiano). As for the quartets, there are many fine recordings. I especially like the Verdi Quartett's Op. 51 set. The Alban Berg has a fine set of all three on 2 discs (but inexplicably no \\"filler\\"). But, this set by the Emerson's is as good as any I've heard, and probably better. When you add it all up, it's a no-brainer as to which set to get. Hopefully, this is the first of many collaborations between Fleisher and the Emerson Quartet (while he can still play at this level)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emerson 4, Fleisher 1","review":"Somehow the Emerson Quartet doesn't seem quite a good match with Brahms, and I I'm not quite sure why. As at least one other reviewer has noted, although these performances are technically near perfect there doesn't seem to be heart beating in the middle of them. Like at least one other reviewer, I've never been that crazy about the Brahms quartets in the first place, but the Emersons don't seem to try to make any kind of gutsy case for them. That leaves the Piano Quintet, and here it's much the same story -- or would be, if Leon Fleisher weren't there at the keyboard, breathing some life into the performance. This is the portion of the album that is worthwhile, and since this is a two-for-the-price-of-one affair, one can come close to believing that the recording of the Quintet is alone worth the price of the release. Maybe. Should be 3.5 stars, but Fleisher makes it an even 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good","review":"The quartets are played at the height of virtuosity. However, like Heifetz, the perfection can leave one a bit chilly. The passion tends to be lost in the execution. Tempos are just too fast. That being said, the virtuosity is indeed remarkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earth Friendly but not strong","review":"I purchased a case of the Earth Friendly paper towels. This is the first eco-friendly paper towel that I have used. I am not sure if it is indicative of eco-friendly paper towels or not but I was very disappointed at the thickness and strength of the sheets compared to my regular paper towels. They tend to fall apart very easily. It would take two to three times as many Earth Friendly paper towel versus my regular paper towels. It may be earth friendly but you end up recycling a lot more of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with other brands for 100% recycled","review":"So I don't know if this will get blocked or not because I'm referencing Consumer Reports or not... but I tried to do a lot of research before I bought these paper towels last week. When I got them in, I was... unimpressed. I was deciding between Seventh Generation, Green Forest and Earth Friendly Products. Today, a new Consumer Reports came in, and ranked all 3 of these along with 18 other brands (21 total), and Earth Friendly Products came in last of all 21. Seventh Generation was an alright at number 13, and a product called White Cloud Green Earth, which I'm not sure where to find to purchase, came in at 7, the best of all products that are recycled. So if you can find them, go with White Cloud Green Earth brand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Acceptable for my needs","review":"I like that these towels are a smaller size. I prefer the \\"select-a-size\\" type of towel so that it is easy to take a small piece to avoid waste. These are larger than the half sheets I've had before, but smaller than a typical sheet.They are a thin paper towel, so they can tear when pulled quickly from the roll, but they aren't prone to shredding as some other recycled towels seem to.Personally, I use rags to clean up serious spills, reserving paper towels for small, quick-grab messes and as napkins when someone is running out of the house with food in hand. Someone who cleans heavily with paper instead of cloth might find these too thin and/or small."},{"rating":"1","title":"too flimsy","review":"Towels advertise strength but they are anything but strong.

I was a little worried since I don't usually like defrosted meat, but finally grilled some up this weekend and the sausage tasted like it was made that morning!

It was a hit in 1976 when it was released, hitting number 11 on the Billboard album charts and becoming another in a long string of million sellers for America. It includes the top 20 hit Today's The Day and the minor hit Amber Cascades. Other songs received some airplay like Jet Boy Blue (this song should have been released as a single), Letter, and Watership Down. George Martin must have had a ball producing this album as he makes heavy use of strings and horns, but it is done very well. A very good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless classic","review":"When this album first came out, my sister borrowed it from the library. I instantly fell in love with the easy melodies and continued to borrow it from the library until I earned enough $$ to purchase the LP. I recently purchased the CD which I have not heard for years. When I listened, the reminiscent tunes automatically brought the lyrics to mind. This relaxing music is timeless and sounds as good today as it did years ago. Hideaway may not be as well known as other America albums, but it remains a \\"hidden\\" treasure and my all-time, favorite album.HideawayHideaway"},{"rating":"1","title":"America's first truly weak album","review":"After the highs of Hearts, this album was much anticipated. However, it falls far short of their past efforts, with nearly half the album's songs qualifying as poor writing. Perhaps some of this can be blamed on what feels like an attempt to create rocking tunes for their live act. But nearly all those fast paced songs (Jet Boy Blue, Don't Let it Get You Down) are weak or (even worse) cliche. High points include \\"Amber Cascades,\\" \\"Watership Down\\" and \\"Today's the Day\\" (the one hit).

They can be prompted to reminisce about their youth, by question poised by the author, on a daily calendar. It is very thoughtful and thought-provoking. Initially there is some doubt that your memory will serve you well...but one by one you begin to put together a compilation of your activities and events during formative years. You by-pass the fear of sitting down and having to write a personal biography. It becomes a fun adventure, requires you to put on your thinking cap to recall many facets of growing up that you had overlooked over the many intervening years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very sturdy and quick easy to use stand.","review":"I bought this stand because I need space for a volume pedal, sustain pedal, and rotary speaker effect on the floor, so the \\"X\\" style stands don't work for me. I have been using the \\"Z\\" style, but it took a long time to set up. This opens up immediately and is heavy duty. The only tradeoff is that it makes it somewhat awkward to carry, especially if you're not too tall. I put a bungee cord between the legs to keep them from swinging around. There is a little side-to-side play when it is all set up. I also bought the M-92 upper tier separately, and it seems they may have had different versions. The stand has a nut in the bottom of the frame while the second tier has the threads on the side. There was also no tool to adjust the second tier in the kit, but I found a couple metric screws, m8 x1.25 thread and the star drive screwdriver at the hardware store to complete my set up. So far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't enjoyed reading a series for a long time....'til now","review":"Yes.....this trilogy was a breath of fresh air....wish Salvatore could write this good......as he used to.If you want to talk boring books (trilogies), it is Salvatore's \\"The Lone Drow\\" series....what a chore (sorry for mispelled words).

Although book 2 should have been edited and made part of this book. Ok let me gripe about this book. It takes forever to reach the the main battle between the hero and the villian but the fight is over in like 5 seconds. Iakhovas worked all kinds of impressive magics, slayed huge creatures, and completed all kinds of other mystical feats to basically be stabbed once or twice and bam it's over. Horrible ending. Also no closure either. After this climatic battle if one would call it theres a whole 2 pages maybe. Plus I have to gripe about Jhereks mystical weapons. They are stupid.

I'm returning it.","review":"The biggest problem is that the outgoing sound quality is not great. At it's best, the person I'm talking to says I sound a bit muffled. At it's worst, there is static and I am barely comprehensible. Sometimes I hear static myself, even when the phone is a few feet away. And the range is not impressive, certainly not 30 feet.'This headset just isn't worth $100. There are superior wired headsets available for under $30."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy cusomer","review":"The first Jabra JX10 came defective and I had to pay over 12.00 to send it back to the Ace Photo. they would not send me a replacement until they received the defective one. Finally after nearly two weeks, a second Jabra JX10 arrived, also defective. Ace Photo refused to send a mailing label and said that I should contact Jabra. I then called Jabra and they said that they would send out another one immediately with my credit card on file along with a mailing label to return the defective one. It has been 4 days and I have not received the replacement. Jabra also informed me that the warranty started when the initial Jabra was sent out, which I think is unfair. It should begin when I receive a product that works. As you can see, I'm rather upset about this whole transaction. It makes me think it would have been better to purchase it at a local electronics store. This is the first time that this has happened, I have been satisfied in the past with other orders through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful","review":"Sharp corners on the back dig into my ear. Extremely painful. Ear hook breaks easily, both inside and at the tip. Wind noise is not controlled very well and the volume must always be adjusted. I suggest a Motorola product instead. They must have actually had someone try their units out before putting them on the market. Jabra was obviously more interested in how the unit looked and not how it performed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk!","review":"I bought two of these throuh this merchant in Jan 08 and had to wait a month while they we on back order and when they finally arrived, one wouldn't charge and the other that did charge, the sync function was broke. These should be called Blackeye not Bluetooth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless after six months","review":"I'll concentrate on the reasons why the Jabra has been useless to me after just a few months, but first I'll mention that I really liked the headset when it was still working ok - small, stylish, good quality. It has a few design flaws though, especially the stylish stand - it is difficult to hook it up, you have to fumble; and the tiny buttons (pairing button is only for people with fingernails).The major weakness is the little ear piece. When you switch the side from time to time, you have to pull it off and it becomes unusable after a while because the claw like attachment widens - then it simply falls off and won't stay in place anymore.To make matters worse, mine also doesn't pair anymore, no matter what device I try. It has become useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Experience","review":"When I recieved the item it was bad out of box. I called and it was some sort of four day company holliday so I left a message and e-mailed for an RMA with no results. After waiting over a week I called back and was given an RMA number and asked for a new unit to be sent. I was told that I needed to send back the bad unit (at my expense) and then they would send a new unit. Never recieved a new unit as promised but did get a credit. I think I'll buy from a different company next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It might be good.","review":"Well I never got to use it; both times. it cost me about 30 bucks for returns twice.

However, after using this headset for several days, there was one common thread that occured in each and every one of my phone conversations (I use a Moto V3C), no one could understand me, no matter how clearly I tried to talk. At first I thought it was just noisy, or windy, but in a perfectly quiet room with the phone in my pocket, people on the other end of my calls simply reported that I sounded garbled. I should say however that the reciever quality, from what I could tell was excellent and crystal clear, unless the phone was more than about 3 feet from the headset. If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset. My advise, pass on this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk","review":"I purchased this to replace an old Jabra that I used and liked. This model though broke within a day of when I purchased it. The ear piece just broke in two (which seems to be common, it broke as I picked it up). They offered replacements for free on their website, so two weeks later when they arrived, I put the replacement ear piece on, and then was disappointed with the range of the JX-10. If you have the JX-10 more then 12 - 15 inches from the phone, your call starts breaking up. I wear my phone on my belt, and in every call I receive static. Save your money and purchase a better headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"It is comfortable to wear, but it is very fragile. the ear clip started falling off the third week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light as a feather but needs more volume","review":"The Jabra JX-10 is incredibly light, it's not hard to forgot you're wearing it. But with the adjustable over the earwire can fit snugly to your head. My only quibble is with the volume. Unless you plant the bud portion inside your ear (very uncomfortable for my delicate ears) it can be difficult to hear clearly when there is much ambient noise. I've solved that by using an earbud extender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile hook, poor fit, easdy to fall off","review":"The ear hook connection with the unit is so delicate and fragile that it's virtually impossible not to have the unit drop from your ear repeatedly. Especially vexing when it drops between the car seats. The hook is a flexible wire. Repeated flexing of the wire to adjust the unit's fit causes the wire to break. Down between the care seats, again! If the earbud is supposed to fit in your ear, it didn't. Just sort of dangled in my ear. I wrote Jabra with my complaint and never heard back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"This did not work well for me at all.

At times I had trouble hearing the people on the other end and times they came in clear. The one thing that was consistant was that the people on the other end said I sounded garbled.

They have two little (and I mean little) prongs that clip on to the headset and if one of them breaks, the loop will not work. We have had four of these ear loops break in just this way.

Pairs easily. Always connects when on. It is absolutely perfect except that the ear bud part is still uncomfortable and it needs to be inserted as the ear hook is not secure if used alone.

I can't wait to take it off when the call is completed. I am totally aware that it is in my ear and it is a bit painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of ear-loop breakage","review":"The JX-10 works okay, looks cool, and is comfortable to wear, but you should expect the ear-loop to break every few weeks or so. It's a bad design with two very, very small pieces of plastic that hold the earloop in place. They are quite fragile and will break from normal use. A replacment loop costs under $10.00 so you might want to buy a few extra.This is a commonly reported complaint about the JX-10 and I would expect they'll have to do a redesign at some point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective item","review":"The Jabra Bluetooth was purchased for a Christmas present. Unfortunately, when it was opened on Christmas morning, we found it to be defect. The Jabra wouldn't take a charge. I returned it to the seller, who refunded the purchase price.

Jabra replaced it once, but with the same results. The new earloop is much better though. I tossed the expensive looker in my drawer and went back to my old BT-250, which just ran out of battery life.

The Jabra folks sent out 3 JX-10 units in row as replacement and all had the same problem (I even tried the replacements on a Moto Razor phone and got the same no audio problem). Strange thing is a Jabra BT150 unit works just fine. Jabra cannot say why it is happening, just that they've seen it on another case with Treo 680's & Razor's. Their only solution is to send me a new BT8010 unit. I agreed to it, but I think the BT8010 is a similar design as the BT150, which is very poor - it doesn't fit on your ear and constantly falls off.

Since we switched to the Jabra JX-10, we get NO complaints from customers. I can hear better with this blue tooth than any other I have used. It's a little pricey, but I think you get what you pay for! In our business, well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, except when there is background noise.","review":"I love the size, form factor, and usability of this headset. Incoming sound is good. Unfortunately, the outgoing sound is a deal breaker. If there is any background noise, this headset will pick it up and transmit it just as loud as your voice. The DSP helps a little, but affects the sound quality dramatically (think overcompressed MP3). I am an attorney and need to talk to clients; I need to sound professional. Unfortunately, this $100 headset does not match the sound quality of a $25 wired headset with a boom mic. I am trying to modify mine by rewiring it with a boom mic from an [...] headset, but so far I have not gotten it to work. I am willing, though, to risk destroying the JX10 in order to have a chance at better outgoing sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too flimsy","review":"My wife and I each purchased one, about 2-3 weeks apart. By the time mine had arrived in the mail, hers had already broken and was being returned. Mine faired no better. With hers, the connection where you plug it into the charger pulled out of the earpiece when she disconnected the charger. Mine... first the ear loop broke in 2 pieces. Then, while pushing the button to answer a call, the whole unit crumbled into about 4 pieces in my hand. I wish I could give it back. The sound quality is crummy. The microphone picks up everything in the background much better than your voice. I am thoroughly dissatisfied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jabra JX-10 Bluetooth Headset, Silver","review":"Excellent product.

I would rate the device as 5-star, but I can't understand why Jabra would enclose an ear hook that a dollar store wouldn't carry. I wouldn't expect much better on a $25 device, but I have higher standards for a $100 one.Jabra customer service was supposed to send two free ear hooks, but after 2 weeks, it hasn't arrived yet - which makes me suspect about their customer service as well.I guess the Danes have softer ears than we have in the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reboot city","review":"Did not work with my Treo650.

The usual bite of a natural cocoa was gone, the usual bitterness was non-existent. I also made some brownies using this cocoa and a high quality natural cocoa. I did blind taste tests with four other people. Four of the five of us chose the brownies with this cocoa over the natural cocoa.

Excellent graphics and great activities but there certainly should be more verbal or graphic reward as incentives to make the child want to further pursue the game.

I was taken back in time to a more innocent age, with PJ's on in front of a glowing fire with a warm feeling of peace in my heart, and family past and present all around.

This is a little confusing, since these speakers are supposed to be 5.1. But hey, who am I to complain?

Too often, the camera gives us odd shots of the audience and the pit, which doesn't help draw you into the story. Alagna can certainly act here, but his forced, high notes always go way sharp. His Nedda, Svetla Vassileva, also gives it her best, but keeps sounding squally and strident. The best of the lot is the Tonio of baritone Alberto Mastromarino - both good acting and voice. The sets and staging are befitting a standard college production. Sound and visuals are fine, but I'd stick to the Domingo DVD for a hair-raising show."},{"rating":"1","title":"The aliens invade and bore us to death","review":"The aliens invade and put everyone to sleep! Virtually nothing happens in this overlong, sophomoric novel. The aliens invade, turn off all the electricity, and a resistance movement starts that does absolutely nothing for years. Then, the aliens leave as mysteriously as they arrived. The book goes nowhere! Geez, if this got published, there's hope for all of us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So dull!","review":"There are books which are a pleasure to read page-by-page.

Then there are books which I just persevere with because *surely* something interesting will eventually happen.The Alien Years plot synopsis:The Aliens arrive (we don't know why)... and then, some several hundred pages later, they leave (for some equally unknown reason).What a bore! Lifeless stereotypical characters struggling fruitlessly. Maybe it's supposed to be a metaphor for something. I don't care one way or the other.Thank goodness I borrowed this book from the library and so I didn't waste any money--only the many precious hours of my life when I could have been reading something interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, but The Alien Years is a big disappointment.","review":"The Alien Years started out with very little energy and ended in similar fashion. The aliens themselves were too cliche and Silverberg poorly supports the aliens' role as the antagonists. He simply writes them off as beings that are too intelligent for us to have any notions of who-what-when-where-why they are. Throughout the book, humans suffer and struggle in the hands of these so called \\"Entities\\" and never win any battles with them... not ever. The idea of such God-like, highly intelligent, and invincible aliens..well... SUCKS! The Alien Years is NOT action-packed nor is it thought provoking. My experience with this book is analogous to watching television for long hours... in the end I walked away from it with indifference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aliens","review":"I've read quite few negative reviews of this book and in some csaes I can agree with it. The family thing got a bit confusing over the span of 50 years. You had to get used to new characters during the course of the novel that werent as detailed as the opening peronas. But the way he handled the aliens I liked. They were ALIEN! We did not know their intentions and why they did things. That is why they are alien! Anyway I liked the book.

It was typical family dynasty sort of thing, with good characters, many that were very well fleshed out. There was sufficient conflict within the family to keep things interesting. Some of the concepts explored in this novel seemed incomplete. At the end, when the entities simply picked up and left, I felt that something was missing. Perhaps this is to leave room for a sequel. As always, I enjoy Silverberg and this was worth my time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unsatisfying","review":"After reading the cover flap I was hoping for something like Vinge's The Peace War, with alien invaders thrown into the mix. I wast very disappointed. I didn't end up caring about any of the characters, the aliens were totally incomprehensible and the ending was very weak. It wasn't even very good at being bleak. This was not really a bad book, but not one that engaged me, and one that fell far short of my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please god, let somthing happen !","review":"This book plotted a long arc in my living room before landing in the kitchen. The reason for this was because I reached the end of the novell and ,not suprisingly, there was no real ending. It took a lot of energy to end this one. Generation after generation of boring heros , I lost track of the family line somewhere near the middle. The characters drift from one event to another, never really taking an active part in what happens to them. Stay clear of this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"No payoff for the time spent reading this book","review":"Many of the reviewers have said it better than I can.Good premise with no payoff. I slogged through pages of character development to get to a anti-climatic ending. It's one of those books that has you flipping back over the last few pages saying \\"that's it\\"?I could understand that type of ending (Although many of the reviewers have revealed the ending I won't do that here) ifthe whole novel hadn't spent most of the time implying that the humans were going to kick the alien's rear.Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag me with a spoon","review":"The Alien Years: Numerous adjectives come to mind but exhausting comes closest to the mark.

But I was very disappointed. Characters seem to be pretty standard sci-fi stock types. Like others have mentioned here, I think it is pretty lazy to take two really terrific short stories (\\"Against Babylon\\" and \\"The Pardoner's Tale\\") and recycle them into a novel. The added text diluted the stories' impact and added nothing. Not bad if you're looking for a beach read, but I expected so much more from Robert Silverberg.

I gave it two hundred pages to get my attention, but it just bored me.The characters didnt interest me in the least bit, and the story was just to slow. I went to sleep three times trying to read it. I just gave up after awhile.To all out there looking for a good Alien Invasion read I suggest Footfall, or The Forge of God. I just cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"All characterizion - Minimal Plot - Even less action","review":"This book was a very easy read. Mainly because I turned page after page searching for a plot while skipping the uninteresting character development. The story is almost non-existant. The abscence of action appalling. The ending is a major disappointment. The aliens simply go away. Just like that. This book is really a short story masquerading as a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"More holes than Swiss Cheese","review":"There is more missing from this book than what is included. The plot's basic premise is these Aliens are so powerful that for the most part they ignore humanity, yet the book has humans interacting with them in a variety of ways. The silliest idea is that one of our computers could interface with the alien technology. Any aliens that advanced would have technology beyond our comprehension and not accessible through a DSL line.The worst aspect was the ending. I will not repeat it for those of you wishing to read this book, but don't expect any big surprises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joke!","review":"The aliens invade the Earth and we will never know why. The book is about the \\"resistance\\" that never will succeed although the book is big and (so) long. One of the (rare) characters that the reader can like die at the beginning of the novel: the writer prefers to focalize on the ranch Carmichael, a stupid and cosanguine family dreaming to be the heros against the aliens. They are as umpowerful as all the other. At the end, the aliens will leave us but why so? We will never know! All these (bad) pages to finish like that! A very stupid book from a master of science-fiction. Is it a joke? If it is, it is a success!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Aliens all of a sudden arrive on earth, and they are pretty cryptic, but brook no resistance. They do take over some people to use as agents.A few resisters do hold out, particularly the Carmichael family in the hills over Los Angeles. However, are they really kidding themselves about what is really happening?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this a parody of Science fiction cliches?","review":"Its hard to believe that Robert Silverberg would have written a novel that consisted almost entirely of bad science fiction cliches. Implacable aliens, all-powerful, all-knowing, completely beyond human understanding, and telepathic to boot. Poor ignorant humans struggling to understand it all, fighting an enemy that can't be beat. And the ending, a classic example of 50's nonsense. The story was disjointed, the characters extremely difficult to care about. By the end of the novel, I still could not care what happened to them.After finishing this book, I've come to the conclusion that it was a parody, intended to show novice writers of science fiction what not to do. (And show them that an established writer can get anything published, no matter how bad.) This is a book that was obviously not intended for serious fans of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"silverbergs worst","review":"a bad concept-aliens invade earth cause many hardships and death never communicate with us and then leave 50 years later for no reason-poorly executed.

Deserving of 0 stars, utter garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"an \\"epic\\" waste of my time","review":"Silverberg boldly claims this as \\"his epic masterpiece\\". This is as epic as an episode of Baywatch. The only good part of this book was the first 15 pages. After that you might as well just write whatever you think of...it would most likely be more interesting than the rest of this crummy book. If you are beginning to read it, lemme 'spoil' it for you: the earthlings do not retake the planet, the god-like aliens just leave. THATS IT. No standard all-out battle, no cunning ploy, not even an explanation. I was left feeling so cheated that I fed this book to my rabbits. I didn't even try to get my money back. Well, I could go on but even a review of this 'epic' goosegg is not worth the space to print, much like the book. Avoid this book. Save the shame at being caught, in the end, with absolutely nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read!!","review":"I had hoped after reading the jacket that Silverberg would conjure up a compelling story, (after all he did write NIGHTFALL with Asimov)but he left me completely unsatisfied. I can't believe that he's considered a master of storytelling. He certainly pales in comparison to Asimov, Bear, Brin, Clarke, Nivin and Pournelle, the truly great masters of science fiction.

I understand this game is one of the first turn-based RPGs for XBOX 360. But the team behind making 'Blue Dragon' had the former Final Fantasy creator contributing to its work.

The achievements are a problem, just like in most of the rpgs that I've played, you need to have more that one file, and its gets boring after a while having to always battle to get you level and SP up to unlock achievements.Blue Dragon great, but If you not into rpgs, I would stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game! but only for the person that is in love with RPG","review":"This game is way fun and will last you for hours! this is made by (in my opinion) on of the greatest game developers ever!

The setting is an alternate future where Germany and Japan won WW2. But this is only the groundwork for a much larger scope.This world is a very anxious world, and all of the characters seem to exist in a perpetual state of panic and anxiety. As if their world is upside down or spinning out of control in the wrong direction. Some scenes are truly horrific. One gets a sense that there are no clear choices to be made, because the world makes no sense.Truly unforgettable conclusion; you will just have to read it to find out for yourself.

It even takes a shot at itself by a \\"twist\\" which told me what I knew when I began the book - that this is a work of fiction.

A few recognizable Third Reich names thrown in are the only connection to the original concept. Otherwise, I have no idea what this book was about. It annoys me to waste my time with a book like this but because it was short, I plodded through to the end. My overall impression was to question the mental well-being of \\"Mr. Dick\\".

The characters were flat and boring. And the ending, AAAAGGGHHHH!I am a salesman, and read all kinds of books to relate to my clients.

Immensely overrated in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied.","review":"I was really excited to read this book when I bought it, but was pretty disappointed by the end. First, it is not science fiction. Second, although the characters are well drawn, the story is just not that interesting. Finally, and the most important drawback, the ending really sucks. There is no resolution, so you feel like why did I go to the trouble to read this if it doesn't go anywhere. Overall, I finished the last page feeling very unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mas","review":"This is one of the few books that I got 1/2 way through and gave up.

And this it actually fine if they are interesting, or the plot is interesting, or SOMEthing is interesting.

Please note, the ending was horrible. With the Nazis on the cusp of a nuclear attack on their unsuspecting Japanese aly, Mr. Dick chose to leave us hanging. I acknowledge this novel/alternate history story was written in 1962, a period in which authors attempted to \\"wow\\" their readers with sophisticated, nuvo, hanging endings but give me a break. I can envision bohemian hipsters with black cigarette holders dangling from the corner of their lips exclaiming with their best Thirsten Howell, accent, \\"Philip is the most spectacular writer, darling,...\\". So come on, ending such a riveting story with a woman walking away from an alternate history aruthor's house is plainly egotistical laziness.

Why?","review":"An altogether confusing and frustrating read. I picked this up because of all the hype surrounding it. It ended up being the most rambling, incoherent thing I'd read sinceOn the Road.When I finished it, I was left with the impression that either Philip K. Dick is not my cup of tea, or that all those who praise this book are just looking for validation from others who praise this book, but ultimately none of them know what they are talking about.At any rate, it would take a really strong recommendation from someone whose reading tastes I trust to get me to read anything else by Dick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complete \\"What If\\"","review":"There may be more exciting books using this idea -- the Allies losing WWII -- but I doubt you'll find one that's more atmospherically engrossing. The world that Dick creates is something else, especially the U.S. that's overrun with Japanese culture.Reading this book, I also realized something else: nobody writes the mind of a schizophrenic better than Dick. The passage where Tagomi is going nuts was so real that I almost couldn't read it.I still consider \\"Three Stigmatas of Palmer Eldritch\\" to be Dick's finest work, because it was so wonderfully whacked out, but I think \\"Man in the High Castle\\" is up there. It's more finely controlled than Palmer, and the landscape that Dick paints is worth looking at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Premise","review":"The premise of this book was very interesting, and there's no question that Dick is a deep and gifted writer. However, I felt that the storyline of this book was somewhat disjointed. While all the subplots were excellent in their own right, they didn't really come together very well. And, at the end, it wasn't entirely clear what the point of the story was except to tie readers' brains in knots. Still, it was a very satisfying read, overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for its day","review":"I feel that this book gets such high ratings due to the fact that it was written in the 60's. Of course this was an important and exciting work back then, but today I think it is rather dull. The author does a great job of developing characters, and telling a story. However, where is the plot and the excitement? Another reviewer mentioned that you need to read this book at least twice to really grasp what is going on. I agree with this and also the fact that it wasn't entertaining enough to justify reading it again. I believe what people want to see today is for the author to go one step further with the alternate timeline(s), and show some action or consequences. This book left you hanging, and wanting a little too much. But that's just my opinion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I always heard how great Philip Dick was, so I was interested in finally trying one of his books. Three months later I finally dragged myself to the end of this bizarre tale. The theme was fine, but the details were tedious, and the characters and story were simply not that interesting, plus the stilted use of the English language was annoying. And did I mention the ending wasn't very satisfactory, either? Sorry, fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"What if\\" this novel had a better ending?","review":"Normally a fan of \\"alternate history\\" stories, I found \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" disappointing. Although Dick creates a tangible and believable backdrop, he squanders it in a meandering mess.The promising premise introduced never comes to fruition. These characters go about their daily lives, and we follow them, but aside from displaying unique cirsumstances, this novel has very little plot.I also found Dick's obsession with the occult (particularly foretune-telling) annoying, as well as out of place. At times, I could not be sure if this was a novel or a new age treatise on the I-Ching.Let's not even get into the problems with this version of history that Dick flat out ignores, such as the fact that it would be next to impossible for any occupation force to successfully hold North America.Add to all of that an ending that really isn't an ending at all, and you're left to wonder just how sparse the field was when this work won the Hugo award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Literature == Plotless","review":"Philip K. Dick's \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" is, I'm sure, great literature. It won a major award. It's got an interesting theme just bursting at the seams. It's filled with a well thought-out alternate history resulting from the Axis winning World War II. It's technically well-written with highly developed characters etc.. The only thing it's missing is that minor detail called a plot. You can only read so much pointless exposition by the characters laying out the alternate history from within the minutia of their trivial lives. After a while, it just wears thin. So, if you love Literature (with a capital \\"L\\"), go ahead and read this. But, if you love a good story, give it a pass. I rate it at a Pretty Bad 2 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Displeasing at the very least","review":"I found Philip K. Dick to be a racist bigot. I don't care what the context of the book is; his casual use of racist terms is uncalled for and should not have been published."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mind-Blower, Perhaps Dick's Best?","review":"Unparalleled science fiction of particular interest to those of us who are fond of alternative realities, historical science fiction, World War II lore and Northern California.Dick describes a post WWII US where the Allies have lost and the Japanese and Germans administer different parts of the US under an uneasy truce.This one is probably my favorite PK Dick book and I would include it in a list of my top 50 all-time favorite sci-fi books as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man in the High Castle","review":"Philip K. Dick is the Master. This is one of his best. A thoroughly engrossing book which twists history (which so many others have tried) brilliantly and twists it back again like no one else. Enjoyable and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated Dick","review":"I had heard that this slim novel, in which Germany and Japan have divided up American, after winning WWII, was one of the best alternate history books ever. Being a moderate counterfactual history fan, I was excited to such a book by someone as respected as Dick. Unfortunately, while the setup is excellent, there's almost no plot to hold the reader's attention. The story, such as it is, hovers around San Francisco and a few people trying to work within this postwar system, where everyone has \\"place\\" or rank. There are some interesting incidents and characters, but ultimately they get bogged down in meaningless mystic nonsense. I can see how in 1962, when the book first appeared, the combination of alternate history and I Ching-babble must have been revolutionary, but both have been been done so much better since, that this ends up feeling quite dated and inadequate. Most disappointing of all is the obscure non-ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meandering, but well worth it","review":"While I would not consider myself familiar with Philip K. Dick's body of work as a whole, I do claim to have some experience within the alternate history canon, and particularly with World War II.As far as that aspect of the novel is concerned, it is a very enjoyable read. The backstory explaining America's defeat is plausible to a degree not often seen in this subgenre, and if Dick's dystopian America is a little bleak, that is explained as the direct result of American 'can-do.'The constant references to the I Ching were heavy-handed at times, and the plot never really consolidates into a coherent picture, but all in all, this is a fascinating book exploring a very different postwar world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resonant, Dignified, Moving, The Man in the High Castle","review":"TMITHC is probably not PKD's best book (although many would disagree) but it is certainly the best written, most resonant, and has one of PKD's best characters, Mr. Tagomi. It is a book about fascism, the I-Ching, and more besides, and is very moving. It is the sort of book that, once read, you can never forget. It is a world of contradictions, many of which are not resolved, and this is PKD's strength. Many have complained about the novel's ending, the man himself most of all (he said the I-Ching, which he used to plot the book, spoke with 'forked tongue' and claims the I Ching copped out). Here, I disagree. What is wrong with the ending? It leaves everything up in the air, yes, but how could be resolve all that he had brought into question. The scene where Tagomi is transported to our own world is possibly the best scene in the whole PKD canon, and it is this book that will probably be longest lasting of the novels PKD wrote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, but no story.","review":"I must confess some disappointment with this book. It had an interesting, if terrifying premise, essentially being that America lost WW II and the Eastern half was occupied by the Germans and the Western half by the Japs. The book started by describing life under these circumstance, but then made only an abortive attempt of telling a story, concluding with a \\"and then I woke up\\" sort of ending. Disappointing. Also,from a historical point of view, it also gives too much credit to Roosevelt, saying that only he kept the US from rolling over and surrendering, which is an absolute absurdity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not for everyone","review":"Philip K. Dick is not, unfortunately, for everyone. What concerns him as an author are not the things which concern most people: questions on the nature of reality, on what makes us human, on how people deal with a universe which feels, fundamentally, wrong. In this book many of the characters feel like they are living in the wrong universe and at the wrong time -- they live in Japanese-controlled California in a universe where the Axis has won World War II. How they react when they learn of a book, itself an alternative history, supposedly based on the I Ching, where the Allies win WWII, and how that fact changes their lives is the focus of this book. No, aside for the death of one individual, not much happens, on the surface. This book isn't about history, per se, it's about people. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"What if\\" this novel had an ending?","review":"As alternate history goes, \\"The Man in the High Castle\\" starts off strong, but meanders it's way to a forgetable, unfulfilling conclusion.I had heard such high praise of this work, I could barely believe I was reading the right novel. Dick draws a wonderful picture of his alternate world at the beginning of the novel, but then does very little with it.And for a Science Fiction novel to lend such weight to occult practices (i.e. fortune-telling) is almost an insult to the genre. I thought at times I was reading a New Age treatise on the I-Ching.And all of this doesn't even take into account the lackluster, anti-climactic ending, which leaves the reader in a state of general disinterest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strange and confusing book","review":"Like many other PKD books, this is weird and in some ways, somewhat hard to follow. While I enjoyed reading it, similar to a view presented in someone else's review, I found it hard to empathize with the characters, and I felt some things, such as the German occupied portion of the United States, were not properly expanded upon.(Yeah, I know, run-on sentence) A worthwhile book, but when I finished it my first reaction was \\"Wait, what just happened? I'm confused.\\" I'm more or less used to this from Dick's stories and novels, but this was a new spin on Dick-orientation(just made up word for PKD disorientation). My only recommendation is read the book, decide for yourself. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Split states spoils of war.This novel is an alternate history, and one of the favorite subjects of such books - World War 2.Here the Allies lose, and the USA is occupied territory, split, naturally enough to be half owned by Japan, and half by Germany (west versus east).Needless to say, this is now not a very nice place, and tensions also exist between the two occupying forces.An author here is working on a book that would result in a severe punishment - an alternate history of his own where the Allies did not lose the war.3.5 out of 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"PKD has written far better...","review":"PKD's recent literary resurgence has led to a (long overdue) reconsideration of his work. The Man In The High Castle won the Hugo Award, and is often sighted as among his best novels. And while the premise is certainly intriguing, the book is exceedingly poorly written - and not in a pulpy, so-bad-it's-good kind of way. PKD was a great risk taker as a writer and he deserves credit for that; he has written some fantastic, delirious and chaotic books that defy easy categorization (A Scanner Darkly is a great place to start), but this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, at best","review":"Philip K. Dick is, in a Douglas Adams sort of way, a man who obviously has a lot of interesting ideas. His novel, \\"The Man in the High Castle,\\" about America in an alternate reality in which the Allies lost WW2, makes use of these. But while his speculations on politics and foreign relations in general are interesting, his plotline is not.The characters, whose endeavors, of course, seem unrelated at first but come together in the end, aren't compelling, and, while having some interesting thoughts on their world, fail to engage the reader. The story moves slowly, and the philisophical musings aren't enough to justify it.In the end, a moderately interesting read, but not as fascinating as you might think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Story?","review":"Granted, Philip K. Dick fans will love this book no matter what. And it's aclaimed by others, but if you are looking for a STORY.... well you are in for a disapointment. It has a resonance, a feel that is dark and impressive, but there is no story. How can this be a classic for some people? Obviously it's 'feel' is so strong, that people love to return to it over and over again. But it lacks true writer's 'craft'. It has no structure, and you will want to throw the book against the wall when you finish. I just love some of Dick's stuff, but if you looking for a story, this isn't it. Atmosphere? Yes. Story? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother reading","review":"It's about jewlery. Don't even waste your time reading it.This is easily the worst thing i have read from Philip K Dick. His other works were amazing and this one had so much potential but this one lacked all of the things that made his other works superb. No plot, no real conflict literally nothing happens for the entire book. Up until this book PKD was my favorite science fiction writer but this one came as a slap to the face. The more you read the more you hope something will happen but it never does and you are left with the horrible realization that you have wasted a load of time with only a giant middle finger as a reward. Normally a book like this would take me a few hours reading, but i could barely read three or four pages before my attention was lost. If PKD were still alive I would write him asking for my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dick's incredible premise is poorly executed","review":"The world that Dick has created here, is absolutely brilliant. What would the world be like, what would the United States be like, had America and the Allies lost World War II? It's such an interesting question. Dick does a great job taking the reader inside this strange world. Jewish people live in hiding. The Japanese collect old American trinkets, like Mickey Mouse watches, and showcase them as collectors items. It's so believable.But the plot of this book seems to go nowhere. There are several different plotlines that mostly don't intersect, making the reader wonder, \\"what's the point of having these characters at all?\\" To me the most fascinating story in the book follows Mrs. Frink as she looks to find the writer, the \\"Man in the High Castle.\\"The ending is confusing, and although it makes the reader think about what this world would be like, it's not a satisfying conclusion to everything we've read before it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was described","review":"This book was described as in good condition with some wear.

As for Rowan in this second book in the Lives of the Mayfair Witches saga, she became the 20th century female version of Dr. Frankenstein, in a way, consumed by her scientific curiosity and lulled into falsely thinking that she could control this creature to which she had given birth and study it when in reality Rowan was herself at the mercy of Lasher.

The books 'Lasher' and 'Taltos' just became increasingly ridiculous. This concept of Lasher being some 5000 year old super being from Atlantis or whatever was so far fetched I was laughing out loud! And why, in all of AR's books, is the main character always about 5000 years old?It would've been nice if she'd stuck with the original theme, instead of this far fetched piece of drivel.

For myself the downfall of the Mayfair Witch series isn't in the prose which is every bit as seductive as ever, it is that the characters became distasteful. While the Vampire Chronicle characters of Lestat, Louis, Claudia, etc have a way of both attracting and repelling the reader, in the end I found most of the characters in this series to be simply repellent. Rice still writes in a wonderful style, but these characters worse than left me cold-- they often disgusted me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it. Thousands of pages wasted on those Mayfair witches","review":"I couldn't believe how quickly the storyline crashed after the first book of this trilogy, The Witching Hour . The prose got so purple and convoluted, I wanted to scream. I was thrilled when the author decided to abandon these dopey incestuous witches and got back to the vampires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Another heaping helping of Mayfair witches, spirits, and incest. Rowan has vanished, and a precocious teenaged Mayfair witch appears in this book. She goes after Rowan's husband, and Lasher kidnaps her and gets her pregnant multiple times, finally resulting in a child.Some scientific investigating shows Rowan is a freak, so Lasher's plan to pump his seed into all the Mayfair witches may not do much, as the reason he was successful with Rowan was because of her mutant nature.Not a lot of point to this, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Considering previous novels; disappointing","review":"I have had the pleasure of reading the Vampire Chronicles, Cry to Heaven, and Sevant of the Bones. I feel Anne Rice is a wonderful writer with enthralling descriptive powers. To put it simply, Lasher was a disappointment. I didn't bother finishing the last 1/4 of the book.I would also have no problem using the word \\"drivel\\" in my description of this book. While Rice is an excellent writer, consider some of her other books for your choice of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasher was good because there as ACTION it... less DETAIL!","review":"Since I think Anne Rice goes horribly overboard with her million paragraph descriptions, this book worked well with me. There was a lot of action in this book, and even if there were times when there was tons of \\"detail\\" paragraphs, it didn't take from the book like it did in Taltos. The middle of the book was fast paced and interesting. Sometimes, I wanted to 'kick Lasher's ass!\\" But in the end, of course, I felt bad for the poor creature, as I did for Emaleth.This book was a pretty good read, interesting and intriguing at the same time. I liked it overall.Read it.(P.S.) Don't we all wish we were so developed like Mona Mayfair is as 13. Then we'd be sooo \\"popular!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it - you'll love it!!","review":"It is quite a rare occurrence for a sequel to be anything near as good as the original, but in Lasher, Anne Rice has exceeded all expectations.Once again, strong, believable characters are foremost. Rice's descriptive powers sparkle and will dazzle, captivate and intrigue any reader.Whilst Lasher is \`self-contained' I would recommend reading The Witching Hour first, if only to get to grips with what Lasher is and how he came into being, and also to understand the complexities of the incestuous Mayfair family itself.Anne does it again - a fantastic novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"I loved the whole series of books. This is a great bridge between the first and third books. I recommend this highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Half the time you never knew which character was the voice she was using to narrate. The story line was importantly carried from Book 1, however she got so lost in describing details of an area , a house, a conversation, that the reader just gets lost and closes the book. I tried to get a refund for Lasher and Taltos, but I had lost the time window for returns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"Fantastic!!!!! In my opinion, Anne Rice is the greatest author of all time!!! I have read everything she has written, and love every book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book she has ever written !","review":"A mere attempt of a poor copy of \\"The Witching Hour\\". Lengthy, boring, flat characters,strory drags on.Juliens recounts most of what the readers already knew from \\"The Withing Hour\\" and describes himself as a troubled soul (which is hardly believable, by the way).Wait for the movie and please ponder seriously whether you are going to watch it or not, but don't read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy attempt at historical validation of fantasy.","review":"After \\"The Witching Hour\\" those that hunger to know the fate of Michael and his abducted-seducted wife will find that the wonderful, brooding sensual quality of that novel is not to be found in this half-hearted tale centered upon Lasher's rebirth as a physical being.This is merely a dry effort, spent perhaps for the contract terms Rice may suffer under, but that is not an excuse for a work which has no real depth, no terror, no eroticism, and only minimal character development.Through even the Sleeping Beauty series, Rice was able to sustain something of the \\"weaver of tales\\" I have come to expect of her works. Unfortunately, the tapestry she normally weaves seems to have unravelled this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"a boring read","review":"i tried to read this a few years ago and it made me yawn more than it made me want to save it to my book collection. it seemed to drag on and on through the pages. i threw it out when i moved because i was so unattached to it to keep it. i wouldn't buy in the future to read it. i love Anne Rice books but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious. Rambling.","review":"This book reads like a first draft in need of EXTENSIVE editing. I finally threw in the towel after 150 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely dreadful! Rice at her ...worst!","review":"This book should never had been written. The plot is so dreadful that my temporary suspension of disbelief positively snapped! The series started high, Anne Rice at her best, but her creativity began to dry up and her characters became cartoon characters by this point. Finishing this book was an unbearable chore and was similar to a seven-course meal prepared by a bungling chef who cannot read a recipe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definatly a let down","review":"I give this story 2 stars cause I havent finished it yet and It has been a week. (I have alot of time to read) This is not what I expected since the withching hour was so good. The book is long and drawn out in places where I have actually skipped pages skimming for important information and not lost the story at all. I will finish it just cause I am dying to know what happens. But I am not sure I will read Taltos. I am afraid of being let down again. Anne Rice is such a good writer and this is definatly one of her weakest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I've read and enjoyed all of Ann Rice's vampire books, but the Mayfair books are so boooooring and tedious that I couldn't finish this one. It goes on and on and on with various personal histories, explanations of individual family members. Interspersed among the longwinded tedious trivia are a few moments of something happening, but even those are usually hard to comprehend. Toward the end Lasher forces us to listen to his long-winded explanation of his life. How he came to be in control of the Mayfair home is a mystery that happens in some incomprehensible half page. By then I was so bored that I put it down and haven't gotten back to it. Read it if you're a really dedicated Rice fan willing to endure endless punishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sequel","review":"A rare occurence of a sequel being almost as good as its predecessor. Lasher returns to haunt the Mayfairs, only this time he's in the flesh, and as deadly as ever. Now he's frantically trying to find the Mayfair women who can bear his child, leaving a trail of death in his wake. Readers who loved Rice's richly detailed chronicle of the Mayfairs' history in The Witching Hour will relish Julien's ghostly narrative of his struggles with Lasher and Lasher's own tale of disillusionment and desperation. More suspenseful than The Witching Hour, this book gave me nightmares one night the first time I read it, something that almost never happens to me! Excellent, although not quite as good as The Witching Hour (my personal Rice favorite), but better than Taltos, the third book in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an editor, badly","review":"Anne Rice's greatest strength has always been her colourful writing, her lavish imagery, and her descriptive prowess. Her greatest weakness has always been the recycling of character traits from book to book (one suspects these are merely traits of Ms. Rice herself) and never coming up with anything new or interesting. She is seemingly incapable of creating ugly or interesting characters, preferring them to be beautiful, brilliant, and ultimately one-dimensional.All of these problems are painfully present in Lasher and obfuscate what might have been a really clever story. The characters of Rowan, Michael, Julien and Mona were ridiculous and laughable and made it impossible to take this book seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read!","review":"Pointless, ridiculous plot. Awful characters. I can't believe I read the entire book. I've read some book that were long and started out weak, but eventually got better. I kept hoping this would happen for Lasher, but it never did. Don't waste your time with this book. This book should have never been published. This book wasted 4 days of my life"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"At first, Anne rice wrote beautiful, evocative, books. Then she became famous. This book was endless and rambling and could have been much better if the editor had had the guts to edit it. Don't waste your money. If you must waste your time, get it at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"All out of Nyquil? Try reading this book....","review":"This was the shoddiest, most disorganized and ill conceived piece of drivel that I have read since rereading my junior high diary. Only a deep sense of injustice and groundless hope that the end would justify the means kept me reading through to the disappointing and absurd conclusion. Rice created an interesting and intriguing world in 'Cry to Heaven\\" - she is capable of fine writing - but \\"Lasher\\" is an insult to her loyal readers as well as any unsuspecting citizen who picks up a copy of this book. Who would have believed that a book about demons, ghosts, murder, wealth, sex, and breastfeeding could be so numbingly dull?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, Ann Rice, why do you make me suffer????","review":"This secuel of \\"The Witching Hour\\" turns to be an excellent book of intrigue and horror, even when this book is not so good as the fist one, but it's understandable because this is a secuel, this is the one when the story becomes monstrous and cruel in all aspects, I am amazed of the capability of Ann Rice to dig in the most inner fears of human beeing and turn them into an unable to stop reading plot. If you think you don't have the stomach to deal with a book that will keep you in suspense, that will make you feel impotent and disgusted, then don't read it, because when Ann Rice wants to twist your guts she'll do it in the most crude and yet elegant way.Anyway, you have to read this book if you read \\"The Witching Hour\\" because neither of both books have sense if you don't read the other, including the third part of them called \\"Taltos\\", so, you have a decent trilogy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasher...","review":"This book is absolutley awesome. If you like Anne Rice, you'll love this. I read all three of the witch cronicles in two days. Set some time aside for this book because once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Absolute ..., and as far fetched as they come. What a disappointment after The Witching Hour! The series began with a sexy mysterious spirit following the generations of Mayfair Witches through the years(loved the concept). By the second book it was suddenly about a five thousand year old GUMBY! This series made The Vampire Chronicles read like an Almanac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trumped up atmosphere","review":"I wanted to read a book with New Orleans atmosphere. Instead I got a book with kiddie porn in it. Sorry--I do not find the sexual escapades of 13 year old girls with their older uncles and uncles-in-law especially erotic. The ending was laughable. I enjoyed INTERVIEW but the rest of this stuff is just Bodice rippers with horror thrown in. If I want New Orleans I'll stick with James Sallis and Rebecca West."},{"rating":"2","title":"She brought me in and left me cackiling for more","review":"This book exceeded my expectations and only made me grin as I read on as Lasher stalked the Mayfair women. Basically, a damn fine sequel. One that I recommend...okay...throw and shove into people's faces. Nah...just the first book. They can buy their own. Great...fantastic...speechless."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive, engaging, highly recommended historical novel","review":"Freedom Ships is an exciting and informative historical novel about African Americans who managed to go back to Africa in 1820 to find the freedom denied them in America decades before the Emancipation. Based on a neglected chapter in America's history, elements of the Freedom Ships narrative are reconstructed from emigrant letters, diaries, official reports in the Library of Congress, and U.S. Navy and Congressional archives. A highly recommended and engaging novel, Robert Carey and John Furbay have successfully collaborated to write an epic story of freed slaves who dare to risk all dangers in a vast and unknown continent so that their children could escape the inhuman bondage and overwhelming racial prejudice of slave era America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring with a capital B","review":"Anjani is a Hawaiin born beauty, with a soulful, beautiful voice. She's refered to as the musician's singer because of her tone and beautiful voice. Very true and there is no denying that. The problem with her album is that it is so so so BORING! I think there are more interesting songs she could sing to make her album better, and by better I don't mean more mainstream, although I am suprised she's a Sony/BMG artist. She does not show any versatility AT ALL. It just does not exist, so every song sounds the same as the one prior. She does have a great voice, so maybe she can find her niche, something entertaining that will take our breaths away, instead of putting us all to sleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mistake","review":"I will say first off that I am no jazz expert, if this is what female vocal jazz is than I was looking for the wrong stuff. I was looking for something laid back where I could sit and talk with my date while we drank a manhattan and overheard chatter from the other tables and glasses clinking in a smokey bar where a woman in a red dress sang on stage with a small band behind her and you could snap your fingers and listen to her seductive voice and the drummer tapping his cymbals with a brush....but boy was I wrong on this album. I think my biggest problem is the samples sound nice and so I bought it, but the lyrics to the songs are horrible, and none of them are catchy. I couldn't find one song to add to my laid back collection. I would say stay away from this unless you like songs that are so boring it makes you want to go mow the lawn or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Anjani sings these songs like they're a part of her life. She has a beautiful contralto and perfect phrasing for these lyrics. And the backing music (mainly piano and drums, played by her) is subtle and tasteful -- not too bland, not too intrusive -- just right. Quite unlike most of Leonard Cohen's own albums, though you can sort of imagine Leonard's voice in the background. I wish she and Leonard would redo 2000's \\"Ten New Songs\\": Sharon Robinson was good as a backup singer but marred it with her incredibly cheesy synthesiser accompaniments...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too mellow","review":"I can feel Leonard Cohen's signature all over this release, but for me, Anjani was a little too mellow. I guess as background music it would be alright, but frankly for me, I found it a little depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I love Leonard Cohen's music, and Anjani's voice, coupled with his inspiration, is refreshing and beautiful. I'm delighted with this music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me sleepy","review":"I won't say that this singer is bad, and I'm sure she appeals to many people, but I found her music too slow, very syruppy and without passion. I bought this CD because I'm a Madeleine Peyroux fan and this artist was compared to her but they have nothing in common, that I can tell, other than sharing the same songs occasionally. Again, I'm sure many other people would enjoy this album, but not enough soul for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Alert","review":"AnjaniBlue AlertSony LegacyFor years people wondered who the new Dylan would be. Funny, nobody wondered who the new Leonard Cohen would be. Well for those of you who even silently wondered, former Cohen background singer and now creative partner Anjani makes a gorgeous debut with Blue Alert, an album of Cohen's lyrics set to jazz-based piano arrangements.Minutes into the CD you feel as if you are inside a NYC jazz club. The night outside is miles away and you want to spend the night with her. You forget yourself and tomorrow may never come.

Unfortunately, I never received the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow for my two-year-old.","review":"My two-year-old is already adept with a mouse and enjoys games like \\"Blue's Birthday\\" and \\"Sesame Street Letters.\\" The slow pace of this game, long narrations, and the fact that he only has to scroll-over pictures and not click on them are very frustrating to him. He really wants to play with Pooh, but it just makes him angry.I was especially disapointed with the foreign language section. Instead of using a total-immersion method such as introducing a new friend who speaks to children only in the foreign language, Rabbit operates a translator machine. Words go in in English and come out (quite a while later) in Spanish. No explanation is given, and the child is left wondering why Rabbit is using nonsense words.I don't recommend this to any child with computer abilities. They will find it boring at best, frustrating at worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it's great.","review":"I wasn't going to introduce my 19 month old Granddaughter to thecomputer until she was two.

I liked the way the author discussed the camera and enjoyed his opinions.The photographs of the cameras taken with the old cameras was, to me, an excellent idea and really showed what these cameras are still capable of.I personally did not mind the authors personal photography and actually found them useful in comparing the variosu qualities of the cameras discussed. I think it is extremely unfair to be judgemental about someones photograph it all eye of the beholder really isn't it!If you like using or collecting old SLR's then you can't really NOT have this book.My only complaint; The softcover copy book that I bought the spine started to split and the cover has almost fallen off after a few days of intensive reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A striking insight into today's life in the USA","review":"To learn American way of life through the eyes of an onlooker is a wonderful opportunity Kafka provides for the readers of the book. It is funny and sad, gentle and harsh, full of hope and despair. The book is not just about Karl Rossman, a young European who is sent away to America for his misbehaviour. The book is about the roots of the present-day America, its attitudes, ways of life, etiquette and its relationship with the rest of the world. Kafka never visited America in his lifetime, but he carried out an extensive study on the country. What he found out in the course of this study gives us a lot to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"like dickens, only by kafka","review":"This first novel is incomplete and was never intended for publication. It isn't funny, it isn't fun, and it certainly isn't very original. Kafka wrote it as an exercise and that is all it should be. Upon reading it carefully, I can only conclude that perhaps it should not have been published as it simply doesn't stand up to this master's best work. As such it is really only of interest to scholars.Basically, it follows the journey through America of a clueless twit into a variety of catastrophic misadventures, from getting a maid pregnant without even understanding he was committing a sexual act to losing job after job in New York and environs. While it does have some of the bizarre atmospherics that Kafka later perfected, the themes in it are not of the timeless horror and angst that later marked Kafka as a peculiar genius.Skip it and go on to The Trial or The Castle. If you don't know Kafka, start with Metamorphosis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished First Novel","review":"This novel was unfinished and needed some cleaning up. We never learn how he comes to leave Robinson and Delamarche, for instance, or whatever becomes of his money the manageress is holding for him. It is obvious that the work was not ready for publication. That said, for those who are interested in reading Kafka the book is light and amusing at times. But overall, the situations Karl finds himself in are often frustratingly impossible and the characters are not well developed. Karl, the main character makes an excellent argument for the Stoker in Chapter One, but can't seem to find words for his own defense at the Hotel. There are enough inconsistancies to drive an analytical reader crazy and probably Kafka wouldn't have allowed publication in this unfinished form."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've all come to look for America....","review":"Franz Kafka's 'Amerika' started off, to me, with a great premise, but in the end I found the tale less than entertaining.Karl Rossman, a teenage boy shipped off to America by his parents following an 'indiscretion' with a servant girl, finds himself in the company of an American uncle, who quickly shuns him for accepting the hospitality of one of the uncle's friends.Rossman then 'disappears' into the poor working class landscape of America, where he encounters many less than scrupulous characters.Much of this novel is devoted to the this 'disappearance', though the action, to me, never quite moved along...and made the story quite stale to me...While I have not read any other works by Franz Kafka, I hope that other novels were better paced and executed. His prose is enjoyable, just not very 'lively' in this offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kafka:The mental Traveller","review":"Kafka never set foot in America, Yes, it's true. He writes however quite valiantly about the American lifestyle of the era in a manner that suggests that he had been there. As far as importance, this novel might not rank high up there in terms of the Kafka canon, but it is perfect for those who have just started. If you've never read Kafka, read this book first, and then move on to anything else-- you will literally feel yourself falling off a literary cliff. There are reocurring instances where the main character precariously falls into the most atrocious situations, of which he has no control. Trust me, you'll be hitting yourself over the head, this is a fairly comical book, and only a pit stop for other things to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read","review":"This was an interesting read for me.

But, I love faith, although everyone in my household was in love with Mary j Blidge Ghetto fab style, faith has a old-skool gospel soul to her voice, and she critique it with perfection. She has style grace and hip hop flare that has constantly put her in a riff battle between Mary J Bilge, and truth is I believe that Faith Evans deserve a title If Aretha Franklin is called the Queen Of Rock and Roll, and Mary the Queen of Soul, than Faith Evans is the Queen Of Hip hop and R&B. She is further than a level of princess she is truly a Goddess. Let's all be Real had PIDDY met her first faith would have been given the entitled Queen Of hip and R&B over Mary, but it just so happen PUFFY met Faith second."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"I have been a Faith fan since her 1st cd! I was very excited to buy this cd, mainly because I saw The Making of The First Lady on BET. It was interesting. It previewed her and some of the producers and gave insight on the reason for writing and adding the songs on this album. Sometimes when we hear their perspective and reasoning behind a song, we can understand it better or feel the artist's vibe. She also mentioned that she tried new styles of singing and mentioned that she is trying new things and trying grow as an artist. I can appreciate that from her, she's with a new label and giving her fan's a variety. My favorites are: 1, 2, 4, 8, and 13. By the cd, you will really enjoy it! I meant to give this 5 stars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Taking Her Place","review":"The title of this album is very appropriate. Her past releases were all solid and great R&B; albums, but this CD goes to another level. The production is together, the lyrics, and her vocals are smoother and better than before. I can relate to every song on this album and I am happy that Faith didn't give up and kept going. I recommend this to everyone who loves a good R&B; album. The standout tracks are:1. Again2. I Don't Need It3. Mesmerized4. Stop N Go"},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith Evans is definitely the First Lady!!!!","review":"What a great album!!! Her voice is phenomenal. Every song is a classic.

Faith Evans at her finest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"Faith must have had quite a bit of pressure on her after an album instantly declared as her best ever, Faithfully. While this album is not as great as that album, it is still very nice. Her vocals are great, and so is the production and songwriting. The first eight tracks or so are all excellent. At the end, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. The best tracks are \\"Again,\\" \\"Mesmerize,\\" and \\"Tru Love.\\" I recommend buying this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"faiths best work","review":"every song on here is tight, only problem is why is \\"hope\\" on here, instead a faith song should replace that, please buy this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool to Cruise Too.","review":"Its been awhile for Faith but her Cd is really cool More Laidback than previous releases. Goin Out is a cool club Banger that will have the Dance floors buzzin,Again is my favorite cut from the Cd its really different from the host of R&B songs that are out there today, she even speaks upon catching a case Down in ATL and how the Media blows everything up. All and All The Cd is cool and definately worth having. I think that My one Gripe is I wish that she would have put the song that she did with Gospel recording Artist Donald Lawrence on her Cd, The title of that Song is Say a Prayer for Me and Faith absolutely Kills it on this Song.This would have made her CD over the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh! faith!","review":"I didn't want to pass on this effort; which would be my first with faith! Faith spoke to me a while back at the BET tribute to patti labelle! Which this shouldn,t be a surprize there was always something in that voice that just pulled at me. I think what it was, was pain; which in some artists cases brings about fine art and that's just what this is! The stand out tune to me is \\"stop n go\\" ; that song is a BAD MUTHA F*CKA; as is \\"i don't need it\\"! the girl got her stuff right and came on with it! if she keeps this up that she'll hit the Diva scale; which i hope she does'nt because that label seems to distort the talent, value, and potential of the artist!

Couple of songs are worth listening to such as \\"Again\\", and \\"True Love\\". There is something major missing on this album, and that might just be good songs! I know she could have came way better than this, comparing it to her past cds. To me it didn't showcase her true potential and its just a bunch of filler songs with not much that stands out. Close to the worst album I have bought in the past 6 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to do this,but","review":"these 2 stars represent the only 2 songs I like on this cd.Faith you are a great vocalist,but I wanted you to take it a step up as far as your vocals.This material does not allow you to show what you can really do.I know alot of people like the little sing along songs,but some of us like the real singing on the cd.Faith is like the Karen Clark Sheard of r&b to me,but this cd did not do it for me at all.I hope you put out a gospel cd that way you she can let loose on music."},{"rating":"2","title":"she's done it!","review":"I just love Faith Evans. She has such a great voice! And now she's done it, she made the album with songs that are worthy of her talent. I hope she will get the recognition she deserves this time around. She is definitely one of the best r&b; / soul singers and her sound is classic, yet fresh.Stand-out tracks are:* Goin' Out.A funky club-jam, produces by the Neptunes. This works very well for Faith and could be a big hit.* Again.Faith's testimony; flawless! This was the first hitsingle.* I Don't Need It.This has a classic feel, thanks to the used sample by the Jones Girls. Very well done!* Stop N Go.A terrific slow-jam with crazy vocals!* Mesmerized.The best track on the album! This is so funky and the vocals are so on point. I love it!* Lucky Day.Also has a classic feel to it and works very well for Faith.There's no doubt that Faith lives up to her title of The First Lady.

It doesn't seem as if the same energy and creativity that was displayed in her first album made it to this one. I really think she has fallen off. What's with these artists today? They rhyme a couple of catchy lines over a studio-originated beat and think it's a hit. Faith and others like her need to take a class and find out what REAL music is. She should take notes from Erykah Badu, Gladys Knight, Maze, Donny Hathaway, etc., and try to make music of substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper!!!!","review":"I was surprised that it got bad reviews!

Her older stuff wasn't like this, this is really funky, & repetitious . Where's the deep bass romantic ballads, the lovers hooks, and the hip hop cameo's?

Her Albums have always beent he same.She never gets enough depth Lyrically&the Production can be Hit&Miss.She was the Link Between Mary J.Bliege&Jennifer Lopez in Puffy's Musical Landscape&this is where it gets crazy. She is a better Vocalist than Both,but She lacks Mary's Emotion,Feeling&Vibe to Connect. she lacks J-Lo's ability at connecting on a Groove. Faith isn't a Robotic Artist but She also at times lacks Musical personality which makes Her better served at doing Hooks for other Artists or Writing as to her own stuff. she is gonna be One of those Artists that will have a Pretty Good Run,but never reaches Her full Musical Potential because alot of what she does is cool for the Moment but it doesn't have enough Personality.this Album suffers that same no Pun Intended Faith.

I was expecting so much because her last album Faithfully was her best, and the lead-off single, \\"Again\\", was her best single yet. But my expectations were left unfulfilled.The only decent songs on here are \\"Again\\" and \\"Mesmerized.\\" That is it. The rest of this album is uninspired, lackluster material like \\"Tru Love\\", \\"Get Over You\\" and \\"Lucky Day.\\" But nothing can compare to the shameful, redundant, throwout track from the Neptunes, \\"Goin' Out.\\"This CD has lame lyrics, mediocre production, okay vocals and poor writing.

We need to snatch that title away from her and give it to Ashanti because I believe she's the one who ushered in the new sound of RnB that other ladies are trying to imitate but fail.Their was none on this album except for 3 songs that were just decent. The music was just horrible. People are saying this is a classic album? No sir it is not. If you wanna hear a classic album, THATS ACTUALLY GOOD, go listen to Amerie- Touch. Thats a REAL R&B; album right there."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLOP","review":"I feel bad because there is something about Faith that I really like.

Its different but different doesn't mean bad. I think she displays growth on this CD, she needed to pull in a myriad of people. I love the CD. I have my doubts about the commercial success of the album, but its a definite getter/keeper. I have tweet's CD- and I loved Tweet's first CD but the current one sucks-- Faith CD is a better choice of the two, if you have the money buy both if not buy Ms. Evans.I love \\"Until You Came\\"- this is some good \\"ish\\" \\"Stop and Go\\" is fun Ever Wonder is familiar, \\"Again\\" is a hit and Goin Out is maybe a club banger-- remix -- \\"Tru Love\\" is good stuff 2"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this Album....And I am 25","review":"No I am not 16 or 17, I will tell you that I enjoy this whole album.

This is NOT the album for you if you want the \\"same ole Faith\\" the one with all the love ballads and quiet storm love making themes. It is a feel good CD. Yes, there are songs relating to love but not like her 1st CD. Faith has once again made it irrefutably clear that she has the voice and talent that many of these so-called singers such as Beyonce, Ashanti, and Ciara do NOT have. The afore mentioned people aren't even worthy of polishing Faith's dusty Ferragamo's when it comes to singing, yet their albums have went multi-platinum thanks to smart marketing and good music machines.

This CD was a departure from the smooth style that everyone came to know and love from Faith. Only three songs on the CD are worth downloading, but I wouldn't buy the entire album, unless I found it really cheap. The good songs from this CD are \\"True love,\\" \\"Again\\" and \\"Hopeful,\\" which is actually really Twista's song, and was out for nearly a year before Faith's CD came out. \\"Mesmorized\\" it okay, but the remix with Nas, which is the better version, isn't on the CD. Instead, they have some hyper sounding dance remix, which is worse than the original. All the other songs sound like they should be on the soundtrack to some late 70's or early 80's movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Faith's Best Talent","review":"I could not wait for her new album to be released-and boy am I disappointed. Faith Evans is an excellent vocalist and songwriter,so I can't believe the work she just put out...put or thrown together is what I should say.

I thought everyone was about to really see who Faith Evans is. Was I wrong. This is cd lacks SUBSTANCE! She sings about STRAIGHT BS.... Faith Evans can sing true enough, but it takes more than great vocals to be successful in the music business. Faith hasn't had a very successful career because she makes BS songs like \\"love like this before\\" \\"Burning Up\\" \\"All Night Long\\" WTF are you talking about. Everybody talking about how great of a writer she is, I beg to differ. There are no really deep lyrical songs on this CD. Faith isn't a pop artist so she should leave the pop songs alone (going out).

And until she can break THAT standard, she's still less than mediocre.For those bashing the Coach Carter song that is the ONLY song saving this CD. The beat is great, Twista is always great, and Faith's vocals are smooth and even, unlike that \\"Again\\" song. It's so good I downloaded it alone.Faith, i'm sorry to say this, but you're only good when some rapper is flowing and you're just singing the hook.

She is then betrothed to Petruchio, who uses the 'cruel to be kind' method to try to change Katharina's personality by being cruel and uncompromising towards her. In the end it ultimately works, and Katharina becomes more subtle, respectful, and ultimately falls in love w/ Petruchio.It is a great play by Shakespeare, very humorous (with a genius use of sarcasm wit and puns), and it is one of his more rewarding plays on many levels. Not only is it a pleasure to read, but the theme of the story, by transforming a shrew into a better person, is very positive, a relief from the darker subjects Shakespeare used in his more famous plays (i.e. Romeo & Juliet)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing drama!","review":"I acted in this play for my school spring play.

Shakespeare uses love in this play to set up many comical situations. It is a nice change of pace from the traditional Shakespearian love tragedy which we have all been subjected to. This book is easily related to by teens. I personally related to the two suitors for Bianca. They both wanted her more than anything and were forced to wait because of a shrewd sister and an overbearing father. This was one book that I had no problem sitting down, reading, and enjoying on my own time. This book is a necesity for all high school literature classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shakespeare Play!","review":"I love The Taming of the Shrew! I'm not big on Shakespeare to begin with (I can't say I'm an expert by any means) but I could read Taming over and over again. At first it was a little disgusting--me being female--but after digging deeper I really fell in love with it. The witty humor that Shakespeare offers is fabulous and the outlandish Petruchio makes it for me! Him and his lusty wench! Kate. I've watched a couple different movie versions, as well as the modern 10 Things I Hate About You, and it never gets old. In this specific version of the book I like how all of the characters with a small description of each are listed in the beginning. The critic reviews in the back of the book were great as well. They were able to be used as test/essay questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read","review":"THE TAMING OF THE SHREW is not Shakespeare's best, most clever work.

Los que realmente quieren conocer a Zoe les recomiendo este album (en mi opinion es mejor que el segundo (Memorex Comender y El Corazon Atomico de la Via Lactea) o tercero (Reptilectric) album de la banda. En el album Memorex Comender y El Corazon Atomico de la Via Lactea la musica es movedisa al principio y poco a poco es mas y mas relagante.

Yeah, everyone grieves differently, I know, but that doesn't mean Cynthia Rylant had to let her characters mope around dismally.

Boring! It's also unclear. You can never tell if he saw these visions or not. And the book jumps from one thing to another so you can never figure out what's happening. Unclear! Boring! Pathetic! This is deffinatly the worst book I've read. And believe me, it is hard for a book to get a one from me. The book has to be absoluetly pathetic for that to happen. And this book is.

I kept expecting something to happen soon but then I realized I was on the last few pages and it was still nothing. Please take my advice because I read a lot and I know about books. Even if you still want to read it, check it out from the library because it's too short to be worth the money. For a GOOD book about death, I reccommend WALK TWO MOONS.

Her happiness is short lived when tragedy strikes her life and book gives us a view of what it is like for a young person to cope with death.

I had to read this for school, and like many other students, we kept nagging our teacher about how great this book is and about how we wish we could read it again (as if she would waste school time doing that). Ah, the art of sucking up for a good grade.Now even if the story was bad, the length or content's writing style could have been better to keep us interested.

Throughout the book, these two search for a way to deal with their grief. Along their troubled road comes Crazy Cletus Underwood, who in his on way helps these two deal with their loss.

Any one would love the characters Rylant creates. There are times when I laughed out loud, and times there was a tear in my eye. I recommend it to anyone.

If this is nice, I wouldn't want to know what bad is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adults consider it a great read for kids. Kids..don't.","review":"It seems that no one but adults liked this book. The kids or young adults thought it--well lets just say that most would recommend it only to someone who was either eight years old, or someone who was was hated and in need of sufficient torture. Adults, it seems to me that you guys probably didn't like it so much, but thought that kids would like it. And it is the neverending tradition of adults to think kids to be younger and dumber than they really are. This book will be enjoyable to kids? Maybe eight year olds and six year olds will like it, but certainly no one older. Kids, pick your own books and take a good look at the adult recommended books before reading them. My review probably won't do anything to stop you from reading it. The reviews didn't for me.

I found it to be a wonderful story about the love given to a young orphan girl, Summer, by older relatives Ob and May. It also told of the love between Ob and May and how Ob came through the grieving process. Although it's not filled with action, there is a story about caring and giving.

I had to force myself to read it, and now it is shoved out of my sight and under the bed.I overlook Newbury awards now.

Vince Majestyk is an Arizona melon grower who rather unwisely incurs the wrath of a professional killer. It's a story of cat and mouse that rapidly changes to one of cat and cat.This is a solidly written novel, which I'd have to characterize as a lesser work of the Leonard canon. The dialogue, as we've come to expect from Leonard, rings very true. Quirky characters and off the wall situations, staples of the author's best fiction, do not play much of a role here.Mr. Majestyk is an easy, enjoyable read. But it is not the unique brand of writing that accounts for Elmore Leonard's stellar reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but a waste of money","review":"I bought 8 of these cards in various designs for my friends dogs and my own at Xmas.

Van Damme is like three feet tall, with an accent more syrupy than a chain of waffle houses (to paraphrase Mike Nelson) He does not deserve to be enriched, complimented, or even *tolerated*. Even Hollywood is catching on to this.Admittedly, I'm a horror movie fan, and loathe action movies.

The police appear impotent to stop the stalker and Susannah must try to discover who the murderer is to not only solve her sister's death but to prevent her own.THE NIGHTSPINNERS is a good solid suspense novel. Well paced and scary enough to keep the pages flying. However, if a reader is well read in this genre, there is a strong sense of deja vu in that the plot seems to lack originality.

I have found that Linksys support is generally good, although they do have spotty coverage from time to time. The waits are actually much shorter now than 12 months ago. For my installation, I have had many problems installing a home Phoneline, but believe that the problem is mostly driven by bad wiring in my home. My advice is to stay single vendor (i.e all Linksys). Although the vendors say that all units are compatible, I have not found this to be the case. Also, stay at a single speed (1.0MBPS or 10.0, but not mixed), as I also found that vendor claims of interoperability were not true. Again, this may all be due to interference and/or bad wiring unique to my home, but who knows. When the network works, it works beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a prototype","review":"The idea behind the HPRO200 is a good one. Functionally it is a bridge between ethernet and home phoneline subnetworks combined with a router. The firewall features of the router give good protection against attempts to infect the attached computers with viruses, etc. If you are not already familiar with router and firewall functions, be prepared to spend some time experimenting with the various parameters in the process of learning how to configure the router for your needs.But the HPRO200 with firmware version 1.37.4 is not as reliable as one could and should expect. In my home network, the HPRO200 drops the network connection between the ethernet and the phoneline subnetworks much too often, sometimes after only half a day of operation. Having to reset the unit so often is annoying.My recommendation is to wait with your purchase until a later firmware version that corrects at least this problem is available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product, SHORT LIFE!","review":"I used to think Linksys was the name to use for solid networking products. This product has changed my mind. I bought an HPRO200 when it was first introduced and it took me only a few minutes to get multiple computers up and running on a peer-to-peer network with a mixture of ethernet and hpna, all using a cable modem and sharing files. All was well for about 8 months. That is when it locked up and died. Linksys support told me to purchase a new one and they would send me a new, sealed unit that I could take back for a refund. What I got was a reconditioned unit and power supply in an unlabeled box. No refunds for me! Fine... I got over it and loaned the reconditioned one to a friend. Yesterday, 7 months after buying it, the new one locked up just like the first one. There is no way I could possibly recommend that anyone buy the HPRO200. And, with the way I was treated by the support team I can't recommend the Linksys label, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Nicks and Cuts?

I have been using this product for over 3-4 years after a dermatologist recommended it. You use a quarter size amount to cover your wet face. Note: this does not make a big lather... just coats the face. The results is the smoothest shave with your face feeling super with all that Aloe! Be sure to use a good razor (2-3 blade type). To finish, use Johnson & Johnson \\"Purpose\\" Face Cream as an aftershave (with SPF15). It never burns and feels great!

There is not much dialogue between the characters just alot of JL explaining what is going on and what the characters are feeling (very descriptive). I felt I couldn't connect with the characters because I wasn't waiting with bated breath to see what they had to say.

It was strongly recommended by a good friend. A few years later I read a \\"cliff notes\\" type summary of \\"The Sheik\\" by E.M. Hull. The plot of the Hull novel paralelled the plot of Ms. Lindsey's novel. Cosidering that E.M. Hull's novel was voted the \\"Best Novel of 1925\\", there is no question of which came first. Save your money and buy a real classic, \\"the Sheik\\" by E.M. Hull"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the other negative reviews, the real reason this book is bad....","review":"I just finished Captive Bride and felt compelled to write a quick review. I don't know what the negative reviewers are talking about when they say there are rapes and beatings. Definite reading comprehension problems. Lindsey makes it CLEAR that the heroine is NOT raped, not even once. This is definitely the \\"forced seduction\\" category. And, if I recall correctly, the Hero spanks the heroine once (slaps her behind five times). No, the real problem with this book is that it's just not well written. The characters are like paper cut-outs. We're talking very little depth. And when action does occur (which is rare), it is so shallow that it is completely unsatisfying. Also, a great deal of the limited action results from neither of the protagonists being particularly bright. Captive Bride reads more like an outline than a real book. My recommendation is to skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply HORRIBLE!","review":"Thank Goodness I have read other Johanna Lindsey books and know her capabilities, or I should question her publisher's sanity in publishing this. I couldn't relate to the characters at all; Christina starts out hating Philip, then he whisks her away to the desert and in about one day's time, she's violently in love with him. Philip has no redeeming qualities, he comes off as selfish, arrogant, and cold. And the plot...well, let's just say it leaves much to be desired. I couldn't finish the book, it was THAT boring, completely devoid of suspense, passion, or love. If you want to read Johanna Lindsey, read Tender Rebel or Gentle Rogue, don't bother with this one...otherwise you might never read her books again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy!","review":"Well I wouldn't use it as kindling because I don't believe in burning books but it is a lousy book.FYI: A a woman getting spanked by her man is degrading anywhere!I doubt a middle Eastern woman would shout with joy, yippee my man just spanked me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd be better off reading one of her more recent books","review":"I read this book after reading some of her more recent books. I just about put it down after every chapter. It is obviously her first book because it is written poorly.

I suggest reading her more recent books where her writing is more mature and the storyline is developed better."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Johanna Lindsey's worst books","review":"I believe this is JL's very first book, therefore the poor story line and so-called love story can be excused. This book is so boring that I could fall asleep on it, the storyline is extremely unrealistic and I cannot begin to see how they fell in love with eachother other than great sex, which I think is in poor taste.

Additionally, the plot is an insult to the reader and to the romance genre. I get that it was written 30 years ago, but that doesn't excuse the bad writing or weak plot. I stuck with it for a few chapters, but when the \\"heroine\\" is fighting off the \\"hero's\\" sexual advances and then capitulates two seconds later with \\"take me, Philip\\", I was done. That this book is enjoying a new release on bookshelves is disturbing and ridiculous, no matter who wrote it or what she has written since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captive Bride","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. There wasn't one redeeming quality about Philip! What a creep! As if any woman would want to be with him! He treated Christina abominably and she loves him! He spanks her and constantly threatens to beat her! And then when she does get away from him, he threatens to take her child? Please!!! I couldn't wait till the book was over.

To actually think this book is romantic is unbelievable! Some better adjectives to describe it? Asinine, farfetched, tortured, and just plain terrible! The characters are ludicrous and difficult to relate with. The hero of the book is a rapist who continually rapes and beats this poor woman, who actually considers herself lucky!

It seemed to me the characters went to fast. One minute Christina hates Philip, then the next she can't live without him.

I noticed that in a lot of Johanna Lindsey's earlier books the narration is flat, the characters two-dimensional, the men are barbarians, and the women insipid, and completely moronic for all of their amazing beauty (and they are all incredibly beautiful *rolling eyes*). Her first book is no exception. This book was horrible. Phillip only made me hate him more as the book progressed, I never liked Christina but became so annoyed with her by the end that I couldn't take it. Half way through the story I got online to see what the reviews of the book were, and most were horrible. At more then one point in the story I actually threw the book I was so irritated. This is story telling at its worst!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"There are many that did not like this book, however, I liked it.

In the end I got exactly what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"I must say that I loved this book. Some readers have been dissapointed with the book given all the beatings Christina went through and the fact that the man she fell in love with kidnapped her in the first place. I thought the book was very well written, and didn't mind Philip's harshness. It was down right sexy. He was a strong man who knew what he wanted. Quite a nice change from the manicured men in todays society. Philip fell in love with Christina desite her defiance, and she in love with him, despite the fact that he kidnapped her. I don't think its too far a stretch either, her loving him after he forced her body to need him with his hands, because once she let him in, she felt the pleasure and safety being wrapped up in his arms.I would reccomend this book to any hopeless romantic. I can't say enough. I wish the book would have never ended. I am dissapointed that I finished it so quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell was this..........","review":"I have to say that I am a big fan of Johanna Lindsey.........especially the Malory books..........however this one, to put it nicely, really sucked. The heroine is an airhead and obviously has Stockholm Syndrome, and the \\"hero\\" is an arrogant jerk who doesn't change once he falls in \\"love\\". I am definitely a fan of J.L.'s books where the girl can take care of herself in almost every way and is not \\"shocked\\" by men and everything they do.

We've learned a LOT about the history of Christianity since then, and many of the sweeping assumptions of this book (e.g., in the ghastly section entitled \\"The Darkest Hours: The Great Recession, A.D. 500-950\\") have been thoroughly discredited. The bibliographies for each section don't include works published in the past half century (despite the so-called revision).

As an American reader, this was the portion I most understood and to which I related; but the book is a thorough story of the life of a 20th Century major figure not adequately appreciated in the west. Since I have lived in Turkey for the past seven years, it was natural I would like to add to my knowledge of the man, his era and the places involved in his rise to leadership; however, the book was recommended to me by a national friend. Interestingly, she is the granddaughter of an informal advisor to Ataturk whose death came as a result of Ataturk's inaction, more than deliberate plan, a fact recorded in the book. Strangely she still extols the virtue of the man and his leadership.

It's funny, Versace make two cologne's (yea and many more), but one is \\"Versus\\" another is \\"Blue Jeans.\\" Looks like Amazon got dooped into buying a KNOCK-OFF of both and they're passing them onto unsuspecting consumers. Look at the metal container and bottle. If it says versus anywhere, you've been mis-sent the same knock-off as I.

James is a hard-headed, unreasonable and controlling male who causes havoc in his daughters lives. Kathleen is the prissy girl you can't help but fall in love with by the end of the novel when you learn of the circumstances surrounding her horrid end. Mercedes is the familiy's source of strength who helps them survive. Although annoyed by Mercedes' actions often she is still a compelling character. Frances is the bad girl you can't help but love. She turns her world upside down when she turns to alcohol and prostitution but manages to salvage herself. Lily has naive love towards everyone as her sisters try and protect her from the truth. An unstopable read that leaves you with a bitter-sweat feeling and an urge to call your parents and tell them how much you love them. Phenominal."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Fall on your Knees\\" Falls Short","review":"Fall on your Knees is like watching a car wreck. You can't stop, though you know you should. No good feelings will come out of watching the wreck or reading this book. Afterwards you can't stop thinking about it although you know you should be doing and thinking about other things. All the main characters are tragically flawed whether inherently or due to circumstances. Whatever the case is, their lives proceed to the benefit of none and more than likely to the detriment to those around them. Not a feel good book. But if you are in the mood to poke your eyeballs out with a hot poker, you will enjoy this twisted family saga immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men are evil....yet again...","review":"How many books do I have to read where men are evil and women are struggling and the only \\"perfect\\" love in the book is interracial lesbianism in the early 1900's? And the spunky character is totally unsympathetic and manipulates the only decent man, a black man, into siring her only offspring.It started out so promising and interesting and then the last half was the pits. I was hoping it would redeem itself at the end but was sorely disappointed. Beyond the realm of believable or engendering any empathy to the characters. The only sympathetic character I liked was Materia's dad who had the sense to kick that nut out of his house at the beginning of the book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READING that you will not want to put down!","review":"I just read this book and it was so intriguing and detailed that I could feel the characters in the book. It was almost as if I was watching the Piper family. The layers of information and stories and secrets that unfold are exciting and excellent in the writing of Ms.MacDonald. The content is shocking and very delicate and traumatic at the same time. I cannot understand why some readers would call it trash or not be able to handle the content unless they were victims of these types of crimes and not yet ready to confront it. Great novel and novelist and I enjoyed the Catholicism undertone too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Read, but Challenging","review":"Beautifully written -- Fall on Your Knees is a good choice for a reader who prefers something fairly (but not overly) complex and literary and who doesn't mind a rather depressing plot line. The characters are meaningfully drawn and well developed and will stay with you long after you turn the last page. The author's masterful use of Nova Scotia as the setting is absolutely perfect (and perfectly rendered) for this dark and disturbing story. A solid selection for your book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Good!","review":"Okay, I'll admit, when I first began reading this book, I was starting to feel a little negative and I wanted to stop. I'd just grown so tired of reading about extremely dysfunctional people all the time that I wanted to feel inspired for a change. But then, what do you know... The novel and its characters just drew me in.It's true that the themes of this book are a little on the serious side, but you can't help but feel like you know the characters that you just want to keep on reading to see their story unfold. It's that kind of book.And because you just get so involved, it's likely you'll turn back to the first few pages the moment you're through just to check up on things you might've missed the first time around.That's how attached you'll be to the characters by the time you reach the last page. You almost hate for it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for some, not for most...","review":"As an employee for [a local book store], the staff and I couldn't figure out what the big deal was about this book. I took it out on a loan, and I am certainly glad I did-- I would not buy this book after reading it. It's horribly redundant, terribly long, and overall confusing and difficult to read. The characters I couldn't care about-- they never touched me that way. Oprah Club books are depressing and full of angst- this novel was no different. Even still, it was hard to get into and in the end, after 2 days of a struggling read, I was glad it was over. It never gave me any lessons on life or an enlightened perspective- all it made me do was fall asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story, fantastic characters","review":"\\"Fall On Your Knees\\" is a fabulous book! It is, however, not for the faint-of-heart; there is no happy ending, no knight in shining armour, and no 'warm fuzzy feeling'. This book is depressing! Several friends - girls and guys - recommended it to me and I loved every page of it, sobering as it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depraved, Deprived, and Depressing","review":"Fall On Your Knees was one of the most beautifully written, depressingly awful books I have ever read. The prose was lyric, but confusing in places. The characters were hopeless and the story line was worse. I made myself complete this book, but will not bother to read one of Oprah's Book Club choices again, as depravity, deprivation, and darkness seem to be requirements for inclusion into her reading choices. Life is too short for me to waste my time on reading anything resembling Fall On Your Knees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps me up at night","review":"I picked this book up at the office, and was hoping for an intreguing novel that had something new and interesting to say. I enjoyed the style at first, but it was shortly clouded over the horrific events of the plot. I admit that I couldn't put this book down- in the same way that you can't tear your eyes away from fresh roadkill. Several times I wanted to \\"put this book in the freezer\\" to make it go away, but the vivid pictures of incestual rape would not leave my mind. Its been a week since finishing, and I can still see Francis telling Mercedes \\"Don't worry. It doesn't hurt.\\" This book was simply too vulgar- I wish I had never picked it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Stinker!","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The characters are completely unlikable if not despicable. The storyline is very dark and obsessed with incestuous relationships. There was one scene that was so graphic, it gave me a stomach ache. I felt like I was living through a nightmare.The weirdest thing is that my grandmother sent me this book. The entire time I was reading this, I just kept thinking to myself, \\"Why would she send this to me? Why did she read this?\\" About a week after finishing the book, I learned it was an \\"Oprah\\" book and I realized what a blessing it is that Ms. Winfrey has discontinued her club. If this is the kind of book she's reccomending to the masses, I want no part of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocore","review":"This was my first Oprah book. It was a huge disappointment.I figured out all of the \\"secrets\\" in the book early on. The story was told in a slow, predictable manner.The most interesting part were the sections from Kathleen's diary.I would not recommend this book - there are so many other great fiction novels out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the online excerpt and stop.","review":"Fall on Your Knees gets two stars instead of one because the author's writing is very good. Read the online excerpt, appreciate her craftsmanship and stop. The plot, about a diseased family and their journey to ruin is heart sickening. The main character James, inspires hatred by the third chapter. Upon finishing each chapter, I asked myself, \\"Do I throw the book in the trash now or continue to see if the family ever gets out of the mire he created?\\" No matter how well the words were written, finishing the book and finding out what happened to the family did not bring satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and terribly boring","review":"I read half of this book and quit, something I rarely do. The story was pretty good at first but then it began to go on and on and on about the sisters giving so much detail that I finally lost interest. I got to the point where I no longer cared what happened to any of them and went on to read something else. I was terribly disappointed in this book and don't think I would care to read another one by this author in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gripping, but hardly optimistic","review":"This book seems to never end in misery. It thrives on it. Right up until the very confusing end. It pretends to build up the book but then towards the last few pages it is prone to arid dryness except the last 10 pages, this book leads you on.. and then leaves you with nothing. I had to reread the last 50 pages to see if I missed anything... it gives vague ideas of what could have happened. It ended up being a wanna-be suspense book.The drama of the book is chaotic at times but I would still give it 2 stars only because I couldnt put it down the last 150 pages or so... dont let me convince you of that being its redemption.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!","review":"Good grief! Could there be anything more depressing than this book? I would have quit reading about 1/3 of the way through, but I just kept thinking it would get better. It didn't. You couldn't even like the characters. They were all so plagued with problems- guilt, anguish. I had heard high praise for this book, but now I'm left wondering why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. The author writes well, but the themes were just too dark for me and parts of it were bizarre and didn't make sense. The only reason that I finished reading it was because I was hoping for something redeeming. It didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is wrong with Oprah?","review":"This was a very strange, disgusting book. It was well written, however. I just don't like reading about incest. Why did Oprah hail this as being such a good novel? I am just bothered by the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, so very bad","review":"This was by far one of the worst books I've read in a very long time. It was just an unending chain of depressing events - death, incest, pain, suffering - with nothing like suspense or intruige or romance to keep you interested. And I wasn't cheering for any of the characters, either. I simply didn't care, I was just so bored with it all.Experiencing a difficult trial with a character or feeling their triumph over an insurmountable obstacle can be very cathartic for me. But the characters never really triumphed, they just continued on with their pathetic little lives.If you need to read an Oprah pic, try What Crazy Looks Like on an Ordinary Day. Trust me - this one is not worth the time or cash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall on Your Knees","review":"Like many others, I found this book to be, in fact, badly written, with characters I could not care about. The fact that the story line is depressing did not daunt me. Much wonderful literature is about sad and ultimately depressing events, but this book used such events merely to shock the reader, not to engage his/her imagination or emotions. I will also add this bit of trivia: Francis says (supposedly in the 1920s) a line which comes directly out of the film noir, The Big Heat(which was produced and set in the mid-50's). After reading that, I had to force myself to finish. I can't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally depressing","review":"The author utilizes beautiful, descriptive language to describe the scenery and Canadian countryside, but don't let this fool you. This book is totally depressing, the characters are difficult to like, and the flow of the words make it difficult to read this book more than a chapter at a time. I was very depressed when I finished this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Expectations","review":"I bought this book simply to have something to read, figuring that Oprah's books are generally entertaining, if not substantial. (Granted, there are a few exceptions.) I can honestly say that I was completely floored. This book is chilling and hilarious at the same time and absolutely one of my top ten favorite books of all time. I am also convinced that it is one of the best novels written in the past decase. Dark and terribly sad, but very powerful. From the first couple of pages (in the graveyard) I was hooked.When I finished the book, I was literally quite surprised by how good it was. I love to read and have favorites in different genres, but \\"Fall On Your Knees\\" is as close to a parallel of Faulkner's \\"The Sound and The Fury\\" as I have ever seen. I was surprised that I have not heard more about Ann-Marie MacDonald, but hope to see much more of her work in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally charged and hard to put down","review":"It is true that this book is deeply depressing but it provides that kind of sore heartache that keeps you from putting it down until you've read through to the very last page. At times, the prose becomes so thick with complexity that I had to go back and re-read a few pages before moving on. I found it a little dry in the beginning but well worth sticking with it! By the end I was completely involved and sad that this wild ride was over. I think I might even need to read it again to absorb all the subtleties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Depressing","review":"I have to agree with the reader from Canada. This is nothing against the writer, I thought she was terrific. However, this has to be one of the most depressing books I've ever read. This family isn't just dysfunctional, they're psychotic. I have to tell you that after reading this book, I really felt like I needed a shower! If you want to be really depressed, read this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING !!!","review":"My family roots are from Cape Breton, including New Waterford. Its not a book that I would typically read but last year my grandmother passed away and she lived most of her life in the little mining town of New Waterford and I loved the idea that I could see what her life was really like in those times. It is a beautiful novel, one that I wished would never end. Once I finished I felt like Frances was my best friend and she just moved away....I'll never forget her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"Even years after reading this book (long before it became popular) I can still remember it as one of the most boring, uninteresting and pointless reads of my life. The character's were dull and one-sided, the plot meandering, and the climax unfufilling. I'm saddened that it has become so popular of late, I can think of far more promising books to have in the spotlight such as Blonde by Joyce Carol Oates or Cat's Eye by Atwood. If you want to read a good book, please try one of those instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Title-Downhill from There.","review":"I had great expectatons for this book as it was recommended to me by a good friend. However, it was a testament to the strength of our friendship that I actually forced myself to finish it.Nice characters are never fully develpoed, and I never felt any connection to them-at least not enough to care what happened. (Which in the end wasn't very much anyway)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why I hesitate to read an Oprah book","review":"I've learned a long time ago not to grab every book that Oprah recommends. I took a chance with \\"A Fine Balance\\" and loved it, loved, loved it, so, I said, \\"Self, why not try \\"Fall on your Knees\\"? Why not indeed? This isn't the worst book I've read but when you expect something decent and don't get it, it's worse than a poorly written book that you had no expectations for. I didn't like the writing style, I couldn't believe what the father did (not because I didn't think him capable, but because there was no effective characterisation to support it; neither was there effective characterisation to support the oldest daughter and what she does/is), the author's revelations were primarily based on huge omissions and I didn't care about any of the characters. This book just didn't do it for me. Read \\"A Fine Balance\\" instead and get your money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall On Your Knees Falls Short...","review":"I laud Anne-Marie MacDonald for a beautifully woven, finely crafted novel. I could read her prose forever.But what I cannot get past is the fact that this is typical of an Oprah pick: 500 pages of dysfunction with the requisite rape, incest and misery void of redemption. It seems the modern benchmark for literary greatness is who can pack the most suffering into one long story. Truly great novels leave me wanting more and are marked not by the suffering of the characters, but the degree to which they rise above their circumstances.There are writers who combine well-written novels (which includes careful editing that respects readers' own intelligence) with fully-developed characters in stories that are moving, but ultimately hopeful and inspiring. If you want that mix, try Shade of the Maple ... or other great fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive literature","review":"I found the themes of rape, incest, and homosexuality offensive to my soul. Once again, a church-going Catholic is portrayed as a fanatic...I wish someone who is truly devout would make it into popular literature. This book is definitely NOT FAMILY MATERIAL...I wouldn't have it in a house with young children. I do not believe I'm a better person for having read it. The one redeeming feature of the book is the historical detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"think about it","review":"This book, despite its creative prose and complex plot inserts much sexual acts that to be blunt..is not worth reading. I did not even attempt to read on after I stumbled upon such scene. There was too much revolving around the relationships of the sisters, that should have been censored. If this were a movie it is like protecting oneself from those simply impure images. Sure it may be great, but the purity of your soul is worth more than the 556 pages (regardless of its content, plot, theme or reputation)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing, yet compelling.","review":"This was a book I couldn't put down...yet I wish I had never picked it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"An incredible and disturbing story about a fathers lust for his own daughter's and the tragedies that unfold as a result. Like other reviewers I'm at a loss for words on how best to describe the novel other than to say it is difficult to read at times, but you cannot stop yourself from tearing through the pages - it is that well written.The only disappointing part of it, for me, was the ending. I was not crazy about how answers were revealed in one long chapter, thus the reason for not providing the full 5 stars. I still highly recommend this book, however, due to the beautiful language and the authors ability to craft such a powerful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall on your Knees","review":"I am usually a big fan of Oprah's books but this was awful!! I couldn't even finish it. Midway through, 2 main characters die, there is child molestation, infantacide and the maiming of another infant!! It was just too much. LGM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a depraved mind could enjoy this book","review":"The synopses of this book do not come close to indicating the depravity of mind it must have taken to write the subject matter. The author attempts to make child sexual abuse and incestual rape seem a normal part of family life among 4 sisters and does a pretty good job of making the reader feel sorry for the perpetrator. The resulting \\"sins\\" (as the description on the back cover refers to them) will make you nauseated! As far as the \\"redemption\\" the back covers refers to - I found none. As the author alludes to child sexual abuse in vague language in early chapters, the reader isn't quite sure that is what is taking place. But, it gets much worse. Death, lies, homosexuality all lead up to incestual rape which leads to more death and child prostitution. I should have followed my instinct about half way through the book -- and burned it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, sad, pitiful","review":"How much more can happen to these poor people? Every cliched tragedy is here: incest, rape, death, murder, war, violence, greed--you name it, they suffer it--way too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somehow I kept reading","review":"I took this book on a beach vacation to relax- big mistake! Ms. MacDonald is a skilled writer I will say that, but I am sorry I found this book terribly sad, depressing, and emotionally manipulative. I found that the stereotypical characters neither learned from, survived or thrived after such extreme familial dysfunction. There is not a single decent moral male character in the entire novel. VERY unfair!! The so called redemption was terribly dissatisfying and left me cold. Also the religious cliches were abused endlessly-a book trying real hard to be P.C."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sins of the Parents","review":"I found the story to be very confusing at times. I had to keep going back in the story and clarify families and family members.There were many interesting sub stories that were both warm hearted and comforting. I came way from this feeling somewhat inadequate as I still had questions at the end of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this stroy","review":"I am an avid reader and read in a lot of different genres. This book, of all the books that I have read has touched my soul. I, like other reviewers, held the book for a long time when it was over. It was hard to leave the world that I was brought into by this book.I read this book years ago and every time I go in the bookstore I go and touch the rind.The story is epic and tragic. It demonstrates so well the way that tragedy in our childhood affects us our whole lives.I highly recommend this book. Even though it is painful to read, it is a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Survival","review":"I just finished the book. Excellent! The book is so well written on a subject of \\"taboo...\\" You will find that even though the subject matter is difficult to deal with and face, you can't put the book down. You keep going back to read it because you feel as if you are there, watching what is going on and the need to know what is going to happen next to each of the characters...The book does not diappoint. Read it, it's good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"A story doesn't have to be smiley & happy to draw you in and this one is not! It certainly made my family look squeaky clean. I could hardly put this book down. The best part of the book was how deeply the author was able to build so many characters. I really felt like I knew these people. I also enjoyed how the book seemed to be several stories that wrapped themselves around each other. It was amazing how I was able to at one point greatly dislike a character and at the next love them! A very touching book that I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - Women do exist in Cape Breton!","review":"As an MA student, I was interested in doing research about literature in Cape Breton. However, the traditional writers of Cape Breton seemed to leave out a portion of the Island experience that is vital - female characters and their authentic experience. Even though Ann Marie MacDonald is not a native of Cape Breton, she captures in her female characters a reality that transcends our own but also speaks to female internalization of a patriarchal culture. The Piper girls learn a kind of alienation that descends from Scottish and Irish cutlure, strict Christianity, and gender relations that subvert female lives. On the other hand, other characters such as the families of Whitney Pier, find a way to counteract the traditional subjugation of women. This book was so real and poignant in its delivery that my mother, a native Cape Bretoner, could relate easily to its content and situations. This book impressed me so intensely that I am writing my MA thesis on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and dissappointing...","review":"This book holds a lot of promise with its intrigue and plot twists. But it fails to deliver a big impact consistently. Even though it is exceptionally written, it wanders too much, particularly in the middle. James is too much of a one-sided character. He is a sick, unlikable man and it is hard to read and accept the tragedies he brings to his daughters. I found it disturbing but just for the sake of it. It deals with the horrors of incest in a cliche way-- makes you feel very impatient and disgusted without any hope for redemption. The outlook of the book was not fresh nor unique. It just blends with mediocre literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best I've read ever !","review":"This is a \\"can't put it down\\" book. The characters are so real you feel for them. The brilliance of writing was in part by writing so simple and real. A brilliant writer, just when you think you know whats coming next, you don't. There is certain to be someone in this book that each reader will relate to. I seldom read a book twice, but I indend to re-read this one. It is versitile in race, religion,education, and in how different each of the people are and yet so alike. Read it, you'll love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile, but often tedious","review":"Too often this book is just tedious and overwritten. However, the story is well told (even if sometimes over told), and it is a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I finished it, but would not recommend it as a favourite","review":"I felt the narrative was difficult to follow at times. I was interested enough in the Piper family to make it through the book, but was disappointed in the ending as it didn't really wrap things up as clean as I hoped. A lot of time invested for what I got out of it...can't understand all of the other high ratings this one received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"This book is beautifully written. It captivates the reader almost from the first words and it never lets you down. It is sad and mysterious and it is surprising. The author manages to tell the story in a way that makes you feel the pain of the characters, while all the while keeping secrets from the reader. You feel that you know the characters so well, but at the same time you are totally surprised by the ending that sneaks up on you. This book is a true achievement in story telling, and its about time that it is finally getting the notice and praise that it has long had by those of us in the canadian east that have read it years ago like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"gratuitous baby deaths ruin the novel for me","review":"Call me a softie, but I hate to read about the death of a baby or child. I can handle it if it enhances a story in some way, but the baby deaths in this novel seem entirely pointless. In fact, most of what happens in this novel seemed pointless and depressing to me. Don't assume I'm some Christian housewife with 4 kids either. I'm not. I'm educated and I enjoy a good dark novel from time to time, but in my opinion this one is not a good dark novel. It's a mediocre novel that tries to be interesting by creating strange characters and events. It fails because the characters are not believable and they don't invite much empathy. The shape of the plot is interesting, and the style is a little compelling, but all in all I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what?","review":"While I do not deny this is a good read I truly don't understand all the accolades for this book.It is basically about the miserable lives of the women in this perverted, incestuous family. Where are the redeeming values? Why should I care? Why was the creepy father forgiven?After 400 and some odd pages I felt more like a voyeur than anything else and I wondered, so what?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read.","review":"This book demands that you continue to read it once you start it. The characters are individualistic and human. The structure of the book gives you enough but not all of the information. When you are done, you are ready to start again. This book will remain in your memory as you continue to search for it's meanings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, fast paced, a page turner til the very end.","review":"Every chapter uncovered a new plot, a twist of story lines, an 'I can't put this book down' event.

You won't be sorry you invested in this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sprawling saga about five generations of a family of Cape","review":"Astory of five generations of a family from Cape Breton, Novia Soctia, this is a very impressive piece of literature produced by Canadian actor and playwrighter Ann-Marie Macdonald . The family history , music , anfamily secrets , centers on four sisters , and their relationships with each other, with their fathers involvement. He shows, his affection in a negative and improper way. The setting of this story was in the coal mining communitiesof Novia Scotia in the early part of this century , the battle field scene of World war 1 and the jazz scene of New York City in the 1920's all had a great impact on creating an intensifying scene in the novel , Fall on Your Knees..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but miserable story","review":"Do you like feeling bad about yourself, about your family, and about life in general? Then read this depressing, miserable story. Although well written, the story has absolutely no redeeming characters or value whatsover. If they're good people--they die. If they're bad people--then they die, too, just not soon enough. I'm certainly not going to give it to any of my friends or family to read. We don't need everyone feeling like they've wasted several hours merely to have their good spirits dampened by this soggy and unrealistic story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say What?","review":"No family could have that much nutiness. Preposterous. How did Francis' son find her? No one else had read her diary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just read the book!!!","review":"Excellent writing and an amazing story that's incredibly evocative and yes ......somewhat depressing. BUT, there is much to laugh out loud at and a richness of plot that in most books is woefully absent. Also, multidimensional characters and situations that reflect the realness of peoples varied life stories. The author's willingness to take a man with the best intentions and show how he slowly destroys his family is quite powerful. The characters are drawn very richly and their dysfunction laid out from its first crack down the long trip to madness. It's a very rewarding read by a masterful author. It's absolutely impossible to write an accurate plot description, you just need to read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grim, Grimmer, Grimmest!","review":"Ugh! What a mess this book is! How can anyone write hundreds of pages of unrelenting misery, suffered by unbearable, unrealistic characters? I was most interested in Materia and in Kathleen --until the author killed them and ran off into a miasma of sick, dark, implausible \\"plot twists.\\" Yeah, twisted is right! Child prostitution, incest, domestic violence, insanity, transgenderism--for pity sake.... That final 100 pages or so was nothing but an insult to the readers(like me) who've slogged through, hoping against hope for *some* redemption..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why read a book like this that leaves you somewhat depressed and has done nothing to enlighten or inform or even entertain? The author writes very well and I read and read, then I put the book down for a few days. I then wondered why would I want to finish reading this sad and perverted story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too depressing for me","review":"I don't mind reading an occasional tragedy but this book went overkill on tragedy. I am a big fan of Oprah Winfrey, but I've yet to enjoy any of the books from her book club. They are all so depressing and full of disfunctional characters. I usually read before going to bed and every night that I read this book I would have horrible dreams/nightmares. The night after I finished this book I slept very soundly :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing family drama with a wry humor","review":"Anne-Marie MacDonald's first novel kept leaping off my bedside table, the story looming larger and larger with each section. What begins as a family saga at the turn of the twentieth century twists and turns into a psychological study of familial love, lies, and distorted perspective. Ms. MacDonald illustrates various traits of human nature while telling a story that keeps folding us into itself. A highly recomended read when you have the time to consume cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and depraved","review":"All I can say is I'm glad Oprah is giving her book club a rest after I read this book. When she first started her book club I read the first 4 books and decided that they all had one common theme centering a female and her struggles to get thru a horrible life. Reading one of her picks occasionally, I can see she has strived to find books with the same central theme. I found this book to have no point. It had mostly depressing points of view on life in general and had more than it's share of perverted plot twists. Because I absolutely hate to not finish a book, I forced myself thru this one. I really don't see what if any kind of point or lesson or morale this author had in mine or what she was trying to relay in her story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Oprah!","review":"No wonder Oprah had to cancel her reading group after endorsing this...!Confession: I didn't get past the first 134 pages in Large Print. I knew what was coming though. Thing is, even if I disagree with the subject matter, I will still keep reading for great writing. You don't even have that much, here.The writing is such a jumble of styles, foreign languages, mixed 1st and 3rd person, weird humor, religious parody etc.... I decided to cut my losses early.I like to be uplifted and entertained. I don't mind suffering characters and tragedy if the writing's good.This is the last Oprah's book I will even attempt. I have found they are all about suffering women, no romance, really dark, and frankly, no fun. At least the one's I've tried. Sorry, no more Oprah's Books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing, even boring","review":"I'm so sorry I wasted my time with this book. The story has not one character you can really like, it is totally humourless and dark family-saga. Incest, foreign cultures, mysterious sexual forces, it's all there, but why? What a pity she can write!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aberrant Psychology","review":"When James met his future wife he wanted to say \\"I know you\\". You would think this was the beginning of a true love story. You would be very wrong. There is a lot of love in this book, but most of it is selfish and some is just perverse. The loved ones are often abused and traumatized by those who love them. I think the book is also trying to say something about racism, but I can't quite figure out what. The only reason I was compelled to finish reading this book was to see if anyone survived. Noone really did. This book left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The number of reviews readers have been compelled to write testifies that this book weighs heavily on the mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read","review":"This book was an emotional roller coaster. Don't even waste your time and money unless you LIKE reading about incest, pedophilia, tragic deaths, the drowning of a baby, and characters so disturbed you can't even begin to like them or wish them well. I can't even give this book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"promising...and then plain boring","review":"on advice of a good friend i picked up this book, it was a promising start and then the book lost it's pace..this turned out to be a waste of money and before it became a waste of my time i throwed it out....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good!!!","review":"I did not enjoy reading \\"Fall on Your Knees\\". It was a bit confusing, one of those books that you have to read between the lines so much just to understand what is happening. If not, you can get totally lost. To me reading is supposed to be fun, and not work just to understand it. I think authors should just flat out tell you what is going on, and this book didn't do that. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially if you want a leisurely read, don't choose this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fun read","review":"This book is dreadfully depressing. The only reason I tolerated the subject matter as long as I did---I didn't finish---was because it was our book-club selection. Part of the fun of reading anything is the imagery you create in your mind, so reading about incest is not the way I want to spend my free time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"I have never watched daytime television, including soap operas, but I am convinced that this book is a faithful homage thereto. I have to disagree strongly with the reviewers who low rate this manure pile on the ground that it's depressing. You have to take it seriously to find it depressing and this is certainly not even near worth taking seriously. I'll do you a favor by revealing the central plot element so you don't have to read it. Little Lily is the product of the incestual rape of Kathleen by her father, James, when he catches Kathleen in flagrante with her \\"black\\" lesbian lover, Rose, who is herself the product of her white prostitute mother and probably one of her black clients. It's easier to watch this sort of crap on TV. I'm forced to rate this as one star out of five; actually it's minus a hundred stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was I missing something","review":"I searched quite a while to obtain this book and when I finally bought it I dove right into and 100 pages later was still waiting for something to happen. Now it is on Oprah's list so it is must be good after all. For anyone who can finish this book I admire your sticktoitinis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother - explicit sexual content","review":"The only redeeming fact of this book is that the author does possess an aesthetic quality. As far as content, however, I consider it in the neighborhood of soft porn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash Disguised as Literature","review":"Although I am an Oprah fan, I do not agree with some of her choices for books. In fact, I threw this book in the trash. The disgusting and disturbing themes in this book do not merit my time, nor do I want the images described in such haunting detail taking up my valuable memory cells. I do not understand how a book such as this could hold appeal for anyone. Although we all know that there are many sick people and dysfunctional families in the world, does it help anyone to read a fictional work that tries to somehow \\"normalize\\" these things? I think not. Miss MacDonald should use her considerable talent and intellect on more worthy material."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have never wanted to burn a book before.","review":"Last night at about 2am after I had been reading this book for several hours hoping that SOMETHING good would happen to someone I finally gave up and went to bed. I was depressed all the next day and finally decided it was because of all of the terrible images I was left with the night before. My mood improved dramatically during dinner when I figured out I could rid myself of this bummer book by burning it, not by simply throwing the whole thing into the fire, but by burning it page by sicko page and maybe page by burning page I can get my happy self back. The author should Fall On Her Knees and beg forgiveness for what she has put her readers through. Twenty minutes later: Okay - I really did it - I burned it and I feel much better. Diana Gabaldon - here I come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it.","review":"I really couldn't finish this one. She has a brilliant writing style, but lacks the ability to write an engaging plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"A useless waste of time","review":"The only think I can give the author credit for is polluting my mind with foul images that evoke a sense of revulsion.The characters are believable, it's the story that is flat out sick. For that reason the book is a form of mental torture. It's like getting to know people and then watching them sink into hell.Why anyone would recommend this book is beyond me.The author can write, but she has one seriously perverse idea of life. Some things just shouldn't be written, and this is one of them. Yuck!! I'm glad I got that out of my system!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A nightmare","review":"I have never read a book with such depressing, perverted and unredeemable characters. Ms MacDonald writes well but her subject matter is horrifying and the stuff of nightmares. I realize there are pedophiles on this earth and I know incest exists but why does she have to write of it under a pretext of a novel about family? This isn't a family I wanted to know about. If I had only been warned! My copy went to the Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is too short to waste it on such a depressing book","review":"This is my first review. I'm sorry there was not the option to give it no stars. I'm driven to share my experiences with others so they are forewarned. I have never read a book that was totally hopeless. Everything that could go wrong did. Many of them were so inconceivable that I wondered if the author included all the horrible nightmares she ever had, or had heard of. I did not finish the book. Life is too short to wallow in such darkness. I put my copy in the garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"too disturbing, not worth the time","review":"As a Mom of 2 young children, I don't have a lot of time to read. I really wish anyone thinking about reading this book would read the 1-star online reviews. This book was so disturbing and the incest and pediphilia is woven throughout the whole novel. I don't need to fill my head with such disturbing, graphic images."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Oprah","review":"If you like Oprah's picks, then you'll probably like this. To me, it's the same old story of a dysfunctional family, love, hate, incest, abuse, etc.etc. Ann-Marie DacDonald is a skilled writer who will get the reader involved in the ups and downs (mainly downs) of the story. The book is haunting and depressing, but very well-written. When is Oprah going to branch out? There are so many wonderful books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A predicable Oprah book!","review":"After hearing Oprahs review on TV I could hardly wait to read this book, but like most of her recommended books it's about another dysfunctional family. I didn't find the book either interesting or entertaining, and the outcome was predicable."},{"rating":"2","title":"a family destroyed","review":"This is a tragic tale, fleshed out in rather epic proportions. Put simply, it is the story of how one damaged man destroys the lives of five girls: his wife and his daughters. This book is a testament to how much damage one person can set into motion in less than a lifetime. James Pipers' actions create situations in which his family also makes bad choices, everyone in the hopes of doing some good.No matter what anyone says, Frances is the best of the sisters. Standing directly in the line of fire, she bears the brunt of James' misdeeds - being slowly destroyed - while the rest of them look the other way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I will never buy an Oprah book club book again without carefull scrutiny. I too am tired of formula writing and am challenged to find books that interest me, I have not however become so desperate as to judge a book positively only because it is different than what is on the shelves. This book is strange, I didn't care about any of the characters, I found the plot unconvincing. Perhaps the truth is stranger than fiction and this author experienced some of these incredible events in life and that might explain how it ended up in print. Tossed it right in the garbage after reading the last page, the first book I have ever thrown away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Fall on Your Knees\\" Falls on Its Face","review":"This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. And the sad thing is that it showed such promise during the first 150 pages. An epic of melodramatic situations, unbelievable characters, and silly plot twists that try to shock rather than tell a story. The author tries to elevate this purile contrivance by covering it with lofty language, arabic sayings (which are not translated), and religious metaphors. I guess this is what dupes some people into thinking they are reading good literature. Ms. MacDonald has succeeded in passing off this travesty as a high-minded read when in fact it is nothing more than a series of Jerry Springer episodes placed on paper. At least Springer is more honest--he doesn't try to pass himself off as Masterpiece Theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off strong, then goes downhill fast!","review":"I read the first two hundred pages in a day and I thought that in a few days I would have this read. However, the next one hundred pages got extremely boring and I couldn't even finish the book. I lost all interest once the mother left the scene. The events of the tragic night were a bit too unrealistic to be believable. Can't remember the last time I read over half a book and couldn't finish it. But as my husband says, \\"Life is too short and time is too precious to read bad books.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Disappointment","review":"On the back of the edition that I read, a critic boasted that this book had a plot \\"worthy of Hugo\\" -- was he ever wrong. This plot is shallow and lacking in depth and substance. It is a typical work of modern fiction by an author who is trying too hard to impress. The characters are one dimensional, the setting is at times intriguing as it shifts and changes, yet overall this book was a lengthy string of prose that did not influence nor touch me. I found it too melodramatic. The effort she put into this is acute...yet, no one should try so hard. It is an unnatural work by someone hoping to evoke thought and poetry and failing miserably. Stay away. If you want a plot \\"Worthy of Hugo\\" read the real thing. Read Les Miserables or Toilers of the Sea and watch your emotions be tempest tossed, calmed, and soared through believable worlds and characters. I deduce you will be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough research","review":"This book is very out of touch with Catholicisim. Only in the past few years have SOME churches taken to putting a body in water. Before that, a little of it was poured onto the head. Could a 5 year old really hold those babies in her gown? Why not take the easy way and use a sink or bathtub? For that matter she could have gotten a cup of water and used that. I have never heard of a 5 year old having been confirmed. She hadn't even made her first communion!Another beef I have with the religion part is they were going to have Lily exorcised. Really! This has just about never been done and not in the 20th century - not much.Very sloppy research but an interesting story even though it is really into Catholic bashing.The writer has a way with words and a good imagination but should be more careful with her research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brought tears to my eyes... of boredom!","review":"An in-depth portrayal of spoiled, shallow characters with no apparent depth of their own, other than their various bouts with mental illness, which seems to impress book critics and Oprah, but bores me half to tears.I love historical fiction, but like other posters here, I made it half way through this one, hoping it would get more interesting, but finally gave up. Annoying, at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just simply amazing","review":"Do not read any of the reviews below until after you read \\"Fall on your knees\\". Some of the reviews mention people and instances that will ruin your reading experience if you know of them in advance. Having said that....Read this book. It is outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed","review":"For the most part this story is delightfully action packed - full of surprises - unexpected turns and twists that keep the reader open mouthed. It is the story of a highly dysfunctional family in New Waterford, Cape Breton Island.The author's writing style is different, yet very effective. The way Catholicism is worked in here is quite interesting, as is the predicament Lebanese find themselves in. Please don't call them coloured or Arab. They would like to be considered European.I am still not sure about the character Rose. What exactly is the author saying here?Also Lily driving,then walking down to New York to meet Rose...what was the point here?I have to admit that at times I was left with an unpleasant taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This is by far one of the best books that I have read - ever! This story has everything - love, despair, incest, manipulation. There is enough drama in the book to make you want to turn page after page without getting enough! I found myself lost in this book and when it ended it craved for more! This book should be one of the MUST READ list for everyone. READ THIS BOOK!! (Have I said it enough times, yet?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"The first time I read this book I thought it was great, then when I re-read it I realized that just too many wierd things happened to the Piper family. If you want to read it, read it for it's depictions of New Waterford and Sydney, N.S., which are dead on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Unyielding","review":"This book grabs your attention and does not let it go until it has taken you through a highly emotional and fulfilling journey. Anne-Marie MacDonald is an immensely gifted writer who describes each character, event, location and image with such creative talent that you have no choice but to be drawn into their lives. You'll have the tears but also find the laughter. You'll feel their pain. Nonetheless, the journey is worth taking. The book confirms that the truth shall set you free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many unexpected developments","review":"I don't normally read the Oprah books. And I wasn't expecting such a multi-ethnic story to take place mainly in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. I thought that only white people from Scotland emigrated to that part of Canada...I guess you learn something new every day. Anyway, I enjoyed this book. Like other books I have read that take place in eastern Canada, there is a fair amount of questionable sanity that makes people do unexpected things. Maybe it's the weather they have up there, I'm not really sure. The female characters were especially well-developed here, although I would have appreciated a bit more insight as to how Frances turned out the way she did. I absolutely did NOT expect Kathleen's story to develop like it did, and my curiousity about what had happened to her (which I knew would get explained later) kept me reading. I thought the author was very talented and really knows how to tell a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating twists and turns!","review":"When people ask for a book recommendation, this (and Peace Like A River) is my go to choice. Love this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Refill your anti-depressants","review":"This was the most depressing book ever. The characters deserve better. I kept reading because I was hoping that at least one of the characters would have something good happen to them, but the tragedy gets piled on, page after page. It was as if Ann-Marie kept saying to herself with every new page \\"What's the worst that could happen?\\".Life is too short to waste on this hopeless book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still shaking","review":"I can't remember the last time a novel affected me the way this one did. It is unforgettable and when I finished it I stared around me feeling dazed and disoriented. The drama and the secrets concealed within these pages are unbelievable and the heartwrenching love story that is slowly revealed is unsurpassed. I recommend this highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of sin and guilt, but where was the redemption?","review":"I knew before reading this book that it was going to be about a deeply dysfunctional family, but that didn't quite prepare me for how truly sick this family was. The back of the book states: \\"Compellingly written, by turns menacingly dark and hilariously funny, this is an epic tale of five generations of sin, guilt, and redemption.\\" There was definitely all manner of sin and guilt, I din't find anything hilariously funny and if there was any redemption to come out of the whole mess it passed me by. It seemed to me the whole horrible cycle was doomed to continue. The writing was very well done, but I dindn't care for the graphic sexual details. The ending was depressing to me. With all the horrible things going on in the world today I don't need to read depressing books. I expect more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"a painfully unsatisfying read","review":"This book was very difficult to get through. The dysfunction of the Piper family was very disturbing and the novel didn't have any redeeming qualities to make up for it. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is Wrong With Redemptive Fiction Now and Then?!!","review":"If you want a redemptive story featuring characters that are \\"real\\" but not consumed by incest or rapists (i.e. a challenging, yet ultimately uplifting, inspiring story), skip Fall on Your Knees and instead pick up \\"In the Fall\\" by Jeffrey Lent or \\"Shade of the Maple\\" by Kirk Martin. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am by Oprah's pick - a dark, depressing, unwieldy story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much darkness for its own good.","review":"This novel is complex and there are too few parts that are compelling. The overwhelming tragic themes of rape, incest and murder are far too overdone. It seems that the writer creates tragedy for tragedy's sake, and it gets exhausting. This is a very depressing book, and I would not recommend it to the weak of stomach or those who are prone to becoming emotional. It's cruel, like it's characters. I really didn't like any of them nor did I come to care about them. I had to force myself to finish the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but creepy, and not in a good way...","review":"I rated this book strictly according to the star system: \\"I didn't like it\\". That is a personal opinion and it does not mean the book was bad, in the written sense, rather that I really found myself dreading to read it and I was glad when I finished it. This book was generally creepy and unpleasant to read, and I don't mean in a horror/thriller kind of way. The writing was good, the story was coherent (after the introduction) but the characters were unhappy, selfish and miserable people, but you couldn't even hate them...I'm at a point in life where I don't want to fill my mind with whole books of people being mean to each other, and hating their own family members. There really wasn't one single character that I could look forward to here, and no good resolution in the end, to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gothic Overload","review":"Upon pressing the book into my hands, my friend said it was gothic. And using this definition - \\"characterized by gloom and mystery and the grotesque\\" - that sums up the book neatly.There's about 80 years' worth of family gothic before there's a glimmer of sunshine in the family's otherwise mostly-miserable existence. There are some nice literary passages - fleeting, I'd say - but otherwise it is like driving by a bad accident in s-l-o-w-m-o-t-i-o-n and craning your head to look in spite of yourself. Let me list some of the tragedies: emotional abuse, verbal abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, suicide, shunning, pathological promiscuity ...Although the author is a skillful writer, I don't think the ratio of the book's redeeming value to unrelenting misery warrants a recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, Dark and yet, Spellbinding","review":"This book is so dark... you'll wonder if you have what it takes to keep reading. Others have covered the story line; no need here. Sort of a \\"Drowning Ruth\\" kind of feeling to it, but even darker! Somehow, this author draws you in (about mid-way, really) and you have to keep going so you can understand the deep, dark secrets of this stricken family. Give it a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the time?","review":"Get out the iced tea, this was one of the dryest books I've read in years. You keep waiting to get to the \\"good parts\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall on Your Knees","review":"Yuck! If you like sad, depressing stuff, this book's for you!From the beginning, this story about a mother, father and daughters living in Canada was dark and foreboding. And I kept thinking the ending would show some redeeming quality in the characters to lift it up a bit, no such luck.Sorry , this is the LAST book club book I'll ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Would you enjoy reading the diary of a mentally disturbed person who lived in the early 1900's? Would you enjoy reading a conglomeration of several such diaries that were thrown together without regard for chronological order or gaps in the story produced? If you answered yes to these questions then you will love this book.The author has some ability but the book is ruined by gaps in the story, great and sudden leaps in time, dead ends, and poorly developed characters.I think it made Oprah's list because it is 1. primarily about women, 2. about women who are abused by men, 3. about white women drawn to black men, and 4. about white women who are drawn to black women. Get it?I actually finished the book out of morbid curiousity. I do not recommend that anyone else subject themselves to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If a rating of LESS than 1 star was available...","review":"This book would earn it! If you enjoy reading poorly written, endless graphic accounts of incest, death, homosexuality, then this book is for you. I selected it because it was on Oprah's List. There are plenty of uplifting, truly interesting books to read. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to quit","review":"I don't usually quit reading a book, sticking with it until the end whether it is one of my favorites or not, but with this book, I just couldn't finish. I am an avid reader but found this book rather sick. I got tired of the relationship between Frances and Lily. I finally decided that I really didn't have to finish, so I quit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A literary quagmire","review":"The most amazing two things about this book are:a) to make the Oprah Book Clubb) and to find readers to give it five starsPersonally, I find the author without literary talent but have to give her one star for effort. Her story line is scatterbrained, her characters are boring, leading a misguided daily existence on 420 pages written in an incomprehensible style. On page 421 the author begins to explain what happened the previous pages, because I swear most readers don't have a clue so far. The mother seems to have murdered her daughter with a kitchen knife caesareanstyle, the six year old wants to babtize the babytwins drowning them in a brook or water nearby. And good dear daddy is boring until you find out his nasty dark secret. The quagmire is so deep, that even Fatima, or any religious aspiration cannot penetrate all this negativity, hopelessness, immorality, and dysfunction. The authors attempt to shine a ray of divinity into her twisted tale fails..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to enjoy this novel, I really did...","review":"...but I just couldn't. And for that reason I cannot recommend Fall on Your Knees. While it is well written, the story is just a series of tragedy piled upon tragedy. After a while, I couldn't care at all about any of the characters because I knew they were all doomed, and there was nothing in them to like anyway. In a nutshell, the novel is about a Canadian family that essentially destroys itself. Reading it is like watching a train wreck in slow motion over and over again -- too torturous and downright depressing. I appreciate books of this sort, for I am a sucker for novels with dark plots, but the aforementioned darkness here is just overkill. It's a shame though. I'd looked forward to reading something that would enthrall me, but this book just didn't do it for me.

Don't read this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful writing wasted on confused, dark themes","review":"I loved the start of this book and found the writing style and creativity of the author hard to resist. At the end, however, I found that I had been entraced into spending a lot of time reading a book I found ultimately distasteful and offensive. A book loaded with tragedy is climaxed when a teenage lesbian love-affair comes out of no-where and then is tragically cut-off. The awful way in which the affair was interupted was disturbing, no doubt, but at the same time I was very disturbed and saddened by the unrealistic and unhealthy \\"love affair\\" going on between the two teenagers.

None of the characters were really likeable and the story was just one negative plot after the other. The first 1/3 of the book was good, but then, it was pretty awful from then on.

Read it, darn it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Unusual","review":"Read this book. You are in the hands of a wonderfully adept and lyrical writer with a voice worth listening to. This family saga is sometimes dark and troubling but it's always fascinating, like its Canadian Maritime setting. How exciting to discover a writer as talented and memorable as this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth it","review":"I started this book out of curiosity, convinced I was going to hate it. Within a hundred pages, however, I was hooked. The story is very powerful, and draws the reader in amazingly well. I didn't want to put it down, and cannot wait to read more by Ms. MacDonald."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing and Creative","review":"As I read this book over a period of 2 weeks, I found it to be compelling,as well as,unpredictable and in some instances unbelievable. The author developed compelling characters who were understandably flawed, extremely neurotic and in some cases attempted to redeem themselves and in other cases revelled in their pathologies. The author also managed to integrate her commentary on the Catholic church, race, incest and a multitude of other social issues within the story using historical and cultural references. The story stretches one's imagination to the limits and in spite of myself was fascinated by her creative way of giving her readers a memorable literary roller coaster ride. Hold onto your hat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO DISAPPPOINTED","review":"I really wanted to like this book; to LOVE it. I knew this book dealt with incest and hoped to give it to help a friend heal. Thank goodness I read it first. This is a DARK book with no redeeming quality that I could find. The only character who was sympathetic was Matteia and the author killed her off. What a waste of Ann-Marie's great talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Oprah Downer","review":"I would compare this book to the book Oprah recently had on her list \\"We were the Mulvaney's\\" which was not quite as depressing as this book.Oprah is a rich intellegent lady, I am not quite sure why she continues to chose books which are frankly just depressing.Although this book is well written, it was painful to read. Unless you are into this kind of struggle, I would not reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book was full of emotion. I loved every letter, every word, every paragraph, every page. It is the kind of book that draws you in and keeps you hooked until 4am when you're eyes are so tired that you can't focus anymore and still you just have to read one more page."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"After all the praise, I expected a GOOD book, but was I disappointed! Has MacDonald every heard the word \\"anachronism\\"? Didn't anyone else notice that the father was referred to as \\"Rudolph\\" because of his shiny shoes while in the WWI trenches? \\"Rudolph\\" was written in the 1950s!! And that whole ridiculous sequence of a young girl walking from Cape Breton to New York in nothing but an antique silk dress -- and then walking directly to the right address! The whole thing was just a pile of tripe. Would this book have been nominated for anything if it hadn't been written by a Canadian woman? Gives a whole new meaning to chauvinism. Just because it's Canadian doesn't mean it deserves any Canadian writing awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling out of interest","review":"Had trouble with the voices. Did like the changing viewpoints but each voice remained static. Almost like each character remains a child to the point you lose track of each of their ages.The torment by Catholicism--stereotypical, overwrought. Just don't see the value of going into these dark waters. No balance, no triumph for any character, nothing learned.The inter-ethnic/religious relationships were interesting. Lily's character could have delved into how those with handicaps dealt with/overcame prejudice. The repetitious gore serves no purpose after awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"Fall on Your Knees is one of the coldest, most depressing books I have ever read. The book gave me that uncomfortable, eerie feeling from front to back. I honestly wish I had followed my initial instincts and stopped near the beginning, but instead I couldn't help thinking, \\"Oh, maybe things will get better.\\" Things only got worse. The characters were all very sick and extreme, which gave them an inhuman quality. I completely loathed some of the main characters, especially as the story progressed. While the writing style was unique, it was too distant. After 500 pages of present tense narration, I felt more like a voyeur than a reader. There is nothing enjoyable about mentally ill characters and the outcomes of their disgusting sexual cravings. Please, save your time, money, and sanity by choosing a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall on Your Knees","review":"One of the darkest and most depressing books I have read. If that's what you're looking for, this one is well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read in a long time...","review":"The character descriptions whether hidden or deliberate in this book were phenonmenal! I did not think this was a tough read in the least. There were nights when I practically had to tape my eyes open to keep reading. I would force myself to stay awake to the end of the chapter even if there were 30 pages left. Amazing detail and imagery. Anyone who did not like this book is not a lover of a great novel...."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst of family relationships","review":"The writing was descriptive and held my interest, but the story line covered nearly evey perversion a family can enter into. I finished the book totally depressed. It is sad enough that human beings do not respect each other in real life, but tragic to spend your leisure time reading about it. This had to be the most disfunctional family I have read about. Sorry I could not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing....","review":"I don't think that it's possible for so many horrible things to happen to one family. I believe the author's intent was to bring you closer to the characters by taking part in their tragedies. But actually, she acheives just the opposite. There's a certain point where their sorrows become unbelievable and that's when I stopped reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dark for words","review":"While the author has a command of the language, it was far too dark for far too long. The first 400 pages offered little hope for the storyline to get better. It did when the daughter resided in New York. She records her life events in a diary and there is hope in her words. How sad to see that an abusive man destroys all hope in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Depressing","review":"This is one of the most horribly depressing books I have ever read. I found that I was in a miserable mood the entire time I was involved in this story. I cannot believe the \\"author\\" couldn't come up with something more creative to write. I only continued with the hope of peace. She looked for the most devestating things to write and put it down on paper whether it made sence or not. She is trying shock treatment to make a name for herself. DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not interesting","review":"What exactly was this book about? The plot was weak as were the characters. I found the book confusing and difficult to follow at times. It's a difficult read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Like so many \\"literary\\" reads this was disappointing. Oprah's \\"picks\\" tend to lean towards too much in the depressing/dysfunctional mode. Too many other \\"worthwhile\\" books out there to read than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I had high hopes for this book. For one, it says \\"novel\\" on the cover, and two, Oprah picked it for her book club. I admit that after i saw it on her show i had to pick up the book. I had expected it to be as great as they said it was. However, I am smack in the middle of the book struggling my way to finish so that I may start my lord of the rings series. Not only does this book take forever to get to the point, but it has really horrible grammar for a published writer. Yes i will struggle a little more and try to make my money's worth for this book, but I highly doubt that it will end any differently than the begginning..which is very confusing..she's dead then she's alive oh opps she's dead again.. a little confused? don't get this book! trust me it's a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Went in the Trash!","review":"I am really stunned by the good reviews this book has gotten here. I found it sickening, perverted, and just plain filthy. I couldn't finish it because I was so disgusted, so I skipped to the end to see if there was any redeeming quality or conclusion, and was even more let-down. Supposedly the author imagines that there is \\"redemption\\" in a character finding out about all the rape and incest in the family and his origins from it, but it was so unreal to me that it was laughable, if you could laugh while feeling so nauseated."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh...not another father incest and baby death book","review":"At first I thought the book started out with a bang, I couldn't put it down for the first 100 pages, then the reader is hit with the father incest stuff (boring and over done), the baby dying and not one likable character in the book (what was the Francis having a baby for Lily if she didn't even keep it to raise about?!). I kept hoping because the writing was decent that there would eventually be a redeeable person in the book. No luck and I didn't even finish the last twenty pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book With Everything But A Story","review":"This book is full of it: inter racial marriage, statutory rape, parental neglect, physical and sexual abuse, war, psychotic parents, a minor \\"exotic dancer\\", the religious daughter, attempted murder, lesbian relations, adulterous relations, a father raping 2 of his daughters and a child produced from one of those relations, and much more. The back of this book should read \\"How screwed up can a family get? Just read this book to find out.\\" I was very disappointed with this book. How can one family be so deranged? The fact that there was no storyline was not what was disappointing but rather that there seemed to be no end to the madness that is truly unbelievable.

Please don't make a movie out of this one.","review":"This book started out with promise but then less than halfway through it went downhill. The storyline turned my stomach and I had a VERY difficult time caring about the characters. They were just all too weird or crazy and had nothing to make me feel empathy about their lives. The story didn't flow and was BORING at times. It seems that the author wrote the chapters at different times and didn't read the whole thing through to see if it flowed. I actually skipped to the end to see what would happen in the end. Never really finished it, it was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incestuous and revolting","review":"Wow - I can't believe that so many people liked this book. I thought that the underlying themes of incest and abuse were warped and disgusting, although I must admit, riveting at the same time. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone with a history of sexual or physical abuse, since its graphic and sometimes overly realistic descriptions turned my stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Time","review":"This truely was a saga that spanned the generations. I would have found it dark and depressing, had I cared. It is written much like a newspaper story. No warmth, no color, no compassion.

I kept thinking it would redeem itself - big mistake. Never has a book left me so down and depressed - and at a time in my life when I really needed something uplifting. Believe me, each succeeding page was worse than the one before it. There was not a humorous nor happy idea it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I spent so much time reading this book","review":"I am saddened that this book is an international besteller. Ms. Macdonald has a lovely writing style. It's too bad she wasted her writing skills on these lowly, perverted characters. It's hard to believe that thousands of people felt this was interesting stuff. It does not say alot about our world when homosexuality and incest are good reading material. It was like watching a movie and when you were finished you wished you had not wasted your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing artful or profound in 500+ pages.","review":"I forced myself to read the whole book because a friend thinks quite highly of it. It isn't compelling, provocative or even thoughtful. It is 500 pages of intentional human mishap. We all know that perversity lives close to the surface of so many of us. Sometimes writers can even capture that fact and create a piece of work that provides something of value to the reader.This ugly, dark, corpse-like book is not of value. I SO want all the time back that I wasted reading MacDonald's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but...","review":"I HATE doing this, but I have now closed Fall on Your Knees and will not bother opening it again. I struggled to about the halfway point, but can go no further.It's not that it's badly written... in fact the prose in places is beautiful. It's not that there's no story... there's bucket-loads of story and the reader is dragged through it at a rate of knots that is sometimes breathtaking. And maybe that's the problem. So far, we've not stopped long enough in one place to care for any of the characters.I really don't care what happens to any of them!Honest, I struggled and struggled to keep going, but boredom finally broke me and I've given up.

Well here's a de Sousa fan who prefers the marches!Sorry, but..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare find","review":"\\"Fall on Your Knees\\" knocked the wind out of me. I probably never would have stumbled across it, had a novelist not thrust it into my hands. Thank God she did. It can be laugh-out-loud funny and heartbreakingly sad within sentences. The characters are blessed and wretched, spooky and common, and their story will haunt you for a long time to come.No self-respecting reader/reviewer would reveal any of the book's secrets here. You simply have to read it to believe it.I will say that if you can get through some truly stomach-wrenching, hair-raising aspects of human behaviour, you'll receive a pay-off in one of the most beautiful love stories you'll ever come across, and a profound understanding that the spirit can triumph over some despicable circumstances.I'm delighted that I discovered this novel.

I can see no redeeming qualities in the plot or the characters. I really don't understand the four star reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought, Overwordy, Overdone","review":"I cannot recommend Fall on Your Knees. While it is well-written, the story is just a series of tragedy piled upon tragedy. After a while, I couldn't care at all about any of the characters because I knew they were all doomed, and there was nothing in them to like anyway. This is the story of a Canadian family which essentially destroys itself. Reading it is like watching a train wreck in slow motion over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great beginning turned into a silly ending","review":"I was so impressed with this novel until about the middle of it. Instead of ending there - where it should have - the author dreamt up ghosts to keep it going. Then all the characters (\\"all\\" the characters) seemed to flip out and none of their \\"eccentricities\\" were set up properly.Then everyone became twisted except the one who the most selfish and horrible from the start. And every \\"secret\\" and twist of the plot were telegraphed so loudly, I wished I could turn my hearing down.I think this writer has a wonderful voice and quite an imagination, but the novel suffers from its length, its callous disregard for the characters, its tendency toward explotative \\"shocks\\" for titillation, and the extremely weak ending. I can only recommend the novel up until the birth of the twins (vague, on purpose!), after that the novel reads like a very twisted sort of Lady Chatterly's Lover meets Justine.Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a cat person, but ...","review":"I'm sorry. I don't get how all these people can love this unlovable book. Okay, so I give it 2 stars for construction, narration, and evocation, but coming from the land down under (south of the Mason-Dixon line, and the home turf of the likes of such dreary folks as William Faulkner and Walker Percy) I'm acquainted with dark and crazy characters.

Starts out in Havana, a Cuban English teacher (of part North American desent), who is rather indifferent towrds the revolution, is contacted by an American who says he has been paid 9k to bring this teacher to Miami. The plan is set, but half way there, our friend is pushed off the boat, and left for the sharks. There begins the drama and mystery.Don't worry, I did not spoil anything, there is so much that happens in this novel.

In Mr. Clarinet, Max Mingus goes to Haiti to help a very wealthy man find his kidnapped son. The plot line and ending are unlike any I've ever read, and I read a LOT!! If you are a suspense, mystery, fan, Nick Stone's books are not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a hit","review":"This was a good read. The writing was superb. Dark, atmospheric, even though he might have gone overboard with the description and noir terms at times. But I think that was the point of the novel: to paint a dark picture of Haiti and the impending investigation before Max Mingus even gets there.The dark side of the island, the voodoo and the pied-piper missing children connection, are really captured well. Also, refreshing to see a different locale used. How many times do we have to see books set in LA or Boston before we start to yawn. For that alone, kudos to the author; also, for pulling it off so well.There was one scene involving the NATO forces which I felt went too far to make a point and stepped into almost comic horror Tarrantino territory, so one mark off for that (although others might well lap up that level of overkill) Other than that it was a rollicking good read and thrill ride and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"tips for writing your essay","review":"One of the most useful of the essay collections for college applicants.Tips are good, and well-organized. It is great to be able to read actual \\"winning\\" essays. At first read, I was far less than impressed with many of them. I wished for a more specific critiquing system, as in \\"Fifty Successful Harvard Application Essays,\\" also available thru amazon. (In contrast, the Harvard Crimson book actually includes critiquing on every essay... reader can see what qualities made the essay a winner, and also some ideas on what could have made it even better).But in general, the tips are good, and this should be a guide for ALL high school students who wish to write better essays.Oh, yes. After using this book as a guide, my son got accepted, early decision, into a great school. So that's worth a few stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"Love this collection! For anyone teaching students how to write personal essays or how to prepare college essays, you have to see the model essays in this collection -- if for no other reason than to read and show off the introductions. Students who have spent four years writing for standardized tests will find these openings fresh and inviting -- a welcome departure from the formulaic. This collection reminds us what professional writing looks like and reminds us that writing should be a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian aircraft history","review":"I love this book. I learned so much about the ye152m-the big mig21! It is one of my favorite aircraft of all time. Lots of performance data, black and white and color photos-drawings too! Anyone wanting data on obscure russian heavy interceptors should get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul provoking insights into a dawning era.","review":"Prior to reading The 5th Dimension, I had no knowledge of dimensions. Shiela's treatment of a dawning age on the earth is tender and sincere. In addition, she clearly and succintly outlines spiritual and metaphysical techniques for a happier and more whole life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy, was this a mistake!!!","review":"I am in complete agreement with the other reviews I have read about this product. Unfortunately, I didn't read them before I bought the Pinnacle Systems PCTV Pro. Besides most of the other *bugs* listed,(eg. audio-sync problems, lack of basic editing functions in the main program, and no radio tuner) I have found that the PCTV mysteriously turns itself on at random times throughout the day even when nothing has been scheduled to record.The documentation is terrible. The support website is full of dead links or loops that send you back to where you started without an answer to your question or a hint of how to find one.I would not recommend the Pinnacle Systems PCTV Pro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops! I got hoodwinked!","review":"I shudda read the reviews before I bought this POS. After spending hours trying to get the card to function properly I finally realized why Compusa had placed it on sale: they were trying to dump this loser on me by dangling a low price in front of my nose! Well, price isn't everything, obviously; like the man said, lets see how good the return policy is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The first half is awful!","review":"The first half of this album is horrid! It sounds like a bad mariachi (sp?) band. However, the last half is very good and very danceable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very inaccurate, bad release with horrible sound quality","review":"Half of the songs have nothing or little to do with belly dancing. I have no idea why Romanian (and perhaps some Hungarian) folk music and Eastern European traditional Gypsy music are called Belly dancing. However, this music is not bad or \\"horrid\\"; it simply should not have been put on this CD. The overall quality of the sound really IS horrible, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange vocals and tinny sound quality","review":"Hi I agree with the other reviewer this isn't the best cd out there. I have listened to it enough to acquire a taste for most the songs though so the music is interesting in a strange sort of way. Some of the songs have very nice beats but the vocals will scare many people from wanting to hear them while you dance lol. I've often wished this cd was recorded with higher quality too... it sounds almost as if recorded in mono instead of dolby or stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not belly dance music!","review":"This isn't really belly dance music - it's Roumanian Gypsy music, folk music and Debke - which is not traditionally used for belly dance. It is danceable - but if you're looking for a belly dance compliation there are better ones out there. Also, the sound quality is AWFUL, the drums are very \\"boomy\\" - poor recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I like the Artemis heel smoother, and these are the replacement tips. The tips don't last all that long, depending upon your own expectations. But I find this product to be the best for smoothing down the feet and toe area, including cuticles. This product is much better than the foot smoothers that use razor blades or cheese graters (ouch) and is easier to use than a pumice bar, since it is sort of a pumice bar on batteries. I stocked up on a bunch of these tips to keep well supplied for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This is one of those movies that you sit and watch to the end to see what comes out of this boring, immoral production!!!I just don't get the point!

I, personally, would not recommend this book to a friend. I found the arrangements lacking and very unsatisfying. For some pieces, the most \\"enjoyable\\" part of the music is missing. I really just don't think the sheet music was written very well in this book. That may just be my opinion, but this is one book that will be collecting dust on my shelf. There are much better books out there than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have if you're just starting","review":"Excellent book, for beginners. It has all the \\"easy\\" bits of classical music, giving you the oppotunity to start easy, and later on move on to the next levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book with excellent music","review":"I bought this for my sister who plays the violin. I do not know much of music, but from what she has told me, the music pieces are easy to read and play (she is an advanced violinist). It is a song book, reading music is a must. Song selection is its winning feature. Some of the best songs for violin are in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying.","review":"I have this Stereo CD Softcase Speaker. I bought it June 9, 2003 and have not had one problem. I travel a lot and am never without it. I use it when I am taking a bubble bath....relaxing CDs and bubble baths go together. You can choose your CDs and put them right there in the case. The sound and construction qualities are excellent. The outside material wears well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Portable Sound","review":"This item has great sound - this is the 4th one I have bought for family members.

They love all of the games, but Hide and Seek is the favorite. The arm pulling out of the socket is annoying, but fixable. Would totally recommend this to anyone with young kids, and we've bought it for several birthday party gifts, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Scrambles","review":"We enjoy playing games in our home. I had seen this toy in a catalog and knew it would be a great addition to our collection. My 5 year old daughter absolutely loves playing with this toy. You can play several games with it, but her favorite is don't drop Mr. Scrambles. The toy will ask you to do several activities while holding the egg on a giant spoon. There is a sensor inside the egg that recognizes if it has been dropped. When my daughter finally drops the eggs, he will respond back that he has been dropped and my daughter will double over in giggles. I love to watch her play with it, it is a barrel of laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major design flaw","review":"Our 4 year old son received this toy for Christmas. He really liked playing with it, and it was a lot of fun for him, with so many different games to play. However, you need to squeeze Mr. Scrambles left hand to activate certain things, and his arm easily becomes detached. So, you have to peel back the cover and push the arm back into the outlet. To add to the frustration, the arm constantly becomes disconnected. I'm not sure why the company designed it this way, but it wasn't a good idea. We still play with Mr. Scrambles, but dealing with the arm issue is irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"many games in 1","review":"My 3 year old niece totally loved this, I will be gifting this to another child as well. I highly recommend this product. The favorite was \\"egg hunt\\" where you hied it, then the child looks for it and mr scrambles says things like woohoo over here to help the child listen for where it is hiding. No other game out there has a feature like this! We also love \\"hot egg\\" dont get caught holding mr scrambles when music stops!"},{"rating":"2","title":"his dj set at citadela nebula","review":"Well it's not specifically concerning this album.I'm just listening his dj set from Citadela Nebula from Czech Republic and it's really wow, it is still hard tech house but really juicy.He is big star in eastern europe techno parties and I can see why, this set is possible to download for free at winmx p2p"},{"rating":"2","title":"A teenage 007 !","review":"In this film, you see the life of a 14 yr old who has been trained in the world of spycraft.

My 2 kids (9 and 10) and I loved the book so we decided to get the DVD. What a mistake. The boy just could not watch it and left the room. The little girl forced herself to watch the entire thing and at the end said \\"That was terrible.\\" My sentiments exactly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got for school play day","review":"I purchased this movie for our schools play day.

The action is exciting and the special effects are thrilling. It is refreshing to have a movie with patriotic characters who don't have to use profanity constantly. I would recommend it for 8-14 year olds, but we \\"old folks\\" watched it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Was ok","review":"The reason I thought it was ok, was because I have only read the firstBook and I kind of like the movie, so if you have read the book, youMight be ok with it, like I was.

This is an older movie but pre/early teens are into the books and now want the movie. This is not serviced by Amazon and is coming from overseas! Either I didn't read the info carefully or the info wasn't clear but, after I placed the order I received notification that it would be delivered sometime late January. I tried to expedite it and that was when I found out why it would take so long. Tried to cancel but suddenly it was already shipped---all this taking place within less than 24 hours!

In an attempt to keep a PG rating, all the excitement, action and violence was washed out, leaving something more like a comedy than an action movie.

But it is nowhere near a true shop manual. A lot of common tasks are omitted entirely, and others are covered in excessive detail.They also try to cover a wide range of engines, and drives, and model years in a single book. As a result, at least 2/3 of the book is irrelevant to you since it covers engines, drives and model years other than yours. Procedures for newer engines are just lumped into a final chapter, rather than being inserted into the text where they apply.I don't regret the purchase, but it is not what I had hoped for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I purchased this shop manual to aid me in winterizing my boat. This manual was of little or no help. The owners manual provided with the engine did a far better job. This manual covers such a wide range of engines that it is cluttered and difficult to navigate. I was very disappointed with this book and would not recommend it to anyone that is not already familiar with Marine engine repair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, effective nature education","review":"Although pitched at children ages 4-8, this book could effectively serve as a brief introduction to old growth forests of the Pacific Northwest for any reader. The story follows a Douglas fir tree's life cycle, including its vital role after death. The well-chosen color photographs clearly present the animals and plants of this wondrous ecosystem, and the text descriptions, though concise, include enough colorful adjectives to avoid boring readers. The design is much less busy than that of the Dorling Kindersley books, promoting a calmer pace that allows beginning readers to focus more clearly on the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Hineini in our lives","review":"At first I wasn't too impressed, but this book is not so bad. It is an interesting take on applying the bible to everyday relationships. However I don't like the 'other' emphasis because I prefer the more chasidic perspective of striving for unity and communion with God rather than separation. However, if I replace 'other' with something more meaningful to me I benefit from the book. It is really about relationships with others and with oneself. Its use of the characters in the bible to illustrate this is interesting. Now I would give it 3 to 3 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"you people are idiots","review":"this album is way better than any of the crap coming out like kanye west and all that, nobody knows what good music is, his rapping style is way better than most out there, just cause he doesnt just talk over a drum beat. bash is also known as baby beesh to all those who think hes some softy, hes rapped with most of the bay area legends like e-40, mac dre, jay tee and many more, so just because he sang suga suga doesnt mean anything, go listen to your nelly, ja rule, and kanye west and leave the good music to people that know what theyre talking about"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Some Growth","review":"I must admit I bought this for the song: \\"Baby I'm Back\\" which is on smash.....but the rest fails to impress.

I told the vendor, via email that I didn't realize it was in French and could not use it since I don't speak French and would like to return it and I mailed the book back last January 14, 2011. The vendor, Moonglow Books, indicated to me that I can return the book if I'm not happy. I have not heard from them since and have not received a refund. Moonglow claims that it was indicated on the listing, but I never saw that. A simple two words in parentheses like, (in French) after the title in the listing page would have been a quick remedy.

It is filled with cultural and historical information but contains absolutely nothing relevant to someone traveling in France. This book is better suited for someone who is interested in the history behind some of the regional sights. There are essentially no practical facts or travel tips included. After perusing it, I didn't even take it on my trip. In addition, the maps in this book are in no way a substitute for the maps published separately by Michelin, especially if you are planning to rent a car. I strongly recommend Frommer's Guide instead supplemented by Michelin maps.

There are plenty of better books out there that deals with religious perspectives on UFOs in general and extraterrestrials in particular.Dailey believes that ALL occult and New Age movements have one thing in common; destroy Christianity. No wonder people turn their backs on a religion that refuses to accept other values.

One click and several months later and here I am. I've had these for months and I've hardly put a dent into them. I've had to resort to finding creative things to do with them-- like putting handfuls into individual baggies and hiding them throughout the house so I can have \\"surprise jelly beans\\" when I'm not expecting it.The only reason I knocked off a star in this review is because these beans literally come in just a cardboard box. No plastic bag holding the beans, just a bunch of beans sitting in and against cardboard. There were some small exposed seams and I did have some concern if the beans could be exposed to creepy crawlies. A one cent bag to protect the beans while they are in the box would be appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"this company sucks","review":"they also sent me broken items and nothing fits my phone...DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"The service was good the book very good shape.

It gives a very good introduction to would-be motorcycle technicians as well as people who want to work on motorcycles as a hobby. It covers the basics of the motorcycle technology that was relevant in the year the book was published (1999). Both text and illustrations are very detailed.This is an excellent reference book to have in your collection if you work on motorcycles or are interested in the intricacies of motorcycle technology.What we really need now, is an updated revised edition with the latest technology included."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE WORKBOOK NOT THE TEXT BOOK","review":"I read the reviews, which is the biggest reason I purchased the book.

Buy the hardcover and hope that it includes the material rather than the questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Haynes \\"Motorcycle Basics Techbook\\" instead!","review":"This is a lousy book! For starters, the electrical portion of the book is so superficial and watered down. I have several years experience so I know what the authors are trying to get across but, I just don't see how somebody unfamiliar with electrical systems could possibly read the subject matter and understand it completely. The first step in troubleshooting is to thoroughtly understand the system you are trying to troubleshoot. I recommend people buy the Haynes \\"Motorcycle Basics Techbook\\" instead. It does a much better job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T buy the paperback!!","review":"Yes, the title does include the word 'Workbook'.

I must admit, at first, some of the aerobic steps were a little complicated, but after a few repititions, they are pretty easy to catch on to. After the aerobics comes the toning segment. That, too, can be challenging for beginners, but after doing it for a couple of weeks, it does get easier. I was really impressed with the way that Leisa cued the exercises (especially during the aerobics). Tracy and Michelle also did a good job. I give it 4 stars, mainly because I am a beginner/low-intermediate exerciser myself and I really have not tried other videos yet. I still really liked this video. I do recommend it to other beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buns & Abs of Steel 2000: Platinum Series - Beginners","review":"I definitely think the operative word in the title of this workout video is \\"beginner\\". I found the toning section for the glutes and abs to be extremely unchallenging. I barely broke out into a sweat during the first half of the video (which consisted of a 30 min. cardo workout). So if you consider yourself intermediate or advanced in physical fitness this is NOT the workout for you. However, if you're a first timer this video has easy to follow steps and good cues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Tape and all over workout for Re-beginning","review":"I also have had this tape for many years.

I just used it, after about three years of being bedridden, and I feel great! I was only able to do about a fourth of it, but I am looked forward to getting back in the swing of things, and I know this tape will help. It works out all your muscle groups, is not hard to do, and the girls aren't too cutsey. Yes they are wearing the doofiest outfits, and yes they are chirpy, but it didn't bother me, knowing that I was getting a great workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was an absolute beginner","review":"..and it took me a couple of times to catch on to this video but now I absolutely *love* it! I like that they're constantly giving reminders about good form-because it really makes all the difference in what kind of workout you get. The steps are repeated a lot of times, so they're easy to catch onto, and very effective. I also like the toning part--sometimes I find it's a little too short, but I add extra reps sometimes while they're explaining the next position. All in all, I love the easy banter among the women and the encouragment throughout. I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't exercised in a while--but start slow and work your way up! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin 76 Series GPS","review":"Great device at a great price.

It works best with file written under 4x. The higher the buring speed, the worse the player behaves, it will not be able to read the files burned using speed 16x and above.

Oh, and the hyped skip protection is nonexistant as is support for it on the creative support page. I have never bought a product that I felt so strongly against.

This one focusing on the fictitious Eastern European country of Molvania.In \\"the land untouched by modern dentistry\\" you can figure out what hotel to stay at, the wonderous historical sites, and the restauarnts and public transports. In the style of Fodors guide, it attempts to even make this disaster of a country sound wonderful.It is a bit of a one-joke book and a hair repetitive, but the detail in book is really amazing and gives it the perfect feel.To the few people who were \\"offended\\" by the book and considered it discriminatory, I think \\"what part of parody don't you understand?\\" comes into play. If you're so tight you won't get the joke, by all means leave this on the shelf.

The descriptions are accurate and without this country actually existing, I do believe that during my discovert of Eastern Europe, I have visited almost every single city described in this book.This book is warmly recommended for anyone who has ever traveled to Eastern Europe or someone saited with the dry wit and self-assured criticism of Lonely Planet and their ilk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough to pass as a real guide!","review":"I bought this book after hearing about it many times from various australian backpackers on my trip around central and eastern europe.

But remember that this is a parody of a travel guide. And how many people sit down and read a Fodor's or Lonely Planet guide systematically, cover to cover? Very few, in my experience. Instead, you pick it up, open to an intriguing section at random, or check the index for the specific region or topic you're interested in, and read for a few pages.If you approach \\"Molvania\\" the same way, I think you'll find it pretty entertaining. Even if it has only one idea, that idea is a good one, and the authors execute it well. Again, in large doses it can get a little heavy-handed.

This treasure-trove of \\"rock-science\\" (petrology) is indeed vast, covering many possible occurrences, not just common modes and types. As an avid geoscience student, I have found this book to be a bit dry, but that has been countered by the seemingly complete nature of the book; everything I've asked a question about has been answered, sooner or later, by this book.Although the book is dense, dry and exhausting, some students really desire this kind of book.

And yes, it was very politically uncorrect, not that that matters, but they treated anorexia and murder like they were jokes. If it had been a little bit more terrible I would have laughed my head off, but then the film would try to take itself seriously and the plot would belly flop again. So it was just boring.

This movie seems to be going for the small-town, offbeat mocumentary ambience of truly funny films like \\"Waiting for Guffman\\", but fails miserably, there are simply no characters to like and there is none of Christopher Guest's subtlety whatsoever anywhere. Kirstie Alley is more over-the-top here than in her Pier One commercials. Kirsten Dunst does her one-note goody two-shoes stuck with bad people routine.

All it has are some broad jokes combined with cheap shots at undeserving targets.One of my favorite movies is South Park; I can definitely tolerate gross-out humor and un-PC satire. But Drop Dead Gorgeous lacks South Park's skill, smarts and its underlying sweetness. The jokes in Drop Dead Gorgeous come across as mean at least...and frequently vile... It has the same,... vibe of Very Bad Things or Happiness, but is less watchable because it thinks it's funny.I found a couple of chuckles at the beginning, but the movie quickly spent its limited appeal. Since the movie fails to generate any interest in its characters or plot, and it's not particularly funny, there was no reason to keep watching.

Well throughout this movie I was plauged with thoughts of everything from the terrible acting to my laundry. The performances by heavyweight Kirstie Alley was less than mediocre (but I'm blaming a bad script) while performances by Kirsten Dunst and Denise Richards were dull at best. Put all of that in with a bad plot, terrible writing, and an ending that should've stopped twenty minutes sooner, and you have Drop Dead Gorgeous. However, there was one entertaining aspect to this terribly boring movie, and that was the performance of Will Sasso.

Of course we have here the famous Kirsten Dunst & Denise Richards, whose popularity would have been enough to pull a crowd to watch the film. But it takes more than that for the viewers to really appreciate its contents...& that's where the plot comes in.A seemingly light, humorous, film documenting a beauty pageant turns out to be an eye opener on the lives & dreams of the aspiring contestants, including those that surround them.

But power-hungry parents, girls striving to win, and wacked up judges make the pageant more than a fun activity. It is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my life. Familiar faces such as Kirsten Dunst, Kirstie Alley, Ellen Barkin, Denise Richards, and Brittany Murphy make you laugh out loud through out the whole movie. But it is a movie where you have to follow the storyline instead of having it jump out at you. Drop Dead Gorgeous is Drop Dead Hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps not a revolution, but definitely fun.","review":"If you mixed 'Fargo' with 'Waiting for Guffman', you might get something a little like 'Drop Dead Gorgeous'. The humor's none too subtle (and some of the characters really get savaged) but it's hard to dislike a film that has such a wacky sense of fun.Central performances are strong and stable, with Denise Richards in particular providing a clever main hate figure. Occasionally the humor takes a dive towards the cheap, but overall it's heartwarming and just surreal enough. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where'd this movie come from!","review":"I can't understand how such a wonderful film could remain relatively obscure. I saw it on a whim and now I can't recommend it enough. This film is hilarious, ridiculous, and very moving all at once. There are fine performances all around but Kirsten Dunst is absolutely amazing. In what would at first seem to be a simple spoof of a beauty pageant, she made me care what happened to her character. Along with the very funny main plot is a touching view of small town life and the desperation to escape it. My only regret about this movie is that I did not discover it sooner. What more can one say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure when you order this it is for REGION #1 in the U.S.","review":"Couldn't watch it - more like \\"dead weight\\" due to the U.K. offering being a REGION 2 release.Would not play here in California.Live & Learn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and funny movie!","review":"My husband called it a \\"chick\\" flick but it's very funny and entertaining!

I sat through it once when it first came out, then again when my sister told me to watch it. I'm from minnesota, actually near Pine City. This is a scandinavian area and they portrayed miss Pine City as an asian girl. That's the only part of the movie I laughed at, not with. Do your research a litt.e Minnesota is not a trailer park trash state, and it seemed to me the people acted more like people of some parts of west virginia....I have a sense of humor, but wow. This is a dumb movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste Of Time and Money","review":"The language was terrible....the plot was a joke and I was totally dissapointed in Kirstie Alley. She has always been one of my favorites. I should have rented this first....I wasted my money on the DVD. If you must, rent this first..why does Hollywood think the \\"f\\" word must be in every movie. Very few movies anymore do not have the \\"f\\" word. They also use the Lord's name in vain which is AWFUL and UNNECESSARY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I can officially say that Drop Dead Gorgeous is the worst movie I have ever seen. Kirstie Alley, first of all, eliminates any potential quality that a movie may have. Secondly, Kirsten Dunst would not be my first pick for a contestant in a beauty pageant. I ran from the theater wildly swinging at the air and howling. I nearly clawed out your eyes before the fire department turned the hose on me. In addition, I laid in a ditch, devoid of purpose. empty. hollow. your thick tongue swollen in your parched mouth...voice hoarse you called to the heavens for answers, but none came."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun.","review":"I was really impressed with this movie. It is fun-loving and very funny. Drop Dead Gorgeous has a great idea and takes an almighty swipe at Beauty Pageants. If only there were more of Denise Richards I would of given it 5 stars...Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst) is a lovely high-school student who has suddenly decided to take place in the Mount Rose Teen Beauty Pageant. She is competing against the bitchy Denise Richards and many suprises are in stall for them all.....Fun, enjoyable and hilarious - Drop Dead Gorgeous is a great movie to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drop Dead Gorgeous","review":"In the spirit of Heathers and Jaw Breaker, Drop Dead Gorgeous is a hilarious look at the politics of popularity. This movie had me laughing out loud! Ellen Barkin and Allison Janney were completely and funnily over the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"I loved this movie. I guees I saw it back when it first came out in movie theaters. I went with a couple of my friends and they all loved it to. I think that it had an excellent cast everyone fit their part well. I really dont think guys would like it though but I might be wrong because all the guys I have talked to about didnt think it was any good but I would definetely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny comedy that was awfully overlooked","review":"This movie was truly funny! Listening to all the actresses attempting to do a Midwestern accent is so hilarious. Thought most jokes centered around women, especially rather skanky Leslie and her amazingly energetic boyfriend, not to mention the pervert judge who claims he doesn't like young women, it still was funny to watch. I was glad to see that Amber fianlly got her dream, because she deserved it. And Becky got what she wanted, to be crowned queen. This is a great one to watch with the girlfriends if you're not out looking for a 'meaningful' movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood ridicules middle America...","review":"This movie thinks it's Fargo meets Best In Show...it's not. It's a witless, smug, mean-spirited film that relentlessly ridicules middle America and middle American values. I was offended by this film, and I live in Los Angeles! How such talented actresses got talked into doing this movie is a mystery to me. For a much better Kirsten Dunst film buy Bring It On. Trust me. Drop Dead Gorgeous is the pits."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of money and time","review":"I can't believe the rating this movie has.

It never did..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I am so thankful that I rented this movie instead of buying it. This movie was tasteless, the plot was pointless, to sum it up it was definately a waste of time and money. Hollywood could have done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"All the characters were stupid and unrealistic. They were either demonized or \\"drop dead good\\" and what was the point of blowing all those damn people up anyway? I didn't think the movie was very good and I think some very good actresses wasted their time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute trash!","review":"I feel sorry for all of the actresses in this movie. it was a complete waste. it really WAS terrible-the script was junkie and flaky, the acting was horribly unbelievable and the plot couldn't even be more ironic. Who wants to see a beer can burnt to a woman's hand? \\"Drop Dead Gorgeous\\" is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Do your brain a big favor by not watching this movie, which should have been called \\"Drop Dead Garbage\\". A major disappointment and waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drop Down to the Bottom","review":"I thought this was a very stupid movie. It wtarts off with a pleasant beauty pageant and suddenly gets into murder and gore . This \\"comedy\\" went right down the drain with me and with some people I know who have seen it. I recommend for anyone that has real movie taste to skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I expected!","review":"I have to candid about the movie. It wasn't as good as I thought is would be. In the previews they said that it was a good movie and then I went and rented it and I thought that it could of been much better. I thought that the movie was actually pretty asinine. If people thought it was funny I'd have to say they were wrong. Its was a futile movie; I thought it was hopeless and without effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say stop the tape","review":"My co-worker made me get this, thinking I would like it. Not only didn't I like it...I was fast forwarding praying for it to end. Never did see the end.Anyway thank goodness I got the VHS for like 25c. when in doubt buy the VHS so you can toss it.

You better keep your money and spend it for something good. If I could give zero stars I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't stop laughing","review":"I could not stop laughing when I saw this movie. It is just so funny. All of the accents are very well done and the writing is excellent...you should see this movie when you are in the mood for a lighter film, especially if you want to laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"WASN'T THE GREATEST MOVIE, BUT IT WAS HELLA FUNNY","review":"This wasn't the greatest movie, but it wasn't trying to be. \\"Drop Dead Gorgeous\\" is definitely THE funniest movie based on a beauty pageant. \\"Gorgeous\\" doesn't really have any punch lines or planned jokes. The comedy just seems to come out of nowhere and hit you in the face like a brick, literally. I laughed really hard and I know you will too. Worth a viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've watched this about 15 times and I would watch it again.","review":"This is currently my favorite movie (Gladiator and Matrix are my other two favs) and I laugh every time I watch it many times thoughout the movie. My wife and I quote many lines from the movie and even though she didn't like it that much the first time, she absolutely loves it now. The movie can seem a little shocking the first time with all the bad stuff that happens and how lightly the characters take it but once you realize that the movie crosses all boundaries and pokes fun at everything and everyone, it just makes you smile. Kirsten Dunst is incredibly cute. All the characters are very funny, probably about a 100 funny lines in the movie, although Kirstie Allie can be annoying since her accent seems more Spanish than Minnesotan, but then she probably hangs out with her \\"husband's many Mehican workers\\".Awesome movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"This movie is \\"off-the-hook\\"! The Minnesota accents add to the humor (everyone sounds like Bobby's Mom on the cartoon Bobby's World). This is clearly a movie to watch after you have had a bad day. The rivalry between Amber (Dunst) and Becky (Richards), clearly adds edge to this obvious and predictable comedy. If you like Saturday Night Live satirical and parody humor, this is the movie for you. The over exaggeration of tragedy adds to the slapstick comedy element of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is HILARIOUS !!!","review":"Being a huge Kirsten Dunst fan AND a pageant contestant, this movie was just perfect for me. It manages to portray the bad side of pageantry - the backstabbing, the conflict of interests, rigged judges etc.. in a way that will make you laugh SO hard.. sometimes TOO hard !!You'll love the humor if you understand Buffy-type jokes, pop culture references and, well, if you never lived in a trailer. Kirsten Dunst is her usual sweet & sassy talented self, and I even succeeded at seeing Denise Richards as a real actress for a few minutes. This is not renting material - you're going to want to watch this movie over and over again !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the actresses but unfortunately not the movie.","review":"There were some funny moments but considering the talent involved it was a letdown. If you want real fall down funny watch Waiting for Guffman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaking Good Rock'N'Roll","review":"Both DVD and CDs are incredible... Seems after playing with J Page, The Black Crowes found their path back to the freaking good rock'n'roll. There is not a track I dislike in the album, and the DVD quality is amazing. I wish I could have seen them alive, but who knows... another time. You will find everything in the show: R&B, Blues, Rock, Accoustic, duet guitar solos and more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy damn!","review":"I always heard people say that the Black Crowes were one of those bands to bring back rock 'n' roll. I always believed them but I never really... UNDERSTOOD them. After hearing this show, I now know EXACTLY what they meant.This is just pure, raw, solid rock and friggin' roll. Phenomenal stuff. The horns and the backup singers add a whole new element to the show, and the band themselves are spot-on with their playing.If you want a new rock album, buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I am very biased here as I don't believe the Crowes can do any wrong...and as such this review is simply my opinion that they have delievered a great live performance once again. The group, the backup singers and the horns make a powerful listening rock and roll experience. That's it. Simple. If you like The Black Crowes, you will love this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chris Robinson's Opus!","review":"When the Black Crows first hit, Rolling Stone did a very nice review on the band. One of the things Chris Robinson talked about was the live concert done by Humble Pie in the early 70s called \\"Rocking the Fillmore\\" where all the crowd noise and talking between Steve Marriot and the crowd was left in the recording. If you haven't gotten this, don't wait any longer. It's one of the best rocking live albums ever done and Chris talked about how much he loved that album and that he wanted to do a live one like it. Well, this is the one. This cd is one of the rockingest most powerfull live albums I've heard in a long time. This is the one he always wanted to make and you need to do yourself a favor and get it because they nailed it ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brief History of Neoliberalism","review":"A very good and simply written overview of the development of neo-liberalism in the 20th century and beyond.

We're toast.Read this book and see why we can't win."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Flexibility within single minded extreme views","review":"The most compelling argument I can say about Harvey's Neoliberalism is this; Harvey looks at every extreme view point and over emphasis it. At no point during his argument does he make a note to how the communist views that he expresses do not grow economies. He shows no regard to the truth of Adam Smith's points made so many years prior. Truthfully there has never been a successful communist nation that has not become authoritarian in some way. Even China has adopted the means of success called \\"CAPITALISM\\". Milton Friedman makes a wonderful counter argument to Harvey that is rooted in truth un like Harvey. Don't waste your time, if you want to get the gist of this book with out reading it just watch the bias news networks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This theory is a hoax","review":"This book assumes that political forces unco-opted by special interests are really in control of policy. What a hoot! The book starts out with a very confused and misrepresented history and has an especially bad discussion in which Reagan is given credit for economic hardships imposed by Carter in his last six months in office in an attempt to turn around the economy which had been sunk.It seems like the main reason to write this book was to call Reagan and other \\"autocratic\\" supposed fellow travelers, that are all lumped together as a group, a \\"liberal\\" and is nothing more than an elaborate insult not only to the people mentioned in the book but to anyone's intelligence that has the misfortune to pick it up and read it. What is missing are a lot of the details that would make such a gross generalization meaningful, which of course like all gross generalizations isn't really possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pray that it gets remastered","review":"I could understand the audio from the live footage being shoddy (though the review from the person who owned the laserdisc version makes me question this) -- but the audio from easily remastered sources (the videos, the filmed bits) is equally atrocious. It looks like the company just used the old VHS master to make this DVD and didn't do an ounce of remastering, reprocessing, or restoration -- much like companies in the mid-'80s rushed out catalog CDs made from album masters.Avoid wasting your money on this, and instead spend your time pestering Image Entertainment to do this DVD *right.*"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD DREAMS ARE MADE OF THIS!","review":"What a disappointment! The very first DVD that I decide to buy is a complete stinker. The video quality is marginal, like a copy of an old videotape. The sound quality is terrible: ranging the gamut from muffled to slightly distorted vocals because of a too-loud transfer. But that's not the worst of it...after you suffer through it all and think you're finally going to enjoy the last video which is \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\\", they start rolling credits over the video! Would it have killed them to wait three minutes for the video to end before rolling the credits! Obviously a rush job designed to make a quick buck, this deserves to be left on the shelf!

Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"OK, first let me start off by saying that I had already owned this Eurythmics concert on laserdisc. Since I was replacing my lasers with DVD's I bought this one over again. I am now sorry that I did 'cause it was a total waste of money. The sound quality is the most awful I've ever heard on a DVD. I should have listened to some of the reviews warning me of this. My laserdisc copy is much, much better. To make matters even worse there is nothing extra on this DVD (not even an interesting menu). All it contains are the song titles on the opening screen. Releasing sound quality like this should be a crime. However if you would still like to purchase this I will sell you mine for a cheaper price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet dreams - The bad dream.","review":"The concept of this compilation was interesting in the 80' but the \\"scenettes\\" with the puppies look very old fashioned now.

After doing some poking around on Rio message boards, I learn that this is very common when the Eigen or Nitrus is jostled. Some fixes include upgrading the firmware, reattaching the hard drive's ribbon to the main board, or just whacking the unit against the table a few times. Unfortunately, like most people, none of these worked for me.The Eigen is a piece of junk. I wouldn't buy it again if a comparable unit were within $100. It just isn't worth the risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Garbage, Lousy Customer Service","review":"If I could give a \\"0\\" I would. I bought the Rio Eigen with high hopes that it would be a cool, convenient way to have music when I worked out. From the beginning I had trouble with the software - and I am no computer newbie.

It combines all of the failings of the other books with a boring and unbelievable story. I didn't enjoy Tycho Celchu's problems dealing with the squadron's newest droid (who in many ways is a clone of C-3P0). I also felt that the lack of realism was mostly due to the complete stupidity of the Imperials and the grossly imbalanced casualties that are handed out during battle. Has anyone else played TIE Fighter, or X-Wing Alliance? There is more to blowing up capital ships than flying in and lobbing proton torpedoes at maximum range. The dogfights seemed slow and detracted from the very real threats to the Republic by becoming so character driven. Corran (as usual) was rather annoying, particularly when he drew attention away from the main characters, and the major plot. This is one of the weaker ones of the series, buy The Courtship of Princess Leia, or The Bacta War instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book in the Series","review":"I read the book and I still couldn't figure out what the \\"Gamble\\" was that Wedge took.

This is not a documentary I would show to general, secular audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough !!!","review":"There is no denying the gifts that Ben Carson was given nor can anything take away from the good he has done, the levels he has achieved. But this book does not paint him as a very appealing person. Not particularly well written, this quickly became a tedious series of self-promotions and one wonders if he is as pleased with himself as C. Murphey leads us to believe. The message of the importance of a supportive family and persistence was lost and what could have been an inspirational biography came across as irritating and nearly impossible to relate to. Its great to be proud of your achievements, but climb down from the mountain."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a marvelous person I am","review":"Gifted HandsThe title says it all. This is a rather poorly written admittedly impressive rags to riches story, but the author's sole purpose in writing the book seems to be self-adulation. \\"Gifted Hands\\" might be a good title for a story about somebody else, but for the author to apply it to himself aptly describes his egotistic personality, which becomes rather boring and tedious when it forms such a large part of the narrative. I must admit that I didn't finish the book because the emphasis on self-adulation was a real \\"turn off\\". Also there is too much material which is completely irrelevant and unnecessary.

Once in a strange rage he almost stabbed a friend with his new knife. This was a one time thing, it happened in an argument in the friends bedroom, not in the streets. When he went home he was a ashamed and determined to control this anger problem before it grew into anything. How on earth does that constitute 'knife weilding street fighter'?! It is as if readers digest did not even read the book themselves. Fools like this should not be allowed such positions in life. Perhaps they should have a an assisted living center for all such idiots--- it would be cheaper than paying them money to embarrass their own intelligence--- but with the same purpose-- have other people take care of all their needs, because they cant make it on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gifted Hands","review":"I had to read Gifted Hands, by Ben Carson for school.

I enjoyed reading this book because it was about real life. It was very interesting to hear the doctors in the story doing their jobs so well and caring about the people they were taking care of. The story touched my heart when it described the tension the doctors went through during surgery and the time it took to help separate the two babies in the operating room. During the surgery, the babies lives were at stake, needing blood, and all the workers in the room went as far as offering their own blood until it became available from the Red Cross.

Reason for 4 stars is lock design: it is rather hard to put them on. The lock hook pointing backwards - some dexterity and patience required, taking them off is easy. The actual watch looked somewhat smaller than picture on the web page conveys, but dial is quite readable, rich looking and proportional to lady's hand.

He liked it because it had a rectangular face and he felt it had a retro look. I liked it for several reasons. First would be that it is an eco drive and I don't have to worry about batteries. My husband has a watch that doesn't need batteries and he is very satisfied with it. Second would be that it has a marker for each hour. I've had a dress watch for years that only has a marker for the 12, 3, 6, 9 hours and it is a little difficult to know the exact time. Next would be the bling! Not only does it have crystals around the face, but also on the bracelet links.I read all the customer comments and agree with the customer who said it was prettier in person than on the web. It is just beautiful. My husband was able to remove the links himself. I have a very small wrist and this watch does not look large on me.

I mainly use at work in an office building in a no cubicle area near a busy road, rail track, airport landing path, stadium.Just wearing it reduces the noise level considerably. Playing any audio while the noise cancellation is off itself is helpful. With noise cancellation on a very soft audio is sufficient to work almost complete peace. There is a small level of discomfort with noise cancellation on. And ergonomically I would say I would give it 3 out of 4. And at this price I believe it is a bargain.Within a couple of days of buying this I forgot to turn it off one night and drained the battery that came with it. Some rechargeable batteries are good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Happy With Them","review":"Purchased these headphones in Oct 2006 after being disappointed with cheaper Noise-Canceling headphones that were not as effective.

Put them on BEFORE you flip the noise-canceling switch and you'll immediately notice a huge reduction in exterior noise.(the leather covered earpieces are deep and wide enough to cover most ears and seal out a great deal of noise). Switch on noise-cancellation and you'll be amazed how quiet it is.5. Real Leather Padding on earpiece and headband (not that cheap plastic stuff that starts flaking off in a few months.CONS: 1.

The noise canceling does a good job on background hum and even on voices, which sound tinny and distant. I find they are comfortable for long periods of time.The sound is OK, if the NC on. Kind of heavy on the bass, while the highs sound faint and a bit strange to me. They don't compare to my Audio-techinca M30's at home. But still I use and prefer the NC set at work. Now I don't have to have the music on all day, and the volume can be lower when it is on.The 'heavy duty' (non-alkaline) batteries that came with the headphones lasted about 20 hrs.

Briefly, the noise cancelling works extremely well, they're comfortable, and they fold up into a very small package for being over the ear phones (with my ears, anyways). That said, I was very disappointed with the sound quality when the noise cancelling was turned off, although when turned on they sound really good on the low end, even if the highs are somewhat muted. My only concern at this point is how long the batteries will last since there's no way I'm going to use these without the noise cancelling turned on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Of course Bose are the best but I could not phantom paying $300 for headphones that I use only when I fly, and I fly a lot.

Just one guy's opinion.These are really good headphones for the money. Yes, they're not Bose. They don't claim to be. BUT for the money, these are a great alternative! They are VERY effective at canceling airplane noise and some other noise. It seems to cancel the lower frequencies well but some other noise passes right through. They also don't block voices very well, so I wouldn't recommend them for in the office. But the drone of a bus or plane is virtually eliminated!Sound quality of audio is not as bad as some reviews will lead you to believe. Not superior by any means, but they have a nice quality to them. And I found them comfortable even for extended wear, but would not adivse them for people with tiny heads as I have a huge cranium and still wear them at the smallest setting.I give it a five stars primarily because of the price. If I paid Bose money for this product, I'd probably only give it 2 or 3 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noise Reducing","review":"This product does well at reducing minor noise. I believe it was designed with air travel in mind and it does indeed cancel out background noise such as the sound of the plane's engines or the hum of a refrigerator. It does not cancel louder noises, such as a lawnmower engine, but does mute it somewhat. The main problem I have with it is that it plays music satisfactorily when plugged into a CD player, but when plugged into a computer it developes an irritating hum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Amazon and Vibecellular","review":"Amazon and Vibecellular represent these headphones to be scullcandy brand, which they clear ARE NOT.

The fine print will be sure to more than double your plan costs.My recomendation:Anyone but AT&T"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problematic AT & T Customer Sevrice","review":"After I placed the order from Amazon, I called the ATT customer service to work with the phone plan. As I haven't got enough amount ($800) in my debit card account, the guy told me to go to a ATT direct store to pay the phone service deposit of $800. When I got to the store, the representative told me that I cannot pay the deposit without a phone number. And they seems do not know anything about the connection of Amazon with ATT about this phone + service plan. After several visits to that shop, I still cannot get a phone number. I finally cancelled the order from Amazon. I think the representatives in ATT do not know much about the system of their company and they really need more training before they can serve customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst EVER BUILT!!!","review":"The phone sometimes shuts off itself. Plus, network setting is hobbile too. However the worst of all, it is definately not the user friendly phone at all. I definately want to go back to my old Samsung so~~~ bad. Finally, AT&T Customer service was my worst nightmare. I usually had to wait for 45 minutes and they charge roaming even when you are right in the middle of downtown!!

Their problems resolution department acknowledged that they owed me a credit but said that they were getting the same run around from the online division and were powerless to do anything about it! So I am out an extra $142 with no recourse.

My roommate and I both have the same service but always has a much better signal.The worst feature is the loud cracking sound that happens about once every minute. It is much louder than the voice on the other end and acturally hurts when it happens.The internet takes forever to load...when it works.The sim card dislodges in the middle of a conversation.I'm buying a new phone tomarrow after having this one for much too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst reception ever","review":"I love the look and style of this phone, but by far it has the WORST reception I've ever heard.

Thank god I bought the warranty because I've gone throught 2 replacement phones and spent probably about 5 hours at the Tmobile store trying to get the bluetooth hooked up to my G4 ibook. Bluetooth was about 1/2 the speed of a dial-up phone connection. A cool toy, but not really practical for surfing the web. Granted, I do live in a basement apartment, but the only way I get reception inside is to stand right next to the window. Also, I need to keep the phone locked at all times, because otherwise it starts calling random numbers in my phone book.

It looks cool and it has a lot of features and is easy to navigate but where it counts it really sucks. It gets no signal, and trust me, it's not the service because I returned the phone and got a more expensive Motorola that gets a better signal, you can see the color screen in the sunlight and I can hear the person I'm calling. I tried to give this phone a chance but when I made a few calls on it I could not hear the person on the other end at all.

The maximum sound (both ringer and call volume) in this phone is almost equal to the minimum sound with my previous Samsung A500 Sprint phone.Other than the issue with the audio volume I am very happy with the phone, but once again AT&T has a very bad customer service.

The display is essentially impossible to read in sunlight or even interior light brighter than a 60-watt bulb. The photos are awful.

It comes with many features, feels solid and high quality in your hands, and it is small and stylish with a large color screen. The drawlback of the phone are that the display is hard to see in bright light. Also, it can be hard to use until you get used to all the menus and such. Overall, this phone is an excellent phone and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.But ATT tested my anger managment skills. They charged more than the starting price and added on all the extra cost features that I didn't ask for! They also charged 88 dollars for roaming when I went to New York!

Right now I thoroughly enjoyed my T637. BTW, T610 is being given away for free with a contract at Cingular. Don't get me wrong, I'm a great fan of amazon, but this is got to be the most ridiculous deal I've seen in a long time.

I don't know if it's checking if I have voicemail or what, but almost anything within five or six feet that has a speaker chirps a little machine song every minute or so.

They will blame anything on it too: hurricane, sunspots, \\"It's new technology,\\" \\"somebody didn't renew antenna tower contracts\\" (that is on Interstate 95, if you can believe it). Don't do it!!! You will eventually be very unhappy!!! If you have a brief weakness and try it out, and you get their service, and have slight problems in the first 30 days, then send the phone back IMMEDIATELY. You are, otherwise, consigning yourself to whatever they want to do to you.DO NOT sign a contract with them. That is the only thing that has saved me is that I couldn't bring myself to sign the contract. That means that I have two phones that cost me [a lot]--because the rebate requires the contract--but at least I don't have to give them money for service that reminds me of spotty cell phone service ten years ago.'Love the phone?

It's screen is extremely clear and readable under most conditions- it's hard to reat with the screen facing the sun. The screen smudges easily, but it seem quite scratch-resistant. This phone could use mroe memory, though. It's feature-packed, like many Sony Clies are- it has a stopwatch, calculator, mini-PDA features, bluetooth, infared, and pre-installed games, ringtones, themes, and pictures. It came with a headset.

No, long criticism!","review":"This essay is more about Roger Scruton's ideas about Spinoza's philosophy that about Spinoza's philosophy itself. He spends too much of this short book on criticism of Spinoza's geometric method of presentation and hardly any on his vision.Typically he says on the last page of the book that \\"it is no accident that Spinoza should have called forth so sharp an attack from the other false prophet of atheism, Nietzsche,\\" and concludes with a quote from Nietzsche.If Scruton considers Spinoza a \\"false prophet of atheism\\" he has self-confessed an ignorance of Spinoza's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Helpful, A Least to This Novice","review":"Got this as a preliminary guide to Spinoza to supplement \\"A Book Forged in Hell\\".

Only an EP though, but nevertheless, a great album that gets you in the mood for De-loused or Frances.Cut that City is traditional Mars Volta experimental noise, and then launches into some pretty sweet vocals midway. It then transitions into Concertina which is more slow paced than the previous song, but definitely a good interlude for the fast paced, excellent conclusion of Eunuch Provocateur.Overall, definitely worth the price because you still get a great Mars Volta experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mars Volta's Alpha","review":"Tremulant is certainly worth a listen. Between ATDI's Vaya, and this EP, it's nice to see Omar and Cedric grow as musicians and explore a sound they grab by the horns in this 3 track roller coaster. By Mars Volta standards, perhaps with some time traveling, they might have just released this whole EP as one song...Still clocking in under the time Cassandra Gemmini (Track's 5-12 on Frances the Mute) takes to play through. The cd flows well and seems like the pot warming up, while de-loused remains to be that same pot boiling over and shooting molten hot water all over your body."},{"rating":"2","title":"voltage","review":"Cedric and Omar freeing themselves from the restraints of da punk rawk, these dudes now sound more like a bi-lingual led zep than anything else.

What makes Mars Volta superior to ATDI (in my humble opinion) is the way they push the envelope of this 'hard-core' that ATDI masterfully...uh, mastered. It's ATDI Version 2.0. its an upgrade. they arent afraid to experient with new sounds, all the while keeping that twangy 'kick you in your face' guitar riffs that we all love so much. i love that they use keyboards and i love that this band isn't afraid to write songs longer than 3 minutes.but what i love most about it is that it still has that ATDI flare...music that makes you drive really fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 not 5 but i round up","review":"great cd. track one sounds like at the drive in, which shows the connection volta has with atdi and is a bridge from atdi to the mars volta. In fact this album is sort of a bridge. These three songs are a sample of what volta was is and will be, and is a whole lot of fun to listen to... anyways track two is standard volta rock, and track 3 is weird volta rock. IMO 3>2>1, although its hard to say one track is the best because they differ in style. Ive heard their other two cds -- they both have a lot more material than this one, but hey, all great things must have a begginning. and this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At the Drive-In evolved","review":"When At the Drive-In broke up last year, many kids were left heartbroken. The members went their separate ways, 3 of the 5 members forming Sparta, the other 2 forming The Mars Volta. Man, what a debut this is. Less intense and furious than ATD-I's last album, but full of experimental ideas. Imagine this as one direction ATD-I could have gone. It blends great guitar riffs with subtle hints of jazz and a bit of electronica laced in between. Very good stuff, one of the best CDs I've probably ever bought. It falls short of a perfect score due to the fact that there's only a scant 3 tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Al Sihrat Hides Behind a Wardrobe of Eunuchs...","review":"Amazing, ... amazing. Out of the two bands that were spawned by ATDI's death (Sparta beign the other), The Mars Volta are ahead by miles. I'll just say right now, a lot of the \\"emo\\" ATDI fans are going to hate this release. It's very experimental, sounding like a mix of Syd Barret era Pink Floyd, Fugazi, and nothing else. Cedrix's voice is just beautiful on this album and Omar's guitar playing is out of this world.Cut That City has a long intro followed by a schizophrenic pass of beat changes and keyboards, it's perfect and Concertina doesn't dissapoint either, the only song that resembles ATDI at all...but there's just something even better about the song. Then we have the masterpiece of the EP, Eunuch Provovateur, it's pure gold, I can't even describe it.

It's their slow-fast transition that caught my attention, so well done and natural, not forced at all.\\"Eunuch Provocateur\\" song has a pretty good latin rythm. \\"Cut that city\\" is more punk and is the song I like the least from all Mars Volta songs.What is Mars Volta? it's latin, it's psychedelic, it's punk, it's hard music , it's soft music , it's totally disorganized music. They have strange lyrics, very metaphorical (there is a website dedicated to the undertanding of the lyrics). Years ago, lots of great band incorporated mid-orient influences in their music.

She has fine, but pretty wavy hair and it appears that it'll grown in very curly when she gets older (like her father). Though it hasn't grown in fully yet, I decided to hunt for a good detangler now to prevent nightmarish experiences with brushing hair later.Suave For Kids Awesome Apple Detangler does seem to make my daughter's hair easier to brush, but that's about it. Even the tiniest amount makes her normally shiny hair look dull and flat. The smell seems okay at first (like green apple flavored gum), but then has an after-scent of cheap hairspray that makes me feel a little sick if I smell it too long (can't imagine how gross it could be for her if she has my nose :) ). It may not impact everyone that way, but if you have a kid with fine hair and/or you or your child have a sensitive nose, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable Detangler","review":"The Suave Apple Detangler works very well.

Yet, of course, we're supposed to feel they're all \\"normal\\" -- just a bit, well, odd. The only thing odd is that people actually consider this to be a compelling story.

Yes, its a long narrow lock - if you are going to lock to other things like parking meters, you might want a different model, one that is wider. The key works just fine (try WD40 if it sticks). The mounting bracket... really??? I have owned kryptonite locks all my life and never once used the mounting bracket. As someone noted, this model is significantly lighter than the more secure NYC model U locks; if you are carrying the lock all the time, that can be a factor.Good standard lock.

The optimized defragmentation program states it 'packs' all your data to the front of the drive, thus lessening future defragmentation.

The filmmakers balance this overall perspective with a sharp focus on a half-dozen individual musicians whose dedicated efforts to sustain and improve their artistry while struggling to make a living are representative of all 200 members. What the film does best, however, is capture the pure, transforming joy of creating music, no matter the circumstances or setting. To their credit, the filmmakers never preach or try to manipulate the viewer's emotions; they simply let the strength and resilience and ambition of the musicians speak for itself. Their collective story is heartbreaking, eye-opening, surreal, often funny and profoundly uplifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving movie!

Once you get theT8 Bulb, wire nuts, and screws to mount it with, and wire it up, you realize that the only way to install the wiring shield is to disassemble the connectors for the light-bulbs. Disassembly is easy, but getting the little machine screws to bite to reinstall it is non-trivial once the light is hanging.

The book is short and did not give me enough details to his insight on Vegas except that he was a gambloholic. It left me wanting to know more about this man and his rise to power. Honestly I enjoyed more his accounts as the publisher of the Hollywood Reporter and the power he had there than his accounts of trying to build the Flamingo.

Of the books I was disappointed by, this book, \\"A New Hope,\\" is the lamer of the two. \\"A New Hope,\\" huh? What an absolute misnomer. Lucasfilm crammed the script into this book, as well some awful childrens' art, and a bunch cartoons that refer to Star Wars. I DIDN'T BUY this book for the script, which can be found a zillion other places, I DIDN'T BUY it for some weak attempts at humour that play off of Star Wars, and I CERTAINLY didn't shell out my money for some nursery school scribblings!

It just doesn't sound every now and then, probably every once in 10 to 20 times, failure rate increases over time. A shame since the watch is very nice and keeps the time very accurately. We have had 5 Timex watches in the family over the past ~6 years. Out of those 5, 3 had to be returned due to failures. The other two have run for ~4 and ~6 years with no problem now. While these two certainly provide a good value for the money, a success rate of 40% is not very convincing and the idea to outsource quality control to the customer might be fashionable but will hopefully not turn out a successful business strategy after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking watch, too bad it doesn't work properly","review":"I liked the looks of this watch and the reasonable price, but couldn't decide between the black or the white model, so I ordered both. Neither of them worked correctly. The black watch had a DOA indiglo light. On both watches the chronograph would not reset automatically. Another reviewer recommended hitting the button at just the right moment to stop it. Come on, that is not the way it's supposed to work. The instructions clearly state that it will reset to the proper position by itself.In addition, the date can only be advanced by moving the hour hand a full 24 hours for each day you want to advance. I've had date watches for more than 40 years and the last time I saw that was in 1965.On the other hand, if you're not bothered by the above it is a very attractive watch at a reasonable price. I almost kept the white one anyway, but decided to send them both back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tremendous watch for non snobs","review":"I got a big kick out of reading all the reviews on this Timex Men's Expedition Watch #T45951. People complained in reviews about finger prints on the dial, a poor leather strap or not snazzy enough or expensive enough. I think this watch is superb! It keeps great time (which is what a watch is all about), it looks as good as any in my opinion and better than most and it didn't break my budget at around $60.It is easy to set and work the various features, has a wonderfully constructed leather strap that shows quality construction and it can be worn proudly anywhere, even with your peer group. I even wore mine to church and nobody fainted.The best thing is the way the Indiglo light works.I can tell the time anywhere, light or no light. The worst thing is the alarm is very soft and I can't hear it---might be my age and that my hearing aids are out at night. Buy this watch and you will always love to wear it and will always know the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Still Ticks","review":"Dependability and style at a great price, a real value. This Timex Chrono Alarm has more features than I expected. It's packed with more features than watches I've paid much more for. I'm more satisfied with this watch than more expensive watches I own.The dials make sense. You can actually read them. It has two alarms and I was surprised to find it has a great back light. It's possible to catch up the date or to re-adjust for daylight savings without losing your time settings.The only minor issue is that I can't figure out what turns the beep off sometimes.

Every phrase also had the phonetic spelling with/beside it, which I did not need, and made it cumbersome to peruse through the text.

I too was initially surprised at the small size, but the flakes are tasty enough to make size virtually irrelevant.

I took a chance on this because of the value and while it is flavorful, either I didn't realize/see, or the description of the product failed to mention (not sure which it is), this coconut is NOT long, narrow, shredded texture, which is what I expected. This is tiny granules - more like sugar crystals. Even raw sugar granules are larger than these coconut mm's. It doesn't affect the flavor or any recipes (so far). It is just messy working with it as it is more like a fine powder that just gets everywhere when spilled. While I wouldn't buy it again, that decision is based on my preference for shredded coconut; not this price, the flavor, or even the packaging all of which was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good looking pedal cover","review":"I actually didn't do the research and thought this pedal cover was an actual pedal replacement.Oh well.It makes a great gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but maybe a little easy for 5 & 6 year olds","review":"We just got our computer, and my son loves Pooh.

This is rarely heard Baba music, especially to those who are only familier with his \\"Drums Of Passion\\" recordings. The quality of some of the recordings are not great, but I've heard much worse.

I can't believe how much Norton charges for an antivirus program that not only doesn't even function, but whose virus update subscription runs out after a year. Luckily, I had gotten a free copy of this from work to try out. In the days of Mac Classic OS I used Norton products all the time, but I can't recommend any of them anymore.

However, after having the unit in our house, printing less than 3 times a week (on average), we have had to replace both cartridges 2 times in the past 3 months. We do not print books; we normally print maps or recipes from the internet. However, because the printer \\"performs a print head cleaning after each print\\", it wastes ink. EVERY TIME YOU PRINT. Ultimately, my HP DeskJet printer was cheaper to operate, as the ink cartridges lasted much longer.We really feel jaded by the \\"cheap ink\\" campaign Kodak is putting on; it's cheap, but your printer eats it a 2x the rate, so really, it is a break-even venture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great Wireless printer","review":"Yes the Ink is cheaper- will not take that credit away.

Then after hardly using it for a month or so, .....the same thing all over again, jam after jam.I am currently trying to decide if I want to go through the various attempts to make it work or the task of sending for another and packing this one off.

I just replaced both cartridges, cleaned the heads, went to Kodak trouble shooting and it still is no good.Also, the ink runs out really quickly, so it has not proven to be any cheaper than an HP.PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR - DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTERNext day update: I called Kodak. Since the printer was under warranty they sent me a new print head at no cost to me. It got to me in 2 days. HOWEVER, since it needed to be calibrated and I printed a test sheet, my ink supply is down to 1/2 (granted, some of that is due to the calibration and test pages I tried printing when I was trouble shooting.) SO I still don't think this printer is all that much of a bargain. I have a feeling that this is a common problem since the support person I spoke to had no problems sending me the new head. I didn't even suggest it, it was her solution to the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this printer, I really did","review":"Well as many others have said, there are just too many issues with this printer to justify the purchase.Cons (you know it's not good if you're starting with the cons):1) Ink, particularly black, does not last long.2) Wifi is sporadic and sometimes when it says it's connected, it still isn't.3) Print quality is average, at best. Several documents came out with smeared black ink.4) Printer head leaks. Not that it leaks ink all over the inside of the printer, but the printer head needs to be cleaned constantly.Pros:1) Ink is cheap. But, if you're having to buy a cartridge after 50 copies, it's not any cheaper in the long run than, say, HP. So, maybe this isn't a Pro afterall :)For now, I've given up on this Kodak and installed a new Canon.

When you try to bypass this, it won't work and you will have to keep replacing the color cartridge to print only B&W. Otherwise, it's a bit quirky, we've had trouble with it disappearing from the network, only some features work at a time, and we have had to reinstall.

Colors including black have no depth, and are faint. colors are not evenly blended either. You would think Kodak would do better in this department, but I've read dozens of complaints on this printer with other users having the same issue.Lastly is the problem with software compatibility. There are two widely used software programs that I use that lock up while the Kodak printer software is loaded. Kodak gave me a work-around, that only loads minimal resources for the printer, but even that isn't good enough, as I have to kill the Kodak software every time I use these other two (critical to my use) software programs, otherwise the PC will lock up."},{"rating":"1","title":"kodak printer","review":"Was led to understand it used less ink.

Two months ago, the printer began sucking through ink carts for no apparent reason. I'd print a page and the quality stunk. Cleaning the heads resulted in virtually emptying the carts. After replacing them a couple of times, I was ready to call Kodak again. Before I could do so, the print heads seized to the far left again and could not move. This was the last straw!

Well the feeder frequently jams so it's not too useful. The thing is constantly out of ink, even though we hardly use it. And now it just decided to quit working altogether. I've had this for about a year and a half with occasional use, and it seems it's worn itself out already. Avoid this like the plague"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Purchase","review":"The price tag makes it seem like a great purchase, but after buying this printer I quickly found out it isn't. Kodak may boast the least expensive ink cartridge, but this printer burns through them. My wife prints off a few coupons a week, and my kids don't use the printer. If you print at all you'll be replacing the ink cartridges a few times a month. This includes the 10C and 10XL cartridges. The 10 XL includes maybe a 1/4 ounce more ink, but you pay a premium for it. It's the same cartridge with just a little more ink. The printer is the noisiest printer I've heard. The all-in-one features are great, but as a printer it's awful. When you shell out a few bucks for a printer, you end up paying a lot more in ink. Save your money and invest in a quality printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"EATS and DRINKS INK","review":"This has been a HUGE disappointment. Kodak's big claim that they have reduced the price of ink is a JOKE. I go through 3-5 times as much ink as i did with any other printer. AND the biggest complaint is that you cannot use the black cartridge if the color is out and vice versa. Most of what i print can be done using black only, but there is no choice here. If a document you are copying has color, well it uses the color, wether or not you need it. I HATE this printer for this reason. And don't even think of trying to use remanufactured cartridges in this thing. I have had this for about two years now and can hardly wait to buy another all in one printer from anyone but Kodak. Kodak is a big rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good option to buy","review":"I have bought 2 of these printers and both have a malfunction.

I called Kodak Support and they tried to troubleshoot the problem, when nothing worked, the support person advised me that the printer needed to be replaced. I purchased this piece of crap less than 2 years ago, October 2010 to be exact. Do Not Waist Your Money On This Printer!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst headache printer ever.","review":"I had this printer for over a year now. At first everything was running smooth but wasn't too excited about the print quality. Oh well I figured - since the ink is cheap, I would live with it. Not so much, I'm finding myself replacing the ink cartridge twice as many times as my hp, which by the way had better print quality even at \\"fast draft\\" settings (uses less ink). I'm constantly rebooting either the printer or my pc to detect the device. I've compared the reliability of the ethernet connection vs. the USB and both are equally unreliable; having to reboot my machine or the printer itself. I wouldn't be complaining about the ink cost, as long as the print quality is good, but no way, print is very blurred and sloppy. I'll never buy a kodak again."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyers regret","review":"I bought this printer to replace my old HP printer. Big mistake! I got this printer because of the great reviews online, and for the selling point of low ink costs. I didn't realize that it won't print just black if the color ink is low or out. What does black have to do with color????? It also printed documents from the internet initially, but now it will not print any documents imported from the internet. What the heck!!??? Had the driver uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times, updated the driver as suggested by Kodak trouble shooting. Works to print once, then won't print again. Keep getting error msg. Wish I hadn't invested money in this printer. Oh well, live and learn. I am now surfing the internet to see if I can find a quality printer that will function properly more than a few months...wish me luck!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kodak ESP 6150 All-in-One Printer Junk","review":"Won't print black.

At first it would communicate wirelessly with my desktop, but not my laptop. Then, after talking to someone in India, it worked for a few minutes with the laptop. Soon after that it wouldn't work with either computer, so I hooked up a cable between it and the laptop. A while after that it wouldn't even work with a cable. I spent hours on the phone with India and never could get it resolved. Finally bought an HP 8600 Plus and it works flawlessly. Setup was easy and I was printing, scanning and copying within an hour. No wonder Kodak is in bankruptcy. I'll never buy another product from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Buy a Kodak Printer","review":"I have owned and used, in my home, a Kodak ESP 6150 All-In-One printer for one year. It is costing me much more for ink than did the 10 year old Hewlett Packard g55 ink jet printer it replaced. This in spite of their big advertizing campaign claiming they were the solution to the high expense of ink jet printer ink. Each Kodak ink cartridge is less expensive than the competition but contains much less ink and has to be replaced much more often. I print very little color but the color ink cartridge has to be replaced often anyway. The color heads are \\"flushed\\" often to keep them clean so color ink is used even when the printing is black only. The printer is automatically shut down and will not print, even black only, unless a color cartridge containing ink is in place. There appears to be no work-around for this aggravating feature. Of course Kodak knew all this when they were designing the machine and their misleading advertizing campaign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk after one year...","review":"Don't believe the reviews. This is a terrible machine. My first Kodak as I bought into the hype of cheap ink. Ink dries up, I'm guessing, as even with new cartridge it is way to light and not crisp. (I print everyday.) Scan feature on machine no longer works. People can't read my faxes. Anything else? Too late to return it and it was not worth the few months it was working okay. I'm not into disposable electronics. Kodak should be ashamed of itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kodak ESP Office 6150 -- Awful Printer","review":"My husband persuaded me to give up a wonderful HP printer for the Kodak 6150, which is a piece of junk. The packaging on my Kodak black printer cartridges say that each cartridge will print 425 pages. This is a blantant marketing lie; we kept a log of every page we printed, and the B&W cartridge completely expired at 125 pages of text. The printer makes a lot of noise and takes an abnormally long time to warm up before it will print. It is also fussy about feeding paper and jams more than any printer I have ever owned. I would never-ever buy another Kodak printer, nor would I ever recommend this printer to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaper ink doesn't last = no savings, just frustration","review":"Although the print quality is fine for this printer, the ink lasts for about 30-copies if you are lucky. I'm not talking about pictures - you get about 4 pictures. If you only want blk/wht copies of text, the printer won't work if your color ink is out. That makes this product very expensive to use. The ink for my 4 year old HP made 1 1/2 - 2 reams of text copies before running out, all for about 5 dollars more! It was worth it, now I have to make more trips to the store or keep lots of extra ink on hand which is more costly. Save yourself the frustration, purchase another type of printer or make sure you find out how many copies they promise per ink cartridge before purchasing this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of good plastic","review":"This is my second Kodak printer in the last year and a half. The previous model was theKodak ESP 7250 All-in-One Printerand it lasted only 8 months, at least this one lasted 9 months before falling apart. I called Kodak customer support today, and spoke with the following individuals, in order: Ahmed, Mohitosh, Shwet, & Geeta. The last person I talked to (Geeta) hung up on me. I called back and talked with Ahmed and Mohitosh (both cool) and they helped me out. They are sending me a new Kodak ESP 6150, but I bet it doesn't last a year.

It will not print a page of black and white if the color ink cartridge is low. This caused me to make an emergency trip to FedEx Office while I had clients waiting for two copies of an 11 page lease on the other side of town.

I had no idea what kinds of pressures were on children these days and how strongly they are affected by current events until I read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ol workout","review":"Ok I think it is funny how many people complained about this old school but very effective workout. I loved it 10 years ago and I love it today! Michelle and Tracey are a great inspiration and this is sort of where they started. YES it is challenging but if you popped a dvd in and could do every move immediately think of how bored you would get. People- did you ever hear of doing something consistently until you mastered it? This is a workout you should grow into. The moves are there to let you have fun and not get bored so easliy. If you can't do the moves march in place until you pick them up again. Also this is great for working up a sweat and a nice afterburn too! Yes the costumes are hilarious and the moods are overly perky and campy but it is such a good work out you can forget your troubles have a good time and think, \\"my have times changed,\\" while you work your thighs and hips into oblivion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera work is the problem.","review":"While the aerobic moves are challenging - especially for a beginner - the moves aren't the problem. It's the camera work. The camera is constantly changing from full view to close up of the instructors' faces. And since the moves are constantly changing it's hard to keep up because the viewer can't see their legs. This video would have had a much higher rating from me if I could have been able to keep my eyes on their legs to see the move changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"2000 is very misleading, this video was shot in 1994!!!","review":"Okay, so the faster and harder the workout is doesn't mean that it is better for you. Here's a riddle, How many moves does it take to confuse someone? Seriously, this video incorporates very advanced, confusing moves, and is not well produced at all. There are three rejects from the 80's giving you absolutely no instruction and no cues then expect you to be a professional dancer and follow their antics for an hour. They move from one thing to the next without the slightest bit of notice.Definately an advanced workout also. Maybe after viewing the tape 5 or 6 times you could learn the moves, but by that time you're puking over their perky hairdoos and attitudes. Yuck! Save your money, or better yet, buy a serious workout video by Leslie Sansone to lose that weight and get in shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Toning Exercises BUT Terrible Aerobic Workout","review":"I think the toning section of this video is great and very Challenging... BUT the low-impact aerobic section is aweful! The instructors are using fancy moves and changing the moves so quickly. The instructors don't show you how to do the moves. I found this hard to keep up with. When I was finally finished the aerobic workout I didn't feel as if I worked out, because I had to constantly return to the basic step. The aerobic section of this video should have been basic and not so fancy. Therefore I would not recommend this video to anyone unless you're an experienced aerobic instructor. LOL.

He provides some \\"key verses\\" in each chapter but I would hesitate to take his advice on several matters.This book could've also been a lot longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny stuff.

With this book I was expecting (based on advertisements, real reliable, I know) a book filled with witty, saterical observations, yet holding warm insights and encouragment to sort through this culture of Test-a-mints and Maranatha Music to get to the real Jesus and not the hokey version we see what too much of these days. Ya, it wasn't that at all. It was full of bitterness and just plain bad advice (like encouraging church hopping and not commiting), not to mention the childhood stories of a kid growing up in a very weird, not normal \\"christian\\" culture. Like, TV Movie soap opera kind of weird. I am pretty dissappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ironic....","review":"Yeah, this book was humorous for the first chapter, until the author's sarcasm became overwhelming, what I would call full-blown arrogance and hypocrisy. First of all, if you intend to write a whole book centered on ridiculing people for their faults, *AND* claim to follow Christ, something's wrong. Jesus' command to love one another includes everyone--even those insane fundamentalist, Bible-thumping freaks you come across. There is such a thing as constructive criticism (which is not used here).What cinched it for me was the irony of sneaking an ad for their magazine at the end of the book. After all that ranting on Christianity becoming a giant sales pitch? Come on now, he should've known better. That was the funniest part, in MY opinion.I'm going back to the bookstore and returning it. I guess he may have started with good intentions, but somewhere along the way lost the concept of Jesus' love and grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly written book","review":"The topic of the book is one that needs to be addressed, but this book doesn't do it justice or provide a solution to the problem. It seems to be more about airing personal laundry, in a poorly written manner, mainly through lists that are not all that humurous. Turner considers himself an outsider when he might better be considered an insider that's had a bad experience or no experience at all. Someone needs to write a better book to handle this subject properly and show this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Account of Christianity Today","review":"it was very funny and it had some very true-to-life points. it will offend some people but its the truth...

The base of the knob is chrome while the surface is brushed nickel. Our bathrooms have expensive Grohe fixtures which we did not want to replace, but we wanted to get brushed nickel towel bars.

I use mapping software to plan bike rides that range from 25 to 100 miles in length. I used to swear by the Street Atlas program, at least up through Version 9. Now I find myself swearing at the newest versions such as 2004, which has what can only be described as a \\"clunky\\" user interface that does not support wide carraige printing and contains errors in the routing of roads here in Maryland that have been changed years ago. If MS Streets and Trips can get these roads right, why can't Street Atlas."},{"rating":"1","title":"A drag","review":"Anyone who's read my reviews of the Delorme Street Atlas books will know I'm a great admirer of good mapping and of Delorme as a mapping company. I've used the early versions of Street Atlas USA for more than a decade, going back to the 1.0 version and bragged about them to friends. I'm sorry to see this great company falling short with their software, gradually declining in their usefulness and usability. The amount of detail for the remote areas on the more recent software releases is receding, the software is becoming too complex to use, and I'm to the point of only recommending Delorme in paper. And awfully sorry to have to say it. I'd offer the opinion that Delorme needs to back up a few paces and rediscover the needs of their loyal buyers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend it.","review":"Like many others, I've used older versions of this program for years. This version is poor. Five to twelve minutes to load on a Pentium 4, 2.6GHz w/512MB RAM is too much. I also purchased the Handheld version. What a ripoff!! I only need the device drivers but can't get them without purchasing the Handheld software. Even attempting to use that version alone, by installing the data files rather than running from CD results in the program not being able to find the data files. The data files, incidentally, are exactly the same as the standard version but it can't find those either. Not an improved program in my estimation, but a rather poor update. Tech support is useless as they don't even respond to email. They've done such a great job of hiding their phone numbers on their web site that I've given up trying to find one. Would be a long distance call anyway, they dont' have 800 numbers to the best of my knowledge.Unhappy DeLorme customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Street Atlas USA 2004, what a PAIN!","review":"VERY poor maps, VERY poor interface. A huge pain to find addresses or points of interest. This is one of the poorest programs (not only maps) I have seen in the last 12 years.The interface is sooo[...] needlesly complicated and ineficent that makes this program unusable. What a shame! Delorme has been in the mapping business for many years.It is really a puzzle to me how Delorme makes this mapping program so difficult to use. You are supposed to use it in your laptop with their earthmate gps receiver too, right? It takes 10-15 minutes to find the addresses or points of interest.This program makes Street and Trips look really good. If you want to put up with its interface and only want to spend 30-40 $ it may help you. Otherwise there are MUCH better alternatives but for a higher price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Elsewhere","review":"This software is a genuine POS! I purchased this based upon a recomendation from someone who used previous releases of this product, I guess Delorme lost thier way for the 2004 release, terrible user interface, no documentation to help get you started, very innacurate unless you create a stop point at every intersection, which kind of defeats the purpose of the software! I played with it for 2 hrs and could not get an accurate route from NY to Wash DC. I purchased Microsofts Streets & trips the following day, it was cheaper $19.95 after rebates, and far easyer to use whith minimal user input! I'll try using delorme again, It has a few features MS doesnt have, But in my opinion it is just too difficult for the average user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has DeLorme lost its way?","review":"It is interesting to speculate on the general feeling at DeLorme these days.Street Atlas 2004 is a genuine turkey, and they must know it.All the previous reviews are accurate, and there's more!They've resurrected the awful \\"Road Warrior\\" interface, and made responses slower.The map accuracy is way off from SA 9, streets are not even the same shape as they were.The GPS accuracy is way off, when the GPS works. I have a mobile setup and so far the GPS tracking works sporadically if at all.There is one feature that I really like, and that is the magnification.As a registered old fart I really like seeing everything at twice the size.I'll be in Maine next week so I plan to call in to DeLorme to drop off my copy and get my money back. 8-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid SA2003 & 4 & Read other One Star reviews - all true.","review":"I completely agree that this is the other most unfriendly SA version ever.

Almost nothing in this application is designed for easy, quick, or intuitive use and the help feature is of very limited value.I purchased SA 2004 Plus primarily for being able to upload multiple addresses from a spreadsheet and then computing the most efficient route. While the software does technically perform this function, the user interface is just so incredibly counter-intuitive that as a practical matter it was nearly impossible to get a route computed. We retained the software for a few months hoping that familiarity would breed usability. It did not. We switched to the less expensive Microsoft Streets & Trips and have been very happy since.

Although I have used it and its predecessor versions for several years, its idiosyncratic user interface is a constant source of irritation. I might feel differently if I used the program frequently enough to learn it well, but for occasional use it is quite non-intuitive and many of its features are both hard to find and difficult to use. For instance, the method of saving map notations and routes is so obscure as to be almost worthless. For finding simple directions, an on-line mapping service like Map Quest is both far easier and faster, although Street Atlas printed maps are better. I have bought upgrades over the years and have few complaints about the quality of DeLorme's mapping database, but Street Atlas the program should be an embarrassment to them; it badly needs a major redesign"},{"rating":"1","title":"Street Atlas 2004 is not too good","review":"I got this from Amazon for $49.99 + free shipping - now I see its lower. The Thomas Guide is not available for my area, so the main reason I wanted this was to make an atlas of the area where I live. First problem is that it boots up very very slowly. But the main problem is that it doesnt show names for all streets like regular maps do - and it doesnt show any street numbers like Thomas Guides do. I printed up several maps but I would never use these to replace my regular folding map. But THAT was the main reason I bought this. I havent used it to find an address and I expect that it does that OK. But then there is always Mapquest for that. One consolation is that at least the price was right = I got it free from SBC.

The only thing I can say bad about it is now I have to wait for Amazon to deliver the rest of the books in this series.Congratulations, Mr. Wolverton, you have topped \\"The Courtship of Princess Leia\\". Please write more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but not the best.","review":"While this book is kind of boring compared to some books I've read, it was good in some ways. For example, it wasn't very fast-paced, but it did set the stage for the rest of the series, which ROCKED! If you are going to read the series, which is good, you have to read this one first. It may be a little slow, but the series is worth it! And it isn't that bad, no matter what I say. I loved it till I read the rest of the series, so you probably will to. And I'm 15, and I still like it, so don't listen to the that 12 and under stuff. This explains a lot of things I didn't understand, and gave me a better picture of Qui-Gon of Obi-Wan's personality. It's a pretty good book. It should be read by every Star Wars or Obi-Wan Kenobi fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The force is with this book","review":"This is the best book I've read in a while. It was so good I just couldn't put it down. Before I knew it, it was dinnertime. Through dinner I read it. I read both this book and the next in the series in 3 hours. It was really good and had the good ol' jedi feeling. Ya know what I mean? I just loved this book. The author put so much feeling into it, as if you were Qui-Gon or Obi-Wan. The force is with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"It was fun reading about Obi-Wan when he's only 12 years old and still learning the ways of the Force! It's interesting finding out more about Qui-Gon Jinn. It was nice to read about the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, now we know what the Jedi's went through to earn thier title!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rising Series","review":"Star Wars, Jedi Apprentice, The Rising Force is destined to become a classic Star Wars Book. Learning about Obi Wan Kenobi's past is very interesting. From Corouscant to Bandomeer this book, in lack of better word's, is perfect. Once I finished this book, I immediately got on Amazon and ordered the others. You should buy this book as soon as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Great insights into the training of a Jedi. My favorite parts are learning about the beginings of Obi-Wan Jedi carreer and his training. Being of the old Star Wars school, Qui-Gon Jinn is not as interesting to me as Obi-Wan.The only problem I have with this book is the price. I didn't realize just how short it was. It took me just an evening to finish. I also had the next book and read it the next night. It seems that these books should have been put together into a much larger book. I felt a little ripped off. I'm going to get the rest of the series from the library:o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating...","review":"I began reading this book to test my son's homework assignment,which was to read through the first chapter. I could not put the bookdown. This is a very entertaining and well thought out series. A must read for a Star Wars fan of any age! The story captures you in the first 5 pages. Within a four hour plane trip, I eagerly read through this book. And on the return trip, series 2 & 3 were equally fulfilling. I can't wait to get the remaining series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top hit......","review":"I just loved this book, it was such a well writen book. The start was great and so was the rest of the book. I have read all of the Jedi Apprentice books that are out and Jude Waton is also doing a great job too! I was disapointed when Qui-gon Jinn did not take Obi-wan Kenobi in this book. Read this book and the rest of the other books you will love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOM!!!","review":"This book talks about Obi-Wan's struggle to be Qui Gon Jinn's Padawan apprentice and shows his training in the beggining and another kid trying to get him angry so he disobeys his Jedi codeand sometimes he is faced with anger. Its shows you the force getting stronger by the minute in parts and sometimes he impresses Qui Gon and sometimes he does not so Qui Gon is tempted to make him his Padawan Apprentice and it has alot of twists and action parts and i reccomend you purchase the second addition to \\"Jedi Apprentice\\" which is called \\"The Dark Rival\\" but you really have to read this one before that one. I defenetly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!","review":"Oh my gosh, I saw this book in the store one day and I knew I had to have it for my own.

I guarantee that you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for children","review":"I readily admit that I am way beyond the age recommendation for this book -- and the other Jedi Apprentice books. BUT WHO CARES?! This is a wonderful read for everyone, actual children and those who are young at heart and love the Star Wars saga. The books bring the established relationship of The Phantom Menace between Obi Wan and Qui Gon into perspective when you look at the start of their time together, and makes the end of TPM all that more devestating. I look forward to the next installment of Jedi Apprentice and wish I could give it more than 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!!! =)","review":"I would just like to say that this is a wonderful book, I couldn't put it down!!

Definetly buy this book!!Erin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly not for kids only!","review":"I'm no SW fun but after watching Episode I, I got curious as to the background(s) of our main characters, namely Qui-Gon & Obi Wan. So, after surfing in the net, I came across this book (& its' sequel) & immediately ordered them. I must say that though it is marked a scholastic reading, it also appeals to an older range of readers. The plot was fast & there is no time/space left for the reader to feel bored. Though the plot was quite simplified (understandably due to the recommended reading age), it did not fail to show the inner traits of our main characters nor our villains. It also managed to show battle inside an Arconan's heart (Si Treemba) to separate himself from a group he has grown with; & make a decision different from the rest. I honestly believe the children will love this & learn from it. Just as well, the adults will likewise enjoy reading this. Btw, I'm almost 30 :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goooooood Book. Way to good.","review":"I wanted to read this book because I like Star Wars but alot ofits books are waaaay to big or to kidish.

They sent a replacement product and yet again, no Sampler Disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed for the money","review":"I received the product in the mail today. I was disappointed with the quality. The door for the battery cover just feels cheap and it felt like it would be broken off by pushing it into place after putting the batteries in the device. Upon turning the unit on it would only shoot a laser one direction...to the right. The directions say to push the on/off button twice to activate the plumb line. This did not work. I have already sent the item back and exchanged it for a much cheaper (in price) Stanley 77-154 SP5 FatMax Five Beam Laser Kit. I am starting to realize that price does not equate quality. It stinks because I was looking forward to using this product for a project this weekend. Looks like I will have to hold off for a bit till the Fat Max gets here. Honestly the finish of the product was disappointing for the price. I was initially only looking for a laser plumb. I stumbled upon this and thought it might be nice to have. Oh well...live and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst experience","review":"This is actually a returned item but was shown it as \\"new\\".The packing was poorly re-packed. The bottom of the body has a clear scratch mark. The battery cover has two latches but one is broken. The latch is a poor design. I believe that's why it was returned.

I listen mainly to two bands in this genre: Napalm Death and Brutal Truth. Brutal Truth is and excellent band. This album, which they recorded before going on an indefinite hiatus, is a spastic, grinding and brutal pleasure drive. If you like Brutal Truth and don't own this, shame on you. If this is your first encounter with this mighty band then this is a good place to start. This IS NOT for fans of bands like Whitechapel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for yoga practioners","review":"This is a truly outstanding instructional yoga video. Ira Israel's video stands out for three main reasons. 1) It is one of the few yoga video I have seen that doesn't treat yoga as merely an exercise. Instead, Ira's video stresses the mind/body connection, which makes the practice much more fulfilling and restorative. 2) One of my concerns with using at-home yoga videos is that you don't have a yogi to help with getting into and staying in correct form. However, in this video, Ira pays attention to the details of the poses without talking too much! 3) And most importantly, I feel great after using this video both mentally and physically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dislike","review":"I am very open minded, but I found this to be uncomfortable. I can't relax or feel calm when I'm so uncomfortable the entire time. I also found the instructor a little on the cheesy side. I didn't get more than 5 minutes into the workout. I completely agree with the theory however. Depression and Anxiety can't exist without our permissions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started to use, lost interest","review":"I started to use this DVD, but quickly lost interest. I think the video quality is a bit less than I was expecting, and I couldn't do, or keep up with the pace of the poses, to save my life! Might be helpful to add to the title \\"Yoga for Depressed and Anxious but Nimbly Flexible People\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Misleading","review":"Yoga for anxiety and depression? Hardly. It feels like your basic everyday power yoga class. An hour and a half of holding somewhat challenging poses, which does boost your endorphins ultimately resulting in that yoga buzz, but that's all it is. Nothing specifically geared towards altering your perception of the world or helping with anxiety or depression-- false advertising. I felt cheated after this practice. It was horrible sound quality, music, and setting. Even though it was a good workout, if I'm doing a basic practice, I would much rather use a dvd that has a variety of routines so that on busy days I could still manage to fit yoga in. I got the \\"yoga for stress relief\\" dvd with Barbara Benagh as well, and THAT is actually really helpful for anxiety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"This is just a standard routine with a decent instructor and one very limber student. This is something that you may well enjoy, but I'm afraid that the \\"anxiety and depression\\" title was chosen to generate sales, not because of the content. Also, the video quality is just short of professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga for Disappointment","review":"Nothing new here. All your standard yoga poses. This was filmed in a an empty studio space that caused annoying echoing - especially when the instructor was moving in the poses. I was bothered by the background music. It really grated on the nerves after a while. The routine was quite long (over 1 1/2 hours). I prefer yoga dvds that offer a choice of routines. I don't always have 2 hours to dedicate to my practice and it would be nice to have a shorter option. I don't understand how the ratings could be so high. I should've paid more attention to the other low ratings. Amazed there are only a couple."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed.","review":"I received this DVD hoping it would be a valuable tool. I have read Amy Weintraub's \\"Yoga for Depression\\" which is excellent. This DVD is actually not on target in explaining the use of Yoga to help people with depression. It does teach a nice routine of asanas, but there are much better DVDs available for that. The sound is also not done professionally. I would not recommend this DVD for the reason that the title is very misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Le meilleur DVD de Yoga!!!","review":"J'adore ce DVD!!!! Apres mettre ruiner avec tellement d'autres DVD, j'ai enfin trouver l'ultime outil pour faire mon Yoga chez moi! Ira est pour moi le meilleur des professeurs; j'ai appris tellement avec lui."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative Approach to the Pactice of Yoga","review":"This morning I took my second Yoga class with Ira Israel, and I have to say that he demonstrates, not only a mastery of the physical and spiritual aspects of the practice of Yoga, but also a responsibility for teaching techniques/poses properly for the greatest physical and mental advantage of them. I recommend this DVD, as well as taking a class with him if you are able. One thing I have to say is, pay attention and follow his instructions properly, listen to your body, do not try to do poses that your body doesn't feel ready for or that you feel too much discomfort while doing/in them. With patient practice, and the guidance of a great instructor such as Ira, you will get there. Ira is a professional in Yoga as well as Psychology. I find that combination superb, and hope this DVD finds its way to all who need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant - really!","review":"The introduction is very lucid and gave me fresh insights on depression and anxiety!

This was a horrible DVD. Its for anxiety and depression. He mentions one time that I can remember that doing a pose (can't remember which) should make you stop thinking like that (in reference to depression). Its done in an unattractive studio with the teacher and one women in some wild yoga pants (which I like, but didn't find appropriate for this). There is some chanting going on in the background which is annoying. Its just sun salute after sun salute, with so many chattarangas (not sure if that's the correct spelling) and down dogs I lost count. Nothing creative, interesting, or helpful. Sun salutes I can do on my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"kicked my butt and cleared my mind","review":"The pace of this video is perfect - I find myself following the sequences and resting according to the video in a natural way that challenges me but doesn't leave me behind. What often happens for me in the other yoga videos I've tried is that I feel the teacher is doing too much and/or too quickly and I start falling behind or do my own thing and lose focus.I am pretty fit and practice yoga 1-2 times per week (so not a hardcore fitness person) and at the end of the video I felt like I'd had a great and challenging workout and my mind also felt calm. It works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Daily Practice tape","review":"This is a great Dvd to support a daily practice at home. Ira's voice is both motivating and grounding, soulful and humorous, with plenty of wonderful cues; just a perfect amount of \\"talking\\" during the practice so that you won't get tired of it after a few viewings. This is one is a keeper, and one that I'll actually use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Quality","review":"I ordered this DVD when I saw that it had so many 5-star ratings. I was very disappointed. I have done many yoga DVDs and this was one of the worst ones that I've ever done. The sound quality was very poor and the instructor's voice was very mumbled. He also tended to ramble on about useless information which was annoying because I had to concentrate so hard to try to figure out what he was saying. I didn't know if what he was saying was related to the yoga positions or just rambling. The loud, repetitive music did not help the situation. The video quality was also very poor and grainy so it was difficult to see what was going on. This would not be a good video for beginners. The moves were not well explained. The instructor would just name a position and you were expected to do it. The video is also very hard on the shoulders because of the prolonged and repeated holding of \\"downward dog\\". The video is also extremely long. There is not an option to do a shorter version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is annoying","review":"After reading several reviews, I looked forward to the arrrival of this DVD with great anticipation. It sounded like just what I was looking for in a yoga routine. Ira Israel is a knowledgeable teacher with a wonderful demeanor and voice.Unfortunately if you are looking for a healthy way to combat depression, this may not be it. Not too many people have 75 minutes a day to devote to the practice of Yoga. Even of you do, the music or should I say, a violation of your peaceful surroundings, is so horrible that words escape me. Even though I tried, I cannot make it through a complete session due to the music and there is no way to silence it as on similar DVDs. Wish I had my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Yoga Video...?","review":"I can see where these other reviews are coming from... but... honestly it wasn't that fantastic. It's not BAD, but I could have gotten the same workout from any of my other yoga videos. The music isn't especially calming, the video work is shaky, and it generally just seems cheap!I enjoyed the introduction- it was very insightful. However, I specifically chose this video because of the \\"Anxiety and Depression\\" title, and I have found that other videos have ABSOLUTELY blown this one out of the water when it comes to calming my nerves. I would suggest any Ana Forrest or Mimi Solaire video. The Yin Yoga with Mimi Solaire has got to be the best yoga video I own (and I own a lot!).Not trying to offend anyone out there, and if it works for you thats great! But, it certainly didn't do a thing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga for Depression and anxiety","review":"This DVD is horrible. It is not like the traditional yoga dvd's. The guy talks to you the entire time about how to do a pose and it is in a gym.

It would be a lovely class for me but I did not regard it as suitable for people who might be beginners. I did not feel it addressed the specifics of anxiety and depression. I was very disappointed despite recognising the skill of teh teacher and the student."},{"rating":"1","title":"yoga for anxiety and depression","review":"I really don't like this at all. I don't see that any of the postures have anything special that would relieve anxiety and/or depression. This yoga program is no better than any other and not much different to any other.There are a hundred better yoga DVDs out there to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD is nothing more than a general Hatha yoga DVD","review":"The sequencing presented in the DVD is just like the normal program for the general public. It did not explain why poses are chosen or sequenced in a way that is appropriate for people who suffer from depression. Yoga for depression should be focused more bringing inward experience, self awareness and introspection into tthe practice so that clients can differentiate the difference between reality and their interpretations of their thoughts. The DVD, however, did not address that at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful for ME","review":"I didn't think I could do yoga for 75 minutes, but it didn't even feel like it was that long!

Even beginners will be able to keep up with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga for Depression and Anxiety","review":"This is a CD to watch for different yoga positions for depression and anxiety and if you enjoy doing yoga you will enjoy this CD that I got through Amazon.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Urbantity goes up.

Seeing Ira in a meditative posture in typically busy urban areas resets the norm and stopped me in my busy tracks.

His soothing voice, his emphasis on deep breathing and his attention to linking breath with each yoga pose created a dramatic shift in my distressing emotional state. The class helped me move move through and release difficult emotions that had been with me for days and restored my natural ease and joy in life. I left feeling free and relaxed.

It is a basic yoga video. He does a little talk (~4 minutes) at the beginning giving a very simplistic definition of anxiety and depression that I'm not sure would be particularly helpful. Secondly the vast majority of the video is standing poses -- more so than most classes! Certainly, a number of standing poses are helpful but I couldn't imagine being particularly depressed or anxious and having to do that amount of strenuous standing poses. What about grounding and stretching? Not much of that happening. Very disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"This DVD is a joke. It has nothing to do with depression and anxiety, minus Ira's introductions about how it is stemmed from expectations and something about capitalism. The sound and picture quality are poor. Ira's voice echos badly, and the camera is shaky. The whole thing is not relaxing, like one might presume. I hate to be suspicious, but who would possibly give this DVD 5 stars?

I HIGHLY recommend this book and the sequel, The Seventh Scroll."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My All Time Favorites","review":"Just wanted to be one more person to give this book a great rating.Wilbur wrote an amazingly intricate book with everything for everyone - a love story, war, intrigue, history and an epic that covers a huge expanse of time. My favorite was introduction of the wheel into society when the Hysocks invaded Egypt. You can't help but like Taita since his heart and loyalty is to those you like best in the story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated the book","review":"I tried to read this book some time ago and I just noticed this page. I could not finish the book as it was entirely too prurient in its discussion of some things and sadly lacking in others, including character development. I was very disappointed, having paid full price for the hard backed version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Nothing","review":"This book was pure soap opera in an exotic setting.It was completely predictable and over-blown."},{"rating":"1","title":"a romance novel","review":"River God is not a historical fiction novel. It is romance pulp that just happens to have the setting of ancient Egypt. The story revealed nothing about life in ancient Egypt. The neutered main character is completely unbelievable with how he is a 'master of all trades'. I regret wasting my time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag me with the Crook & Flail","review":"I cannot believe all the glowing \\"reviews\\" of this piece of tripe. It appears Smith did his \\"research\\" by watching 1950's movies about Egypt. If anyone is truly interested in reading well-researched books about engrossing characters set in ancient Egypt, I would suggest you head to the search page and look up ANYthing by Pauline Gedge. Her latest opus, THE LORDS OF THE TWO LANDS (a three book masterpiece) should make Smith and his sycophants hang their heads in shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"This book has something for everyone! It is a story of love, adventure, history, revenge, discovery, and humanity. I would reccomend it for anyone, and especially if you're ineterested in Ancient Egypt or history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alt hist brought to life with living, breathing characters.","review":"Readers of alternate history who are lovers of ancient Egypt will fall for Wilbur Smith's story and characters. Though a slow start, due to Tata the Slave's love of detail, this story of ancient life among the pharaohs is vivid in its detail. I was soon immersed in the lives of all the main characters. Smith's sequel, \\"Seventh Scroll,\\" brought this ancient story into the present while keeping the ancient characters alive within me. The quicker pace of the sequel (since Tata is no longer the storyteller) doesn't fail to make us care about its modern-day characters, while providing an exciting quest with many unexpected turns--truly worthy of Tata's praise. Together, \\"River God\\" and \\"Seventh Scroll\\" make for a fascinating adventure occuring in two diffenent epochs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious book. Immediately forgettable.","review":"I have seldom read such a horrible book. I clearly need to buy some better light reading. This novel purports to be set in Ancient Egypt and is full of pungeant detail, presented clumsily and inaccurately. I honestly don't know why I continued beyond the gratuitous and ugly violence of the first 50 or so pages. If you like historical fiction based in Ancient Egypt - look elsewhere. Try Gedge or almost anyone else. Gedge is a master; Smith appears to be a pedestrian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, certainly, but...","review":"Uh..... Well.... (Cough, cough) That is to say... (deep breath) Nice cover?No, wait. Let me say a little more:This is not an historical novel. Or if it is, it's not based on Egyptian history. It's a colorful yarn, a violent, interesting, flashy bit of storytelling. The author creates entertaining characters. He conveys pathos, exultation, love, humor... You tend to forget that there isn't a lot of research involved in the tale.Don't get this book for someone you know who is a serious student of ancient Egypt: they'll die laughing."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A slow moving river.\\"","review":"The first person novel is a bit verbose and slow moving. Many facts helped me enjoy the story since I have been to Egypt several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed in Wilbur Smith","review":"River God in the Egyptian series is a real disappointment. I'm a real fan of the Courtney series but this is just gory and boring"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gary Stu to the n-th power","review":"I did not manage to get to the end of this book, I got bored way before. It is hard to feel any sympathy for the characters, especially Taita, the narrator. Too many qualities in a single person, there is nothing he cannot do and spends too much time explaining the customs of ancient Egypt to the readers of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is a review of the cassette version and I must say I was rivetted to this story. I sat in my car long after I arrived at my destination listening in fastination.However, the hero Tanus, is just a little too outrageously perfect for me to give this a full 5 stars. You know, never tires during combat, never loses his cool, never makes a fatal mistake. I would have enjoyed a less god-like hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete drivil - no redeeming value.","review":"This is perhaps the 2nd worst book I have read in the last 5 years (the first being The Illuminator by Brenda Rickman Vantrease). Between the horrible anachronisms, unending similes and the totally unbelievability of the protagonist I just could not take it anymore. Even da Vinci, Einstein, Edison, Benjamin Franklin, Salk and Bobby Flay rolled into one, would not be as perfect as the main character in this story. If you don't want to waste your time, don't read it. Almost anything else would be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank Heaven I can return it to the library!!!","review":"<Shudders> It was horribe! Not a single character was believable. There were times when I felt sympathetic to Taita, the all-knowing, toot-his-own-horn slave, but those times were short-lived. The flowery/snobbish language made me want to puke. I don't think you could go more than two or three pages without the author saying \\"this very Egypt\\" or \\"our very Egypt\\". It got old quick. It may have been a good book if it was no more than 350 pages, but I couldn't finish. I'm so glad I didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"A good story with strong characters lures the reader's imagination, inspires excitement and anticipation of what happens next. This is not one of those stories. It's not a bad book by any means. Shining moments appear. However, Taita is a character hard with which to sympathize. All the other characters are as translucent as the page held up to a strong light, and the heaped action reaches a point of banality in its lack of specificity. Did I mention it's predictable? You should have expected that.Pick up a Clavell or Jennings instead. This is Soap Opera history."},{"rating":"1","title":"please stop","review":"I can't stand arrogant people, this is why the arrogant first person writing stile made me give up on this book before finishing it. The historical background of this book is as thin as air in the stratosphere. If mr Smith had taken even the slightest interest in ancient Egypt he would have written a better book. Pyramids by Terry Pratchett is more serious on ancient Egypt than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK!!","review":"This is literally the best book i've ever read. I felt so personal and close with all the characters that at the end, I was sad, not just that I had finished it, but that I had to say goodbye to these wonderful characters. I have also read the sequel, and though it is based far far in the future from ancient egypt, it was JUST AS, if not more of a good read. Especially since if you have read River God u are in on all the little secrets that the books characters are not. But, I would even recommend reading the sequel to those who have not read river god. These books are great fun, and full of every element a good story should have. I laughed, I cried, I read them both AGAIN!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Taita the super slave. Content to be a slave and refuses freedom. Taita; scribe,architech, doctor, lawyer,microbiologist,surgeon, overseer, inventor, prophet, businessman, poet, orator,spy,chaperone, advisor to pharoh, military strategist. Please...enough. The lead characters are too perfect and the people too gullible. The flouting of adultery at the highest level is an insult to a proud people. This book should be seen as a modern day soap opera and nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taita Rules!","review":"Wilbur Smith is my favorite writer, I would rate most of his books in the 4 to 5 star range, but so far this is my favorite. We even named our new dog, a yorkie, Taita. I can't recommend this work highly enough. It allows the reader to time travel into ancient Egypt. As with all his books, you hate the end because it's over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magnificent epic of a time long gone","review":"Smith is an incredibly gifted writer -- indeed, I place his action stories on the same level as those of Edward S. Aarons. RIVER GOD is extraordinary in its narration, characters, plot, and scenery -- all of which come together to make a book that is very much perfect for reading and rereading. Indeed, the blending of such factors causes the story to remain with you even after you have set the book aside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rollicking fun along the nile","review":"I picked this book up randomly at the bookstore, and started reading. It was kind of cheesy, but fun, and slowly but surely drew me in... I started to like the characters. In fact, I started to like the book so much that I tried not to read it so that I could look forwards to the next chapter. I don't think I have done this with a book since \\"Dune\\"Inevitably, the story drew to a close, and there are some depressing parts that could have been handled less depressingly. This, and the cheesiness factor (which it never truly leaves) take from it the fifth star"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction ? Maybe, but it's real to me.","review":"River God is excellent reading material. I bought this book in Chicago just before boarding a flight bound for London. From the first few pages I realized this was going to be an excellent flight. This was my first Wilbur Smith novel, and though it was mostly fiction with some fact, as the storyline progressed Mr. Smith was able to eliminate any doubt in my mind that what he wrote did not actually happen. When the flight attendant arrived, and saw what I was reading, she said that this novel was good but not as good as his previous novels. I was amazed, could this book be bettered? I did not let go of the book until the last page.

I reccomend this book highly to all in the mood for a great adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"River God is still my number 1","review":"If you don't mind a little blood and gore, you should definitely read this book.Wilbur Smith brings these characters to life, you will not only root for these people, you actually might loose some sleep over them. My husband and I equally enjoyed this book and I \`m usually not much for war and torture, but it is part of ancient times and it definitely creates the characters and the story in this book.The slave boy Taita who is a faithful servant to Lostris who is in love with the warrior Tanus tells the story. Sounds just like the usual love story, but you are in for a big surprise. This book will take you back to ancient Egypt and you will actually feel like you are there with them fighting the same battles.Read it, it is a fantastic book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Smith's best . . .","review":"If you like fiction / history with Smith's brand of adventure and intrigue, you'll love River God."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever!","review":"I thought I was in love with ancient Egypt then I read Warlock and discovered Wilbur smith's amazingly artistic storytelling.This made me go a-searching and I found River God. I pride myself in being a very critical and cynical person but this book kept me entirely spellbound throughout.It is truly an EPIC, better than anything Hollywood has ever come out with. I like the fact that Taita was perfect except for the fact that he was a eunuch. Everythihng in this book is well written. Mintaka and Nefer stole my heart and even though they could be larger than life and too good sometimes, you will not hold it against them for a second. It will keep your heart on overdrive even when you've managed to put it down and catch an hour night's sleep.I cried when someone I had coerced into reading it (I feel that the magic should be shared with as many people as possible), lost my copy.

Like when Taita, the protagonist, disguised himself as a priest, he wore a wig, when in fact, Egyptian priests went completely bald. The number of blond and green eyed characters didnt really convince me either, not in ancient egypt. And another thing that startled me was that the Ethiopian king, was referred to as 'fair skinned'. Also, according to Smith, the Ethiopians spoke Ge'ez when in reality that language hasnt been recorded at the time. And contrary to what was written here, iron wasnt introduced by the Ethiopians, it was introduced by the Hittites about a thousand years later than the setting of 'River God.' i would have enjoyed the book if it was a bit more accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"a romance novel","review":"River God is not a historical fiction novel.

I have just ordered the next two books in the series. I couldn't get enough. Taita, the eunich, a genius in arts, mechinations, life and the other world beyond ours guards and influences Lostris and Tannis a couple destined to be together but seems to be at odds with what the \\"Gods have planned\\". Linked with the evil Lord Intef and the Immortal Pharoah, their lives are filled with war and love. The author brings us into the life of ancient Egypt as if we have actually been there. The descriptions of everyday life and death are startling lifelike. I was unexpectedly impressed and hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly a love story","review":"I enjoyed this book very much!

During World War One such balloons were used to monitor enemy movement on the other side of no-man's land and to call and correct artillery fire on enemy positions. Balloons became an obvious target but were strongly defended by antiaircraft fire and, later, friendly fighters flying cover. They were not easy targets by any means and destroying balloons was a dangerous sport.The book includes photos, color plates and first-hand accounts of engagements which resulted in the destruction of balloons. Biographical data on some of the more important aces makes for a good read. I only wish that the author had perhaps included a diagram or some drawings illustrating the daunting defenses a balloon-buster had to contend with in order to destroy a gasbag.

The events and characters fit together as neatly as the teeth of the clockwork Pullman describes, and the illustrations and textual 'asides' are delightful, offering complementary and contrasting views of the action as it progresses. It is a book which has an enormous amount to offer readers of all ages and is gripping enough to keep you turning those pages.A post-modern version of Grimms Fairy Tales, 'Clockwork' has a certain gothic horror element to it, whilst retaining an underlying 'adult amusement' value. Pullman effectively combines the two, eliciting fear one moment and laughter the next. All the characters are well crafted but Dr Kalmenius is clearly the best, scoring 10 out of 10 on the villainy scale.CLOCKWORK: OR ALL WOUND UP is an example of 'children's' fiction at its very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only wish it'd been longer","review":"One of Pullman's shorter works, his dark yet excellent writing is still a joy in this teeny tiny novel.A strange story is told in a bar at night--about a prince who was so determined to have an heir that he replaces his dead infant son with a mechanical one, then goes to terrifying lengths to keep him alive.In the tradition of \\"Count Karlstein\\", this takes place in a wintery part of Germany and is full of shadowy darkness. Unfortunately, though the writing is excellent, it has none of the wacky dark funniness of \\"Karlstein.\\" If you are a fan of Pullman, then this book is a must. Even if you are not, this is a nice way to spend 45 minutes on a rainy night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary fairytale!","review":"Clockwork is the first book that I've read by the author Philip Pullman. It is also the first book I've read in a fairytale style. At first I thought I wouldn't enjoy Clockwork because I usually don't read fairytales, but once I got into it, I started to enjoy it! It was scary, and I like scary stories. It was also very complex, a sort of story inside a story inside a story - if you know what I mean. I recommend this book for older kids.

Clockwork","review":"A reader cannot expect more in a big-lettered, 107 page book, for Philip Pullman is a literal master at delivering a beautifully crafted story. A dark and enchanted story sewn by a man derranged of trying to do his best... A greedy man who wants his new \\"toy\\" to earn him wealth and power... a young, sweet girl determined to save good... an unforgettable cast of characters and an unforgettable story in one. CLOCKWORK , although far different then Pullman's enchanting HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy, is a creepy and very absorbing read which I could not put down until I finished the last page, an emotionally heartbreaking ending which is one that will undoubtedly touch the reader's heart and beg for a sequel to this spooky, masterpiece of a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for relucant readers and fans of mild horror","review":"Pullman did a wonderful job generating suspense that resolved quickly, only to be rekindled.

It may not hold the interest of older YA's"},{"rating":"1","title":"clockwork","review":"Clockwork is about a man named Fretiz who tells a story about a mechanical boy who had a heart transplant from his father. The characters from Fretiz's story come to life one by one. First, it was the evil doctor who created Prince Florian. Later Florian himself came to the real world. When Florian came he was sick, but after being under the care of a girl named Gretl his mechanical body turned to flesh and he became a real boy. After the night with Gretl in the church steeple everyone said, \\"Look it's a living talking statue up in the steeple,\\" while pointing at Florian . This book is great for young readers and good for the imagination. Pullman is the author of the Golden Compass and has won many awards. This book is scary and surprising, and it has a classical ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clockwork: Or All Wound Down","review":"This is the first time I have ever written a negative review on AMAZON.COM. But I must admit, Clockwork by Phillip Pullman is the worst book I've ever read. OK, so I'm ten, but who would be interested in fathers giving up their hearts for their mechanical sons? Come on.This book is 90% detail, 10% making no sense.You can read this book, but I don't reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REAL Disappointment","review":"I have read and liked other books by this author but this was a REALLY HORRIBLE disappointment. It skips back and forward in time in a fairly confusing way, because when it does that, it moves to locations that seem to have no purpose in the story. But even if you can follow that, the book is just plain creepy! It has horrible clockwork robots that'll kill you if you say a wrong word. I was also saddened by the fact it was such a short, easy read. It is also a purely recreational book; I got nothing out of it. So unless you like creepy, coufusing, short books, I think you might want to look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clockwork","review":"I didn't really like this book. We read it in class and I was absent for one day and became totally lost. The book moves too quickly and isn't fit for anyone with an IQ above four. It was an insult to my intelligence and I don't like books that take place in Germany, they are scary. I wish that Phillip could have come up with something more like the Golden Compass or the Subtle Knife, this book was definetly his worst work. I'm sorry to say that I could not sit in class while this book was being read, I was forced to block it out and pretend that I was on Who Wants To Be A Milliionare."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fairy Tale That Comes Real!!","review":"This book may be short, but it is the best book I have ever read. \\"Clockwork: All Wound Up\\" is about a storyteller named Fritz, who writes a story, but dosn't finish it. Just as he is about to think up an ending, the story comes real. All the main charactors from his story visit him while he is reading the story to an audience. I will leave it up to you to read the ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Halloween Story","review":"This is probably a bit too frightening for younger readers but the middle school age bracket will enjoy it. The story is a very quick read but is a delicious thriller. Readers will be in suspense from the posessed clock figurines chasing the clockmaker and will be excited until the story's end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irish America","review":"Ms. Dezell's book gives some interesting insight into Irish populations outside the Boston and New York areas and she has a good sense of wit about Irish nature. However, I found her writing style somewhat unengaging and the stories of the Kennedys and the Catholic Church are the tired \\"same old, same old\\".This is a topic that deserves more depth than 22l pages but if you like a book with statitics, this one's for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Know your culture","review":"A book I have devoured and given many times as a gift. Just because you're Irish-American doesn't mean you understand your culture. This book gave me many lightbulb moments as I saw friends and family in light of our culture instead of merely quirky individuals. The distinctions between Irish and Irish-Americans and East Coast vs Midwestern Irish-Americans were also eye-openers. And it is useful to rise above the stereotypes of Irish-Americans as drinkers and brawlers to see their role in creating and maintaining an amazing array of Catholic institutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WINNER!","review":"This Program is a Pooh lovers dream come true! Adults and children alike will love this CD. You start at \\"the enchanted hill\\" in the hundred acre woods where you pick a character.Each character will take you to a different activity.You may pop balloons, play who likes to, or even make alphabet soup.There is learning in every corner.We (my daughter and I ) love this program!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Wait","review":"I received my copy of Season 2 iin color.

The DVD came in a standard Retail package. It plays on all my DVD player's and the quality is exceptional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disk 2 was missing","review":"Bought the entire series for my wife as an anniversary present. Disk 2 of Season 2 was missing. To avoid an elongated back and forth debacle we let it slide.

I already opened and played not knowing the fact it does not have English subtitle. Now I can't return nor exchange. I am not happy with my shopping at Amazon this time. I don't want give even one star for the product I received."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fresh Look to an Old Favorite","review":"I won't bother with reviewing the show. Instead I'm just going to note what a wonderful touch the coloring of this DVD series is. The overall tone is a wonderful rendition of the traditional Technicolor that was first used in the 1940s and then progressed to TV in the 1960s. Any fan of the traditional black-and-white series could appreciate the added color in this collector's set, and the color is like that of older television shows with added color before the invention of color film: it has fresh, lively colors without the graininess found in shows from the 1970s and 1980s; yet it lackes the subdued colors and ultra-sharp cinematography of modern TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MAGICIAN GETS CAUGHT","review":"Many good episodes on this second season.Among my favorites are THE MAGIC CABIN in which SAM transforms LARRY's devasted chalet into a modern one;the episode FOLLOW THAT WITCH in two parts in which a detective discovers that SAM is a witch and trys to blackmail her(one of my all time best).Fans of GREEN ACRES will recognize the lady carpenter RALPH playing GLADYS KRAVITZ's sister.I also like among others the episode in which DARRIN's UNCLE ALBERT is mistaken with an old vaudevillien who turns out to be a nice guy after discovering that THE STEVENS are too fine people to steal from.As for UNCLE ARTHUR,he is only featured in one episode in which he makes fun of ENDORA.He will be there in the years to come with new tricks.What's fun during that season is that GLADYS is not alone anymore to witness the magic.In a way,the series seems to move one step further for the pleasure of the fans.It makes us want to see season 3 at the speed of SAM's twiching nose"},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorization","review":"The colorization of these are the best of have seen for any series in a long time. My only disappointment is that there is no added value. Sony should have at least pulled a few promos or such from their vaults!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BE Witched !!!","review":"It is hard to say anything bad about this product. We loved the serial and to be able to see all the episodes together... It has been wonderful.Every day we watch this with dinner... and the experience is bewitching!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bewitched--Second Season","review":"Vey pleased with the second season of Bewithed. Am looking forward to the third season. Thank You."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comedy classic that only improves with age.","review":"Nice to see so many people still appreciate this comedy masterpiece. The set is a must-have, and I agree with previous reviews -- the so-called blooper featurette is a waste of time (and hopefully better extras will be included on future releases). BUT \\"Bewitched\\" fans can enjoy in Season 2 a few moments that could legitimately be called bloopers, but are actually hilarious and cherished unexpected moments in the life of the series: Dick York cracking up in the great \\"Double Split\\" episode as he blasts an ad executive with a fire extinguisher; and Paul Lynde and Dick York breaking each other up after Endora has turned herself into a parrot in \\"The Joker is a Card.\\" Priceless, and the icing on the cake for a show that needed no help being funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal","review":"i love bewtiched and was happy when this was on a tv dvd sale on amazon. great deal. now i have two seasons"},{"rating":"2","title":"A vision of sugar plums again??","review":"Bewitched: the complete second season is just as good as the first season. The color is great & so are the shows. However, if you watch the shows, a couple of them are the same as the first season. Darrin & Samantha are reminiscing about past shows. In episode # 15 A vision of sugar plums, it starts out with Darrin & samantha getting a Christmas card from the boy they took home the year before & then it goes back to the same show from season one. In episode #20 Meet the folks, the same thing happens. They start out different & then go into the first season shows that we have already seen. The rest of the episodes are great! I don't have a problem with it. I just don't understand why they did this. Neverless, If your a bewitched fan as I am you will enjoy Bewitched: The complete second season just as much as the first. The coloring of the shows is wonderful. You can't tell that they were once B&W."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and White is Best!!","review":"I agonized (OK, it didn't really hurt) about choosing the B&W or colorized versions of these DVD's. I finally decided to be a purist and bought the B&W's. I am so glad I did. On the B&W version, the blooper extra is in the colorized format. While a big improvement over the colorizations of the 1980's, it still looks \\"colorized\\", not natural. I will gladly wait for season 3 to see the naturally color episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"One page of information in a 31 page booklet!","review":"Very limited information about anything. Reads more like a newspaper article. If the author knows anything about flea-markets, she has kept it a secret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good used book","review":"This book was pretty old - pages turning color - but all pages were there and no marks at all. I got what I paid for and I am satisfied. The book itself is a wonderful read for anyone that loves aviation or adventure in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best flying book I have ever read","review":"If you are a pilot and anything that is described in this book hasn't happened to you (or someone you know) it will, given time.I found the descriptions of the approach to \\"Bluey West One\\" (now called Narsasuak) the best preparation I could get for actually going there!The book is written by a man who knows his subject. The descriptions of an aeroplane icing up and of preparations for a ditching, get nearer the truth than any operations manual ever has.This book should be standard issue to anyone who seeks to make flying his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic story of an airline pilot","review":"I loved the book when I read it back in 1971 when I was in the airforce in Alaska.

If anyone can help please send me an email at jagwlee@cs.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gann puts you in the cockpit!!! And gets you thinking .","review":"The finest aviation memior ever written. A biography that reads like a novel. Read the chapters about flying in ice and thunderstorms and you'll be back with Gann in the cockpits of DC-2s and 3s. But yet it's not an \\"airplane\\" book, it's a reflction on life's paths. A must read for anyone who loves flying or has ever wondered about our destiny. He wonders about fate without getting into metaphysics...Gann doesn't come across as a philospher, rather as a man asking the questions we all ask ourselves (but rarely admit to). I still have the first copy I bought nearly 30 years ago, and my autographed copy is one of my prized possessions. Once you read it, you'll find yourself reading it every couple of years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for a new pilot","review":"One of the better books on the earlier days of flying. Some great insights into what makes an accident. Ignore the movie of the same name!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fate is the Hunter","review":"This 1986 paperback does not contain all of the material included in the original edition of 1961. There are numerous experiences and anecdotes omitted. For example, the episode on which the movie, \\"Fate is the Hunter\\" is based, is not included in this new edition. Some of the best material has been left out."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old friend enjoyed again","review":"I first read this wonderful book as a teen soon after it came out in the sixties. Since then, I've learned to fly and read innumerable aviation related books. Now in my sixties, I just re-read it and enjoyed it as much as before. It certainly stands in my lifetime \\"ten best\\" list.After finishing it the second time I regreted that Mr. Gann is gone. I wish I had a chance to thank him for the enriching experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need a new copy.","review":"I was given the first edition (1961) in 1965, and have read it about every five years since then.

I bought it, read it, read it again, and will probably read it many more times. One of the best aviation books ever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ageless","review":"I read Fate Is The Hunter in 1962, when the first paperback edition was published. That was an unforgettable experience for a very young adult fascinated by aviation. I still have the book, with its yellowed and brittle pages.So I decided to order the latest edition in view of re-reading it in \\"greater comfort\\".It is surprising how little Gann's auto-biography has aged. In fact, it has gained in value as a testimonial of the daily life and occasional tribulations of the first airline aviators.An essential book for those interested in the history of aviation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best aviation book ever!","review":"This book needs a new category because five stars are not enough. I found a paperback edition in Vung Tau, Viet Nam. I was there on R&R as a military pilot in 1965. I have carried it with me in my flight bag for over twenty five years. We have been all over the world. It has been read and re-read so many times that it is stored in a plastic freezer bag to keep the pages together. I donated it to my son who recently obtained his private pilot license. Any hopeful, amateur or professional pilot will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book","review":"Book was fun for a pilot. Might be a little crazy for a non pilot, but probably great for anyone who loves excitement. Book as purchased was in good shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential for any aviation enthusiast","review":"Fate Is The Hunter is pilot Ernie Gann's vivid collection of aviation experiences set in the early days of commercial air travel. From a sabotaged engine over the jungles of South America, to sudden death in a farmer's field in Ontario, Canada Gann catalogues flying in a way I often found myself thinking, \\"I wish I could have said it like that!\\" In fact, I couldn't put the nearly 200-page book down until I'd finished it 18 hours later--and only then with a regretful sigh because there wasn't more. This book is a must for any aviation enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading!","review":"For those of us who fly professionally, and for those hope to one day do so, this book is a must-read!Capt.

Go look through the reviews, you'll see what I'm talking about. Wouldn't this just prove that all these bands (and the list of them appears endless) are just doing the exact same things. Doesn't every false-core band have a song called \\"Lipgloss and Letdown\\" or \\"The Beautiful Letdown\\" or something that would appear cool had it not been redundant or a redundancy. Truth is, you probably havn't noticed this, after all, you are lame enough to listen to this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth","review":"Perfect if you're the ages of 14-16 or very easily impressed other than that \\"pretty wack\\".The withered EP recordings were more raw and powerful.something about this album is just too watered down.The Lyrics on Lipgloss and letdown are so stupid I cant help but think they're about tripping someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak and unoriginal a pure flash with no brilliance","review":"Static is so easily transparent that I find it odd there are so many other good reviews for this album--I figure it must be the bands friends writing the reviews. There is nothing to this album that has not already been done by numerous punk bands over the last 20 years; it is completely unoriginal. That may sound like a bold and harsh statement considering that most great bands today are inspired none-the-less from musical fore-fathers. Their live show is even weaker than their album, sad to say. Maybe they will get their act figured out but, more likely than not, the mediocre attention this album has received will fade out and not resurface for Static in the future regardless of how many albums they put out."},{"rating":"1","title":"sub-par mediocre emocore","review":"I listen to a lot of different styles of music but hardcore is certainly a passion of mine. So when I put in Static Lullaby for the first time in my cd player, I was initially impressed. There is a hardcore catchiness to this album that I soon realized was not very original at all. A.S.L. seems to be trying too hard to fit the hard core bill when all they really are is a screamo emo band, and that just depresses me. There are already enough bad bands out there that fit this bill (namely the used...what a joke!, story of the year...yeah saddest story of the year, From Autumn to Ashes, and too many others to name). Good hardcore is not A.S.L., instead go out and buy some poison the well, hopesfall, boy sets fire, snapcase, or the bled. Those should do the trick for all you sick people who insist on referring to such terrible bands as the saviors of music. Where have we gone wrong?"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST BREAK UP!","review":"This cd is boring as hell...Even at it's hardest moments one can not possibly get pumped while listening to this...This is another band that should just break up already, your watering down all that was hardcore/emo...I have never read such terrible lyrics in my life, especially in the first track Nightmares Win 6-0 '..as the cocoon fills with oil' is just one of many badly written lines in that song. I'm not sure if they thought these lyrics should symbolize somthing or they thought it would sound cool or maybe they were writing just for the sake of it rhyming...anyway they fail in all three cases!It gets one star, because these guys were brave enough to put there pictures in the booklet of this piece of crap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Static Lullaby Is One Of My Favorites Now...","review":"This Band Is Very Good. There Lyrics Are Very Well Done And So Are The Guitars I Really Like There Lead Vocals, But I Dont Like There Back-Up So That's Why This CD Gets Four Stars And Another Reason Why It Gets 4 Stars Is Becuz I Feel They Need To Be More Metal Like For Me To Like Them Any Like More You Know?The Songs I Really Liked Where Lipgloss And Letdown, A Song For A Broken Heart, The Shooting Star That Destroyed Us All, And A Sip Of Wine. I Thought Those Where Really Really Good The Rest Had There Moments But Weren't That Great I Recomend This Album To Fans Of Poison The Well, Avenged Sevenfold, Hopesfall, And Acid Bath. So Overall It Gets A 4 Out Of 5 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't agree","review":"There's no way I can agree with any of these reviews. Here's the good and bad of this CD.Good: The band (minus the lead singer) is really good. Just about every song starts out great until the singer opens his trap and screams a bunch of nothing. Song #3 \\"Withered\\", was really going good but you can hear the singer holding back a scream through most of the song.Bad: The lead singer. the lead singer, the lead singer. Did I mention the lead singer?...I can understand the need for something new and better but this is not it. There's plenty of awesome new music out there so go sample some real rockers (Kidney thieves hint hint) and let these guys go until they've hired a new lead or pelted him in the head enough that he'll get the message. If you know the band, please send my regards. I gave them 2 stars because I had to hand it to the band to be able to play that well through that screach. P.S. Kick the producers...also for letting it go this far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest cd ever","review":"Not many people know A Static Lullaby, but they should.

But after seeing these guys live and buying the CD right away I totally changed my mind. I really really love this CD. Every song has such a different and wonderful sound. I even got used to and like the screaming in this band, it goes well with the tunes and the way the vocals can go from screaming to melodic singing is just amazing. Theres no real way to describe it.My advice: download a song or two, If you like it...fantastic, great, buy the CD right away and you won't regret it ...and if you dont like it, no big deal thats cool too, just dont go another day with out at least giving them a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"as a fan of metal i didnt think i'd like this but me friends dragged me along to tulsa to see them. wow. live, its incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great screamo right here.","review":"Static lullaby is pretty great--having an original sound without being cheesy or terrible.

It just doesnt work.This might be a valid attempt, but songs like \\"Song For a Broken Heart\\" don't make you question why she left him. It's more like a bunch of kids just bitching (albeit mostly screaming and yelling) about why life [is bad]."},{"rating":"1","title":"eeeeeeeehhhhh","review":"this seems like ferret records signed a band that they thought was trendy...its sorta commercial sounding and not all that great.

It made no sense and just SUCKED overall. And I loved The Ring. I'm no 13 year old moron either. I can handle long movies, and Tarrentino-crazy plotlines, but this movie just blows chunks.After the movie, I could hear everyone around me grumbling and complaining.

Suspense yeah right, I was digging through my eyeballs trying to stay awake! Let me sum it up, the story sucks, the plot sucks, the action, well there was none. I'll admit this movie did have something going for it, I like the actress & the trailer was intriguing but that's it, after the first 20 minutes you already know it's going to be a disaster & it was, what a HUGE disapointment! It felt like a VERY cheap rip off of The Ring. Basically as I said it's the worse in it's genre, worst than The Grudge, worst than [...], worst than The Skeleton Key (yes, it really is that bad) you name it & it's better than this.

First off, I was amazed at how slow it starts, the first 50 minutes are set up. I'm like.... come on..!! Once the plot takes shape, its totaly predictable and weak. It has no intensity. AND... This movie should NOT be unrated. It should be rated pg-13, there is no nudity, violence or 'foul' language... o.k. they may say the 's-word' like once... big deal.

There were no surprises for me and the story developed very slowly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment...","review":"This movie starts out great, but after a while it turns into a psychological thriller... and not a very good one. There are so many emotional issues and struggles of the main character, Dahlia, which completely takes over most of the movie. The little ghost girl is hardly a character at all and her story was completely summarized over, though it should have been Dahlia's story that was summarized. Normally don't mind these types of stories about a struggling mother dealing with childhood issues, but why set it up in \\"horror\\" skin clothing in the trailers?

The movie tanked at the box office and the trailers did not look good but I wanted to see it to see if it was scary and it was not. The movie is on the boarder lione of beeing a good movie and a bad movie. The good stuff the acting is good, the story is ok and it builds up lots making you think there will be scary moments and a good ending but your wrong. The movie builds up to nothing it's just a dissapointing ending. There are many pointltss parts and charactors to this movie. It's not scary and not worth the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this story had more to meaning to it then being scary","review":"This was a great movie because it showed the love between the mother and daughter. Jennifer Connelly's chacter flashes back to her childhoodand her mother was a mean mom that didn't love her and it affectedher alot. The Dark Water just pushed her over the edge and caused her migranes.This movie is a thrilller but you have to look for a deeper meaning in the movie to see what a great movie this really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atmosphere without Substance","review":"Jennifer Connelly does an exceptional acting job in this film that creates a dark wet soggy atmosphere for 100 minutes, but never develops any substance.The film seems like a study in using atmosphere to set a mood but little more.Does anybody else notice that RING, RING 2, GRUDGE and now DARK WATER are all the same story slightly rehashed and done over and over again ?Amazing they have been able to make money by making the exact same movie 4 times from the same basic story (ie... lost or neglected kid and water coming from beyond the grave)This was hard to take serious with nothing but drips, water leaks and geysers for 90 minutes...... and of course it was not helped any with the ending kind of given away in the first 15 minutes.HINT..... as mentioned above, this is a quick rehash of Ring and Grudge, etc..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This is a cool movie. Before buying it my husband and I never heard of Dark Water. Since I enjoy scare movies I bought it. We were happy with the buy. The end of the movie was a surprise.

Definitely see it to see it, but also watch the other version."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little scary but not much of a movie","review":"Not much to say about this one except it just kind of droaned on and didn't offer much. It had a few scary spots but the scenes seemed repeated within the movie. It seems like many of Jennifer Connelly's movies show her as depressed and try to have us feel sorry for her. She's one of my favs but that does seem to be the case. I was just disappointed with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another pointless and disappointing remake","review":"In similar vein to The Grudge and The Ring (penned by the same author as this yarn), Dark Water is a Hollywoodised (for that read watered-down) take on a fairly stylish Asian original horror.Whilst not only lacking the class of the original, Dark Water also suffers from being quite a weak and formulaic ghost story. I mean come on! We can all surely guess what's happened to the missing girl after the first 15 minutes and how many times has the old \\"invisible friend\\" routine been trotted out before?There are no real shocks along the way - just a mildly creepy atmosphere and I'm surprised this was 15 rated. I've seen scarier PGs!On the plus side, Pete Postlethwaite as the flats' handyman harboring a terrible secret and the little girl Ceci (Ariel Gade) put in very convincing performances. The material here isn't really strong enough to make their sterling efforts truly memorable though.Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring","review":"This movie begins like so many other horror/thriller movies. In this case, a woman in the midst of divorce and custody proceedings is moving into a new place with her daughter. The daughter is apprehensive about the move and the mother reassures her that everything will work out. We wait for something scary to happen...The building/setting is indeed spooky, but nothing eventful happens for quite some time. There are many boring stretches in the film that may not be able to hold your attention. I honestly gave this movie a chance, but it simply wasn't scary or all that suspenseful. It reminded me of \\"The Ring\\", but without the good story and lure.There is plenty of bonus material on the DVD, but it's barely even worth watching people speak with such ferver about a movie that falls so short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT waste your time and money","review":"This movie was terrible.

Having such accommodations can be very depressing for the people who have to live with them, but as the basis for a horror movie, this is, shall we say, \\"inadequate\\".Jennifer Connelly is an appealing actress, but she garners nothing from this movie role except a heavy dousing of brackish, brown-colored water. The talents of John C. Reilly--a fine actor in other contexts--are equally wasted here. I haven't a clue as to why he took this role.That stain on the ceiling that Connelly's character finds in her apartment--the one that looks more and more like a malignant melanoma... it's telling you to avoid this movie. Stop watching. Put on your latex gloves and flee!

WHAT exactly was there to be rated in the first place? NOTHING. This movie is absolutely NOT scary at all. The actors are simply too cute looking to be scary.

They should advertise this for what it is: drama bullsh*t. Go see The Devil's Rejects. Now that is a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"You mean...thats it? Gosh, the box is scarier.","review":"Hollywood is desperate these days to create a decent horror script so they have begun to borrow ones from the Japanese.

Everybody, including the little girl, do a superb acting job.Unfortunately, that is the only good thing I can say about this film. I can't even think of who WOULD like this film. It tries to be scary, but it isn't. It tries to be smart, but it isn't. There is no tension and the only part with a little bit of suspense was just weird.The Ring was great! The Grudge was okay.

The Ring, for example, perfectly chopped up the feeling of horror it gave us from the original version 'Ringu'.Perhaps it's culture and we get our boogieman to scare us in our own terms and ways, but really, horror for alternate sides are not meant for remakes for the other, unless you do it right. Otherwise, any remake of a good horror would just led to audiences to just blink and stare in the end, asking, \\"What and why am I watching this?\\"I'm still expecting a good remake to enter Hollywood screen.

Depressing story has no real redeeming qualities except for the acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I rented this as soon as it was released on DVD and was very disappointed. It could be due to the fact as a recently divorced father, it hit close to home.The story centers around Jennifer Connelly and her daughter looking for an affordable place to live after a seperation. She finds an apartment on dreary Rossevelt Island and soon begins to hear noises from the apartment above.The whole setting is dark and depressing from it constantly raining, the lack of color anywhere to the depressing situation that the single mother and her adorable daughter are stuck in. I won't ruin the end but it was extremely sad and dark.Rent this movie if you are feeling down and it will surely keep you there."},{"rating":"1","title":"When you fall asleep be sure to wake up for the end","review":"Dark water was a movie a lot of people expected to be really good but the truth is it isn't. It's almost like false advertisement because the movie wasn't scary at all and it was very boring and way to long. I fell asleep a after the first half hour and when I watched the parts I missed I knew why I went to sleep. It's the slowest movie I've ever seen, you find is some interest in it to see what's up with the dark water but it turns into being a watered down version of The Ring. Everything is obvious from the beginning, you know why the dead child is torturing the apartment building and after that you just watch to see how she died. The only thing making this movie even a little worth watching is the surprising ending. It's better to see the original Japanese version anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ring was Great but Let's Leave Well Enough Alone!","review":"Jennifer Connelly is beautiful and a very talented actor, but like someone else stated that was not enough to save this film. Enough of the Japanese remakes. The Ring was a great remake of Ringu. But The Grudge, Dark Water, and many others need to just stop it. I am just waiting for Hollywood to Remake Tommy a very played out Japanese series of flims about a girl who won't die and keeps getting reborn in strange ways. There are about a dozen of them literally; Tommy, Tommy Replay, etc.I just hope Hollywood doesn't touch Spiral a great Japanese film. The Ring was great but let's leave Well enough alone.If you want to see Jennifer Connelly in a great horror Film, rent Creepers by Dario Argento, she is about 15 or 16 years old and is excellent in this film.

All it turned out to be was sort of long and boring at time. Here's the problem, without spoiling the movie. The pace of the movie didn't move up at all. Instead it crawled at a very linear angle and just didn't seem to rise to a climax that was satisfying. Jennifer Connelly is a gorgeous actress and an extremely convincing one at that. But, her talents were waisted in this very surreal movie. I like the claustrophobic atmosphere the movie conveys, but, I never felt that the character was really in any danger or in a really terrifying situation. Like I said, it had potential, but really didn't take you to where it should have. The ending was great and unexpected, but, as a whole, the movie was way too drawn out.See it for yourself and see what you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thousands times better than The Ring","review":"When I heard about this movie, I thought it was just another The Ring, but it wasn't. If you want somethings scary and gory, go watch something else because this movie doesn't have that. Instead, it's full of emotions. The acting is excellent. And the ending can melt your heart.

Ceicei isn't as cute as ikuko!

Greatist japanese movie ever!If you wanna watch good remakes, watch the ring or the amityville horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"A depressing situation ain't scary, just depressing","review":"I found this film to be more depressing than scary. The bulk of it seems focused on the soul numbing daily problems faced by a recently divorced young mother. I wish to forget the \\"rat-race\\" part of life when I am in that darkened dream arena, not be plunged eyeball deep in another's. For the most part, whatever few scares there are can easily be explained by natural causes, provided by the film's storyline. The music and overloud/overdramatic sound effects try desperately to drum up the suspense...but grow tiresome when there are no payoffs in the story. It's got a group of good actors that need a story with an arc that includes tension and release, ups and downs of human emotions, scenes that instill dread and suspense...drama. Not unrelenting depressing existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"*yawn*","review":"This movie was very slow going. If you are looking for a good scare......keep looking.

Even more disappointing, however, was the fact that I found the exact same plans, illustrations, and photos found in several home plans magazines, particularly those by Home Planners, inc.Overall, the book was short on substance and detail, and the plans were so convoluted, I felt I had opened a puzzle book instead of an architecture/design book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flimsy!","review":"My son got this for Christmas (03).

The focus of this miniseries was on the relationships between the various characters, but in doing so the fierce condemnation of the English Civil Litigation system that I remember as the main focus of the book is lessened. The production comes across as a love story -- the many facets of love but that was not, in my mind, Dicken's main purpose in writting this book. Something in the original is lost, however, the series was compelling. My wife was enthralled and we watched nothing else for a week until we had gotten though all 15 episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faithful to the Book","review":"I just finished reading the book--all 900+ pages so I treated myself to the movie.

But often the translation of these 2D characters into film makes for maudlin entertainment and doesn't do justice to Dicken's stories or writing. In this adaptation many creative filming devices are used to convey nuance and subtlety that add some of the deeper meanings (not necessarily portrayed by the characters) into the film. It truly captures Dicken's juxtapositioning of the dark and deluded aspects of humanity with the potential for goodness or at least humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I started watching Bleak House and I was hooked. Wonderful, complicated, full of quirky Dickens characters. Must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable Production","review":"Dickens is obviously a master in character creation and story telling. This fifteen-episode BBC production of Dickens' Bleak House does him proud in both these areas. The characters are rich, noble, admirable, awe inspiring, exemplary, but also groveling, disgusting, frustrating, and evil. The staging is well paced to the point where the viewer can't wait to get to the next episode. I found this production pure delight and want to know if there are any classic miniseries of this genre that are as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"This one surprised me. Remakes of films based on classic novels usually fail to thrill me, but this film is not only better than its predecessor, it is one of the best films I have seen based on a Dickens novel (and I think perhaps I have seen them all).

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment!","review":"This was a very enjoyable mini-series. I loved this dark Dickens' story, the characters were varied and interesting. I thought it was well acted and very satisfiying. Gillian Anderson was remarkable in her portrayal of a sad and bored wife, even if some of her mannerisms were a bit phony.

I am an avid Dickens fan and it is rare for me to find a film which does his work justice. This miniseries is more than up for the challenge. Dark, gorgeous and often heart-wrenching, this one will stay with you for a while. The cast is pitch-perfect. Gillian Anderson especially captured her character in a heart-breaking way. Charles Dance too, makes a chilling villain and I absolutely fell in love with Anna Maxwell Martin and Richard Harrington as love interests. Their chemistry had a sweetness to it which is often hard to find in movies. The script translates Dicken's rambling language into a speakable version and the cinematography uses a few modern twists to give this old story a slightly updated feel. This is a great movie to curl up with on a rainy night and get sucked into the magic. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely well done","review":"The acting in this mini series in superb! I was very impressed. The overall production was excellent. They do a very good job of recreating that 18th century time period in London and showing the differences between the classes of people. Gillian Anderson has never looked more beautiful. Worth buying just to gaze at her."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one to own","review":"I often am disappointed with remakes, especially when I think highly of previous versions. The 1985 version of BH with Diana Rigg was excellent, but I didn't think it perfect; I thought it dragged along in parts, and I wasn't interested at all by some of the portrayals, including Denholm Elliott who appeared too old even for a role that's supposed to be middle-aged. This 2005 version is first-rate in every respect. Gillian Anderson's restrained, cold, haughty, and yet obviously tortured Lady Dedlock was first-rate; the portrayal of all the other characters were entirely believable, and Pauline Collins was a treat in her small role. Charles Dance's villain seemed a bit over the top in terms of unmitigated malice, but he certainly was great to watch. The plot is as convoluted as ever but this presentation kept it comprehensible, and moving right along. I give this an edge over the earlier version"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"You cannot plan a trip on any of the off-trail routes based upon the information in this book. It has lots of nice information about plants and large stands of old growth forest. This is a nice touch which many guidebooks simply overlook. Most of the offtrail routes have little more than a couple of sentences. This is not a Beckey Guide by nay means."},{"rating":"2","title":"He is a REAL Sifu.","review":"I trained with Sifu Lyons for 5 years at his dojo in Lake Arrowhead, California, and he also had a Dojo in Big Bear, California. So any talk of Sifu Lyons being an amatuer is absurd. This guy is the real deal. He trained Tiger, Crane, Monkey, and Snake. He is also a Master of Shaolin Choung Hop Kuen kung-fu, and also extremly versed in the style of Muay Thai. So any of you afraid to purchase the video because of the one-star reviews because he not a real Sifu is 100% false."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sifu???","review":"Lyons doesn't look like any Sifu I've ever seen. His movements are weak, and his horse stance is just a slight bend of the knee. He looks like a beginner, who filmed an instructional video in his garage.When I bought this video, I thought I'd be getting the tiger form I've seen before. Very low stances, with dynamic hand forms. It's called \\"Tiger\\" kung fu for a reason.I don't know what Lyons is doing, but it's definitely not a powerful Tiger form. I wouldn't even recommend this to a beginner, because Lyons just juggles the same 6 or 7 moves. I've seen children do better forms than this. Awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Information","review":"This is a full-length presentation of information on Tiger Style Kung Fu. The presenter is not famous, but the material is well worth having. The DVD is copied from VHS, it appears.

The characters were flat and the relationships never really explored...It was also entirely TOO coincidental...The slowest part of the story is the \\"meat\\"- the entire body of the novel - when \\"Lucy\\" is wandering throughout Greece etc...the narrative is not descriptive and often jumps and it is really hard to follow. I know the author is trying to get you into Lucy's frame of mind, but enough already. I was very disappointed and the ending was not that great either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent design...","review":"After reviewing this book I must say that I'm really want to see what is going on in that design office at this very moment... ...

I got the impression the ink wasn't quite dry when they shipped it.Other than that, enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"a glaring problem with the book","review":"This book offers a comprehensive look at Apple's design, to be sure - and it's a story worth telling. However, the presentation is fundamentally flawed in that it reads like propaganda from the Jobs machine. The fact of the matter is that Jobs had very little to do with design at Apple, or with anything else that Apple did well, for that matter. The myth of Jobs is a nothing more than a fraud - an incredibly successful fraud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent voices and \\"acting out\\".","review":"Martin Jarvis and Rosalind Ayres give a captivating account of the ESSENCE or essential stories of the Old and especially New Testaments.

With some creativity, we were able to install it without cutting additional holes in the ceiling. It looks great and I'm so glad we ordered this replacement.My only negative comment about this product is the \\"instructions\\" (and I use that term loosely, in this case). The documentation was confusing, incomplete, and utterly useless. It's clear that the manufacturer assumed only electricians (who would not look at the documentation) would buy this product. Thank goodness my husband is an engineer, or we would have had to call a contractor just to replace a light fixture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low readability in a number of passages","review":"When I ordered this book, I was not informed of the production process. At the reception of the book I read \\"How We Made This Book\\" on page IV. I quote: \\"We automated the typing, proof reading and design of this book using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software on a scanned copy of the original rare book. That allowed us to keep the cost as low as possible.\\"Nice. If I had known this before I whouldn't have bought it, for I had already worked with OCR and found out that you often get some odd results as OCR frequently does not recognize characters and vomits parts of sentences in some not yet discovered language. For example: \\"wittTfijeacHaL\\", or: \\"Jf Jhev will notgCL-thfij are shot down, theijJeiUiandsbeing cut off\\". That's what the reader of this book is confronted with.

A premier album by an alternative pop master. Andalucia ranks as one of the more beautiful love songs in it's flowing, pondering melody and aching lyrics. Title track is one of the more artistic pop songs composed, discussing everything from Beaujolais, visitors(ghosts) and fallen continents. It's a nervous song, developing tensions with a chopping, velvets piano then releasing at the break into a pastorial moment of ecstasy complete with birds and distant trumpets. This album is a real gem and on my top ten list. To be listened to when in love, dying, traveling or in analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Volume Defect / VERY LOW VOLUME","review":"If you buy this brand please be aware you better use the closed caption as the sound level is extremly low.

The characters in 'Last Night of Ballyhoo,' seriously examine the idea of Southern Jews in the 1930s, and the reader finds herself alternately laughing and cringing at their attitudes and pronouncements. Simply reading the play was a wonderful experience; I'd love to see it performed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the ballyhoo about?","review":"Mediocre garbage by the same guy who wrote \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\". Yet another mediocre play about Southern jews.

To the listener who pays attention to the vibe from the music, the music is catchy and uplifting. Parachutes happens to be a bit more thoughtful, but the cd still has a positive feel to it. The lyrics are amazing if you are a lyrics freak like me. The whole cd has a Scarborough Fair feel to it. Counter melodies mixed in perfect harmony yielding a distinct yet irresistible sound.

I'm impressed with the energy in which they attack their music. There's such a fun vibe to their stuff and I can't help but get sucked into their sound.

Especialle the passage of the two great rivers but also the 1 hour approach to Chicago Union Station going backwards into the station is really worth the money. For a cabride I find it in the upper half. You see almost all of the strech but for change of betteries and film a you don't really mind the short breaks as you do noty miss any junctions or stations. There are no long periods focusing on the engineers or the instruments and the conversation between the engineers (one of them a woman) is mildly entertaning,Two years ago when I was in Chicago it was my pkan to rode by Amtrak to Los Angeles on the Southwest Chief but some thing came in the way so for me this is a great substitution.We cab-ride buffs want to see the route uninterrupted through the front window with no superfluous comments so in this regard it is almost perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn to Knit","review":"The woman in the video is not annoying like other videos I have tried.

The video is clearly and consisely demonstrated, the new knitter cannot go wrong with this resource. The author takes a relaxed friendly pace to ensure a full understanding of each demonstration.

I spent over a week with three other books (Maran illustrated, Stitch n Bitch, Knitting for dummies) and couldn't get past the third row before ripping it out and starting over. By following Nici's advice of switching to 11 needles and chunky wool instead of worsted and then addressing that sloppy loop at the end of the row right away (instead of in Chap 3), I had immediate success. Now I can go back to the books and say, \\"of course!\\"The production is more polished than I expected and she is likeable. I just want to reach in and hug her! The auto-pause is brilliant.

During this time my friends tried to teach me how to knit. They bought the supplies, instructional books, and spent hours trying to teach me knitting to no avail. My cognitive function had decreased so much, they might as well have been teaching me rocket science. Then I bought this DVD. Even though I was temporarily mentally and cognitavely impaired, I was able to understand the instructions and actually begin and finish a small project (scarf). The instructions are very slow and detailed.

As a recovering perfectionist, it is difficult to try new things. A counselor recommended knitting as a peaceful meditation, and when I read the Amazon reviews for this DVD, I thought I had found a good learning tool. Nici is such an enthusiastic and patient teacher, and the pacing of the DVD is just perfect. Moves are introduced very slowly, with extremely helpful words and demonstrations. Within minutes, I was knitting! Wahoo! I especially enjoy her First Aid Kit chapter, where she teaches you to spot your mistakes and unknit. The Beginners' Booby Trap information was great - the last time I tried to learn to knit, I fell into these mistakes unwittingly. They were so clearly explained in this DVD that I could catch myself almost as soon as I made them. I am SO glad I bought this DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to watch and learn from","review":"I had never knitted before watching this and am now fairly comfortable wiht purchasing a knitting pattern from the craft store and completing a nice looking produt.

That's all I'm gonna tell you, because the film works best when you don't know what will happen. This is one of the most unpredictable and enjoyable films ever made. Now for the new DVD, Criterion has done a masterful job with the films transfer, the film's never looked better, color's are brighter and the audio is crystal clear!

Upon checking, I discover it's being played at the 4-hour speed (LP). This is sometimes done in order to get a longer movie on a shorter cassette to save manufacturing costs. It's not always indicated on the box.I was disappointed at this, for the price I paid. Movies at Wal-Mart for cheaper might be that way; at least I'm not surprised then. But I was with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"deceitful","review":"I had this movie sent to my nephew in Sarasota, unfortunately it would not play because MOVIE MARS sent the wrong region and to make matters even worse only refunded me the cost of the movie, I had to pay their shipping charges and additional shipping charges to send the movie back and they would not even exchange it.

So my feedback is specifically for those two islands. I must say the book was very spotty in terms of the quality of recommendations and its comprehensiveness. First, many of the locations that were recommended(restaurants/sights) were hit or miss. Second, I was so frustrated with the book that I went to restaurants that were unlisted and found them to be 100 times better that the author's recommendations. Which raised serious questions, \\"why weren't these restaurants listed in the book?\\" Moorea has a very limited number of restaurants and thus no restaurant should be excluded (Note: The restaurant was not new and the owner said it had been around for many years - just in case you were wondering).In addition, the book is not well organized when you're trying to look for things.I suggest you find another book if you're headed to French Polynesia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that groovy","review":"Average Nuggets-inspired rock music.

The authors used a very broad definition of \\"mystery,\\" which one can easily see by reading the \\"editorial review\\" here. So many topics were covered, it was impossible to go into detail on many. Some \\"mysteries\\" were discussed in a single paragraph, while others spanned several pages.Yes, there were several points of interest throughout the book. But it was one of those that, had I not finished it, I would not have been disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jungle Lore, by Jim Corbett","review":"Jungle Lore is a book that any real Corbett fan genuinely needs to read. This is the essential Corbett. This is the book in which Corbett tells about his youth, and growing up in India. It is, however, different from his other books, such as The Maneaters of Kumuoan, in that it is not specifically about hunting tigers. Rather, he tells us about how he learned to read the jungle signs, and learn the languaages of many of the jungle creatures. In this book, he does ranble a bit, but he also tells about some of his hunting experiences. If you're a Corbett fan, you really need to read this book,"},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting discovery of cycle analysis","review":"In purchasing Delta, I thought that I was going to be able make a lot of money in the stock market since the ups and downs are already locked in.

I've given this book one star based on the fact that fundamentally Delta is utterly useless when it comes to accurate buying and selling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please tell me this is not Welles Wilder of RSI and ADX","review":"I read a copy a friend had of this nonsense.I was very disappointed to see it was Welles Wilder of RSI and ADX fame. There is an article in the book where he said he wrote his first book because he needed money (he lost money trading) that book covered RSI and ADX!I do think both ADX and RSI have some value. If you look at RSI is mimics Z-Score (very closely) so maybe Welles being an engineer saw that and made RSI a version of z-score. ADX is very similar to moving averages...back this review.If you look at the charts in the book he writes the wave numbers 1,2,3...and so on. Then some of the charts show 1, 1... then 10, 10. Why is there a wave 1 and wave 1 again? He does not say.He must have been smoking something really good when he bought the rights to publish this total work of trash. I hope no fools paid him 35k to join his group. What a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critical missing information","review":"This is a good book on the leather working aspects harness making, and but for one critical detail, it would be a good book. What makes the book less than useful and potentially harmful to the horse is that there is NO information on fitting the harness/bridles/etc. to any particular horse. All sizing is done by weight, which as anyone should know, weight doesn't dictate body shape. Without any information on how to correctly fit what you make to the horse you're making it for makes this book woefully incomplete. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll feel you're in the Asylum","review":"Grant Morrison and Dave McKean's Arkham Asylum is the best Batman book. The story chronicles the establishment of the Asylum as the dumping ground for the criminally-insane. Morrison also asks, is Batman the source of all insanity in Gotham? It may be debatable but Bats keeps the cells filled and it's too coincidental that almost all of his adversaries are wackos. McKean's art truly captures the insanity that goes within the walls. Using various techniques, he conveys each inmate's personality with subtle shifts in art. Truly excellent. Truly a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped!","review":"Terrible, terrible, terrible! Grant Morrison is of the school of thought that the more you shock your audience, the better. That could be a sound strategy were it not for the fact that somewhere in there, you need a good story, which this isn't. Yes, Arkham Asylum is full of stark-raving lunatics who hate not only Batman, but just about everyone else. But the madness in this story doesn't feel like it's there for the purpose of advancing the plot or explaining things to the reader. In Morrison's hands it just feels gratuitious. And the art is bad... I can understand going a little outside the norm to get the point across. But call me crazy, I actually like to SEE what is going on. Imagine a movie set being lit by a 40-watt bulb, and you'll get a good idea of what you're in store for when you pick up this item..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphic SF Reader","review":"This book was very disappointing when it came out.

It was definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"When I sat down to read this book, I did not expect to see such crazy and sloppy artwork. Sloppy in a good way mind you. It had a great story to begin with and then everything went wrong. I couldn't tell who he was fighting, who was talking or what i was looking at. And then the book ended. I kept turning back the pages to see if I missed something. Frankly the book wasn't worth the money. I reads faster than a comic."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old same old","review":"This story jumps frequently from the journals of Arkhams founder back to the main story, the transitions are not done smoothly, which makes the storytelling awkward.The basic theme: the criminals in Arkham are insane, Batman is insane, and therefore the criminals and Batman are one and the same, and can only rely upon fate and madness to get out of the asylum, where they have all become trapped. You get to watch Batman hallucinate, stabs himself, whimper for his mother, and has a non-reaction when the Joker blows a guards head off. Come on, I've had enough of the \\"hero is the same as the baddies\\" stuff, let the heroes be heros.The typography is bad, especially for the Joker, who speaks in large red letters which are nearly unreadable...kind of like this graphic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"looney toons...or just an excuse for sloppy work","review":"Hey, let's write about the criminally insane.

There is not once a faltering of quality, from the glorious sunburst that is the opening organ on \\"Heavenly Pop Hit\\" to the sublime fading chimes of the title track. It invigorates and captivates the soul, until one feels one is bleeding raw emotion and crying pure tears of 'joie de vivre'. The poetry and honesty of Martin Phillip's lyrics is unequalled.

The fascists were power-hungry thugs who changed their rhetoric to gain votes, in both cases, Italy and Germany.That being said, I still strongly recommend this book as a good introduction to the roots of fascism. Eatwell's writing is lucid and his research of the behind-the-scenes politics is impressive.While I would have appreciated more on the ideology rather than the politics of fascism, apparently the ideology was almost a facade, so no deep philosophical questions need be raised."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Research?

There is nothing advanced about the material in this DVD, not only that, but the information is simply useless to someone who wants to model for production.

However, if your imagination is robust enough to envision something beyond the ordinary, something truly unique, buy this album and listen to it right away. Listen to it in one sitting!

I'd just like to suggest that you could, more justifiably, interpret this album as nothing. There's nothing to get except the sense that beefheart is laughing at your ignorant, naive, trusting a**es all the way to the bank.

I don't know how they managed to cram so little onto a cd - there is literally no music here whatsoever. You think that the first track is starting out with some arty studio sounds or random tuning or something, but the whole album sounds like that.

This CD represents everything wrong with experimental music - it's indulgent, pretentious, and worst of all: false. This album is a lie, and all of the stories floating around about Beefheart's true musical skill or amazing, detailed work on this album are just canards. Don't let the truth be obfuscated by a string of poorly thought out 5-star reviews. This was a pile of garbage, thrown together without care, and unleashed on a stupid public.

This album is not noise, it is music albeit very atonal. This is rootsy Salvador Dali for the ears.I have been listening to this disc for about 30 years and I am still amazed to hear some of the angular melodies that permeate from the guitars on this disc. The sections don't last long before they shift gears. A lot of small pieces of this puzzle are very enjoyable while others are very harsh. There is a great sense of humor in Don Vliet's delivery.The different parts are played oftentimes in different time signatures which meet every 12th beat. 4/4 on 3/4.

At least worthless fluff has some real cheese value. Worthless noise such as Trout Mask Replica is just an annoyance and a $[money] hole in your wallet.How can it be \\"tuneless, raspy and very cryptic lyric-wise\\" but also be \\"a brilliant album\\"?

This is an affront to native trouts like myself, since the sacred holy traditions of trouts hold that actual trout masks should not be displayed in public. Captain Beefheart (Beef Heart? or Bee Fart?) tricked the trout nation when he agreed to use a replica on the album cover, and then went ahead and used a real trout mask. This is very politically incorrect in the trout streams of America (where one can go trout fishing in America. Ha ha).

Musically, this goes further, well beyond the 4/4 beats and one dimensional lyrics. It doesn't belong to any genre-there are traces of blues, poetry, and jazz, but the key word is TRACES.

Nothing like it, ever, anywhere. Beefheart directs his childlike mania to creating a new anti-rhythym, an atonal beat which doesn't even pander to the still markedly African and well-timed drum thrashing of Coleman's watershed Free Jazz.Moonlight On Vermont is an exorcism of your soul in silver and gray silhouette. My Human Gets Me Blues is the new world philosophy, towering over modern academia. Old Fart at Play is the most sentimental masterwork since Chaplin's City Lights.Oh, yeah, and if Rock ever produced a Beethoven, it was Beefheart. Notice the similarity in names? It's no coincidence.Buy this. Buy it now.

I have listened to it several times and just can't seem to grasp it. There seems to be a total lack of melody or even structure in the song writing. Combine that with the Captain's animal like growling vocals and the strangest guitar work I have ever heard, flat and monotone like. What's it all mean? Was this the beginning of punk? I hesitate to call it trash. There is some imagination in it and for that I gave it 2 stars. Maybe with the help of a certain herb it might become clearer; but I don't think there is enough of that on the whole planet to clarify this piece of obscurity."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ALBUM EVER!","review":"I give this 5 stars I NEVER found it difficult to listen to.(You wanna know a \\"difficult\\" record?

Somewhere along the way I put it on the turntable and everything just clicked. What I had first considered utter garbage has turned into the greatest album of the last 30 years. You have to work at it, but it really is worth it in the end. It is beyond anything you have ever heard. It somehow combines all music -- Delta blues, free jazz, gospel, rock, punk, etc -- into a mind bending wonder. I've been listening to this album for 20 years and it ceases to amaze me. I compare everything that has come out since my own initiation to this album.

Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable.","review":"Though I know the holier-than-thou Beefheart cult will probably take offense at my saying so, this album isn't especially brilliant. As a few other reviewers have pointed out, it is possible to understand what somebody was trying to do AND STILL NOT LIKE IT. Don't flatter yourselves, this isn't some gateway into a magical world - it was one band's attempt at something new and different. This was certainly accomplished, and there is some innovative stuff, but it isn't the sort of thing that autmotically qualifies as a brilliant album.

This album has two serious problems, both of which would be forgivable if the other wasn't present. First, it shows nearly no musicality (and I'm not just talking about harmony or melody, but the presence of any kind of music). Second, it is terrifically boring. I can't think of any circumstances that would cause me to listen to it again.Back to the loch with you, Nessie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the zero stars button?","review":"I cannot believe that I'm listening to the same album that everyone else is.

Surely, this must be the modern equivalent of Varese. I wasn't really expecting it to be immediately accessible, nor did I think that it would sound like popular music at all. The problem is, I couldn't get this thought out of my head: what would an album sound like if it was made by people who truly had NO musical skill? The answer, of course, is exactly like this. Sorry, mates, but this is truly deserving of one star, and even that is slightly generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if I live forever, I'll not be listening to this again.","review":"Considering how much it costs to get an album nowadays, you can't really justify throwing something away. Then again, you can't really justify listening to this album twice. Here's a tip: if your friends tell you that this is the best music ever made, borrow their copy first. If, after that, you decide you can't live without it, then buy it - but make sure that you don't buy this solely on the strength of someone else's recommendation, or you may make a tragic mistake.

It was the Capt. honing in on his eccentric musical taste to make a brilliant record and by God the man succeeded! This avant-garde album, which many regard as a masterpiece, is a must listen. It takes a few listens to fully appreciate Beefheart's taste, but once you find some interesting hooks and quirks, this will be one of your prised albums. Like it or not, you must appreciate this man's musical exploration, it was certainly influential!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly Unhinged!","review":"Pop music is better for the existence of this kind of music. From the opening notes of \\"Bill's Corpse\\" (with a great coda) to the funky bassline of \\"Sweet Sweet Bulbs\\" (my favorite track), this is the most adventurous album ever released (or is it unleashed?)on the public. Okay, the Magic Band's avant-garde and wild approach to rock/jazz/howlin' blues didn't yield them anything near chart success, but that's the whole point, this is music for open-minded, ingenius people. The last 32 years have done nothing to dilute the power and originality of this bold, groundbreaking recording. For some it may take a few dozen listens for it all to sink in. For others it simply won't make sense at all and they'll abanadon all attempts to understand it (too bad for them). Those of us with brilliant minds and truly open ears will not only get it right away, we'll become addicted! A Classic, Influential Recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the raspberries?","review":"Being a total drooling fan of PJ Harvey, I figure if she waxes poetic about Captain Beefheart, he must be something special, right? So I order this album. I'd heard a few Beefheart clips here and there, but not enough to form an opinion. It arrives, and when I play it I am completely confused. \\"What is this?! You call this music? Sounds like a bunch of drunks playing instruments and making up songs!\\", I think. I play it again the next day, hoping it would be different. It was. What seemed like a bunch of drunks randomly playing notes somehow came together. I promise I'm not on drugs. It's still one of the wierdest albums I've ever come across, but one of the best. I would still like to know what he means by \\"fast and bulbous\\", though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Sgt Pepper's","review":"Like anchovies, caviar, and professional wrestling, Beefheart is an acquired taste. But to a lot of us elderly hippie types, this is one of the two or three greatest albums ever made by anybody. What does it sound like? Kind of like a blues group and a jazz group playing in the same room at the same time. Sort of. But Beefheart could smoke when he wanted to and this album isn't anywhere near as unbearably pretentious as some of the \\"great\\" stuff being played about the same time. And NOBODY has sounded like this since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trout Mask Replica rules","review":"This is the best and most creative album I have ever heard.

This is a great album, no debate about that. It sounds like garbage when you first listen to, but force yourself to listen to it all the way through the first time you sit down and turn it on. That will at least give you a sense of pride about your pain tolerance. After a few more listens (Up to 10, I can ALMOST guarantee that the negative reviews are from people who didn't listen to it 10 times or more) you'll love it. It seems like a heavy price to pay, but once you get what's going on here (They rehearsed for a year.

Half of the five-star reviews suggest that it was composed and rehearsed in nine hours, and that its \\"beautiful\\" lack of form is due to the improvisational nature of the project. The other half assert that it was carefully rehearsed for a year, and that every single bit of studio noise and ridiculousness was planned. I have my own theory: this is a giant, steaming pile of garbage. Here's a question for all of you b-fart fans: how would this album sound different if it was played by pre-school kids?

If you hated it at first, it may haveve grown on you. After a first listen, I thought Trout Mask Replica was a great album. There are some parts of me that likes it more than Safe As Milk when it comes to artistic freedom. Captain Beefhart had plenty of that with songs like \\"Frownland\\" \\"Hair Pie\\", \\"Neon Meat Dream of a Octofish\\", and \\"Old Fart at Play\\". The album is musically great like Safe As Milk. Songs such as \\"Ella Guru\\", \\"Moonlight on Vermont\\", \\"Pachuco Cadaver\\", and \\"Hobo Chang Ba\\" are a few examples. Also, you got Frank Zappa himself producing this. However, the album is 78 minutes (which can luckily fit onto one CD). The listener could grow tired of it as to Safe As Milk, it was a good half-hour deal. Still when you look at it all together, Trout Mask Replica is a fantastic album. There'll probably never be another album like it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mondo strange, and unlistenable","review":"In Detroit, there's a self-proclaimed \\"artist\\" that spent over a decade collecting old, ratty shoes and attaching them to the outer walls and roof of his house. Called simply \\"The Shoe House,\\" the massive eyesore represents the diversity of humanity and the journey through life in which we all must walk. Or something like that.Trout Mask Replica reminds me of The Shoe House. Here's a guy that wastes more than a year painstakingly teaching his band how to play the weirdest, most fatally warped, unlistenable music imaginable. The Shoe House is, to any reasonable person, a big eyesore. Even after repeated listenings, Trout Mask Replica has the same effect on the ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled - it's worse than awful.","review":"Nothing compares to it.

Through the years of my youth I heard so much about Captain Beefheart. When I was young it was hard to get his discs but I finally was able to get SAFE AS MILK. Eh... it didn't thrill me. Delta blues with a bad band and a bad voice. However, since I was a Zappa fan I knew Frank produced TROUT MASK and I read that it was in Rolling Stones Top 100 albums (this was in the early 80's when the journalism in Rolling Stone was credible and not the tripe it is today) I felt it would be worth getting. After seacrhing high & low I found it - and boy was I disappointed. It was unlistenable. To me it was a mess!!! It was painful. But I don't want to totally write it off because it does have an artsy-fartsy appeal to it and some listeners may dig Beefhearts odd poetry and the bad musicianship.

In general, you either love it or you hate it, but loving it doesn't necessarily make you a Mensa member... this album is different and interesting, but simply not for everybody...

However, this album is just terrible, and it's important that people not put up with jokes just because they are new or different.

Be suspicious of albums like this - the crazy, cult following (and the music itself) is more as a result of the desire to be the weirdest of all then any actual desire on Beefheart's part to express his true musical self. This is as bad as it things could possibly sound - and it hurts me to say that because we love Frank Zappa.

Along the way, she meets Pam, a sexy librarian, Deidre Felix, the 60-something tutor who's getting a divorce, and Whitney, the professional lesbian whom Lori starts a relationship with.

Brent isn't necessarily the most charasmatic teacher, and he does appear disorganized from time to time in this video, but where else can you see him play all of his signature licks and learn each one? The slow down feature helps so much because it takes the video from a \\"How the heck did he play that\\" video to \\"Ohhh.... I see what you did there\\".

A wealth of resources for the reader to draw upon, including websites noted for their accuracy and lists of visitor centers, museums, and battleground sites open to the public, Battlegrounds Of Freedom is a vital resource especially for re-enactment groups but also useful to historians and casual readers alike.

This is the closest that fans will ever get to having George Lucas' rough drafts for his original trilogy. The format is styled like a series of interviews and is combined with snippets of synopsis from the various drafts of each film. The scenes are typed up as a screenplay and then diverted with the interviews and the correlating draft material. It reads much like a transcript of DVD commentary track. My only gripe with this book, and it is very minor, is that it is missing some lines of dialog. This book is an interesting read and is a really cool way of examining how the Star Wars universe may have ended up. It's also a very intriguing way of examining the creative process.

Surely her research into Orthodox Jews in general would have suggested that girls in the Lubavitch community are NOT representative of those in either mainstream Orthodox Jewish or \\"ultra-orthodox\\" Chassidic communities, in which gender segregated schools are also the norm. As such, it's not clear how she can assert so confidently that the relative immaturity and extrovertedness of the girls she observes comes from their lack of inter-gender contact. The failure to \\"test\\" for alternative hypotheses - say, for example, the goals of community leaders, or the dictates of Lubavitch philosophy (neither of which are thoroughly examined - makes this even more problematic."},{"rating":"2","title":"love, love, love it","review":"This was such a wonderful eye-opening book about the variety of girls in the Lubavitch community in Crown Heights. This book breaks the stereotype that says that girls from very religious families become \\"drone-like\\" or don't have their individuality. Within their very prescribed world, because of the teachings and influence of the rebbe, there are countless opportunities for personal exploration and expression. It was inspiring to me as a mother of a girl as well; I want my daughter to have some of the passion and commitment displayed in these pages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, but not purely accurate","review":"As a friend of one of the girls portrayed in this book, I was very excited to read it. It was definitely entertaining, but after discussion with my friend I was troubled by it's inaccuracy. It seems to be less a portrayal of individual girls than a description of different types of girls, with the stories and personalities of several people blended into one character. Stephanie was concerned about the ability of people in the community to identify the girls involved in the book (which they did easily anyway), and perhaps this fear led her to obscure and blend important facts. Several of the events she describes my friend participating in never happened as far as she can recall, so it is difficult to know who they happened to or if they did at all. As a former anthropology major, this aspect concerns me. It's still a fun book to read, but I would approach it more as a work of fiction based in fact than a purely anthropological study."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are making her fat!!","review":"I got a shelter kitty and although she is 6 years old, she is so much smallerthan my Maine Coon cat -she is half blue- but she is so very, very loving,and social.

Very generalized, rather dry, and often unclear work, at times verging towards being obscure and confusing, which I assume is due to either poor technical editing, or a general inability on the part of the authors to express their knowledge in print. The chapter explaining the earth's revolution and rotation in particular seems unnecessarily vague and unhelpful, and the book in general is filled with facts with little supporting explication as to the whys and wherefores of the information being provided.If you are looking for a book that will help you to understand the principles of physical geography, this is not it.

We purchased this one on line and he LOVED the camo cover and cup holders. He has no problem getting into and out of the seat himself in our Ford Explorer. The seat is also more comfortable than the ones I could buy in the store (there seems to be more padding). I love that it is very easy to take in and out of my car when needed and that it folds so easily. We are very happy with this booster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compass review","review":"Well we have had this seat for 6 months now and it is really sweet. The nicest made car seat of all we have utilized as the kids are growing. Its the most comfortable and highest quality of all I looked at. I mean the only other one with similar ratings is three times the price. Like other reviews note the seat does not recline so sleeping the kids need a side pillow or their head falls forward. But the seat is really easy to adjust to the perfect height. It switches to another car in seconds. The foldable arms, cup and snack holders are sturdy. The fabric and padding and plastic are really well made compared to lesser models. I would recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - Do not Buy this Book!","review":"This book is shallow and misleading. The author simply does not address the real root of why people become suicide bombers, in fact she makes up any excuse except the real one. Suicide bombers become suicice bombers due to humiliation, oppression, descrimination and lack of freedom. It is an act of desperation and the only way that the Palestinians have left to strike back at their Islraeli oppressors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Advice - I couldn't believe it!","review":"Like the writer from Memphis, I too bought this book in good faith. I had to re-read the author's comments on spaying and neutering a thousand times I was so dumbfounded. \\"Spaying and neutering deprives a dog from the joys of parenthood\\"? Are you kidding me? It is absolutely that kind of thinking that leads to the millions of homeless animals that have to be euthanized. My advice to the author, spend a few weeks volunteering at a shelter (I have volunteered at one for 3 years) Witness shelters that are bursting at the seams because of his logic. Maybe then the author would realize that the \\"joys of parenthood\\" mean nothing when faced with the realities of euthanasia"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog and Cat Care the Natural Way","review":"Good overview, but doesn't have a lot on how to keep a dog healthy...just cures for common problems.

Worse than the most pretentious excesses of Micky Dolenz in the late 60s. Worse than Crispin Glover's album The Big Problem Does Not Equal The Solution.

As bad as the singing of Herv�� Villechaize, but at least Herv�� spared us any vinyl releases.Quite stunning that any record company would fund such insipid trash or that any listener would share Parks' delusion that this was in any way meritorious.

I really like Van Dyke's cacophonic Americana, songs of dustbowl youngsters eschewing the Vietnam war for the big Hollywood rock 'n roll boom of the Sixties (The All Golden), his analogy of Civil War slavery to the starving Proletariat in Russia (By The People), etc. It's a little bit Paul McCartney with a Charles Ives orchestra working overtime.

It's overwhelmingly lush, takes many hairpin turns and changes color every five seconds - but don't let this put you off upon first listen.

Paul Rieckoff deserves a lot of praise for his willingness to take up the cause of Veterans. We all should follow his lead and make it a priority to support those who have had to fight in this war-- or any war for that matter. READ IT. You will be glad you did regardless of how you feel about Iraq. And if you don't care about the issues, then read it for entertainment. It is VERY entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"Paul Rieckhoff's Chasing Ghosts is a straight forward non-fictional account of his tour in Iraq. His thoughts, his men, his experiences. It's at times poignantly funny, yet heart stoppingly sobering. When he talks about the children of Iraq, his desire to do what he was sent there to do is palpable.

This is probably the third or fourth book I've read in this ultra-mini genre.Paul Riekhoff is an exceptional documentarian (in the literary sense). His insight, style, wit and honesty provide the reader with an incredible testimony. Please purchase this book, for yourself, for your parents, siblings, friends, and most certainly for any young person, because they unfortunately are the most easily mislead by a society which has failed them in providing an accurate and balanced perception of the world. This book, and others like it, are the antidote."},{"rating":"2","title":"I believe this is it.","review":"The author is a brave and honest man in tellling the way he feels the war is truly going.

Gee, how many platoon leaders in the Florida Guard got to go get a White House photo with Hillary? This book is so biased and supports the claims of many of his troops that he was an attention hound in country. We call guys like this Spotlight Candidates in OCS. They only shine when the spotlight (The Brass / Media) comes around. Very biased and a clear display of political ambition. There is a reason a kid from New York (Democratic district) would transfer to Florida's Panhandle (Republican district) to join the war effort. He could have stayed home and gone with the New York Guard but then that wouldn't be much of a story would it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"If you are one of the narrow minded, single vision hate Bush, hate Bush, hate Bush crowd you will probably not be bored to tears by this tome, and may even enjoy it's bile.

Save some cash and help the environment all at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"Chasing Ghosts was an informative account of a brave soldier fighting to protect his infantry division as well as the Iraqi people in the chaos of Baghdad. Rieckhoff paints a vivid picture of his struggles to survive and protect with the insufficient equipment, funds and troops provided by the US government. Chasing Ghosts is a psychological account of the frustrations of being a soldier during the war in Iraq and a veteran during the elections in Washington.A fantastic and informative read for those wanting a non-press related story of the Iraq war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Appreciation","review":"I don't like to read...I only read when it is required. \\"Chasing Ghosts\\" was the only novel that has ever made me actually want to read it from cover-to-cover.

I strongly suggest reading this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: See The Publisher's Weekly Review","review":"I saw the author on Hardball and was taken in. Seemed like a good guy. I bought the book; what a mistake. The writing is shoddy, the 'combat' he describes is more complaining than fighting, and he's so full of himself that his hint-dropping is tiresome. This isn't a memoir so much as a selfish rant. I'm an avid reader. I should have read the Publisher's Weekly review more closely. For someone who is impressive onscreen, it's clear now he just speaks in sound bites (or he can't write). The story has no pace and no intent except to say: Look at me. This is a churn-em-and-burn 'em platform. The characters aren't real people. They are props for the author. They ebb and flow around his big head. I was hoping for a much better read. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"More shallow negitivity","review":"Don't waste your time or money.

It truly opened my eyes to the \\"real\\" war that we are fighting in Iraq. We are so sheltered from the actual events, as the news media gives us such a small daily tidbit on the situation in Iraq. This book lets us know exactly what is going on, from an intelligent person who was actually there.This book should be a must-read for all Americans. We need to know what is going on!In addition, it opened my eyes to what I can do from home and what Paul is doing now to continue his fight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Only If You Really Want to Know about the War","review":"In a time when a lot of Americans seem to prefer to cover their eyes with waving flags and stuff their ears with patriotic platitudes, a reader must use caution in reading a book like this. Paul Reickhoff, after all, has been there. He was a platoon leader. He actually knows, and is willing to say, what it's like to be there. I have friends who were there, but most of them don't want to talk about it at all. But Reickhoff tells about the sand, the heat, the boredom, and the terror of being a soldier in Iraq. You'll learn more about this war in this book than you will watching your local news in a month.So if you actually care about the truth; if you really want to support our enlisted men and women; if you think you can love the country and still admit our leadership can be seriously wrong about a lot of things..read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exposing Iraq","review":"\\"Chasing Ghosts\\" is a hard hitting book which reveals the ugly truths about the invasion and fouled up occupation of Iraq from a soldier's point of view. What are those ugly truths? Civilians still living without basic necessities such as electricity, running water or food. Illogical decisions such as disbanding the Iraqi army and leaving a small numbers of American troops to guard large sections of Baghdad (which led to the growth of the current insurgency).

It's just a matter of practicing so you read the subtle ones. 9 out of 10 people won't be playing with professional poker players anyways so what's the point. And even the pro's try as hard as they can to hide their tells by wearing glasses so you can't see their eyes, etc etc. All you have to do is watch the person and see if their mannerisms change or if their eyes get shifty or if they get over confident or their voice changes.

The main problem is that it is a bit sparse with the sounds and some of the songs sound like they should have been worked on some more and Gore could have added some more layers of sounds. Gore has some of the best vocals in the business and on this album we can truly hear that he is not just the once in a while singer for Depeche Mode but an accomplished singer in his own right. The album cover is a bit cryptic but is probably to mean something which I have not grasped as of yet and to me it simply looks like avantgare art gone astray. Even though I have my reservations against this album, it still deserves 4 stars for the pure brilliance of Gore as a vocalist and for his ability to mold songs into his own creation and that is never easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 year old recording leaves much to be desired for DM fan.","review":"I am an absolute, undeniable Depech Mode fan and it was with great excitement that I bought Martin Gore's solo CD.

I was shocked upon opening the CD to learn that NONE of the songs were written by Martin Gore! NONE! The music is fine although very shallow compared to what you'd expect from one of Depeche Mode's founding members. Very basic instrumentation with seemingly no creativity, especially when you consider this work was done between Depeche Mode's \\"Music for the Masses\\" and \\"Violator.\\" If you're a DM collector you'll probably want this odd piece but I can't recommend owning a copy for the music (even with my love for Depeche Mode)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything depeche rules.","review":"This Martin Gore solo abum rules.

And multi-star ratings don't begin to reflect the profund universal gift this body of music clearly reflects and represents.I'm eagerly awaiting Volume 2!Eric, as is the case with fine artists, went far beyond the pale to return with the message of creative elixirs that benefit us all.

The trouble is that the lens mechanism is much too fragile. We had our camera for about six months with no issues. Then one day the lens got stuck in the protracted position when I turned the camera off, and there was nothing I could do to get the camera working again. It just displayed the message \\"lens error\\". Batteries were not the problem. I even tried it with an ac adapter. Luckily I still had the receipt, so I sent the camera to Kodak and got it back in a few weeks working again. Kodak claims there was nothing wrong with it (yeah, right). Unfortunately, we also bought one of these cameras for my in-laws (back when we were still enjoying ours), but we lost that receipt. So when their lens jammed (within 3 months), we had no choice but to get a new camera.

I ended up having to walk and kick the dress at the same time to prevent from tripping because the petticoat couldn't hold the shape of my dress. It's a little awkward but it works.

Also, the plastic internal parts seem to warp. Why? I don't know but as soon as they do warp, it's trash time, the mechanism quits cycling and it will just sit at the bottom of my pool and spin.

If the adapter feels warm when not in use, the adapter is burning significant amounts of electricity. Flipping the outlet switch is easier than unplugging the device and accomplishes the purpose. I installed one at my parents where there is a spotlight mounted on top of a bookcase. The lamp has an on-off switch but is too high to reach.

This show is very funny and one of the first shows that delt with a lot of teen issues and others, the first and second are when they are in Middle school, which is really cool, you kind of get to watch them grow, the 3erd season (when it comes out) should take place in High school. I have seen every single episode many times over and over, LOL, but I will continue to do so, because the show is that dam good.

While Season 3 has to be my true fave, Season 1 and 2 have plenty of gems: who can forget when Screech got struck by lightning (not me!)? Who doesn't crack up just thinking about Zack's subliminal message scheme (I know I do!)?If you're like me, you'll love this set (and by like me, I mean you say \\"Time out!\\" at least once a day; wear your very own custom-made Bayside High letter jacket (Go Tigers!); and plan on naming your children Kelly, Zack or Slater).

I read a LOT and can not believe that a book like this got published.The author writes about falling down the rabbit hole from Alice in Wonderland. I think you have to be chasing the white rabbit to understand the book. It is chaotic with no depth in any of the characters. The story is nonexistent. I can't believe that the author referred to Jesus as the Evil One, my, my, my. If you are even a little religious I think this book will offend you. It certainly did me.I wish I would have read the reviews before picking up this book. Please save your money or better yet get a book by a really good author like Kenyon, Feehan, Hamilton, Harris, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This novel is absolutely ridiculous. The characters are extremely hard to relate to -- who are these atrocious people, and why should I give a crap what happens to them? None of them have redeeming qualities.As for the writing itself, the author's style is bizarre. A kinder way to put it would be 'unique,' I guess. It doesn't seem to be edited very well, either, especially pertaining to punctuation.The story isn't very compelling, and it meanders without purpose for quite awhile. I haven't been so thoroughly disgusted with a novel in a long, long time. And I would have put it down, but once I begin a book I read it to the (in this case bitter) end."},{"rating":"1","title":"the description misrepresents the book","review":"The initial description of the book is enticing, but a little misleading. The description seems comedic, and light hearted. This book is neither, the main characters kill people without provocation and there is nothing in this story that would make you care for these characters. Also, the book did not read in a coherent fashion. It felt as though something was missing, like descriptions or backgrounds of characters and events that would help the reader \\"get the full picture.\\" Another reviewer stated that this was not the typical \\"Buffy\\" or \\"Anita Blake\\" version of vampires, and that is true. But you do wish for the presence of these two characters so they can stake the vampires in this book and put them out of their misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIDNIGHT WORK","review":"The description of the book sounded great, but the actual story was kind of sucky. Like a previous reviewer stated, it jumped around alot and I had a hard time following the story.I hated that Sophie and Norah killed whoever whenever. And Olivier just accepted this. He changed Sophie when she died and was supposed to be her teacher, but he let her run off as soon as she woke up. She killed an innocent man on her way home and then proceeded to change her friend. And how was her friend changed, you ask? Well the heroine basically went up to her and asked: \\"Do you want to be a vampire?\\" Norah's answer: \\"Sure.\\" You have GOT to be kidding me.The whole thing seemed rushed, like the author had to get from point a to b in a certain number of pages and forget everything else. I don't normally write a review, but this book aggravated me enough that I HAD to.Back cover description is definitely misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the plot???","review":"I cannot even finish this book. It is soooo boring. All I have read in the first 129 pages is mostly crap that seems to be repeating itself about the past. The excerpt on the back of this book sounded sooo promising. If the story line would move along and we could get less detailed paragraphs of who's friends with who and the why's of every little thing it probably wouldn't be too bad. I keep skipping paragraphs and sentences because they are boring and make no sense. For goodness sakes just tell a story and watch the typos!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the editor thinking??????","review":"When he/she bought this book????? The characters were flat,the prose boring, the dialogue banal, and the copy editing unprofessional. This is supposed to be one of TOR's new romance line of paranormals? How so? The hero and herione were little more than sociopaths looking to use each other for sex and mayhem. If i could have given it zero stars,I would have. I couldn't finish it. It had no redeeming value, except maybe to be used as paper to start a fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a romance","review":"Despite the hype this is book is not a vampire romance its more of the author's version of the vampire universe. It's unsettling how gory it is and it's amazing how quickly(very quickly)after the heroine is bitten how everyone becomes just meat to her.(Maybe I've been reading too many better versions of vampire stories-Anita Blake anyone?) Plus, she introduced so many characters who had different agendas I felt a little lost. I couldn't get past the first couple of chapters. This is the few times in my life I'm returning a book to get my money back. If you must read this don't go to a used bookstore, go to a garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Midnight Work","review":"I am an avid reader who enjoys a good vampire romance. This wasn't it! The book is disjointed and needed editing. Ms. Sims will need to hone her skills if she want's to have a returning audience. She also needs to find a publishing house whose editors take their jobs seriously. It was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel sorry for the writer!","review":"I honestly feel sorry for the writer! It is so hard to get published and I know she probably had her whole heart in this project...However..I am an avid reader and it took me 3 weeks to read this book! The story jumps so bad that the reader can't get a grasp on where the writer is leading him/her. The end left me so lost that I thought maybe I lost pages out of the book somehow. I was extrememly disappointed and I am within the age group that some posters have put on here that are supposed to be able to \\"get\\" the book. Oh and the lack of editing was so annoying I put it down several times just because of it. That said..I hope the writer is given a second chance with another book to redeam herself. I think she has some talent but with her next book i think she should be more focused and include some answers in the final pages! Oh and stay away from the tweens and bloodlust..that was just sick! Those who read it know what I'm talking about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Annoying","review":"This was one of the most annoying books that I've ever had the misfortune to repeatedly attempt to get through. I found the characters frustrating as well as one-dimensional. What I found most frustrating about the plot is that most of the problems that the characters faced were handled with so much ridiculous banter about nothing that I wanted to scream \\"get to the point already.\\" They seemed to talk around everything without getting to the meat of anything that mattered which created a bunch of mishaps that could have been avoided if they talked and listened to each other. It just seemed silly to me. What's to like about any of these people."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Horror Than Hugs","review":"This book definitely should not be in the romance section. It would be more appropriate in the horror or maybe fantasy section. The characters are totally unsympathetic and although I tried to find some redeeming qualities in the main characters there really weren't any. If they weren't sociopaths themselves they helped to enable the other sociopaths. I picked up this book because the premise looked exciting and fun. It was anything but. The random killings and the blood and guts were more prominent than the romance. In fact if she remove about 10 pages any semblence of romance would be gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is so poorly written!","review":"I really hate to say that, I know how hard it must be to write and publish a book. But this was so hard to read, I had to make my self finish it just to see if it got better. The story jumps all over the place, I would have to go back and read over something because I thought I had missed something.The people are just so uninteresting, they don't have the spark to catch your attenction.They story line was all most like 3 or 4 outlines that she try to make into one book.Well they say pratice makes perfect. Mabe her next book will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not real good","review":"There are so many typos that it has to be embarrassing for the author. It started off okay and I thought it would be a good book - but I was wrong. There is no chemistry amoung the characters, I found Norah and Suki to be annoying and a bit TOO MUCH. Sophie and Oliver had no real conversations, and the human's as food could have been written better, maybe by not killing everyone and instead just \\"snacking\\" on them. Don't waste your money with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The summary on the back is the best part!","review":"I was drawn to this book primarily by the description on the back and the artwork on the cover. These are the best aspects of the entire book. The plot is sketchy and not really fleshed out. The characters go into mental tangents that are wordy and boring. They all think deep thoughts, but the reader isn't given enough background information to be able to follow the mental flashbacks! I have been struggling to finish this book in the vague hope that it will get better, but it doesn't! I'm not emotionally invested in any of the characters. Honestly, I am so turned off by this book, I probably won't buy anything else by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a romance","review":"If you like a book about amoral sociopaths, then this is the book for you. Otherwise don't bother. The heroine early on becomes a vampire who is attracted to eating (and killing) preteen girls. If that isn't disgusting enough for you the book climaxes with a ceremony involving the torture and killing of 11 people. The heroine is somehwat angsty about the whole thing, but not enough to stop doing it. While appropriate for a horror novel, this is not what I am looking for in a romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time reading this book!","review":"I had bought this about 3 years ago for my bestfriends birthday and when she had read it I couldn't belive my ears so I wanted to see how bad it really was.

She's at first disconcerted, then decides it's cool and essentially goes on a homicidal spree, turning one of her best friends for company, and descending into utter debauchery in hopes of becoming like the vampires on Los Vampiros or in a Hollywood slash and bite movie. The plot, such as it is, wanders all over the place, venturing into the Fey lands, reincarnation, and a bit Christian heresy thrown in for \\"good\\" measure. At one point, Sophie does become devoted to stopping an evil fey being, but I'm not sure if she wanted to end its evil ways or just didn't want anyone else to have homicidal fun. None of the characters appeared to have anything resembling morals. In short, don't waste time or money on this.Amanda Killgore"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"I promised myself I would not write a review unless it was positive, but I hated this book so much that I feel an obligation to save anyone even thinking about purchasing it. First, I agree with all the negatives. This is not a vampire romance it is a violent disgusting portrait of vampire life. If that is what you like to read by all means be my guest. I could hardly continue reading the book once Sophie killed the cab driver, tore Olivier's throat out and then made her friend a vampire just so she could have company. GROSS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a romance and not a good book.","review":"This book is inexplicably listed in the paranormal romance genre...WTF? The hero and the supposed heroine don't even have scenes together half the time. They have quickie sex in the hallway of a club for like 30 seconds early on (very early) and from then on there is virtually no contact, no conversation, no romance, no nothing except murder and mayheim. The Hero turned the heroine into a vampire...then she turned her friend and they go on a blood-letting crime spree for the rest of the book. I will admit the book was amusing at certain points but I can't say that I liked it overall. The characters were unlikeable and crazy. The plot was non-existent...people just wandered around and ate people, knocked over jewelry stores, etc. Save yourself and avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"some cohesion, please","review":"I have never bothered to write a book review, but I had to warn the unsuspecting masses.

It would be better titled \\"Ancient Civilizations of the Bible\\". It has the occassional reference to the Israelites or Jewish figures, but few specifics to archaeology that directly relates to the Bible. In that regard, it is interesting, but not what I was looking for.I guess my biggest complaint is the author's insistance that archaeology cannot be used to \\"prove\\" the Bible. While I understand the point, it would have been nice to have been at least presented with some archaeological evidence to substantiate historical things in the Bible. There are plenty of books about ancient civilizations but few that pull together all of the numerous Biblical archaeological finds which academia so often glosses over or minimizes. The authors in this book seem to be more concerned with their standing in the academic community than illuminating the rest of us.

The artists featured are all very famous, so it looked like this was a sure fire hit. unfortunately, what we have here is the original theme songs with a bunch of high as a kite rappers just totally randomizing and saying nothing at all. The rock's theme was especially disappointing, as the entire song consists of \\"if you smell what the rock is cookin\\" repeated over and over, as though we would find this beat to be fun to listen to. The only song, in my opinion, that is remotely good is the d generation x theme, mainly because it sticks so closely to the original theme. Overall this album is not worth the money: if you want wwf get the music volume 4. Get this only if you want to hear the result of one day in the studio and a lot of weed."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS CD NOW!","review":"If you think I am a crazed fan of the WWF well you're right.

The DX theme song \\"The Kings\\" is definitely my favorite of the bunch. My other favorite tracks include Y2J, Stone Cold, & the Outlaws' theme. Some of the lyrics may not be appropriate for your kids; although there's nothing here that you haven't already heard on WWF television. Aside from that, the artists and the WWF have done a great job! Altogether, would I recommend this album for WWF fans?

Tracks like Run-DMC's \\"King Of Rock\\" and Ice-T's \\"Pimpin' Ain't Easy\\" made for effective but dated theme songs but most of this album just wastes decent themes and makes underrated rappers like Bad Azz and Ras Kass seem bored and uninspired.

At first listen I was not sure what to expect since I have all of their earlier albums on CD. I was used to a heavier Rock version of Bloodgood. This album did not disappoint me though. In fact I was pleasantly surprised by the melodic rock on this album. It is more commercial sounding than their other recordings but still ROCKS Hard on it's songs which have keyboards. But even with the added keyboards to their metal sound Bloodgood did not lose it's overall rockin' identity. This is not my favorite Bloodgood release but it is definitely not a bad one either. I recommend this CD to long-time Bloodgood fans who have never heard their more commercial side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated Classic","review":"Fans of Bloodgood are very divided. After all but abandoning their thrash roots most fans gave up on the band which is unfortunate but I can understand why so many people don't like this record. It's a bit polished and more radio friendly than most Bloodgood records but it's still a very good album that moves the band in a more commercial direction. Sadly this was the kiss of death for these guys but if you approach this with an open mind you'll see that it's still a very good album that reminds me more of Petra than Bloodgood which is something I never thought I'd say when talking about a Bloodgood record."},{"rating":"2","title":"roman a clef","review":"This roman a clef by Gayatri Spivak's first husband is a fun read.

Deep and low while not too loud. For the first couple hundred miles sounded like a fart can but once it got broke in it developed into a nice tone. No drone at all. The reasons it got 4 instead of 5 stars is that it was not a bolt on install. Yes I did install it myself at first, but HAD to have it welded together because of leaks and fitment issues. The tip is impossible to keep aligned without being welded. The rear hanger will squeak unless the entire exhaust system is welded to keep it from sliding back. The Y pipes were not bent correctly and had to be forced/bent into position.

This album grows upon White Blood Cells and goes off in a couple of new directions, but at it's heart it's still an excellent, bluesy rock album.

It also contains some of Jack's best Robert Plant-sounding vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Being the local rock n' roll kid that I am, I bought \\"White Blood Cells\\" and immediately fell in love with it. I learned every song on the guitar, I listened to it to relax, and my whole family fell in love with it. \\"Elephant\\" brings whole new feelings. A whole new sound that the reverant and wonderful Jack White stirred out of his mind. It's very simple rock n' roll, but like the last album, it's very inspiring and artistic. Listening to songs like \\"I Want to Be the Boy to Warm Your Mother's Heart\\" and \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\" make you think that Jack's singing a whole new language. Songs like \\"Hypnotize\\" bring back the same feel that \\"Fell In Love With a Girl\\" brought. I HIGHLY recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The White Stripes have released yet another masterpiece.","review":"The White Stripes are now alot more expiramental and not as bluesy as their previous albums but, this album is still packed with catchy, and gritty songs.Surprisingly there is also some bass on this album which Jack White rarely does. To be fair about this album I wouldn't say that this is a 5 star album. I'd be more inclined to give it 4.5 but, since that wasn't an option I didn't want to sell them short.Anyway's it is definetly worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The White Stripes \\"Elephant\\" = Great Music from Jack & Meg White + a guest vocalist Holly Golighty!!!!!!!","review":"There have alread been plenty of reviews on this one, so I'll just mention a few things.

I highly recommend this CD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look at the rating","review":"Yes there are only two of them. Yes there is no bassist. Anyone who doesn't agree that with the white stripes this is a good choice get out and stop reading. This is a masterpiece, plain and simple. Better than White Blood Cells ( Gasp!), this is the first time the stripes felt and sounded like a full band and that's just by adding fake bass lines and electric piano. Do not miss this. They destroyed the burt bacharach song \\" I just don't know what to do with myself\\" built it up from scratch without using computers and out came out the best song on the album. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"this album is trash, they rip off other bands such as The Cure, John Lennon. this guy Jack (if that is his real name) sounds like a bad version (...).

And in most circumstances that ends up with half a$$ed albums that are just out for making an extra buck. But that is never been so with the White Stripes. They are continually able to put out quality rock and roll. They picked a great single to get out on the radio with \\"7 nation army\\", the song has a great riff that just sticks inside your brain for hours at a time. Other quality tracks include \\"Girl, You have no faith in medicine\\" and \\"Black math\\". If you are a fan of these pair of musicians then head out and hop on the Elephant."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is awesome.","review":"Almost every song on this disc is radio-worthy. Seven Nation Army is the strong radio song out of the gate, but I don't even think it's the best one here. There's no home for you here is my favorite so far. In the cold, cold night is the only track that I can do without. It's not that it's bad, but it just doesn't seem to live up to the rest of the disc.Based on this CD I bought White Blood Cells, but that disc just can't rock as well as this one.If you like what you've heard on the radio, you won't be disappointed after buying Elephant and hearing the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very good..","review":"I think this a great album everyone should own, But I think White blood cells is much better. Buy one of them. The White stripes are a wonderful duo. Everyone should own one of there albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptional","review":"This is the White Stripes best album to date. The production is minimalistic, the lyrics are excellent, and the melodies are powerful. Jacks guitar, Megs simple drumming, and Jacks heartfelt vocals combine to create some of the best music we have today. Favorites include \\"The Air Near My Fingers\\", \\"Seven Nation Army\\", \\"Hypnotize\\", \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\" (on which Jack sounds as though he's about to weep), \\"There's No Home For You Here\\", \\"The Hardest Button to Button\\", and \\"You've Got Her In Your Pocket\\", though they're all wonderful. So buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elephant?","review":"Now, i just bought this cd, and while the music and stuff is OK, the vocals and feel of the music stinks.

A social experiment gone awry. The army of young fans standing tall behind Elephant is very impressive considering this album stinks. The White Stripes are fun to look at, they are very stylish and cute, but the music is boring and tired. It sounds as if Jack White lets everything he writes go straight to CD. No care, no concern, just fill a CD and put on the red pants.The first song, \\"Seven Nation Army\\", fires up the White Stripes gimmick with a lot of energy that goes nowhere. The rest of the album is where the first song leads...nowhere. It's all filler.My best guess on Elephant's popularity is it's a peer pressure thing. But remember this, boys and girls, the same club that requires you to like this album will someday require you to think it sucks. Confusing? Maybe, but it's a lesson that can be learned from a book that is required reading in elementary school, \\"The Emperor's New Clothes.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgrace to Real Musicians","review":"My goodness, if this could be considered music, then the whole world of music might as well come crashing down. Besides some melody hooks (that get old fast), the guitar riffs are repetitive and bland. Meg's drums are amateur and so incredibly simple that anyone playing for the first time could take her place. Sorry, but for any artistic potential, technical ability must be there and the White Stripes simply don't have it. Every song is the same, not one of them is redeemable. It's a shame that marketing has made this \\"band\\" so recognized while good bands like the Hellacopters are shoved to the background. This is proof that hype can be created even when good music is not. Please, for the sake of real musicians out there, don't buy into this hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blandness!","review":"This cd is just a bunch of talentless noise disguised as brilliance. After a few listens, and after a few comparisons to other rock records, you will probably see that Elephant is nothing more than another major label scam.If you want something good, check out Interpol's \\"Turn On The Bright Lights\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty package, but where's the real music?","review":"Ok, Jack and Meg White are horrid musicians. Jack's voice is grating at best and Meg has issues with keeping a beat. But, if you like the whole matching ensembles thing, then I guess you could buy this CD. If this is the new direction of rock, this horrible, no bass crap, then I'm going to go listen to some Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart, because there's a reason their music is called classical and The White Stripes have made me fearful of all things \\"rock\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my","review":"Beyond the cadaver-esque \\"look\\" and the hype, what is the appeal of this?

My God this cd sounds like my nephews frikin garage band on a bad day. Is that the point here?, is it supposed to sound like a first take in a low budget studio? Maybe I'm just a tainted musician, but I can't figure this bands popularity out. The tunes are ok at best and even that's pushing it. These people can hardly play their instruments and the singings God Awful most of the time.

Most if these songs sound like outtakes. \\"I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself,\\" looms over the entire collection and it's a cover. It shows that with good material the duo can be entertaining. But the bulk of these songs seem like fragments either musically, lyrically or both. \\"The Hardest Button to Button\\" and \\"At least it's True We Love One Another\\" are the most wayward of the collection. It seems two weeks (the time in which this CD was recorded) wasn't long enough for the gestation of this elephant. Jack and Meg rather have given us a mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"White\\" stuff.","review":"I can't believe I waited so long to get this album, it's at least as good as \\"White Blood Cells\\". I imagine anyone who remotely liked that would this as well. As fresh and original as it sounds, it also feels like it could have been done in 1970, whether it's similar to \\"The Stooges\\", or \\"The Mama's And Papa's\\". The only hits here are \\"Seven Nation Army\\" and \\"The Hardest Button To Button\\", both easy to like. However I like others just as much. \\"Ball And Biscuit\\" and \\"Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine\\" are great, and \\"The Air Near My Fingers\\" is sweet too. Meg sings on \\"In The Cold, Cold Night\\" and the cool last track, and sounds just as cute as she looks.

Elephant is a great cd. buy it. i recomend \\"girl, you have no faith in medicine\\" \\"seven nation army\\" \\"black math\\" \\"i just dont know what to do with myself\\" and \\"i want to be the boy...\\" the entire cd is worth buying. now the only thing left to do is figure out if jack and meg and brother and sister or ex-husband and wife................"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars is a crashing understatement","review":"Simply an unbelievably good, timeless rock CD.

After listening to it I felt like most of the songs, and especially the lyircs on songs like Little Acorns, were forced. The cover of the Burt Bacharach song, I Just Don't Know What To Do Myself, sounds akward and is not easy to listen to. I really did like Ball and Biscuit, especially the guitar solos, though and if it weren't for that song I think this would only get 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par","review":"Basically a rip off of the old classic sound. The single \\"Seven Nation Army\\" is barely tolerable, and way to repetitive. The CD is filled with tracks that just take up space, this is by far their worst CD to date. The fact that Rolling Stone called this CD a classic, goes right with their opinion that 8 Mile was also one of the best films of the year. Who the heck do they have writing for that magazine. If you like White Stripes, you will be heavily dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"They could do better....","review":"You can tell from a couple of songs that they have talent and are good songwriters, but I think they have much more capability. It can get dull. They could play better on their instruments, and you cannot have that good of a band with just a guitar and a drumset. You don't have to get new members but at least create some kind of diversity with changing styles and maybe adding instruments once in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"redefining easy-listening....","review":"I didn't even have to listen to this entire album 2 or three times for me to appreciate it - it just got down to business in the first listening.If you liked \\"White Blood Cells\\" but were yearning for a bit more leaning on the guitar, then you won't be disappointed. Hard charging guitar (see Jimmy Page) and strong drums on such rockers as 'Ball and Bicuit', 'The Hardest Button to Button' and 'Girl You have No Faith in Medicine' are mixed superbly with Meg's contrasting solo's and simple melodies in 'In the Cold Cold Night'.Of course, right out of the gate 'Seven Nation Army' sets the pace for the entire album.Well Done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack's on a roll","review":"'Elephant' is the second exellent White Stripes album in a row. While it's not quite the equal of 'White Blood Cells,' it does provide another collection of great songs. The stance and sound on this album is slightly different than on the last, but not so much that you wouldn't recognize it. There are no standout, amazing songs such as Fell in Love With a Girl or Hotel Yorba, but the more cohesive sound of 'Elephant' makes up for that. There are no weak songs here, and Ball and a Biscuit is as dirty as white blues gets. This could be the record of the year in 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound","review":"I'm really surprised by how many people have posted poor reviews for a good band. I can understand if it's not your taste but there is no way this album is boring. I'm also tired of people saying they've ripped off other bands, EVERY BAND HAS RIPPED OFF ANOTHER BAND. Of course they're going to use forms and styles they like of other bands. Anyway, this is one of my favorite bands with a great sound. My favorite songs are \\"Black Math\\", \\"I Just Don't What To Do With Myself\\", and \\"Ball and Biscuit\\". I usually skip \\"In The Cold, Cold Night\\" (no offense to Meg) & \\"Well It's True That We Love Another\\" Good album along with De Stijl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap Trick meets Bob Dylan","review":"This is the first White Stripes recording I've owned, and I like the mix of quirky lyrics, bluesy guitar and garage sound.

Chances are 80% of the people who bought \\"Elephant\\" weren't even alive when the technology this album was made with was made (I know I wasn't): hell, even the Beatles weren't huge then. Raw, unedited, completely real sounds that come from Jack's increasingly hot guitar (and piano), Meg's tremendous drumming, and both of their larynxes. Jack outdoes himself on the ballads here: touching and exquisitely crafted. The rockers? They burn like a cauldron. If you dismiss this album because there's no \\"Fell in Love With a Girl\\", you're an idiot. Buy it for the great music, not the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZzzz","review":"this album puts me to sleep. all right you got a formula great how about some songwriting, although I do like that button song.bottom line if the white stripes really are the de rigeur of modern rock how come all them songs sound the same, and how come that dude wants to be a bad-ass dandy?what is a bad-ass dandy? who took all my stolen candy.(15 second guitar solo)man these things just write themselves"},{"rating":"1","title":"why won't anyone say it?","review":"This album sucks.This band is overhyped.So what if they did the entire album on old equipment.Did they push the recording beyond any album that had been done in the 60's or 70's?C'mon \\"Electric Ladyland\\"IT IS A GIMMICK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"genius?","review":"please, i could squeeze out 12 songs that were written twenty or thirty years ago in two days. am i a genius, too? the only reason this got two stars is because it wasn't quite as boring and uncreative as their others. quite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm... I don't get it","review":"I just don't get it. Yeah, the album is raw and it's ok... but all of the attention that the White Stripes are getting, for me, is a bit undeserved. I think that I bought this album expecting a timeless album from all of the hype. Now I listen to it after about 4 listenings ... and to be honest... it's just a bit tired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, listen to it, put it away for a while, listen again","review":"I fell in love with \\"White Blood Cells\\" in a way that I didn't fall in love with this album. It's a good album but it's not a GREAT album. I suggest that you go out and buy it, listen to it and then put it away for a while and then listen to it again. This is an album that you don't want to get tired of. If you listen to this album over and over again you will learn to hate this band. I personally really love this band but this album is just another white stripes record. Nothing really special. Seven Nation Army was a bit of change but not too much. The sound is cleaned up a little but that's only because they have more money to spend on production. I think that the white stripes have a masterpiece waiting inside of them but this is not it. I like this record but I don't love it. But I do love the white stripes. Does any of this make sense?"},{"rating":"2","title":"good rockin' cd","review":"I like this band. Jack White's voice reminds me of Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant. A couple of songs sound sort of like just a bunch of noise, but the majority of it is excellent. The straight up rock'n'roll reminds me a lot of the old AC/DC stuff. And Jack White knows how to play blues, I LOVE \\"ball and biscuit\\". Now I want the album with their version of Son House's \\"Death Letter\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"jolly good","review":"Gone are the days when the White Stripes played humble blues-rock. Elephant showcases a newfound swagger in the vocals and guitar riffs of Jack White. The blues influences are still evident, but this album sounds much more like a Led Zepplin album than a Johny Cash or Cole Porter album. The stripes fourth album is another simple masterpiece held together by kickin' guitar riffs [reduced] down, vicious drumming. It's a [great]record that any rock, blues or punk fan should buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Sucked In","review":"So, I've bought into the hype again. Except this time, that's a good thing. I bought into it with The Hives(good), and the Strokes(overrated but good) so I figured why not with the White Stripes?I'm from Memphis. I was raised on blues, rock and roll, and a little country(some hiphop and rap if you want to get right down to it). This is an excellent album. I heard Seven Nation Army on wazee.org, that's what really convinced me to buy it.If you've got an open mind about music, buy the album. I doubt you'll regret it(if you do maybe you have poor taste?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE HELL OF AN ALBUM!","review":"When I first listened to this album, I was blown away by its sound. It reminded me of so many classic rock bands that I have enjoyed in the past. Ranging from the Beatles to Led Zeppelin, it made you think of the woodstock generation. However, after listening to this album more and more, I realized that Jack White still had his very own signature sound that can not be compared with other bands such as the Hives, Strokes,Vines,etc. He manages to write catchy songs that are sure to be radio hits and still has an amzing live sound as well. Songs such as Seven Nation Army, Black Math and Hypnotise flat out kick ass, while songs such as, Ball and Biscuit and In the Cold, Cold Night are blusey. Overall, this album should be praised by fans who enjoy originality and the classic rock of the past. A good addtion to your music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock & Roll Will Never Be Tchaikovsky","review":"The White Stripes play rock music. They play it well and it doesn't have to be intellectualized to death. I play classical music for living, but for recreation I like indie rock a la Raveonettes, Built to Spill, and songwriters like Buffy Sainte-Marie (thus the title quote). Once I picked up Elephant I could not get enough of this band, and within a week I had all 4 CDs. With an album of any genre I really appreciate variety and The White Stripes pull it off here with style and humor. They must be doing something right for Conan O'Brien to have them as musical guests for 5 nights in a row. This and their other CDs get plenty of repeat play in my household."},{"rating":"2","title":"white stripes review","review":"well what atracted me to the white stripes is meg white and her beauty..upper torso and lower...she rocks my world and jack is lucky!...but i finaly got into their music when that dead leaves song came out but it didnt make me want to buy the album.but when 7 nation army came out and seeing the kick a$$ video made me want to go down to borders and spend all my money.i am pleased with the album and i listen to it often and i give it 4 stars..i think its good to add other instruments to the music cause that guitar and drum beat gets boring..i think this is some what like the white album magnatude...i do recommend it to people but listen to it before buying it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing Back Rock","review":"\\"Elephant\\" the latest album from the Detroit duo The White Stripes is a great album and should not be missed.

I'm over The Strokes and I murder anyone who puts The Hives in that same category. I bought this record a little while ago and I've never really gotten into it. I've tried and tried but i just can't. I don't personnaly recommend it to anyone, pick up De Stijl or White Blood Cells, they're definetly worthier of your money. All in all, one word can sum it all up: Disapointing.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of 2003","review":"The White Stripes have created the best album of the year with \\"Elephant\\". No other band out there today can compare with the originality, sound and simple yet perfect songwriting of Jack White. He shows time and time again on this album that he can write the perfect combination of blues, rock, country and folk, often in the same tune. Filled with endless hooks, nearly every song on this album could be a hit single. This is a disc for people who love music, and forget what good old rock and roll really sounds like. The White Stripes have now officially emerged from the pack of \\"The\\" bands (Strokes, Hives, Sounds, Raveonettes...) as the leaders, and a force to be reckoned with in the music business. Truly a masterpiece, five stars all the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad memory that you won't forget for a long time","review":"Yank four-piece the White Stripes - consisting of Jack White, Meg White, and their respective egos - used to be good when nobody paid them any attention. The album before this, whatever it was called, was a masterpiece of raw, untainted rock 'n' roll. Then they got all artsy and old-school and started trying to make statements about the state of the music industry today (which is to say, dire) by using 1920s (or whenever) equipment. All very well and good, but ultimately pointless when your head swells over your eyeballs and you can't see the pencil in order to write a decent song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Nothing can compares the sound of vinyls and more impressive is how warm the guitar sounds!!!

Enjoying every moment of it since it came. Super music and speedy delivery. Thanks so much, again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Early 1960s blues-based rock without the innocence","review":"Hard, dark takes on early 1960s music, with direct references to Stones, Pete Townsend, Burt Bacharach (!). This blues-based music is uncomplicated and uncompromising. Instrumentation changes from track to track. Noir music is created by recycling retro music through filters that remove 1960s innocence, thickening and toughening the music, stripping passion to leave a matter-of-fact hard, rough metallic surface. Stand outs: tr 6--I want to be the boy to warm his mother's heart. Quiet, earnest country blues that Pete Townshend could have written. Great slide guitar bridge. Tr 13--Girl, you have no faith in medicine. This head banging garage-rock, punk rave up contrasts a dirt-simple musical setting with a meth-spun vocal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second & Third Listen","review":"I had the chance to run Elephant through another couple times this weekend. I gave it only 2 stars earlier. I stand by that rating when setting Elephant in the context of our musical universe. BUT - that may be unfair. White Stripes has a garage band sound. They do it quite well. The CD is growing on me.I give Elephant 4 stars on the garage band scale. Worth a spin if that's your style. What's my style? Not garage, but Elephant may expand my tastes a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless rock","review":"I haven't been that big a fan of the Stripes before this CD--in fact I bought it for my wife, who is a big fan--but this album forced me to sign on. Jack White is GOD--plays like Jimmy Page AND signs like Robert Plant (sort of ) AT THE SAME TIME! The songs here are terrific, quite varied yet cohering together as an album. The classic rock moves are there, but with a post punk intimacy present that begs the question--is this a classic Modern Rock album, or a modern Classic Rock album? Fact is it's both, and as far as I know the White Stripes are the only band plumbing this kind of terrain with this much artistic depth. Classic or modern, this album is TIMELESS! And thank God (i.e. Jack White) for the return of grungy slide guitar! NASSTAYY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you insane?","review":"This is a brilliant CD. Hands down. Now, I certainly do welcome other opinions -- well, except for the guy that rated it 1 star and said go pick up a Kylie Minogue record instead -- but it seems to me that many of these 1,2,3 star reviews are coming from people who want another White Blood Cells retread.Well, no one's getting that. The White Stripes wouldn't be the White Stripes if indeed they did put out a carbon copy. For those that want that, go listen to some more Backstreet Boys if you want predictability.This IS a harder edged album, this IS a less poppy, hooky album. That doesn't mean it's necessarily bad. It's just a different record.It's amazing to me how people complain how [bad] and boring music is these days but then insist that each album sound like the last.

First listen didn't blow me away. Second listen and I started to pick up a bit of a Beatles vibe. By the fourth listen (all in the same day - headphones at work) I realized that his album features some diverse lyrics and musicianship. It didn't sound like anything already out there - the cookie cutter does not apply to Jack White - and the album provided changes in speed, sound that make it a great album. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars (as petty as it sounds), is that although the last song is tongue in cheek, they should have omitted it. Which means I had to skip a song...so it can't be perfect, but a tremendous album nontheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE RACKET","review":"I could not even make it through this entire CD (I was not listening to it by choice)...this guy absolutely cannot sing, his voice gets on my last nerve.

All of the great albums you can listen to over and over again and discover new things because there are subtle layers and textures there. Here there is none. You can't get very complicated with a guitar and simple four piece drum set. The simple poppy hooks might be fine for someone with no real musical taste but when you listen to as many new releases as I do it get's very old, very quick. I wouldn't be surprised if this record will be mocked some day in the future as the downfall of the pop culture of the 90's to bring in a new genre for the 00's.All in all \\"The White Stripes\\" are terribly overrated and in my opinion do not live up to the hype, they collapse and burn under the pressure."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd is boring, so buy feeder or muse instead","review":"I bought this Cd after seven nation army came out, but I was really disappointed with the rest of the album. The only other good song on it was black math and even that wasnt brilliant. I think the way there is only a couple of instruments is different but it means that the songs sound similar and makes them sound like they aren't going newhere because there is nothing to build up to. It doesnt feel like there is ne energy going into the music and the lyrics are not v.meaningful. the whole album just lacks depth with the lyrics and the instruments."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRAINED CHIMP ON DRUMS?","review":"YES, I HAVE LISTENED TO THIS SHOO-SHOO AND HAVE ALSO SEEN THEM ON TV, ECT.

Take away the high dollar hype and let the youth of today see and hear this band as they really are and let them decide without being brainwashed. I think the reviews I read before purchasing this cd were written by the White Stripes\` record company. One thing I will say, in there favor, is they do a good job at trying to masquerade as the Flat Duo Jets. I liked the first White Stripes Cd and if there are people out there looking for the roots of the White Stripes, then they should pick up a Flat Duo Jets CD or better yet, the latest by Dexter Romweber (he was the singer guitar player of the Jets) I heard his new Duo is playing shows with the White Stripes.

Wow, another tomato gone rotten. At least Cobain doesent have to see fantastic and talented people be chained to big companies backyards.

But now they've tried to catch up but only scratched the heel of todays music- which ... beyond all comprehension anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"To me, the White Stripes stand out as a wonderfully different alternative to what is currently played on the radio.

They do it well, simply, too. I am a little disappointed that the CD is only 50 minutes, because it seems to go by fast, and it might be worthy of the hype if it had a better running-time. The lyrics don't mean anything and the there's a fairly irritating English/Retro vibe to it which can grate on you, but that's the cost of making this genre of music, I guess.

The production, as you'd expect, is a pretty slapdash amd Megs drumming gets wayward here and there but (I'm led to believe) this is part of the charm.It's not much of a step forwards (four albums in and not a lot of change) but if you like it (which I do) then it's good stuff. 'Seven Nation Army' and 'The Hardest Button to Button' are a couple of the best tracks they've done ever, nevermind highlights of the album.If you liked 'White Blood Cells' get this because it's better.

He gets in fistfights in bars. He thanks Swank magazine (on White Blood Cells).

This is quite possibly the WORST band I have ever heard in life. Jack White can't sing...well I wouldn't even classify it as singing. I'd compare his voice to a rusty bike tire....it's just annoying, plain and simple. And Meg White playing drums, I could make better sounds using bowls in my kitchen. The White Stripes are a disgrace to rock music everywhere. Everytime I see one of their videos played on MTV the same question pops into my head every single time 'Why God? Why?'

So, I desperately wanted to like \\"Elephant.\\" However, I was soon very dissapointed in this effort. The songs are almost painful to listen to. They sound as if elementary school kids got together in a garage and just started playing. I just don't get the \\"hype\\" surrounding this release. It is so overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I must be the only person who doesnt get the popularity of this band. Meg White cannot drum at all. Jack White sounds as though he has acute larengitis. All the songs sound the same, and that is not a good thing. Even my band has more talent than this. I wish the press would pick a better band for the public to idolize than the White Stripe. They are not the next Nirvana, nor or they the next Beatles. In fact, they are far from it. Only buy this album if you are tone deaf, or in a coma."},{"rating":"1","title":"shocking","review":"Like another reviewer said, upon first listen, I thought this album was pretty good. Upon second listen: okay. Third: poor.Let's face it, the songs on this album sound very amateur. Especially the folk songs. 'Ball and a Biscuit' gets much praise but I question how many times does the standard for blues songs have to be done, and redone. Meg's drumming is horrid. I will not even mention her singing. Its as bad as Eddie Van Halen's attempt at singing on VHIII. They should be ashamed for trying to sell a song with lyrics such as the one on \\"In the Cold Cold Night\\". Little Acorn is, perhaps, the worst Black Sabbath song ever. Its as if they said let's spend no time trying to actually write songs - all we need to do is \\"sound\\" good (and derivative). I don't mind derivative if the songs are good (ie Interpol) but this is just ridiculous. Come on people, you've got to want more from music than this!In other words, this album is tailor made for the MTV crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard it all before...","review":"The White Stripes are an admirable rock band, but painfully overrated. \\"Seven Nation Army\\" is a very good song, but the rest of the disc is the same repetative lo-fi noodling. This is far from groundbreaking. You can grab any garage rock album from as far back as 1968 and find the same thing.If the music scene wasn't so vapid and lacking of good bands, The White Stripes wouldn't get a second glance. Think about how much attention they would get during the early 90's grunge movement.A band needs to blend its influences into something new and unique, not rehash what others have done before it. AFI is a great example of a band that has melded influences of punk, goth and even metal into a new cohesive vision. I heavily recommend their new CD, \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" in place of \\"Elephant\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Average","review":"I don't quite get all the Hype this Band gets.while it's cool they play there Instruments&wahtnot I don't find much Creative with the way they are hyped to me.the Arrangements are alright at best but the vocals just put me to sleep overall.they have parts here&there that I like but overall I don't feel they are worth all the hype the get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Challenged","review":"In my opinion, this band is musically challenged. For a drummer, it is insulting to be represented by a band like this. When I first saw them on Late Night With Conan O'Brian, all I could think was \\"this is probably the last time I'll ever see this group\\". This was less then a year ago. Now I turn on the TV and they're winning awards left and right that they don't deserve. As a dj, percussionist, and music fan, I think that the white stripes should be boycotted, to the point of non-existence. Thank you for taking time to read my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it 1970 again? What is this junk?","review":"I just don't understand people's obsession with The White Stripes! They suck SO badly, Jack & Meg can not, I repeat, CAN NOT play instruments and are certainly not worthy of being \\"rock gods\\"! 'Elephant' is one of the worst, most overrated albums I've ever had the unfortunate luck of hearing. I'm a very open minded person, but my intentions of hearing good music were gone and thrown out the window when this heap of horse crap was put on at my friends house.'Seven Nation Army' is probably a song that'll come to hunt me down for the rest of my life, because of it's intentions to try and kill me with it's bad riffs and VERY poor drumming.Jack White isn't a good frontman either, he moans and groans through the songs like a little pre-teen who didn't get their own way!And as for Meg, drumming has never sounded lazier!Please avoid & get some Black Sabbath or Def Leppard instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"This is supposed to be innovative?

I don't think so.","review":"I am sorry everyone, but these two people are the two most untalented people to ever pick up musical insturments. I'v played percussion for a little over 10 years and even if I had only played one I would still be better than their \\"drummer\\". Jack White is a terrible singer and a terrible guitarist and it disgusts me that they have a record deal. Oh yeah and the cd is terrible to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible music supposedly called rock","review":"The success of this album has shocked me.After listening to the album you begin to wonder how it won so many awards,and sold so many copies.The track that made me buy the album \\"seven nation army\\" is the only good song on the cd.The rest is no where near and then you have to ask why these two call themselves a rock band.The music is horrible and no where near rock.Refrain from buying this cd.These guys got lucky and don't deserve the fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elephant from The White Stripes","review":"Every one that reads this review needs to read this because this is the best album of 2003. The White Stripes are one of the greatest rock band of all time except for AC/DC and don't get me started on AC/DC. In conclusion, buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll never let you go, Jack.","review":"Okay, that was cheesy. I'm not good at titles, though. This CD is great; it's probably one of my favorite CD's (as of this date). A month ago it was Seventeen Seconds by The Cure (which is superb, buy it as well). There's just something incredibly wonderful about Jack White's voice. It's so strange. But hey, it's good to be weird. If I had to destroy one song on here it would be \\"You've Got Her in your Pocket.\\" It just doesn't seem like it fits. A few of my favorite tracks on this are (at the moment): \\"There's No Home For You Here,\\" \\"In The Cold, Cold Night,\\" and \\"The Air Near My Fingers.\\" The White Stripes have this incredible, gritty, imperfect sound, and I love it. I love every minute of it (except for \\"You've got her in your Pocket\\"). It's so unique from anything I've heard lately. Basically, if you like boring stuff, don't get this, stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whites Stripes really, really rule!!","review":"I think that the White Stripes are a awsome band. They have re-vived rock music and they have a cool blues vibe about them. I listen to them alot an enjoy thier music. The White Stripes are NOT selling out by making 'radio-friendly' songs. They keep doing songs the way they want them to be done. Go White Stripes!! This albumm is definetly worth the money...also buy 'White Blood Cells' by the white stripes.both albums are cool to listen to. Pleez support them by making them rich an buying their music cds. Thank u."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopefully, the future of music to come...","review":"However, I just want to point out that I believe the supposed *bass* line in \\"Seven Nation Army\\", is actually played on a guitar with an octave pedal to give it the bass sound.

The album rocks and that's all that matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABOVE AVERAGE ROCK ...","review":"UNTIL I HEARD \\"BALL & BISCUIT\\" ON A JOSE CUERVO COMMERCIAL ..

THE HUGELY OVER-RATED JOHN MAYER !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring release of 2003","review":"The only good songs on this album are the first two tracks... Everything else on this album has been done by country greats like Lyle Lovett and Johnny Cash. The White Stripes put on an amazing live show, but their studio albums simply do not rock out. Period. I sold my copy of Elephant to the used record store after only a couple of weeks. My advice: Don't waste the time or money. Meg White sure is cool, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding right?","review":"The White Stripes are supposed to be the next big innovating beast in music right? Well, they may be a beast, but they are not the next big thing, especially in music. This is because they are completely unable to grasp the concept that music is supposed to be nice to listen to. While I know that their sound is not for everyone, it isn't music at all. I have been playing drums and guitar, both for less than a year, and I have more skill than either of them. It's old, it's boring, it's repetitive. They can't expect to pass this off as \\"creativity\\", because it's just making up for their lack of skill. Skill isn't everything, yes, but please, for the love of all that is sacred, make it stop.WorstBandEver"},{"rating":"1","title":"And this passes for talent?","review":"OK, while I'm in a good mood, I'll make this polite: Jack White can't hold a tune in a bucket, neither can Meg. A five-year-old could drum better than Meg White. This duo should be mown down with a truck for slaughtering a Bacharach/David classic.This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. I'm sticking with The Band until things improve... God help us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What exactly is this?","review":"After the hype this album recieved, I figured it had to be pretty good; so I bought it. I was very dissappointed with the quality of this album. None of the songs we're pleasant or interesting to listen to. None of them had real tunes, and I felt like I was listening to five year olds play in a disorganized musical pagent. Most of the songs had no recognizable chorus. I had heard that this album was one a \\"cross-generation album\\" so I was eagerly anticipating an album that I could listen to with my 13 year old son. The minute I turned it one, my son loved it (he even started playing air gutair), but I had to turn it off before my ears busted. This album is for people who really enjoy heavy rock music...not a curious mother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EXSQUEEZE ME?","review":"I have to say this album was absolutely terrible. The drums were more basic than anything I have ever heard, the guitar was fine but not at all good. All in all I dont recomend this extremely bad/basic album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad. Not Great. Good Opener.","review":"I not that impressed by this album, with the notable exception of their big hit opener \\"Seven Nation Army\\". I guess I'm getting older, because I've seen this shtick done before and better: Think G. Love, Jon Spencer, Royal Trux, Boss Hog, Guided by Voices. On top of that, I can't believe anyone would miss the fact that they COMPLETELY and UTTERLY rip off Urge Overkill's \\"Positively Bleeding\\" on Track 13, with no acknowledgement.This IS a listenable, decent album. The rest of it just isn't as inspired as the opener, and I'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"No...more of exactly the same. The White Stripes appear to have found their sound on \\"De Stijl\\" and made the same album over and over again ever since. It's either Led Zeppelin or Paul McCartney with a bit of distorted hipster white boy sings the blues. I thought they'd hit the usual third album rut with the solid but unadventurous \\"White Blood Cells\\", but this is just more of the damn same. Very disappointing. If you need a White Stripes record then check out the first two releases (God knows that's what the White Stripes are doing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kings of the one riff wonders!","review":"The only reason I was possessed to come and review this was because the amount of times \\"Seven Nation Army\\" has been crammed down my throat on MTV and the radio. I thought Queens of the stone age were pushing it when they wrote a whole song with the same riff over and over and over again, but this band takes the cake!! Is it the fact that they could only come up with one chord? or did they want to milk it for all its worth? either way that managed to tick me off. I also read some reviewers say they are \\"musically strong\\" You can say anything you want about this band: you can say you like them, they are cool, what have you, but you cannot say they are musically strong, count the riffs, do you hear any guitar leads? do any of you play guitar, you could learn this in only a week if you have never played a guitar, and if you have, you could learn it in 2 seconds. Simplistic, annoying music, sounds like a broken record!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think it's me.","review":"I used to really adore White Stripes. Now, I'm not sure why.This cd is their worst by far. If you you really like their sound, pick up De Stijl instead. It has a top-notch cover of Dylan's, \\"One More Cup Of Coffee\\".Most of the songs off Elephant are plain-out annoying. I bought this cd the first day it came out... I even went to several stores. I've never been so disappointed in a purchase. Please stay away from this. I don't understand what all of the critics see in this record. I really don't.It's going to the Used shop tomorrow.E-mail me at Christopher_face@yahoo.com if you feel the need to explain what I'm missing in this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be Joking","review":"Simply put this album BLOWS!! , It's got no flow to it , the songs are awful , boring and monotous and not to mention the low musical abiltity of these two , they make old school punk bands look like \\"accomplished \\" musicians . Why this band gets so much praise is beyond me , If you want simple music that rocks buy a Ramones , Clash , Sex Pistols or Misfits album , you want Hard Rock , get into Iron Maiden , Megadeath , GNR , Led Zep or any other real good band . This album is seriously like watching you're money burn so unless you like doing that ,stay away from this garbage rock ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainstream=Garbage","review":"Once again mainstream music has proven itself to be complete garbage. The lyrics are simple and dull and the sound is repetitive and boring. Similar, equally untalented, and media hyped bands include the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, The Strokes, Bowling for Soup, and the Hives. If you want real music with real, complex, and thought provoking lyrics check out Thrice, Thursday. Also recommend Senses Fail, Saosin, A Static Lullaby, Rufio, Yellowcard, Brand New, Dogwood, and Funeral For A Friend.Look into drive thru records if you want good pop punk. Just stay away from the White Stripes and clones like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype???","review":"I just cannot understand what all the hype is about this album. I bought it looking for something new to listen to. True, I grew up listening to the hair bands and rock and roll bands of the 70's and 80's, but I feel I can listen to most \\"music\\" out there. This was absolute trash. This is absolutely the first time I've ever bought an album and literally threw it away after the first time through. Sometimes music will grow on me, but I hope that this band never does or I'll have it surgically removed!!! Don't waste your money. Go buy something from Incubus instead. Now there is some real talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"They have absolutely no talent and, other than \\"7 Nation Army,\\" the songs suck. The industry fawning is a backlash of fifty-year old industry execs against hip hop's global dominance (whether good or bad). In short, I've crapped out turds that were more musically gifted than the White Stripes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me!","review":"This is absolutly terrible. I heard some of there songs on the radio and thought it was alright. I got the album for free, some kind of promotion and it absolutly sucked. This is probably as low as music today will go. The songs are bland, no sololing, no sign of musical intelligence or knowledge. All in all, a complete waste of money and time. Someone would have to pay me to listen to this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"Overrated band with crappy garage sound. People will listen to anything as long as it is critically acclaimed. Junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE!","review":"So very not good. So very Bad.

You'll throw this album out, I promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"For hardcore fans only","review":"You must be a devoted follower to like this album. I can't understand how the same band can make Seven Nation Army - an excellent song - and combine it with 13 extremely bad pieces. It wasn't worth the money to buy this CD just for the one good song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brings back memories...","review":"...of watching \\"Gilligan's Island\\" as a kid. Specifically, the episode where Gilligan's favorite British Invasion band, \\"The Mosquitos\\", wound up on the island, and the men put together a band to try to impress them. Trust me, this album doesn't sound any worse than the obvious result, but neither does it sound any better. Call me old-fashioned, but there's more to rock and roll than attitude; at a certain point, being able to play your instrument competently and sing in tune becomes important, and not much of that is in evidence here. Sort of like The Shaggs with slightly better musicianship, but without the charming innocence that redeemed them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gripes about the White Stripes","review":"If this band is going to save rock 'n roll, then it's shame for rock 'n roll. When a no-talent drummer (with \\"endearingly amateurish\\" skills) and a vocalist whose range I could match with a few choice farts make it big, you know the music world is going down the drain. Fresh, new, original?! I'll give 'em points for style, putting on a show, but musically one shouldn't put White Stripes on a pedastal. Garage rock has its charms, but, please, don't pass it off as art-house rock or art for that matter. This whole indie rock movement has gone too far. All you need are a pair of tight jeans and a t-shirt two sizes too small and you're an immediate hit. Innovation, skill and talent don't seem to count much anymore and, in that context, White Stripes is no better than cookie-cutter productions like N*Sync or Avril Lavigne. It's a sad, sad day when you buy this album, support this genre of \\"music\\" by buying this album, or wear one of those stupid \\"sporty\\" jackets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album-- but I prefer Jack White's first band \\"The Go\\"","review":"The minimalist thing is done to perfection by Jack and Meg on this album...but wait till you hear what Jack White can do on guitar with a fully-rockin' band with him...I recommend checking out Jack White in his first band \\"THE GO\\" on the album \\"WHATCHA DOIN'\\" Absolutely righteous!The White Stripes are a great band limited only by the fact that there's only two of them.

Maybe she'll learn some guitar/piano."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.","review":"God, I hate these guys. Hearing them play live on the Grammys was enough to make anyone sick.

I would have rate 2 or 3 stars because it is simply another piece of mediocre pseudo-rawness, tolerable however.

Unlike any recent music purchase, I listen to this CD literally everyday and can't seem to get enough. I have heard other White Strips CDs before, and they are edgy and experimental.

Leave the blues numbers to musicians with more soul, and Meg--please take some drum lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Variety is the spice of life!","review":"I've been a WS fan since De Stijl, and they just keep getting better and better. I love the variety of this album, from the 70's inspired, hard rockin' opening tune \\"Seven Nation Army\\" to the final track \\"It's true that we love one another\\" which reminds me of an old Loretta Lynn tune. Jack sings a couple of lovely ballads (\\"I've got you in my pocket\\" is my fave, and Meg sings a sexy, minimalist song, \\"In the Cold Cold Night\\" which reminds me of \\"Fever\\", the old standard that Madonna covered a few years back. There are some bluesy numbers, like \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" and then some more rockin numbers \\"Little Acorns\\" and \\"There's no home for you here\\". Then, a McCartney-esque tune, \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself \\".With all of this variety, one would think it would be a disjointed mess, and just sound like the WS are trying to not be niched, but incredibly, the songs flow together perfectly.This is the best album I've heard since White Blood Cells!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elephant: Decent Album","review":"The White Stripes are an interesting band. Meg White may [stink] at singing, but hey, that doesn't bother me. I think Jack is a great guitar player. It's not how simple it is, or how difficult it is either. It's the quality that makes this album outstanding. I remember watching the band perform each day of one week on Conan O'Brien. Jack can really play a mean guitar. I know and understand much about music, and their styles are different. This is a must own album for any rock n roll fan. Jack and Meg's styles have made this band sound different and unique. Not any other music group can be compared to them.My favorite songs include Seven Nation Army, Ball and Biscuit, and Hypnotize. There is a mix of slow songs, fast songs, and just plain ole rock! Meg sings in the song, \\"In the Cold, Cold, Night\\". It's not the best, but its fun to listen to. The last song, \\"Well It's True That We Love One Another\\" , is a great song that reminds me of the Mama's and the Papa's...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The White Stripes dish out a quality CD","review":"This CD is full of many different types of songs, some sound classic,some slow, some modern rock and others popish.

Along with Ryan Adams, Coldplay, Josh Ritter, John Mayer and David Gray, they prove to music fans that there really IS people out there who still make music for the music, not for the image, glitz and glamour of the 'biz'. They're hip, they're indie, they have creativity, spark, great hooks and HOT guitar licks. The 'Stripes' are a smack in the face to anyone who thinks that people like Ashlee Simpson qualify as 'rock' music.

Lyrically, the White Stripes have clearly worked overtime to write some great poetry which can be deceptively simple at times (\\"It's True That We Love One Another\\"), heartwarming (\\"I Want to Be the Boy...\\"), and full of meaning. Musically, \\"Elephant\\" is usually an edgy album (see \\"Black Math\\" and \\"Seven Nation Army\\") while at other times is soothing and mellow (\\"I Don't Know What to Do with Myself\\").The only real flaw here is similar to that of another White Stripes album \\"White Blood Cells:\\" the album somewhat weakens toward the end, although the final song \\"It's True...\\" is a quirky song and fun to listen to.Nonetheless \\"Elephant\\" is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know why everyone gave it such high marks","review":"If you want a DVD that shows a large man (who's shoulders roll forward from bad posture)giving a tan woman a really nice massage, then this is the DVD for you.It doesn't really give any instruction.

Bob Mould's slower songs \\"too far down\\" and \\"hardly getting over it\\" are awesome. I didn't really like them at first, but now they're my favorites. Grant Hart doesn't fail to deliver awesome songs like Mould. Hart's \\"sorry somehow\\" and \\"don't want to know if you're lonely\\" are his best cuts. The opening song is awesome too.

So he came up with a plan, an evil Grinchy-plot, to do away with Christmas for every kid and tot! This book tells the whole story about how Christmas was saved in its greatest Christmas Glory!

This book has been made into a cartoon, a song and even a movie with real people as characters. It is my all time favorite Christmas book I ever read. I still enjoy reading it at the age of fifteen. It's a wonderful book about a Christmas hating Who, who tries to steel Christmas from all the other Whos by stealing all their presents, decorations, and food until their wasn't even a crumb left for the mice. His name is the Grinch and what he finds out in the end is Christmas isn't about gifts or the big feast with the roast beast.

Dr. Seuss is a poetic genius. His rhymes flow so smoothly, there is not one \\"forced\\" rhyme in the whole book. By saying \\"forced rhyme,\\" I mean a pair of lines that technically rhyme together, but just don't seem to fit well, a pathetic attempt at making a rhyming pair of lines.But \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\\" is a perfectly rhyming book. Also, the message is positive, that there is good in everyone, even the Grinch.There are only four colors used in the illustrations: black, white, red and pink. This is great, because it lets the reader imagine how the Grinch would look. (However, after the 1966 cartoon and the 2000 Jim Carrey movie, I'm prettty sure everyone thinks of the Grinch as being green). But, it just wouldn't seem right with everything colored in.This is quite possibly Dr. Seuss's greatest book, and undoubtedly the best Christmas book for kids ever to be published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to read it!","review":"I've never read the Dr. Seuss book, but I recently saw the movie, with Jim Carey.

It has a very low powered transmitter that allows bleed-through all over the FM spectrum.

We were constantly searching for a new frequency every 10-15 miles or so. This creates as driving hazard. It's certainly not for the solo driver.

After reading the three reviews on Amazon.com I was pretty sure I would be returning it. I live outside of Chicago which means finding an open frequency is not an easy task. I visited the Belkin site to identify \\"the best available frequencies in my area.\\" I was a bit worried because even their first choice had weak reception of another station. However, once the Ipod was playing, the clarity and volume was wonderful. NOTE: that the transmitter location did have an effect on the reception, so move it around a bit. In the past when taking long trips, my daughters have taken a clock radio along in the car to listen to music.

Not worth the money - I upgraded and got the Belkin brand docking station, MUCH MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I received this as a present when my previous tuner broke. The signal is very weak, you have to practically attach the transmitter to the stereo itself to get it to work.

For those wondering exactly who it is on the disc, I believe it is the Dubliners - a great band indeed.

The first song is great! One of those you play again as soon as it's over, but after that...not much to get excited about. I've heard plenty of catchy irish pub songs that stick in your head long after you've heard them - and there aren't too many here. Too many slow, repetitive songs. There are much better choices out there. In addition, I agree with the other reviews here...it's unprofessional (and cheap looking) to not even bother to mention the singer's names.

That's just in bad taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorest of the Poor","review":"If this were the first exposure to Irish folk music I ever had I would never want to listen to anything like it again. The sound quality of this production is very bad. Gladly, my first taste of this genre was a 1998 CD produced in Canada titled \\"Irish Drinking Songs\\" (not found here on Amazon unfortunately) which has all but enchanted me.

A great example of how life (theirs) imitates art (Shakespeare). I heartily recommend. It's an insight to both Shakespeare and to the hearts and lives of people.

She has been a social worker in a prison AND loves Shakespeare, so this seemed to be just the right thing. She found it to be much more about the filmmakers than the inmates -- she thought they would at least show the inmates doing a complete scene, but while they showed them rehearsing from a distance, they never really TALKED with them or showed any of their performances for any length of time. She was very disappointed and so was I -- it's a great idea for a project, but only partially realized from the viewer's point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poncho is the Man","review":"I really enjoyed this CD.

I have a daughter who is almost six and a son, who has ADHD, who is eight. Perhaps for an older child, this book would be appropriate. However, I found that I skimmed pages to try to find something that my daughter could relate to. More illustrations, in color, and less text would be more appropriate for children ages four to six. Perhaps more of a story line. Overall, I think she did get some useful insights out of it, but reading it to her was not an easy task. It is very wordy and comes across as written by an acadamician for a child. If I could, I would rate it 2.5 stars. I think the need is great for a book that addresses the siblings of children with ADHD. Perhaps one aimed at the younger child would help fill the need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid brush for infants...","review":"This is a great brush for your newborn/infant. Very soft brush and the comb works well too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book in a wonderful series","review":"Although this is the second book of the Dimity series I would recommend reading this one first as it is sort-of an off shoot from the character in the first book Lori - if you read Atherton's first book Aunt Dimity's Death first you sort-of loose some of the excitement of this book but it is still fabulous and fun. Read them all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until the end.","review":"I started to read this book with avid interest. I was really touched by young Peter's memory of his mother, and I loved the story behind the stained glass window. Some of the characters are a trifle wacky, but I put up with that until the end, when the answers to everything come out. Suddenly all the characters begin acting silly and nasty over nothing! Frumpy Emma bullies and yells at her host, and Kate Cole develops a sharp tongue towards not only the Duke but her mother as well. Kate must've been starting her period and Emma going through the change. And the Duke is SO meek towards these nasty women! Maybe Atherton wanted to cut through the over-sweet atmosphere of the book with this disagreement, but it just didn't make sense to me. It ruined the whole book for me. I am glad now that Nancy Atherton sticks to Lori Shepherd. At least her anger at something or someone makes some sense. Read Aunt Dimity And the Next of Kin to see what I mean. The Duke SHOULD have thrown Emma out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book - don't bother","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read!

My thoughts on this first book, I enjoyed it.I love the Arthurian legend and the mystery that surrounds it. To my mind this book offered a grittier personna to Arthur, than some of the other books I have read over the years. In this interpretation, he was not a romantic figure as has been portrayed. In some ways I didn't like the Arthur that the author presented. He was callous, brutal and single minded. But he would have had to be such a man to gain the Crown. This book gives some insight to Arthur's early years and his meeting Gwenhwyfar. I enjoyed reading the book, but I don't think that I will ever again envisage Arthur as a romantic figure in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helen Hollick - An Outstanding Writer","review":"I enjoyed Helen Hollick's style of writing very much.

However, after reading that, I found this one and loved it. The story is easily the most inspired one that I have read and I found that, despite all of Arthur's vices, I loved his character all the more. (there is only so much interest when the character's a saint) Gwenhwyfar was a character I had always loved and now I finally got to see her the way I had always wanted to. As for the rest of the characters and the setting, I truly enjoyed them. This is certainly a must-read for all fans of King Arthur."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very different Arthur!","review":"Helen Hollick has refused to be constrained by the stereotypical Arthur we all know through legend - and of course TV! She has created a very different man and we get to know him, his life and loves, warts and all. This Arthur is very human and not always the good guy. But he is a lovable larrikin and, despite his flaws, we're left in no doubt that he's the hero. Gwen, the love of his life is no shrinking violet either - a feisty, courageous woman and definitely a good match for Arthur. This is a fascinating book. I'm now reading the second one of the trilogy. It's great fun getting to know all the characters and learn about their lives in 5th Century Britain. Thanks Helen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arthur without magic but definitely real","review":"All three of Helen Hollick's books on Arthur are excellent. Unlike many other books on Arthur, however, they deal with Arthur from a realistic point of view and deny any form of magic. This has the effect of making the books more historical fiction than fantasy, but very worthwhile if you bear this in mind. Arthur is a much stronger character in these books, but also much more human. His love for Gwenhwyfar is his one saving grace, as he is nearly fatally flawed in every other regard and in every other relationship. Gwenhwyfar also is far more of a real person in this series. She is a real woman with real needs and intelligence of her own, not just the slightly dim but beautiful focal point of chivalry displayed in most portrayals. The Pendragon's Banner Trilogy is an excellent read, and will influence your opinion on all future and past writings of the tale of Camelot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will be crushed if I can't get a copy of this book!","review":"My grandmother bought me this book when I was 10 or 11.

He played it for and I swear it must be contagious because not only did I fall in love with it but so has everyone that I've played it for. The backgrounds are reminicient of Smashing Pumpkins, but that's a cruel comparison, because on this one album there is so much range that to say it's like one artist is to ignore the rest of the album. At one point the vocals remind me of an old time blues singer just coming into to his own and at another Bowie. He has the kind of voice you want to hear in your bedroom late at night.

Prior to reading this work, it appeared to have potential. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. This book only dicsusses one particular case study, and although the topic is an extremely important one, the author's writing style makes for a dull read. I do not recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"good first 40 pages","review":"This book was good for the first 40 pages but that's it. Hochschild gets across the interesting truth that some Americans work and don't spend time with their families because work is a reprieve from the stress of home and family life. This is really the crux of the book; the rest is mainly filler. Hochschild doesn't provide much more insight or scientific rigor and support to these observations. I agree with the above reviewer that the writing is quite poor: convoluted; however, I wouldn't even give the writing the compliment of being novel-like. The writing is trite and character placements a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious and dry","review":"While it is commendable that the author avoids the verbal fakery, jargon and obfuscation so common amongst academic authors, it is hard to imagine a flatter, duller narrative. The evidence on offer here is anecdotal and therefore of limited value, and since the anecdotes are so mundane, there seems little reason to read the book. Most adults can furnish their own supply of similar stories, have already come to some of the same conclusions, and won't find the insights very insightful. Sociology remains thin stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good insights but nothing real original.","review":"The basis of this book is great and the author has a terrific way with words but she loses the reader after about page 55, where she goes off into all sorts of liberal and unproven theories about modern family life.

Ms Hochschild raises questions of how much pressure we may create for ourselves, how that is reinforced by the workplace and the economic, social, political climate that fosters it and the painful consequence of reduced quality of life. In attempting to raise our consciousness on this matter and to ask about our priorities we are invited to step briefly outside the current paradigm to consider saner possibilities.

We would show it off to family and friends like other reviewers, amazed that plastic performed so well. But then it started cutting very poorly. You would expect that a plastic knife would lose its edge but that was not the problem. The knife became too pliable, cutting creative patterns through our cheddar and colby. Fine if you are going for some eye catching h'ordeuvres but rather irritating when making a cheese sandwich. I don't know what caused the plastic to become so wavy because we only hand washed it, (we don't have a dish washer).

It glides right through cheese that grabs and holds a standard knife, requiring very little pressure to slice right through.The problem is that the blade isn't very stiff, so it bends and flexes while slicing through the cheese, making it impossible to get anything even *remotely* resembling an even, uniform slice. It may be a struggle to get a normal knife through the cheese, but at least the resulting cuts are straight.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Cheese knife","review":"Saw one of these at a garden Happy Hour this summer.

That's not a bad thing, in fact, it is a beautifully crafted song. My opinion of the Decemberists was that they didn't make any good songs before Picaresque, but this EP proved me wrong. I'm curious as to whether there is a different version in which the album is broken up into 5 songs, because most websites have it divided into parts. I think I'd have a problem with that because it's hard to start in the middle of a song like this, especially when it contains Colin Meloy and his great talent for story telling. Another thing that's great about this song is that it is in no way repetative, and there is no chorus that is sung after each verse. In fact, it actually sounds like 5 completely different songs pushed together into one (which, essentially, is what it is). This is most definately the Decemberists at their finest, and a greatly inspirational piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danilov the Violist -- Delightful Read!","review":"I always envisioned life under the Soviet flag as gray, humorless, uninspired--but Danilov suggests it was anything but humorless. I've read the book 3 times, and recommend it to everyone. Danilov, the half human half demon, is delightful. His job is to torment humans, but evil deeds give him stomach ache and he seeks to do good instead--though secretly, lest his employers from down below give him hell over it. And, as it turns out, there are things worse than hell, when he is threatened by total annihilation. The zany characterizations of both Russians and demons, the descriptions of Russian society and the games people played, the politics, the music -- Danilov is definitely one of my favorites. I've lived on China's Xiamen Island since 1988, and I wish there were an English book that could bring to life China of the 60s and 70s in the same way.

Tsoukalas has a wonderful gift for writing and telling history. Unlike most books about the NOI, Tsoukalas takes the right approach in describing thier history and belifs. The only book that might do a better job is C. Eric Lincolns book 'The Black Muslims in America' but that book goes into extreme detail within the black Muslim history. Tsoukalas's book is much more basic and to the point. He does what should be done, he tells the facts about the Blacks Muslims without totally bashing them. In his last chapter, he does give a Christian response to the black Muslims, but it is in no way a bashing of their belief system. I would definatly recomend this book to anyone who wants a short but well written explaination of the Black Muslims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative but...","review":"This book was very informative and there is a lot of information and historical documentation here.

You can see how much more effective this tool is. I have already ran 5 different bread recipes through this mixer, and I haven't had to finish any of the by hand yet.

Prior to owning the KitchenAid I used a Cuisinart food processor to make breads. The Cuisinart was very fast, but making bread dough was extremely hard on the machine. I had to replace the work bowls, stems and the bread blades several times. The replacement parts did not fit very well and they were expensive. I finally gave up and got the KitchenAid.

And everytime I hear this band, the words \\"singing prophet\\" always are planted firmly on my lips. Stylistically, these guys share their genre most closely with Galactic Cowboys. The lyrics to their songs are prophetic in nature (not futuristically speaking, but as vision about God's view of society in the present). Visions of Jeremiah, Elijah, and Paul the apostle come immediately to my mind when I hear them.The songs here are great.

I first got a used version then I re ordered a new version and both versions do the same thing no matter what control I hit I get wrapped up by the snake.

In the Fighting Marlows he mentions Marshal George A. Knight Sr. and in reading the parts about Knight I recognized my husbands personality. He is the great grandson of George A. Knight Sr. He and other characters came alive for me and I really enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Halachah to ' live by '","review":"Rabbi Berkovits was one of the important Jewish thinkers of the twentieth century. In this work he strives to explain the way the Halachah( Jewish law ) works. He explains the Nature and Function of Halachah, the Nature of Halachic Authority, the essential nature of Halachah, and the application of Halachah in our time. He is especially concerned with the role of Halacha in relation to women's role in the modern world, and discusses marriage and divorce laws. Rabbi Berkovits is an orthodox thinker but one who is aware of how needs of the time may require flexibility in Halachah. He considers the role of Halacha in democratic society."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ice has melted","review":"Ice Cube is a Rap Legend Period.but his recordings after 92 have just gotten worse&worse.I'm tired of Hearing Cube just getting by with 2nd Rate Tracks.you get a song hear&their that sounds Familiar to his Peak but other than that it's Melted ICE.He Lost his edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak For Ice Cube","review":"This album has a few good songs. What happen to Ice Cube? Has the things he was so against, taken his soul. This is whole lot better than the WaR Disc but what does that say about this as a double disc- It SUCKS. Where's the old CUbe, Where's K-DEE? F@ck Mr. short Khop. I weep for this OnE, it's so studio, it is riddiculous. Weak for Ice Cube, listen to Amerikkka's Most, Death Certificate and Westside Connection album to regain your skills. ONE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Cube","review":"When I first put this CD in the deck, \\"Hello\\" got me real excited. Unfortunately, the rest of the disc did not hold up. Sure \\"You can do it\\" is great, but the rest of the album seemed to fall off a bit. I still like every other album, from \\"Amerikkka's Most Wanted\\" to \\"Lethal Injection\\" to \\"War\\" as well as those in between, but the one bright spot was hearing a sneak preview of what N.W.A has in store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Cube's the One","review":"listen to this one- a beat that will drive this one Platinum....Cube is #1 and this Priority compilation is classic rap."},{"rating":"1","title":"War & Peace Vol. 2","review":"Damn Cube..... after owning all his albums i went and got this b/c vol. 1 was so great....
