I read all the books in the Robin Hudson series while waiting for the next Stephanie Plum book to be released -- I was looking for something with the humor, romance, sexual tension and mystery of the Plum series. Of all the books in the Robin Hudson series, the first one (What's A Girl Gotta Do?) comes the closest to capturing those elements. The other Robin Hudson books are lacking in the romance and sexual tension areas. All of them are funny, with some zany characters or situations. This one has some of the more memorable laugh-out-loud scenes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth owning","review":"There's no question that improvement is possible, but if you listen carefully to this CD you can hear a world of potential. Matt's got a great voice, and the rest of the band has genuine talent. It's the kind of CD you can listen to a lot and not get sick of it.

Buy the cd you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying Blind left a lasting impression","review":"I had never heard of this band until they came to the Q101 Cinco De Mayo Festival when I was just 14 years old. When the band got on stage, they totally rocked. I loved their performance, they were extremely passionate and very high energy. I got to hang out with the band for a couple hours after the show and they're great guys! I bought this album and listened to it non stop for the longest time. I like the great diversity on the album from song to song. This is NOT one of those albums where all the songs sound the same. Not only that, but it's nearly impossible for me to find an album and like EVERY song on it, even to this day. Push is that CD for me. I can put this CD in and rock out to every track. It's been 7 years since I first saw Flying Blind live in 2001 and I still have that great nostalgic feeling about them. I still have my push CD and I still pop it in from time to time. I'd definitely say their music left a lasting impression on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather bland and flavor-of-the-week","review":"Well, picked this one up on a friend's recommendation & was disappointed.

The weak points here are the excruciatingly bad attempt at funk, \\"Work So Hard\\", the soulless Hootie-esque \\"Western September Skies\\", the unimaginative & predictable 50's romp \\"Smokescreen\\" & the plagiaristic \\"Paralyzed\\" which bears an uncanny resemblance to one of Dave Matthews biggest singles this year.I just think that this disc is devoid of any originality & should be avoided by anyone who doesn't rely on MTV to determine the definition of what is truly good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The pen is cheap, the pen holder has already torn, and the paper tears off too easily.

Lewis as superior fictional substitutes to J.K Rowling's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of trees!","review":"In the UK it's become tantamount to treason not to like Harry Potter so much so that criticism is usually supressed. So imagine my dismay to find so many US readers have also falen for the 'emperor's new clothes'. Harry Potter is to literature what the 'National Enquirer' is to investigative newspaper journalism. Unfortunately, I've not been able to get away from the hype as I've had to read these books to my daughter when she was between 6 and 10. She's now 12 and has got over HP. Anyway, the stories and several of the characters are derivative while HP is the kind of kid who would've had his head flushed down the toilet at my old school. There's far too much description which slows down the pace of the narrative and worst of all all 4 stories are completely predictable. As kids books they may just about be passable but for adults! Give me a break! In summary, mindnumbingly boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing","review":"Having heard a great deal about this series, I thought I would give it a try. Very disappointing.

Anyone past the 3rd grade should be reading better written books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype definitely not worth it","review":"This is one ofthe most overrated series of books in the Fantasy (or even general Literature) genre. It lacks depth, humanity and anything to provoke thought or real interest.As for the claim that the books get kids interested in reading - my experience in talking to kids who enjoyed the series is that they are very interested in buying merchandise relating to Harry Potter or seeing the movie multiple times, but are not really interested in reading more books that are non-Potter related."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the buzz?","review":"I dont' understand what all the hype is about! Quite frankly, they're good stories, but it seemed to me like they were completely predictable. There is no depth to them at all. The good thing about Harry Potter is that he gets kids reading, but they are no comparison whatsoever to the Chronicles of Narnia, or the Lord of the Rings. My final word on Harry Potter is that its a great series for kids, but GROW UP and read a real book, for a change. Your brain cells will thank you! I would give it two or three stars, but it's way too overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter 1 and the Sorcer's Stone","review":"If you liked The Lord of the Rings than you will like the 354 paged book Harry Potter 1 and the Sorcer's Stone by J.K. Rowling. Harry Potter is a boy that goes to school and gets into several conflicts. One of the conflicts is that Harry gets into a fight with a teacher who helps out the \\"great\\" Voldemort (he-who-must-not-be-named). I think thatit has interestign action and all of the conflicts are solved in an odd way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but watch out for missing chapters","review":"Not much need to discuss this publishing phenomena. I purchased the packaged set in November of 2001 and have since read it several times. I have the same tingle of anticipation for Volume 5 as I did 40 years ago while waiting for the next Hardy Boys Mystery to be published. I do caution you that Scholastic has been quite slipshod in the production of these books. Volume 2, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is missing an entire chapter. I only discovered it after viewing the movie and seeing the dueling club scene on screen but did not remember having read it in the book...Heaven only knows what other portions are missing.Note-Amazon.com was marvelous in replacing the defective set with a new one even though the purchase was a year old. Great customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"absoulately PERFECTT","review":"These books are absoulately amazing!!! As a person, who normally hates fantasy books, I must admit that Harry Potter is far more than merely an imaginary character. The unbelieveably organized details is not the only thing that makes me simply adore these books. The way these details are described by the author helps you to visualise the scenes which makes these books even better. Also, the fact that these little details connect with each other by the end of each book is yet another wonderful thing about these books.

The books are a medium reading level due to all the characters and the names. Mostly because you are trying to piece the story together about Harry's life as much as he is. You do not need to read the books in order because each books entwines the prior year's information within it. However it will make the story flow a bit easier. Join Harry on his wild adventures. I can't wait for the 5th book and the rest of the movies. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrilling Adventure","review":"Harry Potter is a boy who learns that he is a famous wizard. He attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He meets many friends along the way as he goes from an ordinary boy to a trained wizard. When I read these books I felt that time flew by and I couldn't put them down. I am currently in the middle of reading the fourth book. I have realized that for a childrens book it has quite a bit of harsh language especially in the fourth book, Goblet of Fire. These words may mean nothing to you but I feel for a children's book, they should not be in there. I also feel that there are other ways to express your feelings. Otherwise these books have made me enjoy reading a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"H.P. Rocks!!!!!!!!!","review":"Harry Potter rocks! If you didn't read these books yet, it's about time!

I recomend \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" (If you're Polish, also read \\"Corka Czarownic\\"). A lot of people tell me I'm obsesed with H.P.

The first 2 I thought were cute and light reading, which is great in between some of the heavier more intense series I often read. However, book 3 started filling in the blanks and background of Harry and his parents, thus fleshing out his character, and making him more enjoyable. Book 4 however, was better than all of the others. The story was much more involved and interesting, with lots of twists and turns. You're not sure from one moment to the next who is the \\"good guy\\" and who is the \\"bad guy\\". I can't wait for the next book to come out; I just hope things keep getting better with each and every one.

Just when you think you've figured it al out, \\"Pow!\\", something unexpected happens that keeps you flipping the pages. Harry Potter, a child still, gets the chance to go to Hogwarts, a wizarding school. He makes friends and enemies too. The thing about Harry, though, is that he has secrets even he doesn't know about.

There is NO reason to slag a series of books that give nothing but enjoyment just because they are popular or are Juvenile/Young Adult fiction. Such books open up the world of reading to many people.

I like the part where he meets the 3 headed dog fluffy but it is so much more exciting in the movie. The one action scene that i think j.k did good at in the book (action wise) is the part with the troll. She explained the troll and what it did in very good detail and it was cool how Hermoine was in the middle of it all because of her friend.But it ended up a very good book and is worth reading i would recomend it to you or anybody with a wide immagination.

And I was totally, utterly, and completely in love.And then I reread them now as twelve year old, and they have degraded. The plot and the characters are ultimately lovable, though it becomes a bit too repetitive in the fifth and sixth book. But I'm actually quite proud of how the characters have developed from the first one; they are 3D, dimensional, lovable, and almost believable. (though I find Draco Malfoy is just too...cliche-bad-boy-unbelievable)It's mostly J.K. Rowling's writing style. I like fresh, appealing descriptions, not so much the \\"and there was a chair in the room and a small boy and another boy and...\\" (Okay, I just made that sentence up. But still.

The first book (and this is my opinion not fact as far as I know) seems to be designed for fourth grade. it is a very simple read with easy vocab (well unless you try the character names) and themes that are appropriate for that age group.As you read the next book it heads into 5th grade reading level and so forth with all the books.I would highly recommend this to any parent that can see the moral themes behind the very enchanting storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT JUST FOR KIDS!!!","review":"It's a shame the Harry Potter books and movies are being marketed to kids.

Harry's Aunt and Uncle are Muggles which means that they are not wizards. All of this alone shows how inappropriate this book is! Voldemort, their best friend, killed Harry's parents? What is this book trying to tell young readers? Personally I do not understand Rowlings whole idea od a fantasy world.

The publication and popularity of this pablum proves that I could also perhaps write 5 books about nonsense and earn fame and money. Whenever I see this book one quote comes to mind from Nietzsche: \\"That everyone may lear to read, in the long run corrupts not only writing but also thinking.Once the spirit was god, then he became man, and now he even becomes rabble.\\" A perfect archetype of substance-less degrading piece of literature this Harry Potter seems...I recommend it for a mentally depraved, domesticated, effeminate, foolish, sheep-like creature. Pardon if I have offended those who have read it and have enjoyed it immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy and burn these horrible books!","review":"If you buy these books it would just be a waste of money.

I saw Batteries Required on a cart and it looked interesting, that is until I started reading it. The dialogue is horrible. Very basic, amature writing. The heroine leaves much to be desired. While Apodaca tries to make her funny, she ends up turning her into a stupid, helpless idiot who can't do anything right. There are many twists and turns, but after about the 5th one, I rolled my eyes and put the book down instead of eagerly reading on. The twists, like dead bodies not being there, cars blowing up and such, were more annoying than anything. The story was not adequately developed and the characters were very shallow. It seemed to me to be comprable to a bad Harlequin mystery than a cute Janet Evanovish read-a-like. If you don't want your brain stimulated and have no problem reading boring dialogue with idiot women as the characters, then you'll love it. Otherwise, go try Janet Evanovich or Lauren Willig."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batteries Required","review":"Batteries Required is book number 4 in the Samantha Shaw Mysteries. This is one hot, sexy book. Sam and best friend Angel are given a sex toy kit to try out and see if Angel wants to add it to her lingerie business. But before Sam and Angel can open the box, Angel goes missing and her house has been ransacked. Sam has to deal with a fanatical fan of R.V. Logan, her up and down relationship with P.I. Gabe Pulizzi, and the simmering heat of Det. Logan Vance who wants Sam as his own. All the while operating her dating service Heart Mates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book has been sitting in my wish list for years, so I decided to give it a try since I couldn't find anything else to order. Two chapters in and I remembered why I stopped reading the series and let this book sit in my wish list for so long.Sam is an idiot, and the author's attempt to mimic Janet Evanovich doesn't even come close to working. The dialogue is ridiculous, the \\"gags\\" aren't funny, the characters are cartoonish stereotypes and the whole thing is just a bad joke. Even the cop is a moron and can't save this one.Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries NOT Required... reading that is","review":"I'm sorry to say that I just don't get it. This author consistently gets four and five star reviews, and I thought I would really enjoy her stuff based on the reviews I'd read. This is the second Sam Shaw book I've tried (along with the first one in the series), and unless I get really desperate, I won't be back. I find the dialogue to be terribly stilted, the plots seem contrived, and the whole thing is clearly a (very poor) Janet Evanovich knock-off. I wish I saw what everyone else does, because apparently lots of folks find her an absolute hoot, and I love funny books. But these are not funny, they're just... weak. It's rare that I can't finish a book, but I could not bring myself to keep turning the pages in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting to hear the original music from the series; instead I got a souped up orchestral version of the songs in the original series.

I already opened the package and played it, but I gave it to my boyfriend, also a Dark Shadows fan.

The track that contains the actual \\"sound effect\\" musical shorts from the series is cool...to listen to once, but can drive a person crazy after a while...it goes on forever! I especially wanted \\"Back at the Blue Whale\\" and the version here isn't the regular heard on the series. Disappointed in general, I then ordered the Original Music from Dark Shadows CD, which I'm listening to right now, and can already tell I like it better. If you're looking for the versions of the songs from the original series, this CD will disappoint you, instead, get the Original Music from Dark Shadows CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dispelling the myths of age ...","review":"Morning Song is a homecoming of sorts for tenor saxophonist Kalaparush Maurice McIntyre. Kalaparush made his debut on Delmark Records back in 1969 when Chicago's A.A.C.M. were just beginning to make waves in the free jazz world. Interestingly, Kalaparush's current trio members were not even born when he made his recording debut, but no matter. There is an empathic quality to their playing that elevates it up above a mere sax soloist and rhythm section date.All three members share equally in the creation of this album's expansive and exploratory sound. A tuba is used instead of traditional string bass so the typical dividing lines between soloist and rhythm section are often erased, allowing greater collaboration to take place. An extremely rewarding album from a lesser-known legend, Morning Song is on a par with any classic session from the 1970s free-jazz loft era AND beyond."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Duet","review":"R.kelly with His soulful Presentation here steals the track from Cassidy.it's a fun cut that kept heads moving in the clubs.a good debut cut for Cassidy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say loud?","review":"I am not very technical when it comes to case fans, but I do have ears: these things are the loudest fans you can possibly meet.

At the end you are still not certain who the killer was, but I stuck with it, and like so many other books I ended up not liking wish I had quit after about 3 chapters. I have also read Infamous by the author and gave it a five star, so try that book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MUCH OF EVERYTHING","review":"Starts promisingly but meanders into subplots galore and peripheral characters that only distract the reader from the \\"point\\". Speaking of which, I think the point is to include every scrap of local color and historical data that Atkins compiled for the book.

I was so pleased with it that I turned again to Swiss Gear and purchased model 36289 when I needed a larger tent. I just used the new tent this weekend for the first time on a two day campout and it was a big disapointment. The plastic feet that the tent poles insert into are attached to the tent by a thin ribbon material. Before the tent was was even completely up, 1 foot sheared off the ribbon and I had to improvise to make it work. By the end of the campout another foot was almost sheared off and a third had started. The feet them selves are fine, it is the thin ribbon that connects the feet to the tent that is the problem.

Really to be all honest about this movie, I really hated to even give it 1 star, yes, it was that bad. It was so boring I wouldn't even advise putting it in to go to sleep on.

Herman Broder (Ron Silver) is a Polish Jew living in Coney Island after the Holocaust. It is 4 years after the end of WWII and he works as a writer and has a wife whom he wed because she protected him from the Nazis. Meanwhile, he's enjoying the company of another woman during 'business trips' when he finds out personally that his original wife thought to have been killed by Nazis is alive and in New York!! It sounds so absurd that you might think this movie is a comedy, but it's not. There are funny moments, but throughout this movie you will become wrapped up in the very serious moral dilemma of a man married to two women while he's in love with another and the conflicting emotions that all of the characters feel and experience. All of this is brought in a suffocated, sarcastic, sweaty manner, that you feel his suffering. It's really not a movie that I'd recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enemies -Review","review":"Great Movie - Set in post WW2 New York but highly relevant to todays age of complex relationships - deals with the classic problem of multiple relationships and provides deep psychological insights we can all relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie.

The author uses special characters, terms, etc. that are not previously defined, and assumes a basic understanding of programming.

He shows how this is harder than just writing PHP to make 1 HTML page. Now you have many pages. Probably divided into various thematic groups.Of those groups, or tasks, he gives examples. Like hooking to a back end database. He chooses MySQL for the latter. Or, how to impose a membership system, with passwords and members-only pages. Plus, how to add a shopping cart and various payment scripts. And he shows quickly how a content management system might be used, so that visitors can read and write content.However, the book's coverage of Web Services is very rudimentary.

Overall it was an entertaining read and good way to spend a weekend. Happy Reading!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Babbling and Boring !!!","review":"I read Blinded by Stephen White and liked it. This book however left me wanting from page one!! The characters are uninteresting; and the author introduces new evidence and characters that are dull and have nothing to do with the story. The story itself is so Convoluted that I soon just started reading the dialog, hoping that it would \`get better' or finally be worth reading. At the mid-way point I gave that up too!!! And just read the ending, something I have never done before. My advice would be to skip this book it's not worth your time or mine.

Meanwhile, a woman is killed in his colleague's office. Later, this same colleague goes missing. All of this makes for a convoluted story that is at times hard to follow. Gregory is continually conflicted about disclosing patient information as he tries to help find the girl and his colleague. The book failed to hold my interest in its entirety. As the story progressed, I found it to be continually harder to follow, and I also found myself not trying very hard to follow it. I've read other novels by Stephen White, and I don't find him to be an effective or engaging story teller. I would pass on this novel.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standard","review":"I have read all of the Alan Gregory books in order and always look forward to the next one. This was a terrible disappointment. All the talk about the \\"other girl\\" and his ethics were boring after the first time they were mentioned. I was interested in the plot but this book could have been 200 pages instead of almost 400. I also got tired of what he was thinking...move on to the plot.

Psychologist Gregory treated her parents for one session years earlier. Also missing is his colleague Diane Estevez who disappeared in Las Vegas when she went to for Mallory's schizophrenic mother.There are several plotlines working in this novel starting with the death of Hannah Grant, a friend and colleague of Diane and Alan. It keeps things interesting, but at the some time you really have to pay attention because the story can get confusing. Alan is a fascinating character dealing with the fine line of doctor /patient confidentiality when Diane goes missing. I have loved several of Stephen White's books. This one is not my favorite, but it is still very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong page turner","review":"I have a bit of a problem with novels that have psychologists as their protagonists. Sure a psychologist probably hears stories on a daily basis that would be the basis for a terrific novel, but how do you make them the center of a true mystery. Cops, coroners, detectives and crime lab specialists are all integral parts of most crimes but not a psychologist. That is why I have a bit of a problem with the Alan Gregorys and the Alex Delawares of the ficitonal world but I've got to admit I enjoy their stories. It's just how do those guys get caught up in so many fascinating mysteries? This is only my second Stephen White novel. I truly enjoyed the \\"Best Revenge\\", but the writing in this work comes off quite a bit more solid. As is often the case with this genre, when it comes to wrap everything up it feels a bit rushed but there are enough twists fascinating enough characters and a couple of red herrings thrown in to make this a strong beach novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get out of Town","review":"After reading nine of Stephen White's novels, I'm on my way to reading the series. I especially liked getting out of town with the interesting, familiar (but never boring) cast to solve this crime mystery.

I laughed, cried and stayed up all night and I was always entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Therapist / patient confidentiality ethics lesson","review":"I listened to the audio book narrated by Dick Hill who is one of my favorites. As usual the naration was superb by Mr. Hill. It almost made this book palatable but the neverending and obsessive preaching about ethics and patient confidentiality was way beyond tiresome.

It may be an artists rendering but is not accurate as to how the interior of the Toy Box appeared.However, John Glatt does a very good job in regard to the background of the individuals involved inthe crimes committed in this case. His coverage of the trials wold have been more in depth and accurate had he been at the actual trials in New Mexico.The only postscript I would add is that the New Mexico Court of Appeals denied the appeals filed by David Ray's attorney in March / April of 2002.

This movie is a complete waste of time with a storyline that was frustrating to follow. The only thing I got from this movie is that once you rise from poverty into riches and fame, you become shallow. Oh and Billy Dee William's character was an insecure loser of a man who was also a wannabe alderman. Far as I gathered, Billy Dee Williams was a slacker who wasn't seen as such because he was always running for office -and losing. Of course Diana Ross's character made Billy Dee William's character feel insecure about her success because he was insecure. Somehow, she was to blame for his own insecurities and the only viable solution this film offered was for Diana Ross to get off her high horse and worship this loser as if he were the King of Zamunda for no other reason than --love.

Diana Ross and Billy Dee Williams!!! This film is filled with so many internal and emotional struggles and battles. Ultimately, it is about finding where you belong in life and who you will share it with and walk together. There is also a lesson to be learned that money, fame and fortune are nothing, if you have no one to share them with. Beautiful film. Anthony Perkins (R.I.P.) was great in this film too. I still watch this dvd. This film is multi-generational too. My teenage daughters (ages 18 and 19) love it. The song for the film is \\"breath-taking\\".

As a guitar and mandolin player I found the jams on Elko to be flat, the fiddle (exuse me, violin)sounds way to spacey for me and I didn't particularly like the whole mix. It just seems to be missing some of the urgency of a live show.

I must admit that the first time I used it, I didn't put in the right amount of water, too much, and it did bubble up and out. bummer. However, I discovered clean up was super easy, much better than my previous cooker.Vegetables turn out evenly cooked, just remember not to overload the basket.I cook for one, it's nice to have this streamer to make portions that serve both dinner and leftovers for my lunch box. If you use a larger utensil to cook in, the result is food evenly cooked and the seasoning is uniform, and only one pot to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"fairly nice rice cooker","review":"It's convenient to cook and steam at the same time.

Had it a few years now and it still works fine other that the lock for the lid broke after a couple years. The rice turns out fine but it takes a little long. Don't use the \\"warm\\" feature because it will just burn your rice on the bottom. Its biggest flaw is it's a pain to clean. Cooking makes a mess of the whole appliance. You have to break out a screw driver to remove the lid and clean it properly. If i had to do it again I'd return it for a product with a removable dishwasher safe lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"This cooker disappointed.

I have used this rice cooker several times now and we are going to give it away to charity. Here is why:1) The horribly loud beeping sound when the rice is done. If you have kids napping close by, they will be woken up. If you are next to the rice cooker when the beeper goes off, you will have to cover your ears. And guess what- There is no way to turn this off! And there is no volume option for it either. It's truly an awful sound and it goes on for about 10 seconds.2) This rice cooker is really only made for large quantities of rice. If you put in one cup of dry rice, good luck getting the proportion of water right. I dumped in 4 cups of water and it still did not cook the rice all the way. It only works correctly with 2 or more cups of dry rice.The rice cooker also feels cheaply made. Very flimsy plastic all around. I do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with item.","review":"So far so good. I don't have any problems but will let you know if something changes.

I recently moved and unfortunately had to put most of my kitchen stuff in storage. Buying this makes me not miss most of it. I still miss my plates and silverware, but this single-handedly replaced several kitchen items. Makes the best omlette ever. Reheats leftovers much better than a microwave. I frankly may never have a microwave again after using this to reheat last night's chicken. So much better than the micro. Undoubtedly the best thing I ever put in my kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rice Cooker","review":"I have cooked brown basmati rice in this three times and it has turned out yummy each time.

Ever since I moved out of parents' home into living by myself, this has definitely helped me not have to eat packet noodles each night! The rice comes out very tender and with lots of flavor, especially with brown rice. You can make portions for big groups or just for yourself.

It's way overrated! The biggest issue with this cooker is that it burns the rice at the bottom if you put it in WARM MODE over night. All my rice was burn and became uneatable. My previous Japanese Made Tiger Rice cooker was much more simple and functional. It cooked and KEPT THE RICE warm for DAYS!This cooker I have to turn it off completely to prevent rice burn, and then I have to turn it to WARM MODE 1 hour before my meal to make sure my rice is warm and ready to be eaten. When I do that, I have to finish all my cooked rice in about three meals as leaving it cold over a period of couple days makes it go stale due to the condensation build up inside.It's very inconvenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"I needed to have the ability to cook a lot of rice for a dinner and bought this thinking it would do the trick.

I grew up in a Korean household with expensive rice cookers, so I'm used to warm, well-cooked rice being a no-brainier. I'm not too happy with how this one bubbles large amounts of gross rice water out the top, and how it overcooks the rice at the bottom every time. The keep warm function basically continues to cook the rice, so it's useless unless you want some crispy rice snacks. The inner rice bowl is NOT dishwasher safe... mine got weirdly discolored and warped when I put it in the dishwasher (I probably should have known better since it's a non-stick surface inside). It's at least easier than cooking rice on the stove, so I think it was worth the $40, but have to give it a bad review bc it pretty much sucks in every other way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless as a Vegetable Steamer, Food falls right through!","review":"I got this steamer for Christmas and was planning to use it for a vegetable steamer.

The manual has directions for vegetables like green beans, peas etc. but they fall right through the holes. What idiot designed this?

It overcooks some of the rice at the bottom of the container around the outside edge in toward the center about 3/4 of an inch. This overcooked ring of rice is not eatable. The bulk of the rice is well cooked, of nice texture and very good. The dog enjoys the overcooked rice but we don't.This cooker also puddles some water on the outside top of the cooker. I tried increasing the water to the rice but that didn't help much with the rice but increased the size of the puddle on top. I would not buy this unit again if I had know of these problems.This cooker keeps the rice warm and in good condition for a very long time after the cooking cycle. This steamer is easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"White rice only!!","review":"I love rice, and I eat all different kinds of rice - basmati, jasmine, brown...

This is just a mediocre appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as expected","review":"We've had this rice cooker for about a year. A couple of things that bother me is that you can't just pop loose the top aluminum cover to clean, like some of the other rice cookers. You have to unscrew the hinge of the whole top assembly, which is very bothersome because you have to keep track of the screws, etc.The other thing that I don't like is that the inside pot is not round, where one would expect -- you have to turn it a few times to fit it and drop in. It's like oval-shaped. And this I didn't realize until much much later. I kept having trouble inserting the pot, and I didn't know why for a while until I realized it wasn't perfectly round -- I couldn't believe it!update: after two years the rice doesn't cook thoroughly. And the non-stick pot is in bad shape. Never had this kind of problem with Japanese rice cookers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aroma ARC 838 TC rice cooker review","review":"Worst appliance I have.

I don't cook with anything plastic which could leach into food. If you're not concerned about that, maybe you'll be happy with this rice cooker. The basket for steaming is made of very light plastic, the seal around the inside of the lid is made of a very light, delicate looking material, and the steam escape valve inside the lid is plastic. My old bottom-of-the-line rice cooker was glass and metal. I guess I need to get another one of those!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice cooker, but scorches rice after a while","review":"It does it's job very well. It cooks the rice nicely BUT if you leave it on warm for too long it will begin to scorch the bottom of the rice. I personally don't mind a little scorching because it adds texture but I can see how this will annoy people. That's why I gave it 4 stars because of the scorching. If you want to use the warming function to its full effect, you really can't because it begins to scorch the rice. Also, if it's warming for a while it starts to make this weird clicking noise. I hope it doesn't indicate any problems in the future.It's a well thought out design. I really like the steamer tray and the condensation reservoir. It comes with a miniature ladle and a rice paddle. The price is very good and the overall package is a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"At first I was ecstatic because this rice cooker had an off button and a chimer to let you know when your rice is done, but with the first use, it was NOT worth the money. It takes 45min to cook the rice. Even after rice is fully cooked the chimer didn't go off until an extra 10min later. It also does NOT have a chime but a beep. It beeps a really loud annoying beep. That is not a chime. It also is supposed to keep your rice warm, the warmer only cooks the rice further into a crisp. Within 4-5 hrs. Your rice is extra crispy on the outside and soupy on the inside. Waste of money. Waste of expensive Jasmine rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"If you are looking for a good rice cooker...don't buy this one!!!!!

It is no larger than most rice cookers, but is does a lot more work. The pan removes easily and is also easy to clean - an absolute must in my book.

I tried to put this thing back myself and was unsuccessful. At the same time I noticed that the bottom has some sign of using. Apparently someone returned it before and Amazon just shipped to me without even taking a look at it! I have been satisfied with Amazon all the time but was disappointed this time really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work reliably","review":"There must be some sort of quality control issue with these units, I'm in the same situation as the others who are reporting that the cooker doesn't always cook the rice properly. I've had the unit for about 8 months. In my case, 1 in 10 uses yields a \\"done\\" alarm and the unit goes into warm mode but the rice has barely started cooking and the cooker is still full of water. All you can do then is trash the rice and make another batch. I'm going to end up having to buy another unit and doubt I'll go with the Aroma next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased this rice cooker mainly to cut down on the time required keeping track of brown rice. Not only does it not save any time or hassle, it doesn't even do white rice well. Regardless of ratio of rice to water, setting etc. the rice (white and brown) always ends up sticking or burning and usually undercooked until I add more water and try to bring it back to an edible state. The company has been totally unresponsive to several attempts to figure out why this piece of junk doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"I'm surprised at all the positive reviews. This rice cooker consistently over cooks rice, even if you take the cooked rice out of the cooker as soon as it is done. If you leave the rice in there after it's cooked (when it's supposed to keep it warm), the rice continues to cook and forms a crust. Without a clear plastic lid, you also can't see anything, which I think is less than ideal for e.g. vegetables. All in all, I wish I'd gotten something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last very long!!","review":"Our old rice cooker quit working so, we bought the Aroma 8 cup at Target.

My husband tried to fix it and checked all the electrical pieces of the machine and couldn't find out why it just stopped working. When it did work it was a really nice rice cooker. The pan was really easy to clean and the digital buttons were nice. It even had a delayed cook time on it...I just wish it had last longer the it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Favorite Small Appliance","review":"We have owned this rice cooker for over four years and it is still going strong. It is great for making white and brown rice as well as Quinua.

It does an amazing job with any type of rice used, whether you buy the cheapest rice or the most expensive, you will get perfect rice every time. The steamer basket works amazingly well too. We use this as a rice cooker the most, but also as a steamer for dumplings and produce. I love the delay timer option too. It's very easy to clean, doesn't scratch easily and stores nicely on the counter. The rice never sticks on the inside like with most rice cookers. I've purchased three of these now, one for me and two for gifts. Every single one has been a huge hit for people who use rice cookers or want a good steamer. This makes cooking dinner so much more efficient and tasty. I highly recommend this product to anyone - you can fool your friends into thinking you spent hours on something so simple and easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing rice-cooker / steamer!","review":"My family and I recently became vegan.

So far I am blown away. My wife and I use it several times per week, we make huge portions of rice in it and steam our veggies at the same time! The steamed veggies above the cooking rice actually rive an awesome taste to the finished product! Oh, the timer feature is great. We put the stuff inside at night and set it to cook an hour before I leave to work. I get some freshly cooked rice and veggies to take to work for lunch.We're a couple of happy vegans thanks to the Aroma!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooks rice perfect every time","review":"I have used this to cook rice many times now and it cooks the rice perfectly every time. Even if you aren't very careful measuring the rice to water ratio the rice always seems to come out perfect. Also the removable bowl the rice cooks in makes for easy cleaning, so its not a hassle to use. My only frustration has been that there is no indicator of when the rice will be done, some sort of countdown timer would be nice.

I washed the entire unit, including the insert, when it arrived and before I used it to cook. I hand-dried the insert and it snapped in my hand (and, no, I'm not the Incredible Hulk), resulting in a crack on one side. Pretty flimsy material. It's still usable, but the insert should be sturdier than it is. Since I'll probably seldom use it, it's not a huge deal, but it is a negative attribute, which is why I'm giving it four rather than five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Makes Rice","review":"This thing definitely makes rice; I have to say that up front. The manual is also really useful, giving exact measurements for water to rice ratios for many different kinds of rice. On the downside, it takes a considerable amount of time to get the job done, although I'm not sure that can be avoided. Also, make sure that you don't put it underneath a low-hanging surface, like a cabinent. The exhaust will collect on the surface and eventually make it sticky.We were really on the fence about buying this rice cooker, and there were a lot of options out there, but we're definitely happy with this one at the end of the day.

I read all the reviews before purchasing this, and have made a few adjustments on my cooking with it, first of all I'm lucky to have a nice counter spot to put this so that the steam doesn't damage anything above me, especially since depending on the type of rice and the amount you will get lots of steam. Second thing I do, is since so many people complain about the very, very thin layer of brown on the bottom of the rice after being cooked, I just open the top about 15-20 minutes in for most white rice types, and 35-40 minutes in for brown rice and give a super quick stir. This has basically eliminated this problem, and has only added a minute or 2 to the cooking of the rice. I have yet to make a batch of rice that didn't come out as expected.

I purchased it at Target for only $[...]. I LOVE it. It's very easy to use and delivers perfect rice in 30-40 minutes. All I did was follow the instructions. It was my first time ever making Onigiri with Japanese rice. They came out just like the onigiri I see in stores and Japanese pictures.The only negative I could possibly say is that when you use the steam function while cooking your rice then it might get discolored. I had shanghai pork dumplings on the top tier while my white rice was cooking on the bottom. Because of the dumplings, liquids dripped down from the top container and caused some discoloration to some of the rice. Because of this, my Onigiri had a spot or two on them. If you want picture perfect sticky rice, them be careful of cooking rice and steaming something else at the same time. On the other hand, the rice came out great so it was only a minor cosmetic mishap.Great buy though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE this rice cooker!","review":"I had a rice cooker when I bought this. I wanted a bigger one, but the smaller one worked fine. Unfortunately, since I got a new one, I donated the old one. Man oh man, I wish I'd have kept it. This thing doesn't know how to cook rice. Tonight was the last straw with it... I cooked one cup of brown rice, added over 3 cups of coconut water (more than I ever had to use with my previous rice cooker), and an hour later, it was still el dente. Neither my husband or I like crunchy rice. I'm done with this thing and shopping for a new one.

There is really only one button that you need to push. That is it. There is no need for special measurements - just scoop the rice in, fill the water to the appropriate line, and start it. You can steam vegetables in it.One of the Negatives I have noticed is the loud beeping when it is done. Ten loud beeps is a little overkill. Also, additional controls may be nice for someone wanting to do a little more for timing, etc.You will like this if you just want an easy way to cook perfect rice every time.You won't like this if you already have a way to magically cook the rice without boiling over, burning the bottom, getting soggy, etc. If you can do that, this may just be another appliance to move around your kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"WOW, what a nice product. Within the first hour of it's arrival, I had to see if I could screw it up somehow as I would either under cook or over cook my rice. The very first use of this cooker boasted a very nice texture of rice. I cannot wait to continue making rice in the future.

It open the door to Williams' use choral motifs so effectively in Star Wars Episode One's Duel of the Fates.McNeely follows Williams' habit of drawing upon the compositions of Shostokovich and other Russian composers of the late 19th and early- to mid-20th century. In particular, the distinctive waltz theme in The Seduction of Leia is drawn directly from Aram Khachaturian's Masquerade: Waltz & Mazurka. This is a well-established tradition, enjoyed by most of the film composers of the last 50 years.A welcome addition to the Star Wars canon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to the Star Wars Universe, with a twist","review":"Ever wished you could enter and explore the world of the Star Wars characters all over again? With the Shadows of the Empire soundtrack, you can get just a tad bit closer before the prequels are released...Joel McNeely offers up a mixed bag of musical treatments on events and characters taken from the novel, and the results are interesting...McNeely's musical style clearly differs from John Williams, though it's obvious that parts of Williams work served as inspiration. Play the CD after listening to the Special Edition Soundtracks and there is an obvious change in composition and style...but it still works. While this is definitely orchestral music and suites, <obviously NOT from a movie>, in some sections I would have to say McNeely does rival some of Williams original music...particularly the powerful \\"Night Skys\\", based on Williams work.A must have to the Star Wars aficianados collection..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is an awful soundtrack.

I liked the end of the CD with it's triumphal fanfare, the music is very dark but sometimes doesn't respects the original Star Wars's style, I feel that this one uses to much the chorus, almost abuses of it, and still doesn't reach the beauty of Duel of the Fates."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"I've installed two of these in the last few days.

First, the thermostat will simply not operate with a \\"low battery\\" warning. This will leave one without heat in the winter if the batteries fail at the wrong moment. Second, the unit will not allow temperature settings below 45 degrees Fahrenheit. This increases energy costs in the case where a 40 degree setting (for example) is desired to simply prevent freezing. With the combination of these two flaws, it would be risky to leave a home unattended for any period of time in cold weather.It would be helpful if Hunter listed real specifications instead of marketing happy-talk such as \\"digital accuracy\\", \\"Up to 15% Savings On Energy Costs\\", etc. I suspect the other Hunter digital thermostats have the same flaws but there's no way to know until a unit is installed as neither Hunter (on its web site) nor Amazon provide this kind of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunter Thermostat","review":"Need this to apply to my RV.

Hank blunders around his ranch, barking at the mailman (you never know what those guys are up to), \\"investigating\\" murders (burp), and getting yelled at by Sally May.

At first it did not bother us, but at other times, the music was to the point where it distracted us from the story. Would have been better with NO background. We persisted with the CD - Hank is indeed a fun character for old and young alike - and then the coyotes were introduced. I do not think my kids picked up on on it, but it brought back recollections of denigrating portrayals of Native Americans. The word choice and intonation came across as condescending.

For example the sorceress Calypso in the Odessey was said to be the daughterof King Atlas of Atlantis and there was explicit information there about how she cast her spells. His scholarshipis impressive and wide ranging and he comes up with alot of really interesting information that is based on morethan just, for example, channeling psychic information from a former incarnation on Atlantis.

Maybe it's the rage or maybe it's the fact that they are clearly giving a big F.U. to the whole emo and oversaturated metalcore scenes that are going on right now whatever \\"It\\" is that makes true metalheads fall in love with a band and support them till death these guys definitely have it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4.0 Like Slayer?","review":"Good stuff! great thrash record! when it starts, you will think you are listening to Slayer..

I expected to watch only a few minutes, but as a former teacher I was drawn into this film by the dramatic beginning and the wonderful acting by the children and Monsieur Lazhar. This is not a light and frilly film. It brings you quickly into the minds and feelings of a wide range of people while exploring the cultural and emotional differences that make schools such interesting places. The audience is methodically burdened with a charged school environment and then brought to a clear, if not, resolution.

It's heartwarming, yet simple. But maybe not so simple, because the teacher, Mr Lazhar, is anything but predictable in his interaction with not only the children, but adults too.

Most of it is talking heads going on and on about this designer or that trend. The blurb indicated that it would deal with Edith Head, costumes in film,etc. That takes up about ten minutes, and it merely shows a photo of Ms. Head. It doesn't deal with the iconic elements of her designs. The rest looks like those MTV fillers where actors and unrecognizable \\"fasion experts\\" give their preferences and opinions. I showed it to my film class and was embarrassed by the lack of information and the vapid way in which it was delivered. I wanted to fast forward through the first 30 minutes, but I kept hoping it would get better. There have to be better movies about costumes and fashion in film.

This one, with its \\"Commandments\\" and its friendly text, it could perhaps be compared to the Artist's Way books, but this substantial book is full of pictures and little eating tips (not fancy intimidating recipes, but useful ones, and general advice). I relied heavily on this book and her Sensuality of Strength when I first got into weight training over 20 years ago, and I still enjoy the sport, although I don't have as much time for it any more. I think her work makes fitness more enjoyable, and enjoying fitness is the key to keeping it up.

Instead, Z.T. and Zack do a kind of mopey nostalgia dance around each other while not-so-pleasant things happen to the people in Z.T.'s life.This is a cautionary \\"carpe diem\\" tale about how life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans (to quote John Lennon), but it would have been better had Z.T./Zack been just a little less self-absorbed and just a little more interested in the people he/they value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best devotional Bible ever!","review":"This was my first bible 15 years ago.

Considering the band's brief-but-turbulent tenure, and that this covers two wildly divergent LPs, it's remarkable how well it holds up as a cohesive album. The first four tracks consist of the band's first two pre-LP singles and B-sides (the respective A-sides were re-recorded for CROSSING THE RED SEA); the CD progresses chronologically through the last B-side, the perfectly dolorous 'I Will Walk You Home', which is also the last track on the mischievously maligned, beleaguered CAST OF THOUSANDS LP. The only complaint I have about this particular collection is directed toward the truncated A-side version of the wonderful 'Cast Of Thousands', but hey- -it says right on the front that it's a singles collection and not a best-of. Wish they'd recorded another seven or so singles, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious and fun!","review":"My 2-year-old daughter loves this book so much that she keeps bringing it to me and simply says \\"Parts\\". This is a pretty gross book in a sense of the stuff this poor kid imagines is happening to him [he thinks he is coming apart through various bodily emissions/functions], like losing a tooth, lint in the bellybutton, you get the idea. Reading the other reviews, the consensus seems to be that kids love this book, and I guess Tedd Arnold deserves kudos for being able to tap into what appeals to kids and turning out a winning book. The illustrations are simple, yet cute despite the gross factor. The text doesn't exactly follow rhyming conventions but it works, and has a sing-songy flow to it. The fact that my little one loves it makes it a winner in my book too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worry no more!","review":"This book is humorous, informative and flows well. At times it's a little gross but it's a delightful way of teaching children the \\"normal\\" functions of their little bodies at a level they can understand. As adults how many of us expect the worse from our ailments? I wish there was a book like this for us! How many times have we had the medical books out like the boy in this book. I saw this in a book store and flipped through it. After getting it from our local library I knew I had to buy it for one of the many children in my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutest and best educational book for little ones.","review":"I got this book for my grandkids.

Recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parts (of the body)","review":"This book is a delightful one to have in the house in case you have small visitors. It is fun to read to them and watch the expressions on their faces. A friend introduced me to the book that she had purchased for her grandchildren and they take it out first thing when they come to visit. Now mine do the same.As you read along, the little boy learns about all the different parts of the body that we lose. He begins to wonder if he is going to have everything fall off or get lost. It is, as I said, amusing to watch the expressions on the children's faces as you read and they begin to wonder, as well. The dialogue is presented in an interesting way and it is a good way to open up discussions and answer questions that children might not think to ask otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start to a wonderful series","review":"This book and the others in the series are just fascinating to my four year old grandson. Both the story and illustrations are geared to that wonderful age."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Teacher's Perspective","review":"In this book, a boy is confused about his body. He finds belly button lint, sees a grey mass fall out of his nose, and his tooth was loose. The boy began to panic thinking that is body was falling apart. His parents reassured him that it was all normal.Parts is a great book because it has the \\"gross factor.\\" My children are fascinated by boogers and \\"raisin toes\\" so I believe this book will intrigue almost every young child.In the classroom, I would use this book as an opener for a human body unit. Encouraging children to research fascinating human body facts would be a great activity after reading this book. In addition, a KWL chart, gathering information children know, want to know, and learned from the experience would be a great extension idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"from a Mom of 5 boys","review":"This book could not be more perfect for little boys (heck, my middle and high school sons loved it, too)!

They all wanted to fully examine every image.This book is guaranteed loads of giggles from your aduience, as well as yourself. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilarious & entertaining book for kids!","review":"A little boy discovers several strange things that are happening with his body. It begins when he notices a few hairs in his comb. Next, he finds fuzz in his belly button and now he has a loose tooth! Piece by piece he imagines that he is falling apart. His parents clear up his misconceptions; but only after he spends many anxious moments worrying and imagining what piece of his body will fall apart next. Children will love the colorful and hilarious illustrations in this book. I like the book because I think children can relate to the little boy's fears and his feelings of relief when he realized he was NORMAL!Note to Teachers: This would be a great \\"ice-breaker\\" book to read to students at the beginning of the school year or when you do your \\"ME\\" unit. This book can be used to remind children that a lack of information can many times lead to misconceptions and needless worry. This should encourage students to ask questions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top choice of library summer readers.","review":"I read this book to children ranging in age from 4years-6th grade for a summer reading program at our library and it was loved by all.

In \\"One Peace\\" he highlights people and organizations that are doing something about these problems--nonprofits like The Miracle Foundation and A Glimmer of Hope, people like Willie Nelson. Each segment tells a story, and while the movie covers some very serious topics, at the end the viewer is left feeling hopeful and inspired and ready to go out and do something good in the world themselves. It's appropriate for children - even my 8 year old daughter got something out of it. We saw it last Summer and she still talks about it a year later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting History, Not so Interesting Editorial","review":"David Banks does a masterful job of telling the story of the internal battle between Windows and Internet Explorer. It is insightful story over the struggle for strategy. Written in the tradition of the Wall Street Journal Bank's paints colorful vignettes of the key personalities and imbues the struggle between these two groups with drama.However one of the interesting ironies of the business press is that journalists confuse themselves with their subjects. (I know of very few who went from covering a beat to running a company.) Unfortunately the more famous the publication you write for, the less you seem to remember that. This book simply fails when Banks puts on this business analyst hat. Luckily when you hear the scraping of the soapbox those pages are few and can be easily skimmed.If you're interested in an internal history of Microsoft during the browser wars, buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing overall","review":"Overall, I was a bit disappointed with the lack of facts in this book. The author does a very good job narrating a story about the main characters, but the book could have done with significantly less editorializing.

She was not born a singer,she has worked at it, and it shows.Her renditions of \\"Dancing On the Ceiling\\",\\"If Love Were All\\",and \\"Once You Lose Your Heart\\"are sheer magic.Twiggy has done country,rock,and other styles of music.This is but one fine example of a lovely lilting voice that will charm you with a wide range of songs that come from a wide range of London musicals. \\"On My Own\\" is superb.Twiggy has proven herself to be far more than a 60s icon. She is a fine actress and this album is proof that she is a very fine singer. Like show tunes? Then buy this CD, you will enjoy the wide array of fine songs by a very fine artist.She sings from her heart and that makes this album such a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the ** BEST **","review":"As a veteran of the Vietnam war, I was riveted to each and every page.

The black filter shown in the photograph may not be what is sold this year. They are selling a yellow painted filter using a Champion Laboratories \\"Eco\\" design. A quality oil filter has a metal interior with holes to allow the oil to flow through it. This metal cyclinder supports the paper filter element. The \\"eco\\" design uses a plastic grid with large openings. This does not fully support the filter and allows pieces of the filer element to pass into the engine. This naturally causes blockages which leads to engine failure. If you want a quality oil filter for your Kohler engine, use a Purolator L10241 (or PL10241) or the Wix 51348 as substitutes for this filter. The Champion Laboratores \\"Eco\\" design is probably worse than a Fram oil filter.

I was amazed when I received the package that something so small could be a camera. The pictures were of superb quality. You can choose two sizes, and either one is great. I find the larger size to be the perfect wallpaper kind. It comes with a pouch and a wrist strap so you can just hang it around your neck, or put it in your pocket.

I loved it and can't wait for the next book to be published......HURRY UP!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange is Great","review":"The best book I have ever read; It is also the best mystery-thriller I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds similar but falls short of haunting","review":"I missed any mention that they were getting together and making a new album. I am a big fan 30+ years. I even liked some of Annie's solo work. With these great orchestrations it just seems to miss the mark. Not sure why, its not haunting no songs stick in your head that you want to listen to over and over. Maybe over produced or they were striving TOO hard to sound like they did. Oh well, glad I bought if even though it will end up in my collection only to be shown to friends who didn't know about it.Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Thousand Roses, indeed","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this CD. For any Annie Haslam and Renaissance fan a recording of this caliber is a long time coming. Annie's voice is as true as ever and the songs and musicianship far exceeded my greatest expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a mellow pop album","review":"If you are looking for classical passages that inspired their music in the 70's, forget it. In fact, there is only ONE SONG with an instrumental passage (One Thousand Roses) and it is not very long.The direction of this album picks up from their 80's work. I would compare this to \\"Songs From Renaissance Days.\\" This is closer to an Annie Haslam solo album. If you like that, then you will like this. But this is far from \\"Turn Of The Cards\\" or even \\"A Song For All Seasons.\\"And this time, we can't blame Jon Camp!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The things I did in the 70's","review":"Used to love listening to this band back in the 70's Listening to them now makes me realized just how stoned we all were.

Her voice still sounds the same, but I think I must of outgrown the sound, the music didn't flow well, not the same astheir classic \\"Jeckle & Hyde\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting melodies","review":"I love Bernard Herrmann's haunting melodies. Here he takes a few themes and intertwines them and weaves them into a hypnotic masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential part of the film's story line","review":"Many consider Herrmann's musical contribution to the classic Hitchcock film to be the third \\"star\\" behind leads Stewart and Novak. Who am I to dispute that?Almost every scene is filled with the lush strings and ominous chord arrangements of which Herrmann is noted. Of course, the central theme is repeated or restructured but that only serves to support its importance.Herrmann knew how to musically tell a story. His passages reflect the on-screen action; they alternate from extremely subdued to blaringly threatening. Very few film composers had (or have) his knack for adding \\"color\\" to the filmed images.\\"Vertigo\\" is one of Sir Alfred's most personal films, and the Herrmmann scores remains one of that musician's most dynamic undertakings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly remarkable","review":"Beware Hermann fans, for once you listen to this, you will be hooked. All of his tracks are excellent and all have been digitally remastered in stereo. What more could you want. On a sour note, one track was too badly damaged to be included, but it can be found on the re recorded CD. Buy this now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving accounts of dying people who accelerated their ends","review":"This book preceeded the textbook on euthanasia, Final Exit,and is different in that it relates true stories of dyingpeople and exactly how they took their lives to escapeprolonged suffering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipe for tragedy...","review":"This book is an ode to death; a manual for self-deliverance, even for those who are not terminally ill it offers some very lucrative suggestions. One year ago my friend took his own life, he was only 32 yrs. old with no terminal illness. He had mentioned Derek Humphrey's methods as very \\"cool ideas\\". So, if you or someone you know would like the easy way out, then definetly read this book. If you would like to live a while longer and offer hope to those suffering rather than the quickest exit possible, you may want to choose a more uplifting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Me Die Before I Wake","review":"My Mother was a paranoid schizophrenic.

Mr. Humphry, why don't you try being a man and follow through on some of the sick advice you are dispensing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still makes me cry","review":"This movie is so powerful. I have watched it over 20 times and I still cry. I spent a semester doing extensive study on the holocaust and this movie really captured hope and love which were still present in this tragic time of our world."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIFE IS MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL AFTER WATCHING THIS","review":"I was at first very undecided about watching this movie, because I had to read the spoken parts throughout. After watching about the first 3 minutes of this movie, it was absolutly no hinderence on me at all. Actually in a way you had to pay more attention to this movie.However, paying attention to this movie was no problem. Roberto was great. He really does an EXCELLENT job throughout this movie. So does his wife in this movie. There are many parts throughout this movie that are very very sad, however this is the underlying humor and love for this child that you can sense throughout this movie. This is a MUST WATCH MOVIE. I would reccomend this movie to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm amazed","review":"I'm amazed at how many high marks this movie has been given. I could tolerate about 30 minutes of it before turning it off. I felt that the acting was second rate, the actor's line were idiotic and unrealistic, and if my dad talked the way this dad did in the movie to his child, I would have avoided him at all cost if I were the child.Just because this tells a story of Jewish people having to deal with Nazi death camps, it doesn't mean it has any real value to it. Save your money and get something that is more realistic and not as corny as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This movie stunk big time. The main character was a babbling idiot. The details of the movie itself were historically inaccurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swill","review":"Anyone who has actually studied Holocaust history would be appalled by this flippant, impoverished, and manipulative film. Those of you singing its praises would do well to read \\"Masters of Death: the SS Einsatzgruppen and the Invention of the Holocaust\\" by Richard Rhodes or \\"The Nazi Doctors\\" by Robert Jay Lifton--both of which accurately and devastatingly depict camp conditions, torture, and mass executions. There are no jokes to be mined from this history. To find humor in it would require revision if not denial of the truth--which is what \\"Life is Beautiful\\" is all about. Doubtless, not a single champion of this film is a Holocaust survivor nor a serious reader of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gross abomination.","review":"I don't know what is more dismaying: the fraudulent film itself or the saccharine outpouring of praise that it so widely enjoys. The rank kitsch of \\"Life is Beautiful\\" lies essentially in its basic mendacious premise that perversely sentimental optimism can -- and, thus, should -- survive the soul-grinding, hope-crushing, and dehumanizing conditions of a death camp. Benigni has perpetrated an unconscionable whitewash."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreal","review":"Saw this one on television. Scenery and costuming are pretty good. But overall I really don't care for it. There really is nothing funning about the Holocost. Indeed the scene best showing this is when the child of the main character is briefly lead away by an Aufseherin. She is wearing a starched clean white nanny apron over her uniform complete with black boots, her face devoid of warmth; which pretty much describes the reality of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a great movie at all","review":"I hope this movie is taken as a fairy tale about holocaust. This movie tries to uplift the topic of holocaust. It's too depressing right? Let's then involve benini and he will lighten up our heavy hearts! It is insulting to people who had families in holocaust. I can asure everybody that children knew everything and were not spared cruelty of nazis. Only benini can create such a farce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nazi's are funny","review":"I never thought that a film about the horriable things that went on in germany could rasie a smile but these film did. It made me laugh so much I thought I was going to cry and made me cry so much I thought I was going to laugh.This little french guy is so good, and all the other jews made me feel proud that we won the war for them.2 thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont say you dont like it!!","review":"For the film critic from Canada, I find it interesting that you posted a review saying you loved this movie yet you discouraged someone with a different opinion from posting his review. What, is everyone's opinion supposed to be the same as yours? How boring! I agree that Roberto was begging for laughs, and begging to be loved. The whole first half of this movie was bizarre slapstick. Then it segued into a serious drama that to me was incredibly unconvincing. One can argue that this is a fantasy, but I believe the Holocaust deserves a more accurate portrait. The concentration camp reminded me of something built on a Hollywood backlot. I did find the ending to be surprising and effective, but what came before was merely average. For real humor (though dark), and an intense depiction of the horrors of the Holocaust, I would recommend Schindler's List. Life is Beautiful was just too cloying and scattered."},{"rating":"2","title":"and more ******","review":"Yes, I cried too.

However, I adored this movie, I watched it with a handful of friends and we all loved it (for reference we are between 18-21 yrs old). I absolutely loved it. It showed a fathers devotion to his family. However i did totally sob during the end of the movie. I hope you'll give this movie a chance. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie","review":"This is one of my favorite movies and am glad my seller got it to me so quickly and in such good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, amazing film","review":"I won't go in to specifics about this film's plot. I will, however, say it is great. Surley my favorite foriegn film and will die before watching this dubbed in English, like the Roberto Benigni Pinnochio film I couldn't stand to see it dubbed. I had to check on this DVD's info to make sure it was in Italian and it was. A great film from start to finish, inspiring and touching.I could watch this movie again and again and it probably wouldn't get old, less inspiring and less great.About the DVD's content, I'm not a nut over special features on a DVD so I say the DVD is fine. It's not like the picture is out of focus, the sound out of sync or anything like that. It was fine and most importantly not in English. That would simply be a disgrace.A great film for everyone, highly recommended.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"LIFE IS BEAUTIFULL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This film is truly a delicious film that makes you want to jump with joy. BRILLIANT! Ive read the other reviews and some i feel are way too politicaly correct! This film shouldint be looked at like that. I agree that the second part of the film is a Rather radical. Is it correct to make a comodie out of the Holocaust? But then this film is so life inspiring that one should ignore this. DONT LOOK AT THINGS SO NEGATIVELY!

In a world that is often controlled by hatred, lust, and jealosy, it isn't often that a movie bypasses all of life's troubles and focuses on what really matters. Roberto Benigni demonstrates the love that every father, and mother as well, should have for their children. He also teaches us that nomatter how many dead fish you find on your doorstep, you can always jump over them and keep smiling. I think if nothing else, everyone should have to see this movie to know what true love is all about. True love is giving all of oneself to the one you love. So, carpe diem and love unconditionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a beautiful life, and movie!!!","review":"Life is Beautiful enchanted me and my friends.

I have never seen such a great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal movie with a positive story of hope.","review":"Life Is Beautiful manipulates the magnificent language of Italian, together with a great cast to make it one of the best movies of all time. Lost in the story line, one is able to forget the subtitles and the horror of the World War II concentration camp and focus on the beauty of life. This film is a must see for all who love a little romance, combined with a little adventure and desire to remember what makes it true: Life is Beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal story of hope and courage!","review":"Wonderful movie! I was so relieved to watch a movie that portrayed reality. I am tired of going to movies full of sex and violence. This movie left me with a sense of peace and hope.

I highly recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"La Vita e Bella!!!","review":"This movie is not so much as a Holocaust movie as it is a love story, and an incredibly touching one at that. Therefore it can be fully and completely exonerated for not being \\"Schindler's List\\" (which, by the way, is not nearly as good as everyone thinks it is). What La Vita e Bella is is a story that restores hope in mankind; it says that even in the face of ultimate evil, love will always triumph. At the end of the film (\\"We won!\\"), I felt that Life is, indeed, beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in English as stated!","review":"This was a gift for my father who does not like subtitles so I purchased the copy that was supposed to voiced over in English- however it was not."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Kind Of Person Hates This Movie?","review":"I first want to say that I hope you find this review helpful, I want to say first that Chad needs to learn about GOOD Movies and Bad movies and giving this movie 1 star is just annoying. No way pal, if you hate this than don't post it.This is a beautiful portrait of a man who loves his family and doesn't want his child to live in horror. Nicoletta Braschi is amazingly beautiful in this movie and Roberto Benigni was just magnificent as Guido in this movie. He steals every scene with his comic actingI am also amazed by Mr. Benigni's skillful writing and sensitivity towards this issue. I want to say the score is magnificently beautifully done by Nicola Piovani. I hope that if anyone gets a film on Video and DVD it will be Life Is Beautiful. It is funny, sad, touching, romantic and everything in it.Watch for the many times he bumps into Nicoletta Braschi in this movie. That's all I have to say for now. I hope you will rent this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly incredible ...","review":"\\"Life Is Beautiful\\" is the tragic and poignant tale of Guido, an Italian Jew in a concentration camp with his small son. Guido creates a story to explain the horrors of the war and the camp by telling his son that the entire thing is a game to win a tank. His sacrifice is immense and Bengini acted superbly in this magnificent tale. The dubbed version and the subtitled version are both intense and amazing. Recommendations all around. The original Italian-language film won Oscars - for a reason. Absolutely wonderful and haunting. The images of war and the starvation and horrors of the Holocaust are not as severe as in \\"Schindler's List\\", for instance, but the film itself is brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't resist adding my 5 stars","review":"Don't be hesitant because this is a foreign film. It is a truly wonderful film, and this movie is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie of 1998","review":"Life is beautiful is a masterpeice. It is intelligant, humorous and deeply moving. Benigni is an absolute genius. Don't be turned off by the subtitles. I was reluctant to see it; but was happy to actually see a movie worthy of six dollars and two hours of my time. Unlike many movies that are released this is quality entertainment without the trash. See this movie. It will be worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Special Features","review":"I'm not happy with this edition, it's the cut edition re-edited by Roberto Benigni for the Acadamy Awards presentation, compared to the uncut italian Blu-ray which presents the original uncut version released for first italian release before the Academy awards. OK, Miramax hasn't got the rights for the italian cut, but the worst thing is the italian release has also a lot of extras, including the Academy Awards ceremony footage (such a footage had been recorded in USA) which is omitted in this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is Beautiful MOVIE","review":"The movie itself was great, the quality as the seller described was bad. It has scratches and skips on the best part of the whole movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I would not recommend this movie. Not homogeneous. Beginning and end belong to two different movies. Ok, the last scene was touching and some of the scenes were quite engaging but overall I did not enjoy it that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is beautiful everytime;if you know it's value","review":"A family's tragedy in Italy during German occupation is told by adding comical elements While exbiting the merciless of the German concentration camps during World War 2, the relation of a father and son is emphasized by the acting talent of the players. This subject has been the theme of many movies for many years. We can't see a different approached in this one. The things the father does for his son are not extraordinary. Every father can do the same things for his son. In my opinion Roberto Benigni as the director and performing the leading role stands out.He was very successful in making people smile and create a comedy and joy for life in spite of such gruesome conditions. Benigni has proved that an ordinary theme can be transformed into a successful movie by bringing an epic tale of love and the human spirit to the screen. The film by itself doesn't deserve the Oscar but Benigni's acting talent gets the reward."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most meaningful movie I have ever seen!","review":"I am reminded of the words of Leo Tolstoy: \\"The secret to being happy is to be...\\" \\"Life is Beautiful\\" is about living a passionately happy life which makes others see the beauty of it.

It only comes with subtitles in English and French. The movie is great though, the rating goes to the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not see unless you want your heart ripped out","review":"I'm in the minority of people who hard a very hard time with this movie. Yes, there was much that I appreciated about it, especially the magical romance in the first half. When the action moved to the concentration camp, I wish I had followed my gut instinct and turned the movie off then and there.Setting the rest of this movie in a concentration camp just ddoesn't work for me. I cannot ignore the knowledge that great cruelty and unimaginable suffering occured in places like this.If you are a sensitive person, I suggest you skip this movie. It'll rip your heart out by making you care so deeply about the characters and then.... well I don't want to give away the ending. Let's just say, I was left very sad, NOT uplifted at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are Oscars Given Out By Amoeba","review":"Sorry everyone but I thought this was a real turkey shoot. The humour was contrived, hammy & very lame. I guess my major reason for disliking this film was as a consequence of Benigni being both the egotistical director & star. He certainly gave himself centre stage. While his screen & real life wife was obsequiously adoring & dippy, & his screen son was just a mail-order doll for pathos. Roberto was a totally foolish character, who was unable to raise any empathy with me. We don't actually get to see who shoots Roberto - but I would be more than happy to admit to pulling the trigger.The fact that this farce was set during the infamous holocaust was not a problem for me - but clearly offensive to some people. I suspect that people who cried during this film, would also have cried during \\"Pretty Woman\\". As both films make a fairytale out of a harsh reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life Is Not So Beautiful","review":"I am not doubting Roberto Benigni's talent for he certainly has talent. What I do doubt is how good this film really is. This is one of those films where at the end I was so depressed and it pretty much ruined what was left of my day. The film is set up as a romantic comedy that is just so lavish and well done. By the time the first half was up I felt like it was the happiest film I had ever seen. Then came the dreadful second half which takes place in a Nazi death camp. Sure there is some extremely dark humor in this last half but it reaked of \\"Shindler's List\\" and the conclusion is not exactly uplifting either. I believe the film would have been much better if it stuck to either the first half or the last throughout the entire film and not setting up something wonderful and than ending it with tragedy. That's the worst joke anyone could pull and I for one did not appreciate the film at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love At First Sight","review":"I am a 19 year old who saw this movie for the first time roughly 6 years ago. It was love at first sight, back then i was a mischievious little teen who had no respect for tragedies. Upon watching this movie it opened my eyes so wide and respect filled my heart for the Holocaust.The movie was so well executed, so exquisite, it made my heart stopped. The mix of humor and tragedy made this movie set apart from all the other movies made from/for/tributing the Holocaust. One thing for sure it's that humor was still seen in the middle of a tagedy like this, it is a way to escape reality and some people never lost hope, or simply saw everything on the bright side.I recommend this movie to those who are open and know how to judge a good movie, I am no expert at this of \\"critique\\" but I do know when a movie is worth watching it, owning it, and sharing it to others.La vita è bella (THe Life is Beautiful) is that film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is Beautiful","review":"A truly beautiful, inspirational film.

A return to the era of grand cinema.Recommended to all....you'll laugh...you'll cry......its a hellova movie.Susie"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"When I first heard of this movie during the Academy Awards, I was skeptical of the plot because well, how could a person shield such horror from one's child, especially at a time such as the Holocaust? Yet, somehow, this man did. And the reason I feel that it was like that is because it was a relatively short stay. I don't think he could have pulled it off if it were longer. What I love about this movie is that I was touched by it. And each time I see it, I am more touched, and I fall in love with a certain aspect of the film. Despite the fact that I am African American, I can identify with this film, and I give it two thumbs way up!! (Personally, it needs more than five, more like ten)"},{"rating":"2","title":"La vita e bella","review":"My Dad had been constantly nagging my sister and I to see this movie, so we rented it and I'm eternally grateful to him for nagging the way he did.Everything about this movie, the humour, the tragedy, the excellently captivated sense of passion is overwhelming. As a Jew, I thought Benigni's use of humour in such a subject as the Holocaust was tactful and sensitive. What touched me most, however, is Guido's passion for life itself. Even on the brink of war, he exudes feelings of sheer joy which display so strongly his talent for optimism under the bleakest of circumstances. The subtitles didn't bother me one bit, so PLEASE don't let them put you off- this film is truly magical. It certainly restored my faith in love.

This is without any doubt the best movie I have seen. I saw this movie 18 months ago when my daughter was just born. It influenced the kind of parent I became. I believe I would have been a different kind of father if I hadn't seen this movie.Roberto Beningni is probably the only film maker who can make you laugh with tears in your eyes.

Of course it's one of the best movies of the last twenty or so years. It's one of my favorite movies, and definitely should have been in the running for best picture.Why the 4 stars, then? Because, as much as I love the movie, the DVD really isn't anything special. There's a dubbed and a captioned version, a few commercials, and a trailer. That's about it. Unless you only own a DVD player, just purchase the VHS version and save yourself some money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest movies","review":"Life is Beautiful is a wonderful, moving, TRUE story of one's families experience in WWII Europe and eventually the horrors of the Holocaust. I never believed I would be able to find humor in a movie depicting the Nazi war machine and its attempt to elimate European Jewry from the face of the earth. What Benigni does is simply amazing. He makes everyone laugh at his antics while feeling incredibly sad only a few moments later. This journey of emotions is something you rarely find in films these days. I applaud Benigni et al and suggest that everyone buy this movie and watch it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was funny and sad, I loved it!","review":"It is one of the best movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some preatty good movies such as T2 and Saving Private Ryan.

This is possibly the number-one movie of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story Beneath The Trailer","review":"This film's trailer is deceiving to say the very least. I had put off seeing the film because I was misled into believing it was a typical romantic comedy. It is FAR from typical. I'm not sure I should reveal the plot of the film, but let's say it threads a romantic comedy through a MONUMENTALLY unromantic and uncomic event in world history. 'Nuff said. See this film. Achtung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible","review":"Having a positive attitude and a creative immagination is one thing, but this movie asks us to believe that for the love of his child, a father is able to convince his son that life in a concentration camp is a game. Albeit a hard and difficult game, but worth the sacrifices and suffering in order to win the grand prize, a military tank. The denial is overwhelming. In fact, the denial is so overwhelming that my mind found it impossible to accept the fantasy, no matter what the reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I read the raving reviews and thought it would be great but it wasn't.

To attempt to make light of such subjects insults the very memory of all who suffered so greatly.The movie as it stands is sappy and predictable and intelligent viewers will see right through it, it's cast and it's goal as a pathetic tear-jerker.THE HORSEMAN"},{"rating":"1","title":"so corny it gave us goose bumps","review":"Maybe my husband and I are too old and jaded, but we couldn't watch more than the first 20 minutes of this movie.We liked the costumes, make-up, scenery, etc., but the actor playing the main character is way too self indulgent for our tastes.We're both fluent in italian.

I'm shocked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best movie I have seen yet!!!","review":"Life is beautiful was the best movie I have seen yet. The movie tells a story yet keeps it in a frame that even a child would understand. The message, that his father gave his life for his son , is one that everyone needs to learn especially at this time where it is being told in our culture that family does not matter and the only thing that is important is your own feelings and self esteem. Thank you for making this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"still in my mind","review":"this movie is the best movie I have ever seen. It left me speechless, breathless and emotionally shaken. I too saw this film only after seeing Roberto's \\"display\\" on the Oscars. I figured whoever had this much love for life and joy so obviously genuine must have done something great! Boy was I right. The movie was plainly and simply about love and self-sacrifice. Love so powerful that self-sacrifice comes without thought. See it then buy it. Total brilliance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"100000 stars","review":"This is by far, the best movie I have ever seen. I've been left speechless. You must see this amazing film to understand what I mean. It's impossible to put the movie in words..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life truly is beautiful","review":"This movie was incredible. It's a shame that it was released in such a competitive Oscar year. Nevertheless, Roberto Benigni gave an amazing performance as Guido, and received support from the lovely Nicholetta Braschi and the very talented Giorgio Cantarini, who gave quite a performance for someone so young. This movie left me speechless. I expected a film that focused on the concentration camps and persecution of Jews. Yes, I did get that, but I also got a beautiful love story and an unforgettable tale of the power of imagination and a father's love for his son. I highly suggest viewing the subtitled version, as the Italian language is simply beautiful. This is one foreign movie that not only made an impact on the US box office, but internationally as well - and with good cause. A film not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Benigni's masterpiece!","review":"All it took was \\"seven seconds\\" for me to know I would love this movie.Filmed in Italy, it is best if you get the subtitled version, for dubbing is not very effective.Italian comedy actor/director Roberto Benigni and his wife Nicoletta Braschi give outstanding performances in the best film of the year without competition, La Vita E Bella.Taking place throughout the second world war, this movie starts off as a boy meets girl hilarious comedy, but turns into a terrifying drama about a father protecting his boy when they are sent to a concentration camp.La Vits E Bella is most definitely in the top five films ever made in ANY country.I reccomend this movie for all who have ever laughed or cried at a movie... and just about everyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing movie","review":"When I saw this in the theater, I was so emotionally drained that I practically had to be scraped off the floor. The courtship in the beginning was beautiful and touching -- proving right away that THIS MAN KNOWS HOW TO LOVE. During the rest of the movie, in the concentration camp, Begnini's character prooves this again.Some have said that Begnini made a joke out of the Holocaust by making this movie, and I know some people that have refused to see it and I think that they are seriously missing out. This movie is a true display of the strongest human emotion (LOVE) from beginning to end. It was depressing, but incredibly uplifting, as it shows this amazing man giving all that he has in him to keep his little boy happy and hopeful. BTW -- he DEFINITLY deserved the Academy Awards that he received!THIS MOVIE IS NOT TO BE MISSED. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. YOU WILL THANK ME FOR IT. I am going to order it the moment the price drops, and watch it with someone I love and a huge box of tissues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Is Beautiful","review":"I first saw this movie with English subtitles. I thought for sure I would not enjoy it due to the subtitles. I was wrong, the movie blew me away! When I watched it again dubbed in English, I didn't enjoy it as much. What gets lost in the translation is Benigni's expressive voice. So expressive in fact that you don't need to understand Italian to comprehend exactly what he's saying. This movie is on my list of Top 10 Best of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This is a great movie and a great product! I bought it brand new from the seller and it was exactly what I had expected and hoped for.

It's a very inspiring story!Life is Beautiful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is beautiful","review":"Life is indeed beautiful and this wonderful movie by Roberto Begnini makes us stop to think about it, to admire it, to enjoy it, to love it, to come to the conclusion that, no matter how hard it is sometimes, it's always worth it! From my point of view, the core message of this masterpiece is the selfless love. Whenever we feel this kind of love, we will see that nothing else matters. We will have accomplished the highest goal a human being can be assigned to. That's also GOD's message for us and, amidst laughter, smiles, humor and tenderness, Roberto Begnini leads our thoughts to same conclusion.

I enjoy it every time I see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was alright","review":"This movie was alright, but it is by no means as good as everyone says it is. I didn't think it was funny at all, and it was unrealistic. I mean, in the real holocaust, little kids knew they were in an awful place. There is no way that one of them would thought it was just a \\"game\\". The movie made the holocaust seem like nothing. I mean, if a Nazi was gonna shoot a prisoner, he would just do it, he wouldn't take the guy to a deserted corner to do it, like they did with this movie. If you wanna see a funny movie, watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off. If you wanna see a REALLY good movie, go see The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, Spartucus, To Kill a Mockingbird, Shadow of Dought, Ran(or any other film by Akira Kurosawa or whatever his name was)etc., etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a still life","review":"benini in this film does to the audience exactly what his character does to his son - he shields the viewer from the horror of the holocaust. whether this is just deluded or pernicious (benini turning one of the greatest tragedies in human history into comic schtick) is not for me to say. But the film is dishonest as they come. Life wasn't beautiful in the Holocaust and for the people who survived it there wasn't a happy ending. go read Primo Levi instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self indulgent and dishonest -- \\"feel good\\" in the worst way","review":"I can't imagine who would like this except people who desperately need to believe that the Holocaust wasn't all that bad -- that all a father needed to do save his son's life was be quick witted and full of love. Every single testimony of what the death camps were like says the same thing -- there was nothing you could do to save yourself or anyone else. Survival was random. \\"Life is Beautiful\\" isn't a fairy tale; it's a pathetic delusion. Touching, perhaps, in it's sad attempt to re-write history to make it rosy and to defend the phrase \\"life is beautiful.\\" Life may be beautiful, but the Holocaust was not, but you wouldn't know it from this strange, depressing film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appallingly overrated","review":"This film should have been titled \\"My Ego Is Beautiful.\\" The so-called gags are weak and uninspired and, for a film that purports to be about the triumph of the human spirit blah blah blah, Begnini's character displays very little interest in any other people beyond himself. The unrealistic depiction of the concentration/extermination/labor camp actually undercuts the resonance of the \\"humor\\" in the second half. Had the filmmakers chosen to depict the dehumanizing horror of a real camp accurately, Begnini's mugging might have had a truly tragicomic effect. But setting the film in a camp in which Jewish children are allowed to live instead of being murdered on arrival and in which a prisoner is allowed to roam about unsupervised merely reduced the contrast between horror and comedy to the level of a Hogan's Heroes rerun. For a good Italian comedy about the Holocaust and WWII, rent Wrtmuller's Seven Beauties instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy","review":"To make a such a movie about the Holocaust would require an extraordinary actor, who could convey the contradictory desire to spare his son and simultaneously feel the horror of being shipped to a camp. Instead, all I saw was him literally trying to make a big joke out the experience, I think because Benigni isn't capable of portraying fear while being a clown. Especially awful was the \\"funny interpretator\\" shtick for the Nazis. It was just so icky to me. I was shocked that he won Best Actor, though of course that is consistent with the travesty of the Oscars. It wasn't a true story, but at the end the boy claims \\"This is the story of my life\\" as if this were true life story. It was a cheap trick. Very dishonest."},{"rating":"1","title":"I saw this with a Holocaust survivor","review":"(First of all, thanks to those who understand our reaction to this film. It's unfortunate that more people don't.) We enjoyed the early parts of the film because of the humor, but my friend, a survivor of Auschwitz Birkenau and a forced labor camp, was finally outraged by this treatment of the Holocaust, as was I. A child in Auschwitz would have been gassed to death immediately so there would be no chance to make a game of the camp experience! My friend would have been gassed to death, because he later found out they gassed all children under the age of 18 soon after he left for a labor camp.I appreciated the heart-warming love of the father for his son, but this \\"game\\" idea was misplaced, as it ended up trivializing the concentration camp experience. WatchDivided We Fallinstead! Or, for a very good depiction of life in the camps, watchFatelessorThe Grey Zone! For a heart-warming father-son relationship, try the new film from Mexico,Alamar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Schindler's List","review":"If one movie had to be picked as best for describing the horror of the holocaust, this is it. Schindler's List was mainly from the perspective of Schindler and, by all means, it was a very good story too. However, \\"Life is Beautiful\\" is from the perspective of a Jewish man. A man who is portrayed to be ordinary in many respects and even a natural clown to some degree, but you eventually realize that this man is no 'clown' when it comes to what is most important to him. Benigni uses a device at the very end of the movie that leaves you with no doubt of what that is for him and should be for all of us; love. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is Beautiful","review":"This DVD puts a \\"Charlie Chaplan\\" humor to a tragic story.

It is filled with joy, laughter and tragedy which make it very emotional.I can't believe the people that knock this film because of displaying humor in a Nazi War Camp.

In both cases we have the proper woman who is supposed to marry the very proper man. Instead she falls for a vagabond; someone who is far from \\"proper\\" but someone who definitely knows how to enjoy life. And in both cases the story is told against the backdrop of disaster.\\"Life is Beautiful,\\" however, is a fantasy. No, it could never really have happened. Yes, the Holocaust was far more horrible than this movie shows. But we already know how horrible the Holocaust was.

His wonderful use of physical and situational humor are astonishing. Life is Beautiful is a delightful film about a Jewish man who chases his love through a series of happenstances. The story then takes a dramatic turn as the Nazi's enter his city and he and his family are sent to a concentration camp. This is where the film really makes itself memorable. Benigni is unforgettable as he uses everything in his heart and his head to keep his son happy and alive, promising that all of the horror is just a game and if he can play it well enough he will win a tank. The DVD isn't much of an extra benefit, but it does allow you to watch it in English or Italian. Please, please watch it in Italian. Hearing the emotions of the actors makes it worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired.","review":"I do not speak Italian, had never heard of Roberto Benigni and detest chaotic, slapstick humour. This film contains all of the above and oddly, I loved it and thought it a truly wonderful film. (I ended up watching it twice in 24 hours). Having briefly scanned other reviews about this DVD, I know I do not need to go into great depth about its content and quiet magnificence. Suffice to say it is a gentle, funny, spiritually inspiring film and you must see it. Roberto Benigni deserved all the accolades he got for this.Additionally, I must say that the horse scene and the German translation scene rendered me a howling heap on the floor and I had to pause it in order to compose myself and not miss any lines. And this is a movie about the Holocaust?"},{"rating":"2","title":"LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL...EVENTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS PERFECT","review":"Life is Beautiful is one of the best films I have enver seen. It is truly a masterpiece. The movie is able to actually make you believe that there is always a way when there is hope and lots of love.Life is Beautiful is a mix bag of joy, worries, laughter, love and tenderness... and that is precisely what life is all about. Throughout the movie you are able to laugh and cry with the characters and their personifications. That was the best part in my opinion, you come to realize that today you laugh, tomorrow you cry, and then you laugh again... that is why life is beautiful.The setting is beautiful, The acting is magnificent. Not to mention that Guido is the ideal man that all women dream of... caring, persistent, funny, charismatic, a great dad, a wonderful husband.

This film is so over the top and unrealistic it borders on ridiculous. And like another reveiwer said, it is one coincidence after another from beginning to end. I anticipated a poignant film. I expected to cry for the characters and it was impossible to do so considering the silly antics of the lead actor which never ended during the entire film. There are no horrific or realistically sad scenes to cry over anyway. The little boy was no more convincing in his role than the lead actor and the wife was a deap pan non-entity. I can see now after viewing it why so many here are disgusted by the way it turned a horrid event into a high-drama Dick Van Dyke movie. I truly hope none of the Holocaust survivors subjected themselves to this travesty.Btw, I gave it two stars because the scenery and photography was exceptional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never seen a more touching movie","review":"Life is beautiful has really touched my life.

The people in the concentration camp didn't lose weight, nor did they seem to suffer much in the movie. I thought that this movie did injustice to the survivors. Until the very end of the movie. When the movie finally reveals from who's point of view this movie was being told the whole weight of the movie hit me, and hit me hard. One man's undying love for his wife and dedication for his child move me to burst out in tears when it was finally revealed who's story that was. This is the most incredible and most loving story I have ever heard. As this movie shows and reminds again; in a man's life his father is the greatest hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Starts out very funny, and then becomes very sad, almost to the point of making you feel guilty for thinking it was funny.

One of the best movies I've ever seen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST movies ever!","review":"The beauty of this movie lies in the amazing lengths taken to protect a child from the reality of the Holocaust. So often we feel like we need to be the one to tell our children how it is so they don't get surprised when they go out in the world.

There was far too many anecdotes, fond recollections and opinions and too little quantitative assessments and incisive analysis.

Disappointing.","review":"I was familiar with some of the players on this DVD before I purchased it and was expecting something better than this. There is absolutely no instructional material in written form nor commentary in the video. It is strictly aperformance package thrown together from excerpts of other instructional videos. Although the songs played seemed to be quite technical & challenging, I found most of them were not pleasing to my ear. There were a couple of exceptions but not enough to bring up the rest of the tunes. The format of the dvd doesn't allow you to play the whole thing through either, you have to play each piece individually and have to go back to the main menu to change performers. Very annoying to say the least. I'm not one to dole out a lot of negative information but this dvd was not worth my time and effort. The only plus is that it cost less than $4bucks.

Batteries charge in 15 minutes as advertised. Batteries are so hot after charging that you cannot hold them in your hand - or put them in a camera for quite a while. Major reason I do not like them is that they rapidly auto-discharge - i.e. they go dead on the shelf within a matter of a week or usually less. Capacity is OK if you use them immediately after charging. I have Rayovac hybrid AA's & like them much better. Although they charge overnight, the batteries hold a charge for months on the shelf.

It also has trouble charging regular NiMH batteries - they can take up to a whole night to charge.2.

John Grishams \\"The Chamber\\" is a tale of the moral complexities of capital punishment while the movie deals primarly with a convoluted conspiracy which goes to the the highest levels of government. Had James Foley kept true to the novel I still believe Burwell would have scored the film the same way- dark and unsettling. The one thing I like about this score is how its theme goes from a darker tone \\"Two Small Bodies\\" and evolves with the movies primary character Sam Cayhall into its more beautiful rendition in \\"The End\\". Besides these tracks five others which are powerful are \\"Dark Roots of the Tree\\", \\"Parchman Farm, By Car\\", \\"Hall of Records\\", Tale of the Laurel Tree\\", and \\"The Chamber\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it...","review":"When I saw that she had a new album out, I was so excited.

I'm still amazed she hasn't become more famous here in the states.So when I saw her album at Best Buy, I bought it in a second. Sadly after listening to it a few times, hoping it would grow on me, it hasn't yet. I praise Amanda for being able to re-invent herself, but I'm not sure I like the new Amanda Marshall. She's falling into a genre I've never been a big fan of. Though, from the mixed reviews on this site, I guess some people can appareciate it. But from this Amanda fan: it's not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed...","review":"I absolutely loved Amanda's first two CD's and eagerly awaited this new release.

If you haven't listened to this CD, don't buy it before you do. I wish I had an idea of what it was like before I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my usual style, but I love it!","review":"I'm most impressed with the depth of Amanda Marshall's meaning in each song (specifically \\"Coleen (I saw him first)\\" and \\"Double Agent\\"). I usually don't listen to R&B, but the slight folk overtones are apparent and nice guitar, especially in \\"Marry Me\\" (which is possibly the most romantic proposal song I've heard in a long time).This album inspires me to think about many issues, not just be satisfied with the status quo. If it's not your style of music you enjoy, you simply may not like it. If the tunes are catchy to you, disecting the meaning of each song brings great reward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen before you buy","review":"I have both of Amanda Marshall's other cds. I bought the first one at the recommendation of a friend and never regretted it. couldn't wait to get hold of the second one and even went so far as to have a friend go to Canada to get it since it was released there well before it was released here. So when I happened to be in a local music store and saw that she had a new cd out I bought it without hesitation. I wish I had hesitated! I will give it another listen just to be fair, but I do not think this is one that will grow on me. I think the production of this one took her in a direction way too far from her style. Maybe they were trying to appeal to a younger crowd with this one. My suggestion is to give it a listen before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The demise of Amanda Marshall","review":"I've decided not to write this review in a sarcastic tone. Amanda Marshall was a breath of fresh air back in 1995 when her debut album came out. I saw her in concert and she was great. Then came Tuesday's Child, an okay follow-up. Then, unfortunately, she released Everybody's Got a Story. I'd rather eat sandpaper than listen to the muck on this album. I think the biggest mistake Amanda made was co-writing all of her songs. She didn't write the songs off her debut, save for three songs. Since Tuesday's Child she's been writing horrible lyrics. UGHHHHH."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this is Amanda Marshall","review":"Janis Joplin was special, but if you bathed her rear end in gasoline and lit it on fire, she still couldn't match the pipes Amanda have. So why would anyone want to record Amanda using toned-down, multiple-layered vocals and hip-hopish bass? Someone must be grooming her for Glitter II.After 2 albums that were the perfect blend of rock, soul, folk and blues, albums that were performed with what seemed like a passion indicative of pleasure in the musical direction she was going in; we get this ...... stuff.There are MAYBE 4 songs worthy of her first 2 releases. The rest sound like they were recorded for a TLC album. If that's the kind of music she wants to make, then good luck to her(The first person an artist needs to please is themselves.). I just didn't dig this particular work.Big fans of Marshall should get the album just for the few good tunes. This way, you won't have a gap in your collection when her \\"rebound album\\" comes out in a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amanda Has Lost Her Mind!","review":"Amanda Marshall's self titled debut is one of the best canadian albums of all time. The reason? Amanda didn't write the songs! She now thinks she can write. She can't! Her second album was a decrease in quality, this album suffers from a complete loss of quality. Her songs are annoying now. She writes like she is twelve years old. It's such a shame that she insists on writing and her record label lets her. Buy this cd if you are 11 years old, otherwise skip it! You'll be thankful."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more record contracts","review":"The only thing worse than hearing Amanda Marshall on the radio is seeing her face on TV. I live in Canada where I have the misfortune of being exposed to cacophonous Canadian dischord to meet required domestic airplay regulations. This means Marshall is not a nobody, which is a shame.If she was a fraction as hot as you can tell she thinks she is, she would be an uber-model. Instead, she is - okay I'll be nice - very average looking with a totally generic style and her 'music' gives me mild headaches.I place her in the same class as those silly hairspray metal bands - you know, those anachronistic fools who think they're the bomb, when instead they just bomb.This disc is terrible.

You play as Kenai and Koda, both individually and as a team, working through levels roughly along the timeline of the movie. The early levels are pretty easy, meant mainly as tutorials, but later levels are tricky.

Also, all of the cast, except the Caucasian parts, ARE Asians, and for the most part, particularly the Tuptim and Lady Thaing, they are good. Lou Diamond Phillips is no Yul Brynner, but he's decent, if a bit over-eager and boyish. And anyway, who could be as good as Brynner was in the part of the King? And then there is Donna Murphy. Her Anna is wonderful, very well-textured and sung beautifully and \\"veddy\\" British. She won a well-deserved Tony for the role.

It should be titled the \\"Toyota Sequoia Partial Manual with Limited Illustrations and the Worst Photo examples ever!\\" I got an ALLDATAdiy subscription to my SPECIFIC VEHICLE with OEM parts and assembly diagrams, CLEAR photos and and Detailed Repair information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read. Very unique and entertaining.","review":"This is truly an amazing read! I admit that the first book \\"Rhapsody\\" did drag a little, setting up the plot-lines for the next two books, but man, does \\"Prophecy\\" deliver!OK! So the lead character is \\"perfect as Marry Poppins\\" but so what. That flaw is more than made up for in the intricacies of the rest of the story. I am not a fan of Romance novels, but Haydon adds just the right amount of sappy, sexual angst, and yes, romance, that it makes the characters emotionally concrete.If you despise romance, but can stomache it, this is still an amazing trilogy. The third book in the series \\"Destiny\\" will have you shouting at the top of your lungs as you await the unfolding of the many plot-twists and resolutions. She is one of the best \\"Storry-tellers\\" out there. Read it!I also read and love Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I too fell into the hype of Rhapsody along with many others. I picked up the book, and was pleased with what I read. It was well written and the history was compelling. The plot was slow at times, but I enjoyed the depth it took into the past, so it didn't really bother me much. Prophecy is better three-fold. It is an extrodinary book, proving Haydon didnt' get lucky with her first book. The story speeds along faster, and the action is more numerous. The only possible problem is that on several occasions it is too much a romance novel. If, like me, you don't enjoy the detailed love scenes of who placed what where, causing this to pulse, just grit your teeth, because the rest of the story is worth suffering through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth Haydon Does It Again","review":"Elizabeth Haydon does it again in her magnificent sequel to Rhapsody. The book literally kept me up at night as I was enthralled by the magical writing style of Elizabeth Haydon. I became even more enthralled with the characters than I was with the first. In her sequel she leaves you craving for more. Like the character Rhapsody, in the novel, Elizabeth Haydon's writing style leaves you begging for more. It is my contention that she is the future of the Fantasy genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop after Rhapsody","review":"The heroine is frequently called intelligent, but never proves this. Despite her intelligence, she's completely unaware of the effect her utter physical perfection has on everyone that meets her. She is called fair and compassionate despite being haughty and judgemental.However, the absolute worst of it is any interaction that involves Ashe. Aside from the fact that he comes off as a player character someone rolled up for a d&d; campaign (see, I'm this half-dragon...), his presence turns any chapter from fantasy to bad romance.If you seriously browse the romance section when choosing a book, you may just love this, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent book","review":"Although this book is not quite as good as the first in the series. It is well worth reading. The plot twists keep you reading and the ending leaves you begging for more. I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"no plot, no real personalities, no point","review":"Ugg. The promise in Rhapsody was totally lost in this book. I can't even take the time to write a decent review of it. Basically, this book has no real plot. Things happen, and then more things happen, but there seems to be no real goal for this series. The heroine Rhapsody is the most annoying mary sue ever written about, and there really is no point in reading this book. Look at the Truth series by Dawn Cook instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even my 12 year old daughter didn't like it","review":"I gave this book to my 12 year old daughter, and she didn't like it either. Too many long prosaic passages with no reference to the direction or plot of the book. Too many discovered problems. Good ideas, but not much execution. The author needs to read some real mythology. Too much idle banter. Too many events that don't connect to other events. Too much like an aimless diary. Too much....."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULDN'T EVEN FINISH","review":"I really liked the character of Achmed from the first book, so I bought this one excitedly hoping for some Achmed/Rhapsody action... or at least more of Achmed's story.I got neither. This book was SO BORING. Instead of focusing on Achmed, suddenly Rhapsody's \\"first love\\" Ashe becomes the romantic focus. UGH. Ashe has NO CHARACTERIZATION. If you can imagine a piece of cardboard walking around on paper, appropriately saying \\"I love you\\" and \\"I've waited my whole life for you\\" at every opportunity, you have Ashe. FACEPALM. Once I realized that was how the romance aspect would work out, I completely stopped reading. Plus there were huge chunks of text that were just boring back-story or world building that was really unnecessary.I won't be buying the next book in the series. Waste of time and money. I've never been so disappointed in a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true rhapsody","review":"I fell in love with this series immediately. As a fan of Tolkein, it's easy to appreciate the use of language, both in the writing and the background, which is alternatively lyrical and stark as the story needs it. But there is more to Haydon's fantasy than the wonky recitation of lineage or the action-driven plots of other fantasists. This story has brutality that is thrilling beside romantic elements that are even moreso, a sense of music that underpins it and mystery that is totally absent from most of the field. It's like every chapter is a different movement in a symphony. I have purchased all the volumes in Kindle format and am loving reading and re-reading them. Can't wait for the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the first","review":"Amazing! Usually the second book in a trilogy is filler and moves slow. This book breaks that stereo-type. Where Rhapsody had some lag in the middle, the story line in Prophecy moves along smartly. The tension between Rhapsody and her partners over the mysterious stranger is managed well and rings true. All in all this is a series that I highly recomend: it is written well, the characters are real and interesting, the plot compelling, and the story line is new and fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book, an even more amazing author","review":"I would have given this book 6 stars just for it's content. The depth here is superior to any other fantasy I have read besides Lord of the Rings. I love the cahacters both main and secondary. Rhapsody is one of the best heroines I've ever seen. She tranmutes, changes, grows in the story. She has a generous spirit and her devotion to protecting kids makes her a more realistic female character than the Xena babes in other books. Grunthor is wonderful, and Achmed the snake is one of the best characters in fnatasy, complex and fascinating.But this morning I read in USA TODAY that Elizabeth Haydon gave all the money from this book to a pediatric AIDS Foundation. No I see where Rhapsody gets it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really loved reading Rhapsody. It was excellent. The second installment of the series was a prodigious disappointment. I\`m sorry to say that it reminded me of Mills and Boon publications. Anyway, how many times can you read about Rhaps being so excruciatingly beautiful? I will however buy the third book for closure..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the hype","review":"This is the best high fantasy series to come along in 10 years. I have not read two books like this since the first two in the Wheel of Time.While the plot is not quite as deep as Jordan's books the characters are amazing. I can not explain how good the character development/interaction is. You have to read these books. Now. Right now. I'm not kidding."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's turned into a romance novel","review":"I enjoyed the first book, Rhapsody, and looked forward to this one but I barely got through it. Maybe its because I'm a guy, but when whole chapters are spent on romantic interludes, or the heroine having a good cry, I'm sorry but I just can't hang in there. This book started out as promising as Rhapsody, then it turned into a therapy session/romance novel.By the time I finished this book I had the same nauseous feeling I get when my wife's got the TV remote and she's watching the Lifetime network. I don't mean to sound like a male chauvinist, but I'm sure many women feel the same way about a football game. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all down hill from here","review":"This book was the worst in the lot. I didn't even want to finish it. It was stuffed with so much mindless minute detail I felt like screaming. I was like get to the point what ever it was. You spent so much time not caring what happned next you forgot. Nobody seeme to be challanged. What ever they set out to do in next page bam! they did it. I loved the first book so I'm not sure how this one came out so bad. Even the last one is better than this. Raphsody really is just a blond bimbo and an insult to women everwhere. When she said that she had no choice but to sell herself becuase men wouldn't leave her alone other wise I almost shut the book for good. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so bad..well not the worst","review":"I just made it thru Rhapsody and because had nothing else to read went on to this one. I'll concede that at least I was able to finish this book but it didn't move me to tears like other reviewers and overall I wouldn't recommend devoting time to reading it.Ridden with romance novel cliches. The song lyrics are unbearably corny. As with the last novel, the attempts at humor are flat old jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles was right: should not have been released","review":"This should not have been released. The best thing about it is Summer Night. The rest sounds like outtakes. I like pre-electric Miles, but I read that Miles was furious with Columbia for releasing this and he was right.

Confusing project from the master","review":"I've got an extensive Miles collection CD's, vinyl....love absolutley everything Miles..., all periods. This however is like cocktail lounge music. It's like some mistake was made. Compositions, performances arangements all flat dull and uninspired. Maybe some demand was made by Columbia for Miles Davis MUZAK.

The unit does as promised, charging in about 15 minutes and it will charge non-IC3 batteries, too, though very slowly (seems to be at least 8 hours for a 900 mAh AAA).I did not pay this much for it, though ($45 for the two-bat charger and 2 included batteries), when I bought it. Rayovac no longer makes this product, their premier rechargeables being Hybrids (which are just regular NIMH but have a very low self-discharge rate; normal nimh discharge at 1%/day or so and these other ones at substantially slower than that). Getting the IC3 batteries is increasingly hard and the charger will only fast-charge IC3 batteries.With other chargers on the market now, including fast chargers from duracell and energizer, as well as super-chargers like the La Crosse BC900, I would not buy an IC3 now, but it has been a good charger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Purchase Ever","review":"Works like it says.

The only thing that keeps me from rating this 5 stars is that Scott seems to have picked tracks that sound less Irish than the songs on the original. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean less trad-style fiddle from Steve Wickham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but get the other edition","review":"This album was released in the US under the misleading title \\"Fisherman's Blues Part 2\\" with a bonus disc which includes a superb slow-burning live version of \\"Too Close to Heaven\\".

Bad design to heat the area below the unit as that heat is radiated up into the unit.The power supply gets very hot, hotter than is good design.The gas canister does not seal very well as it emptied in about a week with no bottle in the unit.The bright LED to illuminate the bottle is silly.

Readers will be shocked, it's hard to imagine how these atrocities could occur. It fills you with a sense of disbelief - and it should. Unfortunately, the case against Kelly Michaels was just one in a string of ritual sex abuse cases during the 1980's that has been disproven. Kelly Michaels' conviction was later overturned. I don't expect Ms. Crowley to believe in Kelly Michael's innocence, she's spent nearly 20 years believing the version of events given to her by the inept investigators in this case. I'm sure her daughter believes she is a child abuse survivor as well. It must have been horrible for the families of these children to hear all the things that supposedly happened to their children and they have years of guilt and anger that they've dealt with because of this. The evidence does not support the claims of the investigators, though. The saddest part about this story is that all these lives were sent into turmoil needlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"the story and the movie script look like were written during a tea break session","review":"the story and the movie script look like were written during a tea break session.i take it back, maybe it was written during two tea break sessions.there is no story, no plot. it can make a 13 year old more puzzled about love, but that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me think about the way we perceive people that are born different","review":"This book was thought provoking. It made me think about what 'normal' is. From research that the author had done, it seems that a very high proportion of conjoined twins left conjoined are quite happy with their bodies. It seems that it is society that demands they are changed to a more normal appearance, despite horrible medical problems that will result from the operations. The book philophosises more about this than discusses actual cases. However there were some very interesting recent cases discussed, such as the sacrifice of one conjoined twin to save the other, and a case where the doctors took the parents of a pair of conjoined twins to court so the separation could go ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"More PC than analytical","review":"More of a celebration of political correctness thana well thought out study of conjoined twins.If you follow the author's ideology through, any bodymodification--including braces for teeth or body-- isdamaging to a child's psychological health.If you want facts--give this one a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catherine Ponder at Her Best","review":"This is another great book from Catherine Ponder.

It is not rated, but it was not at all what I expected based on the information on the jacket. From other reviews I have now read, the movie is more extreme (than the actual book) in its display of the bullying which occurred in this school. Even though the main culprit does get asked to leave, you always get the feeling he is not punished enough and should have been punished as a criminal. I felt like I made a mistake in choosing it as a family film even though the story has some merit. For the most part, good triumphs over evil in the end.

It starts off well enough, and seems like it will be an interesting film. It starts to slow down and gets a bit confusing, a lot of scenes left us wondering what the point had been. And towards the end it takes a significant turn. I won't go in to details so as not to include any spoilers, but it's fair to say that we just didn't get it at all. I understand the idea, but the delivery left us wondering what it had all been about. There is a lot of overacting, which isn't necessarily a problem in an independent, hand held camera production, but the story was just plain odd and trying to be shocking for the sake of it. We are big fans of independent and foreign movies, and it's very rare I would rate a film poorly if I didn't like it, as it's a subjective opinion, but this has to go down as one of the most disappointing films I've seen, when compared to the high praise it received from critics."},{"rating":"1","title":"last third of movie was stupid.","review":"gotta say the first 65 percent of the movie is a classic slow burn. wonderfully shot, written and acted. loved the dinner scene. loved the intrigue. loved the mystery.....again, slow burn...that said : the movie, out of nowhere and at the worst possible time takes a complete change of course and...im not gonna ruin it...becomes way too symbolic and surreal to be entertaining. im all about having a deeper meaning in films...but this one just rams its ideals down your throat and tries very hard to be intelligent.shame. the director has a good thing going and then decided to insult the audience by going back to film school and make a pretentious ending. if i wanted to rent Eyes Wide Shut i would have...this movie could of been a game changer for horror movies for years to come but settled on cliche."},{"rating":"1","title":"last third of movie killed it entirely...","review":"this movie came (relatively) highly reviewed and i was psyched to watch it...gotta say the first 65 percent of the movie is a classic slow burn. wonderfully shot, written and acted. loved the dinner scene. loved the intrigue. loved the mystery.....again, slow burn...that said : the movie, out of nowhere and at the worst possible time takes a complete change of course and...im not gonna ruin it...becomes way too symbolic and surreal to be entertaining. im all about having a deeper meaning in films...but this one just rams its ideals down your throat and tries very hard to be intelligent.shame. the director has a good thing going and then decided to insult the audience by going back to film school and make a pretentious ending. if i wanted to rent Eyes Wide Shut i would have...this movie could of been a game changer for horror movies for years to come but settled on cliche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Year","review":"I'll be stunned if a worse movie comes out this year. If you liked Wicker Man and thought it needed to be slower, mix more genres, and be a bigger waste of time, then this film will be right up your alley. It's the kind of film that makes me rethink people's recommendations because if they liked this then we're most certainly looking for different things out of two hours of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent movie morphs into unbelievable","review":"This movie was a pretty good character study and action/thriller for the first 75% (4 stars).

Nice job here, thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story? Who needs a story when you've got style... right?","review":"This film is a great example of what you get when you forget about the importance of a story. Watch the first scene and pay attention, because that's exactly how the rest of the film will be. And don't let all the claims of gore and blood and violence lure you in, either. It's very tame and unrealistic. Too bad. Next time I hope this director will take the time to tell a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time!","review":"Are you kidding me!

This one also suddenly turns into a whole different movie in its final third act???Admittedly a very brutal and soulless film, I can't find any redeeming features. Boo to the sound mixing and the often murky accents which certainly didn't help.I respect all reviewers opinions, but sorry guys...I hate this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the?!?!?!?!?!?","review":"This movie was bonkers. It plays like an offbeat yet brutal crime thriller and then, pretty much out of nowhere, goes in a COMPLETELY different direction in the last 20 minutes. Definitely worth checking out, but be prepared for a sudden tone change that catches you off guard, but in a good, if disturbing, way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense Film","review":"A strange ultra violent descent into Hell is what this film is. Some have thought the ending is out of left field but if you watch closely throughout and just let the film wash over you, it makes sense. The musical score adds to the tension so much. Not since Rosemary's Baby have I felt the musiccontributed in such an unnerving way. Rent this if you want something different than the usual horror films that have ruined the genre lately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Indy Thriller","review":"This British indy film had received a lot of attentions and favorable reviews, mainly from British film media.The film has a simple story about 2 semi-professional(?) contractors received orders with a \\"kill list\\".The first 3 acts are alright with a good cast but the last act is too slight to make it a good and satisfyingthriller and doesn't justify the foregoing grisly violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critics are wrong","review":"Way too much hype by the british critics.

I bought and loved \\"How to be a Domestic Goddess\\", so, I got this book from the library to check it out, thinking it would be somewhat the same. I have to say I was dissapointed. I only found 4 usable recipes in the whole book. (Granted, I am not a gourmet chef by any means, but I do consider myself to be a lover of great food and a Good cook.)

There are lots of good ideas here on reinventing many different aspects of your life. The author takes the approach that their is no one set formula for anybody . For some people a reinvention could happen with a snap of the fingers. With others it might take place years. For most of us it is probably something between several weeks and several months.

It's good to eat nutritious food!) that doesn't come close to being a comprehensive plan for major life change. And while the tone is, as another reviewer noted, amicable it is also smugly self-satisfied. Jeff Davidson is clearly impressed with Jeff Davidson.

In the second shredder not only did the case fracture, but the plastic gears disintegrated.It doesn't seem that it would be very difficult to design a shredder that; (a) is capable of protecting itself from self-destruction under heavy loads and (b) would allow the operator to safely remove shredder jams that can't be dislodged by pushing the rocker switch back and forth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last long","review":"Had this shredder for about 2-3 years, used it about once or twice a month, for about 10 minutes at a time.

It is probably not the quietest shredder on the market, but the sound is not unpleasant. It has a good capacity basket for holding the shredded documents. I have not had a problem with overheating.The only negative for some might be the effectiveness of the shut off mechanism. If I touch the shiny part on top of the mouth of the shredder it will stop shredding. However, I can stick my fingers actually into the mouth of the shredder without the sensor going off.

They offered to replace the shredder and they offered a label for free shipping of the defective one. Once I get it I'll update. Very surprisingly, I was told that I can't leave the unit on \\"I\\" all the time (where it start if it detects paper). I was told to leave it on off at all time, and only turn it on when I was feeding it paper. The tech support even told me that they recommend leaving the unit unplugged as much as possible.

I've had other shredders before but nothing that compares to this one. The capacity is supposed to be 12 pages maximum but I've fed it as many as 15-20 pages with no problems.

Would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this shredder","review":"I love this shredder - it does everything I want it to do, it's quiet, it's cross-cut shred it better than strip cut. A few notes: I don't like that I have to slide the paper in at an angle, but it does prevent accidental intake of ties and the like - you have to WANT to shred something. My jam light is on all the time, although there is no jam, the container is relatively unfilled, and the shredder works fine. Basically, to me, the jam light means nothing. Other than those two small items keeping it from being a five-star rated shredder, it's great - I recommend it to anyone needing a good, medium duty shredder."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good performer for household needs","review":"Sense I purchased this shredder for my home I can only speak for how well it performed under a household workload. The shredder works very well and was purchased to upgrade from my previous shredder which was of a different brand and smaller size. The powershred most certainly lives up to the \\"power\\" aspect of the name as it easily handles multiple pages and envelopes with ease. The powershred is not too noisy considering many shredders I have seen at office supply stores and seems to be hard to jam (Not a single jam yet) while still easy to use (was able to figure out operation without reading documentation). I have used it for about a month now and I'm very happy with my purchase as well as the speed and reliability of the shipping. Would recommend for any home use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"I haven't owned this shredder for very long, but, so far, it has performed well. Time will tell if it deserves the fifth star. The shredded bits are sufficiently small to make it difficult to piece them together, unlike some cheaper machines, and it really does easily eat old credit cards. I had another Fellows shredder for almost ten years before it bit the dust. It was very good and owed me nothing when it quit. That's why I selected Fellows ahead of other brands. One very important point - lubricate the cutters regularly. Most of the failures I hear about are caused by letting the cutters run dry or overloading the motor with too many sheets at once. The Fellows oil is cheap or you can buy another, even less expensive, brand. The important thing is to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I used this to replace a 9 year old Fellowes shredder. Totally satisfied. Much quieter than my old Fellowes shredder. Goes through CD's and credit cards like a hot knife thru butter. Also, altho I was a bit leary when I read the comments regarding the basket being somewhat flimsy, I see no problem there at all. Finally, for what it's worth, the motorized cutting unit is fairly heavy. Possibly that's why it's able to do such a fast, easy number on the CD's. Would definitely recommend this shredder unless your needs were to shred a huge number of documents each and every day. Oh, my name---disappointed----applies to a previous review, not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet and powerful","review":"I use this machine in my home office, so I don't make heavy demands on it. I bought it when my previous shredder died. This shredder is a nice upgrade from my previous 7-page shredder. It is powerful, quick, and--a nice bonus--much quieter. Just be sure to pay attention to the number of sheets you feed in at once (a gauge is on the front), or it (like any other shredder) will jam. The instant-off safety feature works as advertised and that would be important if you had little ones around. This is a good quality machine with enough heft to last for quite awhile. I'm pleased with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item! Quiet Motor! Reliable!","review":"The shipping was fast!The Shredder is amazing. Takes 12 sheets, just like it says.

I was disappointed when I shredded some items only to find that it really didn't cut into \\"confetti\\"; it cuts into strips. The strips are smaller than standard strip shredders (about 1 1/2 inch), but I thought it literally did cut into confetti-size. We're keeping it since it is not worth the shipping cost to send it back. If you are looking for true confetti size shredding, look at the \\"diamond\\" cut shredders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great shredder + flimsy bucket = total disappointment","review":"The top portion, the shredder itself, is very well designed, but the bucket is made of a flimsy plastic that is hardly able to hold the heavy top. If I could rate the parts separately, I would give 5 stars for the top and -3 points for the bucket. If it was not for the desperate desire to cut manufacturing costs [Fellowes, why not to try using a paper bucket next?], it could have been a great shredder. Unfortunately, the product overall is not worth its shipping price, not to mention the $100+ price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Shredder","review":"We have been shredding away bags of our unwanted receipts, bills, etc. and couldn't be happier with such a hard working and efficient shredder. I have also put UNOPENED credit card applications through it and it did the job great. I used to have to open the mail and take out the application portion to shred, but no longer!!! I just pop the whole thing in and it eats it up for me. I love this shredder! It even shreds credit cards and cd discs without any problem. The only drawback on this shredder is the fact that after continual use, it becomes overheated and you have to let the hardworking thing have a rest. Not unlike any of the rest of us, huh? Otherwise, this is a fabulous investment for the money and I give it a full 5 stars!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shreds Like Crazy","review":"The Fellowes Shredder PS-77Cs is exactly as it is advertised, efficient, quick and handles muitiple pages of paper, credit cards, and CD's.

Once you get past that, it really performs well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shredwell Eliminator of Hand Labor and Identity Theft","review":"So far, so good. I've had this shredder for less than two months. I use it infrequently, but it does the trick. Being able to get rid of paper, and more paper and all kinds of paper with my identity and info on it, is a real pleasure! In my work, I print out design comps that eventually need to be trashed. This baby is a real smooth operator, and takes the labor out of ripping or cutting up by hand. It's my first shredder, and if it performs well over time, I'll give it 10 stars! The removable drawer, makes it easy to dump the shreds, and static electricity is inevitable, so some pieces need to be swept up. This is no problem. In the 21st Century, this is a necessary device. An excellent purchase, I'd say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I am writing this review several months after purchase. It has been about ten months.

Boottom line is, its now garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"After reading all these \\"rave\\" reviews of this shredder, I decided to go ahead and buy it. Boy, was I disappointed. Why?1. The shredder itself is VERY heavy and buckles the flimsy plastic basket assembly below.2. It shreds very slowly.3. It can only handle approximately 8 pages at a time.4. It jams fairly easily.5. It jammed with the first DVD I shredded. The second DVD shredded fine.6. The basket is small and the shredded material is very messy (contains paper dust). It seems like the blades are not too sharp because the shredded pieces have a very rough texture.That said, I would NOT recommend this shredder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shredder but if you also use as a waste basket - a pain","review":"I bought to replace another Fellow 55S (I think was the model)that I had bought about 7 years ago..My old shredder was also a confetti (cross-cut) but it cut thepaper in about 1/2 of the size of this one..I never put more than a couple of sheets in at a time and thatis why my first shredder lasted so long.Likes:* The ability to shred CDs* The ability to shred credit cards.Dislikes:* My previous shredder had a opening so I could use it as awaste basket..so I now have to pull it out and push it backin which isn't really a fault but my personal preference.* The Power Head is very heavy, I think if it fell over ona hard surface it would break..* When you put the head on, make sure it \\"snaps\\" into place,it almost fell on my foot since I didn't use enough \\"force\\" tosnap the head into place the first time..ConclusionI do like the shredder and will probably buy another Fellowesin the future.Hope I get 7 years out of this one.. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for home or small office","review":"So far this shredder has worked flawlessly for me. I put 50 - 100 sheets through it everyday. No jams so far. I have also used it for about 8 cds and several old credit cards. I like the separate slot for cds/cards and the safety cut off if someone touches anywhere near the feeder.My only complaint is that the basket seems a little flimsy to support the weight of the cutting unit. Wheels would also help if you ever need to move it. For the price, I am well satisfied.Hint: You will want to use plastics bags to avoid a mess when you empty the basket."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good...","review":"I haven't put my shredder to the ultimate test yet (only short-time jobs) but so far it is functioning as advertised.

A few months ago, the metal \\"Safe Sense\\" strip just inside the opening of the shredder started peeling back, making it difficult to feed paper in without wiggling it around. Fellowes customer service recommended super glue and tape.Shoddy construction. Shoddy customer service. I don't recommend it at any price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with this item","review":"Does everything it says it will; Quiet. Not too large a unit, but good size paper bin which is easy to empty. I didn't realize what a crummy shredder I had until it broke, and now I'm happy it did because this one is so much better. It shreds several pages at a time, and handles credit cards and cd's without strain. The only flaw is that the plastic casing on which the shredder unit rests is flimsy, but this doesn't detract from its function or appearance. Time will tell if it affects durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shredder Ever!!","review":"I have been through many shredders and the motor quickly burned out of all of them. This is a workhorse. The basket seemed flimsy but it does not affect this product. I highly recommend this shredder for medium to heavy home duty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"Arrived promtply, as described. It does require shredder oil - if you don't have some, get some! Without it, the shredder keeps running after the paper is done.

Large enough to do the job and yet not look ugly. I am pleased I chose this one after looking at so choices.

Good product, so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Buy","review":"I always had shredders costing less than $50.00, thinking a shredder is a shredder. Not so, we burned out two less expensive shredders trying to cut up boxes of confidential files. This shredder is well worth the money. First of all it is bigger, about 25 inches tall, 10 inches wide, with a deep slide out waste bin, so no more lifting the top to change bags. Second, it is easy to move, has four sturdy casters and two hand slots on each end. Third, it cuts through 17 sheets without jamming and the top indicator lights turn red when bin is full or not centered. The shredder shuts off when bin is removed or bin is not centered. My unit came with oil and plastic bags. I would suggest purchasing bags that can be recycled, look for the recycle symbol, so the paper does not end up in the landfill."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I think this machine is great.

I have shredded unopened envelopes in the center of this shredder, credit cards all no problem. Only situation where something got stuck was an envelope unopened with a credit card inside. It took a little tugging in reverse but got it out no problem. Also purchased the lubricant. Very pleased and the pull out drawer is the best idea yet!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, But........","review":"Shredder seems very heavy duty. Will shred anything I put in. The only thing I don't like is the feed slot is in the front, which requires the paper to turn downwards to the blades. I generality will need to hold the paper with both hands and push it in to get it to go around the corner. I'm sure this is to make it harder for someone to get their fingers in there, but it makes the shredder harder to use. The shredder does have a smaller slot on top which feeds straight in for putting in credit cards and CD's. This works well for envelopes and smaller papers, avoiding the shove it in past the curve problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shredder for home use","review":"Does a great job of shredding and has convenient removal of collector.

The other major problem is that it states confetti, but the confetti is at least 1 1/2\\" long and 1/4\\" wide, which makes it very easy to read anything you shred including acct. numbers, or anything else.

But this one is. Really much more powerful than my old one making shredding go quickly. Rarely jams, has never overheated. Shreds CDs and credit cards no problem.Update: A year or so into owning it the plastic bin tipped over and a small piece broke off which is necessary to push a metal lever in to make it operate. I can only make it work now if I stealthfully insert something like a nail or a safety pin between the plastic bin and the lever each time I move the bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice shredder","review":"Just bought this shredder and it is perfect for our household needs.

With that said however, if your like me I wanted my first shredder to my last shredder, so I was willing to spend a little extra for quality. After many weeks of research this one got the best reviews and seemed like the best \\"bang for the buck\\" so I went for it and I am very pleased. It has great features like: 2 power buttons, the safety strip that shuts off when it is touched by skin, a reverse mode and an easy to empty tub, although it does tend to leave a few pieces of confetti on the floor.If this shredder is in your budget - go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Shredder!","review":"I am very pleased with the recent purchase of the PS-77C's Fellowes shredder.

I'd buy another if I needed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shredder, nice and quiet","review":"My favorite thing is how this shredder is quiet and calm sounding. None of the frantic, high-pitched noise of our old cheaper shredder. A few shreds of paper fall out when you empty the drawer, but I've never had a shredder that didn't, and it's not bad at all. The top of the shredder is flat, so we stack stuff there and do a bunch of shredding all at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"This machine terminates paper / credit cards etc. with ease.

Thanks to the other reviews here I had confidence it would shred what I need and more. The CDs and credit cards go down just fine. Several envelopes at once are also a breeze.The top is a bit heavy but not too bad if you're not moving it around a lot. The paper basket slides out easily without removing the top and overall it just does what it's supposed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defective Unit Followed by Crazy Mix-up","review":"I ordered the PS-77CS and received it within a few days. However, the unit I received was defective - the motor didn't work. Completely dead. I called the manufacturer and they quickly sent me out a replacement unit - but they sent the wrong model! It was a cheaper model that didn't have the child safety features we needed. Didn't realize it until I had it unpacked. I called the manufacturer again and although their records show that they shipped me the correct unit, they sent me another PS-77CS. I had to make two trips to the UPS Store to ship the 1) defective unit and the 2) wrong model back to the manufacturer. Finally, after about 3 weeks, I received the correct unit, and it works fine. It's able to chew up thick junk mail, envelopes and all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shredder, would give 4.5 stars","review":"I have owned several shredders in the past including other Fellowes models. This one far exceeds previous models. It shreds 12 pages as described, no problem. Safety bar nice when kids are around. It has unexpectedly stopped shredding when no fingers were around, had to clean the bar. Basket adequate and I like the window to view how full.Only negative is it does thermal shutdown after short period of time when doing a lot of shredding and you must wait until it cools to resume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shredder, flimsy lower section","review":"When I first got the shredder and took out the motor section from the box (the silver top part in picture) I could tell it was a sturdy motor. Nice and heavy.However, the lower section was a little disappointing as the plastic is cheap. This causes the whole thing to shake when you remove the waste basket.As far as shredding goes, it is GREAT! 12 pages no problem and ran it for a good 5 minutes without an issue. Manual says 12 minutes consecutively is max. I did a 4 inch stack of documents with no problem at all.My third shredder, first one that I spent over 50 bucks for, should be the last one I buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Why","review":"I really enjoyed the details of the concepts, theories and principles.

Each page is a cheesy diagram or photo with a summary of ideas. It looks like an outline you'd get at a seminar. As hard as I tried, I could not get a few good ideas out of it. The pictures are so poorly organized that I could not even relate the author's thoughts to the photos.All in all, you'd get more ideas out of an article from Black Belt magazine than you would from this whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maccoby the Mythmaker","review":"Convincingly argued? Sure. Convicingly documented? Hardly.There are two glaring flaws in this book:1) A complete lack of documentation. Claims that go contrary to traditional scholarship are seldom even backed up with addition primary source materials/quotes.2) A tendency to equate \\"probably\\" with \\"definitely.\\" Maccoby likes to deconstruct a particular incident in the NT (the Jerusalem council, for example) and explain why it couldn't possibly have happened this way. Then he explains (with qualifiers like \\"likely\\" and \\"probably\\") what he believes happened in reality. All fine and good. But later in the book, he often refers back to these reconstructions as now-established historical facts. Thus, his \\"probablies\\" become \\"definitelies.\\"It does raise some important issues, but doesn't resolve anything convincingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Mr. Maccoby","review":"I loved this book.

I need to read this book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book is a wonderful breakdown of how the message of Joshua ben Joseph was turned upside down from one of political rebellion to one of religious rebellion. That he was a rebel, no one questions; but, the belief that it was political rebellion has always been condemned by those who believe the writings of Paul. As my mother has so often said, \\"Paul, Paul, they preach too much Paul!\\" This author has proven my mother correct!

The Library Journal summary is quite fair, and Mr. John S. Ryan's review is ample and balanced. I have nothing to add except my enthusiastic endorsement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating, well-argued and iconoclastic","review":"Maccoby goes with relish after inconsistencies in NT writing and makes a well-argued case that Paul was not a Pharisee and basically founded Christianity as a new religion of his own design, incorporating elements of gnosticism, mystery religions and Judaism. The other, corresponding hypothesis (viz. that Jesus was, indeed, a Pharisee) is less well developed in this volume, but a previous book has taken care of it.This book is written for a lay audience, but even non-theologians would at times prefer a little more in-depth source material. Maccoby's style is a bit shoddy: It is surprising how many awkward sentence structures and poorly chosen words have crept into this book. For this reader, that weakness detracted somewhat from the pleasure of reading an otherwise absolutely captivating narrative, and raised the question: Where was the publisher's copy editor?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift idea","review":"I got these boots two years ago for my father-in-law not knowing if he would like them.

They thought they would be unable to get permission to use Jan & Dean's old songs in the movie, so Dean Torrence and his friends rerecorded Jan & Dean's songs, along with several Beach Boys songs. The TV movie eventually did end up using the original versions of Jan & Dean's hits. Anyway, this album features the rerecorded versions of the Jan & Dean and Beach Boys songs. They are far inferior to the original versions. While they try to come as close as possible to the sound of the old records, something is definitely missing. That missing ingredient is Jan Berry, the lead singer and mastermind behind the original recordings. He is totally absent from the proceedings, and that absence is definitely felt. Stick with the Jan & Dean originals from the 1960s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - Read The Fine Print","review":"My title - and the assignment of 1 star - is for the benefit of collector's of original charted singles.

Their reputation for excellence was well-established in my mind.However, when I got it home and played it I realized at once something was not quite right from track to track. Then I read the liner notes about the making of the TV movie Deadman's Curve, and saw the fine print on the reverse of the CD: \\"The majority of the songs on this compact disc were recorded for usage in the film Deadman's Curve.\\"Of course, that TV movie came out in 1978, so what you're getting here is, in essence, a soundtrack. From that perspective it's a nice little collection and, on that basis, combined with the informative liner notes written by Kevin Elliott in 1996, I'd award it 4 stars.What it did was teach me a lesson about reading fine print."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterful book on faith","review":"Kathlenn Kennedy Townsend's book is an illuminating and inspiring meditation on how churches are insulating themselves from the true spirit of compassion and generosity.

These Christians denominations, the Catholic Church included, are retreating deeper into a quasi-fundamentalism that negates their ability to discourse openly. She regrets that her own Roman Catholic Church has retreated from the openness its 2,400 bishops heralded four decades ago. She is right to do so. The price that church has paid is a vanishing clergy, declining numbers and rising mistrust. Ms. Townsend laments that many Christian denominations today seems less concerned with Good News for the poor than acquiring power to impose their views on one and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I loved this book so much, I gave copies to as many people as I could, especially the young adults in my family. Kathleen Townsend is clearly a committed believer, whose values have been formed by her Catholic faith, yet she has wonderful, clear insight into the failings, timidity, and missed opportunities of all the Churches and Church leaders in recent years. I wish I could give copies to every Catholic Bishop and Protestant Church leader in the country.

Looking forward to hearing more from this Wonderful talented lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 1 good song on this CD","review":"I am sorry but the only great song on this CD is \\"Nevertheless, I'm in love with You\\". If all the songs on this CD were as good as this one, she'd be a hit! It's terrible what she did to the \\"Theme to 2001\\". Buy it for the one song or pass on it.

This book is another one of her winners. Both the hero and heroine are rich, likable characters, and I found the idea of them being friends before lovers interesting. It worked very well, and neither was the plot something we've all heard before. \\"The Pretenders\\" was a refreshing read.

But, you'd probably enjoy this performance more if you only listened to the CD.The major problem with the DVD is that the director cuts to a different camera every 2-3 seconds!

Sadly, this was my worse purchase in recent years. Reasons:1. Each case has large scratch marks on the flip cover.2. One case's flip cover would not close properly when the Z22 is inside.3. The description \\"durable\\" is misleading because the case is hard plastic. If I drop it, I am sure there is a high probability of cracking it.4. The description \\"lets you use your organizer's functions while safely inside the case\\" is misleading because you would need to flip over the cover in order to use the Z22. So where is the safety?Summary: Given that the \\"Air case\\" is from Palm and my particular units are made in Japan, I would have expected better quality than what I got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Palm Protector","review":"The Air Case is great. I was a bit concerned at other reviewers' comments about it being difficult to open because I am both clumsy and arthritic.

I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little case!","review":"My mom and I both have these cases for our Z22's. It's nice because it protects your palm from being turned on or scratched in your purse, but it's not bulky. I have a leather zip case from Franklin Covey that I bought with my palm that is just collecting dust--it's too big and bulky. This case is simple and serves its purpose well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"I find this case difficult to use. Yes, it prevents scratches, but so would a safety vault- which is basically what this thing is. The case itself is absolutely impossible to get into; its a struggle every time.If you plan on being able to actually access your palm pilot, go with the soft case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best case for Palm Z22","review":"I actually bought this item as a temporary case the day I bought my Palm Z22 because it was the only one the store had for this model. I ended up really liking it though so now its the case I use everyday. Many people wrote hard to open and get open but its not hard at all. As far as getting the Palm out since the stylus and charge/sync plug is accessible while the palm is in it there is really no reason to take it out (which isn't too difficult if you wanted to anyway). I just gently flip the cover up and use it while it stays in there. Definately a great case. Even if it gets scratched which mine hasn't yet you flip the cover up so it doesnt matter. I like the way it looks too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great protection from dirt and scratches","review":"This Z22 Air Case is made of clear acrylic. It fits the Z22 perfectly and adds only a tiny amount to the size of the device. I have used it for 2 months so far, and it protects my Palm from the dirt and scratches of sliding around in my purse. The hinges are holding up just fine as is the closing tab. It flips open easily and closes securly. I even attached the grafitti help stickers that came with the Z22 the the inside of the case lid so I can reference quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Timbuk2 case instead","review":"After looking at reviews for this case and the air case for the Z22, I wasn't impressed by either. The air case either opens too easily or not easily enough, the metal case gets scratched up and opens on the left side (which is awkward for a right-handed or small-handed person), and neither one protects the charger port on the palm. I found a case by Timbuk2 called the 2way that holds my palm PERFECTLY. It's made from ballistic fabric, has room for cards and straps to a backpack or purse strap. It's lightweight and secures with velcro. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to protect their palm in style without paying a lot or getting a case not made for the z22 that doesn't fit.Here are links to Timbuk2's product:http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords;=2way+timbuk2&x;=0&y;=0http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/accessories/accessory-cases/2way"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as expected","review":"THIS BOOK IS AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS.

After putting the canopy back on and all of the other stuff Hurricane Rita came to visit us three days later. As the storm was still a half day away and it was only a tropical storm at the time it hit us, I thought I could wait until the morning to disassemble the pieces. Boy was I wrong! When I woke up in the morning it looked like a mangled scrap heap of metal. Just a 15 to 20mph wind took it right down.

There are two points to heed if you are doing wiring for them.The phone takes in telco lines two at a time. One connecting cable/wire carries lines 1 and 2, and the second carries 3 and 4. DO NOT FEED a dedicated fax line nor a DSL line to line one (first cable, inner pair of wires in a 4-wire jack/plug). Leave that as plain as you can since it seems to be the administrative line for the system.If you're feeding a line with DSL into this puppy, it REQUIRES a DSL filter on the line. Feed DSL in on line 3 (the inner pair of the second cable) as a telco DSL filter will filter the inner pair of line 3 and pass through on line four (the outer pair). That will make this phone's setup easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singer better than songs","review":"Clearly among the many influenced by the now senior citizen, Streisand, Debbie Shapiro Gravitte, stands out as an old fashioned singer who, in the style of Garland, Merman, and the happily still available Barbra, can handle a wide variety of material with aplomb. As with the others mentioned, she seems to be at her best with the songs that give her a chance to belt it outto the balconies, but also, like the others, she can give heart to a ballad as well. In this album, some of the material gives her a chance to be outstanding, a few fail her, but overall, she makes the most of what is given her.

It lacks the ingenuity that usually encompasses his music, the originality and flavor that brought him his well deserved fame in the Disney classics.

They had questions concerning cantatas, special concerts, liturgical dancing, and drama. Each time, they decided to find out what their congregation wanted.Such a church may become very popular, but it has not discovered what worship is nor why it should be done.

Easily the worst Black lace book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"This book is probably the most concentrated source of material on the Great Locomotive Chase that I have ever seen, and yet is presented in a highly readable format. Mr. Bogle has provided an impressive array of data on both engines and many rare photos of them from the 19th century up until today, as well as a prodigious amount on the participants themselves. Paintings and drawings by Wilbur Kurtz graphically illustrate key events in the raid and bring to life an event that today still captures the imagination. With chapters devoted to the films made of this event and of the Medal of Honor (first awarded to the raid participants), this book is guaranteed to provide many hours of fascinating reading for not only the railfan or modeler but also the Civil War historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"general and texas","review":"The information in this book is not correct. In fact, the author provides references that do not in any way, shape, or form reflect what he writes. Because some of Andrews Raiders were from our area of Ohio, I was very interested.

I don't have the album myself but it appears to be all the live songs from the 12 Picks & Loaded Deck album, although it would appear that this album like the other two had little if any input from Ace himself.

That was the fall of '95"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back In The New York Groove!","review":"As a HUGE Ace fan I am always so excited when new material surfaces and went out to buy this on Tuesday when it came out. The 3D cover is AWESOME!! The Amazon website just cannot do it justice. The best part is that Megaforce used 2 covers, the 3D one and a 'normal' one underneath so you can frame the amazing 3D photo of Ace in action without messing up the look of the CD! COOL!! Ace is just an amazing musician live and this album really captures him at his most rockin'. Stand out tracks have to be \\"Rip It Out\\" and my personal favorite, \\"NY Groove\\". This album really takes you back to the good ole days of rock 'n' roll. Legendary stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unnecessary release","review":"actually this is a rip off, commercialy spoken and I regret buying it, too hastily, eager waiting for new material, which it isn't. Not even the packaging is new. Before 2 compilationalbums were released, \\"12 Picks\\" and \\"Loaded Deck\\" and all the songs stem from those compilations. Earlier an original band live EP (on vinyl) has seen the daylight \\"4 + 1\\", four live tracks and a new studiotrack. They are already present on the aforementioned compilations. So why this album? Finally despite its title not all songs are from live performances: \\"One plus one\\" and \\"Give it to me anyway\\" are just plain studiorecordings. So nothing is gained by releasing or buying an album like this. Stick to \\"12 Picks\\" and/or \\"Loaded Deck\\" CDs and you have all the goods. Only for those who cannot afford these other CDs might it have to offer a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Record","review":"A good feel for a live recording.

Enchanting...","review":"I have had the pleasure to listen to many a musical score. This is one of the best - if not THE best that I have ever heard. The best way to listen to this piece is in a darkened room with your eyes closed - as at the first few notes, you are transported into another world filled with emotion and hautingly beautiful melody. Never has a musical piece affected me more \\"physically\\" than the music of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\". As I lay in the dark with my eyes closed, transported to that other world, I felt the power of the music in my soul. The feeling was that of having the air sucked out of your lungs - but not the normal uncomfortable experience. This is a similar feeling I experienced after viewing the film for the first time and every time after that. I truly recommend this music to anyone who has a love and appreciation for this score and for the movie that it was made for. This is a true classic that should never be lost......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting nostalgic and stirring","review":"This soundtrack, so unlike the bombastic \\"tear jerking\\" crap passed off today, sucks you in and is almost too stirring.

I adore To Kill a Mockingbird.......a rare instance in which a beloved, flawless novel is made into an equally beloved, flawless movie. I had always admired the music in the film and thought how well it complemented the theme of the movie, and perfectly captured the atmosphere. I had no idea a soundtrack even existed......I found it on accident and fell in love with it immediately. The main theme is sheer perfection......it reminds me of Atticus, Scout, Jem, and all of the other beloved characters of Maycomb County. It brings back both the movie and book vividly....not to mention how wonderfully it is composed. What a great soundtrack....if you loved tkam get this soundtrack!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great soundtracks","review":"We had a chance to watch this movie from a DVD a while back. About three seconds in, during the opening credits, I made a note to myself to get the soundtrack. This is one of those perfect examples of really good music that complements the movie rather than upstaging it.Just watch Mockingbird's opening credits in widescreen. It's amazing how well the music establishes the tone of the whole film in a split second. The southern setting, the tension of the plot, the coming-of-age theme... it's good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor recording of a wonderful score","review":"This is one of the most beautiful film scores ever written. The CD however is a disaster. It is poorly recorded with terrible sound. The stereo seems to be electronically processed. The original LP is infinitely superior in sound and quality although the contents are identical. If you are fortunate enough to own the original LP, do not replace it with this CD. This is one case in which the CD ani't worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most beloved film scores ever.","review":"Consider yourself a serious film score collector? If so, there are certain film scores which must be in your collection. This is one of them. Not only does this score contain one of the most beautiful melodies ever written for film, it is also Elmer Bernstein's greatest work. In TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, Bernstein does an incredible thing. He imagines a world through the eyes of a child and skillfully succeeds in bringing it to life. This is not, necessarily, childhood the way it is but more childhood the way we remember it; with all it's joy and sadness, playfullness and pain. In the history of film music, rarely, if ever, has anyone written such an emotionally resonant work. This is truly a masterpiece. You are not allowed to miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait, this is an overhaul manual?","review":"This is an overhaul manual? I could have sworn it read like the Sunday comics with its pictures and captions. There is hardly enough beef in this book to help anyone rebuild an engine. Maybe if you had a NASCAR crew chief with 30 years of experience on your side you'd be able to rebuild an engine with this guide, but otherwise it's useless. At least I borrowed the book from a library and didn't waste my money. There's not enough detail, not enough clarity, and the instructions are vague. It spends like the first 5 chapters discussing how to use a micrometer and know how to build your own workbench. If I wanted to build a garage - I'll get my dad to help or a Bob Vila book, thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a Novice","review":"I am rebuilding a 1966 Mustang with no prior experience.

As some of the other commenters have stated, this book will not teach you how to trade. However I would not trade without reading this book first. Richard Waldron has done a wonderful job in explaining something as complex as futures trading to the person of average intelligence like myself.The Hillary Clinton chapter is worth reading, he states how he was not a Hillary Clinton fan, but after researching her 1000 to 100k in cattle futures he sees that the media was trying to smear her.

This album is one thing short of being a classic and that is that an original member is alive, and not around. Warren and Derek are nothing short of being the best duo in decades, and Dickey could have been at the center. Gregg hasn't sounded this good and focused in years, Jaimo/Butch/Marc lay a great foundation, and Oteil? Buy this puppy for the bass line, Oteil glides and slides."},{"rating":"2","title":"like classic early Allmans","review":"When I first got this, I played it for my wife, asking her to guess who it is. \\"Early Allmans?\\" was her response, which is as good a description as I can provide. This does indeed remind me of the pre-Fillmore albums--tight arrangements of songs honed through live performance that loosen up on the instrumental passages. The late Berry Oakley's occasional vocals in that era (pre-dating Dickie Betts' emergence as a vocalist and writer) contributed to the band's blues feeling as does Warren Haynes here. An interesting twist--the Rolling Stones started as a blues band (influencing the Allmans), then began writing pop tunes such as \\"Heart of Stone,\\" which the Allmans then remake as a great blues number here. I can recommend this album without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best thing to hit the racks in years!!!","review":"This Album contains some of the most soulful and emotionally driven licks I have ever heard.

I saw the band last friday and it was one of the best sets I have seen in a while. The band looks happy and at ease and the music was excellent. This album only serves to bolster the credibility of this recent line up. The music is amazing and true to the original ABB feeling. The three albums from 1989 and the early 90s were great, but this is a whole different league! Dust off some space on the shelf between Idlewild South, Eat a Peach and Live at the Fillmore East!! Buy this one, its a must have!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hittin' The Note - Hard","review":"I've just purchased \\"Hittin' The Note\\" and I can't stop listening to it. \\"Firing Line\\" and \\"High Cost of Low Living\\" are easily two of the best songs written in recent years. The musical interplay is tighter and more relaxed than it has been in years. Having seen ABB live with both the Betts/Haynes guitar frontline and the Haynes/Trucks frontline I can say that they are two entirely different animals. Betts and his contributions have been and always will be important but Hittin' The Note lacks nothing due to his abscence. In fact, and this is not to say the Betts held them back but, the Haynes/Trucks duo seems to allow ABB to take the next step. Haynes/Trucks is every bit as good a Allman (Duane)/Betts while being different.\\"Old Friend\\" is easily my favorite song on the album, both lyrically and musically. As a blues/rock guitar player myself, it is one of those songs that makes you wish you could write that well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"The songs here are lackluster and Greg sounds weary.

I've followed this band thru every incarnation they've had and they have the best line up since before Dwayne died. Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks both are monsters and you'll notice that when they play live, Derek is the first slide player that's stood by Greg's organ since Dwaynes death. What a compliment to Derek!!If your a fan already, you'll be a bigger one after listening to this cd. If your not a fan, listen to it loud and you'll become one. They are tighter and are playing the best I've heard since Eat A Peach. The best thing about this is it's new songs (you might have heard some of them if you've seen them live recently) that stand tall next to the rest of their catalog which is one of the greatest catalogs in rock history.

You'll be very glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real deal.","review":"This is the real deal.No change/decline, as with post-Cream/Dominos Clapton; or as with mid-70's Jethro Tull; or as with post-Traffic Winwood.This is the Allman Brothers.What more needs to be said?You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The inner truth surfaces in an easy-read style","review":"Ted Williams reveals a lot about his personality and lifestyle that the media failed to recognize.

It has become apparent that the Combine-o-Tron 2000 has placed Mr. Krupp's mind in Melvin Sneedy's body and vice versa. George Beard suggests that Melvin (now Mr. Melvin - it's rather complicated) construct a time machine to put everything right. But, when Kruppy the Kid (I told you it was complicated!) becomes Captain Underpants, things go from bad to worse!OK, if that description sounds very silly...well, it should.

My son also thought that George and Harold were cool for getting bad grades, getting sent to the office and being mean. Kids are already rude enough these days both to each other and to teachers and parents. This book is sending the WRONG message- that it's okay to be rude, disrespectful, mean and crude.

I cant wait for the 8 Captain Underpants Book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain Underpants Lost Its Humor","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Captain Underpants books. Ever since the fifth book came out, I've been dying for the sixth one to come out. When I finally got to read it, I was disappointed. First of all, George and Harold's teacher is now extremely nice. She was much funnier when she was extremely mean. Second of all, Melvin's hamster is now a regular in the series. New characters always make things worse, even if it is a hamster. Third of all, the book focused too much on Melvin. Not enough George and Harold."},{"rating":"1","title":"under wear man","review":"This book was cool because if you had a guy in town that flew in his under pants that would be awsome.

Both have been reading CU on their own since 1st grade. We have them all in their goopy, gross gloriousness. They're always good to go back to EXCEPT they are poorly bound(I mean the paperback ones) and fall apart and ours are all taped together. Boo for the binding, yahoo for the silly content that keeps two wild things still enough to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Underpants and the Big, Bad, Battle of the Bionic Booger Boy, Part I, The Night of the Nasty Nostril Nuggets","review":"I think this book was a laugh out loud funny book that kids will enjoy. Captain Underpants fights a Bionic Booger Boy named Melvin Sneedly. My favorite part was when the hamster started to spank Melvin. I also love the Flip-O-Rama pages that makes the cartoons look like they are in motion. George and Harold are believable to me because I know kids in real life who act like they do, but we know they are no such things as Bionic Booger Boys or Nasty Nostril Nuggets. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys laughing at gross things!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jalen's Review","review":"All superheros have capes but do they all have pants?

I got it yesterday and skipped threw it not laughing once out loud or in my head. This might have to be the worst Captain Underpants to come out.... (although the name is very clever ;-) ) If you like the Captain Underpants series, i would recomend you read 'The Day My Butt Went Phsyco' by Andy Girfith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brief and helpful.","review":"I used this book (an older edition) on my first trip to New York City and I found it very succinct and helpful. If you don't want lengthy descriptions and lots of historical background, this the book for you. It gets to the point about some of the \\"must sees\\" and \\"shouldn't miss\\", as well as warning you about some cultural differences. The Essential series is also great because it's thin and lightweight, yet some color pictures so that you can recognize some of the sites you're searching the skyline for."},{"rating":"2","title":"YUMMMMM!!","review":"Ok, I have to admit when I opened up the box...they made ME hungry!! These treats are the best I've found and I've yet to find a dog that doesn't like them. I got these for my dog after watching a program about overweight animals. You don't feel guilty about giving your pal a treat every once in awhile with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Stick with the Peanut Butter Molasses Ones","review":"I bought these to save a few bucks, (why do the PB/M ones cost so much more?) but my picky little rescue girl won't eat them.

Now I've got a case of them that will be donated to the local shelter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Fat Dog Biscuits","review":"Blue Dog Bakery came recommended from one of my dog newsletters that I think highly of. I had not heard of Blue Dog Bakery until then. By buying 6 boxes at a time, the price per box is more reasonable than the Mother Hubbard Large Biscuit 4lb. bag I was using. My dog has certainly been happy with these biscuits and because it is low fat it is a good choice. It is important to not let our dogs put on extra weight for a variety of reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Dog - A great dog biscuit","review":"This is the only dog biscuit that my large dog absolutely loves. They're all natural and low fat, which is great, but he obviously loves them for the taste as he eagerly takes them when offered. This is in contrast to the large, name brand plain biscuits which must smell like sawdust to him as he takes them reluctantly or just walks away. Each Blue Dog box contains a variety of animal shapes and sizes and I prefer the ones that have four flavors in each box. They're also available through Amazon at a much better price than PetSmart which inexplicably stopped carrying such a quality product. My dog and I would highly recommend Blue Dog biscuits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corgi's Love them","review":"My two Corgi's love them. I have given them to pet lover friends and they have ordered. This is an awesome product."},{"rating":"2","title":"My dogs love these!!!","review":"After trying just about every brand out there, I gave these a try. Not only are they low fat and natural but both of my very picky dogs LOVE THEM! When you open the box, they actually smell really good. I would recommend these to any dog owner but especially if your dog is finicky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to hard to eat.","review":"We started buying blue dog treats about a year or so ago. But somethings changed, now the treats are hard as rocks. I use to just break up the big cookies with my hands, now I have to break them over a table. I thought maybe I had gotten hold of an old box so I bought a new box and come to find out these are just as hard. I know this may cause my dogs problems, I went to the Blue Dog website to see about contacting the company, but they don't have a way to contact them. maybe they just don't want to answer any questions, Too bad, Now I have to find another treat for my dogs.

They ate them for a few days, then I started discovering them around the garden. Unfortunately, they didn't like them. Others have written about how good they smell, that they crumble easily etc - I don't think they're any different than any other dog biscuit. They're large, but they break into pieces just fine (without crumbling). I'd suggest you buy a single box to see if your dog actually likes them."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad face","review":"i was so excited to give these treats to my dog. she only nibbled on it for a second before walking away from it. she doesn't like any of the flavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are great dog snacks!","review":"My border collie will no longer eat a snack unless it is one of the Blue Dog Bakery snacks. Offered a regular snack, he sniffs and walks away. This is a very smart dog and he knows what he likes.Honestly, once you open the package, you will understand. It smells good. Have you ever opened a dog snack and thought it smelled like freshly baked cookies? These do. I never, ever, imagined that dog snacks could smell so good.Lucky they don't make cat snacks.The only flaw with this product is that they do go stale. I ordered a lot of a bunch of flavors on a Friday sale, I think, and the last box of six smelled a little stale to me. The dog did not mind at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my dog ill","review":"It took me awhile to narrow it down, but I finally realized that these biscuits were giving my dog diarrhea.

I ask her if she wants to go outside and she just looks at me. I ask her if she wants a dog biscuit and she sticks her tongue out.

I subscribe and save he pb molasses.

After I read it I looked her up and found out that she had since had this one published and I rushed to buy it. Huge disappointment. I've only gotten a hundred pages into it and it may turn out to be worth the effort but so far I can't get interested in it. It's as someone else said -- it doesn't even seem to have been written by the same person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like her first work","review":"I must say this book is not a page turner like Cane River. I started reading it in 2010 and today I am only on page 147. However, in between I have read 23 books. So it is basically going on a year. I will keep and recommend Cane River, but this one is totally up to the reader. Maybe I'll pick it up again in a few months and try one more time to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red River","review":"This was a very educational and interesting book. Everyone should read it to get the idea of what a group of men and their families went through in order to provide an education (learning to read) for their children. We take a lot for granted now days, and this book reminds us that a lot of blood was spilled needessly to secure basic freedoms we now enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red RIver by Lalita Tademy","review":"I enjoyed Red River, it was well written. The story told was not only based on true events but of real people, Ms. Tademy's ancestors. Many autobiography, non-ficton books I have read (I felt) did not make the characters come alive as in Red River. This book not only tells of a family trying to survive and their love to each other, but of a time in our history that we need to remember inorder to ensure that everyone has a right to be treated as human beings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red River--a hit","review":"Red River, like Cane River, led me into the world of slavery, brought awareness of the mistreatment so human beings, and enlightened me in the struggle of African Americans to maintain dignity.

While I admire author for tackling such a huge story, there was little to no character development. This story follows 3 generations and just as you really start to get into one generation, you skip to the next. The unfortunate thing is that 2 characters of the story survive for at least 3 generations yet they were barely mentioned after the first third of the book. I would have rather the book be written in the first person of these two characters. I wanted to like this book, but I just could not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Tademy Novel","review":"When I first saw this novel, I was thrilled because I loved Lalita Tademy's first novel Cane River so much.

The reader felt very much a part of the scenes around the Colfax court house. Once that scene passed, the book droned on for hundreds of pages with little stories about various family members to the point of utter boredom. I was waiting for a riveting ending but it just abruptly ended. Big disappointment, for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read...","review":"I haven't had the opportunity to read this yet but if you loved Cane River, then i believe you will love Red River as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"This book has neither fulfilled my expectations on Degas nor provided his most distinguished paintings.

I had to return this item back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had expected","review":"Right off the bat, I'm going to admit to being only semi-literate, computer-wise. That said, I have had some experience with USB speakers. I was looking for something like I had used before, ie, one where both power and audio signal were transmitted through the USB port. This was not that. And it doesn't say that anywhere in the \\"specs\\" (which I put in \\"quotes\\" because the specification list offered here is almost non-existent). Plus, the volume is not as loud as my old, conventionally powered speakers.Spend a few extra bucks, and get a set of speakers from sellers whom are courteous enough to list ALL the specs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick fix...","review":"I just needed a quick fix to substitute highs until I made my \\"Big\\" purchase to enhance my digital studio.

I didn't want to buy anything permanent, because we will be updating this bathroom in the next few months, so I needed something that would hold up some suction cup trays I bought at BB&B. I use four total on each tray and they hold up beautifully. I think two would probably be enough for the weight, but the shape of the trays need two to keep them from tipping forward and back. I recommend these if you have a bathroom that won't take suction cups. Make sure you give them several hours to stick before you add weight, because they seem to do better that way. However, they don't stick to latex paint very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell off the first day!","review":"I've used enough command hooks in my life, I actually follow the directions. I apply it, I let it sit, I do the whole thing. I followed those same instructions. I was hanging this on our bathroom door as a temporary hook until we could decide on a more permanent rack to put on the door. It fell down within 48 hours of me hanging the first item on it. It was a towel, a rather thin Kohls towel. Obviously I'm not satisfied. Clearly it wasn't water-resistant enough to muscle through my steamy bathroom holding a thin towel."},{"rating":"2","title":"You know what these do","review":"These are the best of this type of hook, if you are looking, you know what these are.I use these in my shower on the tile walls, hold everything I need, no falling down.

Also I think who ever created this game should stick to coloring books because you sure don't know know anything about making a game. You waste people money and time. Your Spirits & Spells does not have a walkthrough because it a real boring, stupid game.

I bought this book, because it was a requirement for my college lesson but I really think it is possible to do it on your own.As I said, if you have at least the knowledge about grammar and average voc. skills.Somebody who corrects the written parts would help a lot.4 Stars because I didn't learn much more.

By far one of the best baking books!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent even for a beginner","review":"I had absolutely no idea what cutwork was until I got Darlenes book and took her class.

It managed to achieve a depth rarely found in the field, and maintain it far longer than most of the other important series. Neil Gaiman is a true genius, and this volume certainly displays that. Illustrated mostly by my favorite Sandman artist, Micheal Zulli (and containing excellent work by Jon J. Muth and Charles Vess), The Wake is a grand and emotional ending to a superb series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anticlimactic.","review":"(Warning: Contains spoilers..) After reading \\"The Kindly Ones\\", I was very excited to find out how The Sandman series would end. The first three issues contained in this volume introduce the new Dream, while many characters pay their respects to the previous version we had (sort of) gotten to know over the years. The first half was very promising & I looked forward to the rest. My problem, which explains the low rating, is that the final three issues completely break away from the previous storyline to deliver three self-contained stories that completely lose the momentum. I couldn't help but feel cheated, especially since there are so many more stories about these characters (particularly The Endless) that could & should have been told. Personally, I would have been more satisfied had the story ended right as the new Dream is meeting his siblings for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"by a landslide, this is the worst Sandman","review":"up until a few weeks ago, i never imagined in my wildest dreams that a volume of the sandman could by bad. then i read the train wreck that is VOLUME 10: THE WAKE. i'm not saying that this is bad by neil gaiman's standards, i'm saying this is bad by all standards. i didn't know gaiman could be this boring. all this book is is a bunch of characters from past books reminiscing (in the vaguest sense) about who the sandman as an idea really is...or was...or something. no loose-ends are tied up (were there even loose-ends to begin with?), and there's no sense of closure because you don't care about what anyone's saying. a whole book exploring the new sandman and his relationship with the family would have been way better.the art is AMAZING, but it doesn't save the story (not even a visual appearance by batman saves it).only get this if you're an obsessive-compulsive completest who must have every volume in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatiful story and art, confusing additional stories","review":"This book follows the death of Dream. I like how this book answered several questions from the previous book. I LOVED The art. Every artist had his own style and it was all diverse and beautiful! However, I don't understand what the story about the Chinese emperor had ANYTHING to do with the plot. Or the story after it? Did Gaiman throw that in as leftovers from the previous issues? Interesting stories on their own, but they don't fit in with the Dream series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sandman ends","review":"This collection concludes the original run of the Sandman. It is a fitting finish to the series, with enjoyable stories and some remarkable artwork.John Muth's \\"Exiles\\" is next to last in the book, and is a real treat. Part of its topic, an extreme of loyalty, is quielty touching. The look of this piece, however, is what makes it, ink-drawing in a style inspired by Asian classics. The style is quite unlike the watercolors that Muth has used so well (e.g. in Moonshadow), except in its wonderful expressiveness.The final piece in this book, \\"The Tempest\\" returns to an earlier story and Shakespeare and concludes it. Charles Vess illustrated this in the manner of which he is master: elegant pen work and muted color.\\"Wake\\" is a satisfying end to the original series. Even after the series' long run, it maintains the highest standards of artwork and storytelling. If you enjoy comics at all, you're sure to enjoy at least parts of this.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great atmosphere","review":"I first saw a few clips of this DVD on YouTube, then I decided to purchase it. I have not regretted my purchase. The atmosphere of the church hall in which Starobin delivers the music of Sor and Giuliani is completely apt for this innocent and beautiful music played on an equally beautiful period instrument. My only regrets are (a) that we did not really see any attractive footage of \\"historic London\\", beyond the pretty country lane outside the church, and (b)that the DVD was not actually a bit longer. David Starobin could have spoken about the pieces and their history a little more, too, but a serious student will find this information through other resources.

It often gives several for different uses of the same word. That's why I gave it 4 stars. Now for the negative side.

YUK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time And Money On This Book!","review":"Embedded within Personal Injuries is what could have been an interesting plot. HOWEVER, Turow feels it necessary to describe in excrutiating detail every thought, every feeling, every rationale for these thoughts and feelings of every major and minor character in this book. As a consequence, I feel that I, personally, have suffered a personal injury trying to force myself to read Turow's latest effort. Finally, after making myself read about 1/3 of the book, my disgust with Personal Injuries won out and I gave up on it. It's possible that people who read books mainly for in-depth characterizations versus plot will enjoy this book. But,for me, the following saying was the basis for my decision to not waste any more time reading this book, 'so many books, so liitle time.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turow did great on this one!","review":"Turow changed tracks a little on this one and maybe that's why the readers are confused. No, this is not a mystery thriller, but a well-written novel that's strength is in its characters and vivid imagery. I can just picture Feaver and Evon in my mind, as well as Stan, the Judges and the rest. . .I think Turow did a fine job here my moving his writing up a notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow paced, couldn't finish it","review":"I was looking forward to this book and have read all of Turow's previous novels. What a let down! I can name on one hand the number of books I have not finished reading and Personal Injuries has now become one of them. In addition to the uninteresting characters and Turow's odd switches from 1st to 3rd person, I found it difficult to follow the story line when he refered to his characters by their full name, then first name and finally, their last name. I sometimes thought he was referring to three different people. Very confusing! Glad I checked it out at the library and did not purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too detailed about small things","review":"This wasn't about personal injury, it was about trapping crooked judges. So it's not a trial book. Should have read more reviews before ordering. I only got through it so I could see how it ended, but it was really a waste of my time. Turow has too many stories told by too many characters that do nothing toward the plot of the book but just burn up pages and time. Turow has written some really good books but this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted the book to be good, but it was only slow, boring.","review":"I really have enjoyed Turow's books, but this one is so slow and boring.

The character Robbie Feaver and the narrator have no appeal. I believe the book will sell based on Turow's past efforts. I am happy to say that I did not pay for the book but used my local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"a major let-down versus his earlier works","review":"i have generally stayed up all night to finish a just-released scott turow novel. this time, he put me to sleep four nights in a row! the story never seemed to get out of low gear -- dull and unexciting are the words that come to mind. i finally gave up at the half-way mark. don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too dull and plodding to be worth a reader's time.","review":"Turow is not a bad writer--but that's not exactly a selling point. Here, his story bogs down terribly in situations where there is nothing at stake we can care about, and no real jeopardy. The main female character--supposedly tough and no-nonsense, is flummoxed immediately by the protagonist, and we cannot imagine why. There is also a nauseating transparent attempt to make the protagonist more likeable, in the form of a wife with ALS, The society of ALS sufferers should really protest being used as an author's desperate attempt at manipulating his reader's emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"The jury is in; the book is a liability.","review":"Expecting the best out of Turow, I was disappointed with this lastest outing. He has set such a high standard, that this book does not come close. The plot is contrived and did not hold my interest. The characters in the book do not have the intensity of previous Turow plots. The book seemed to string along a set of disjoint events and it certainly did not have a killer ending. I have read more thrilling material in the newspaper. I recommend that you do not take this case and pass on to the next thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Halcyon","review":"I have read all of Turow's books, and know that it takes time to get into the rhythm of his distinctive prose. But I never connected with Personal Injuries. I never failed to fall asleep after reading six or seven pages, no matter the time of day. I was persistent, however, and read it to the end. Now what am I going to do to help me fall asleep? Perhaps some Pushkin?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow read","review":"I am still fighting page by page to finish Turow's latest. While his character development is interesting and the story line had a chance to be a real page turner, I keep getting lost. It is not that it twists and turns to keep the reader's interest it just rambles. I think I'll not finish this one and wait a long time before I try another dose of Turow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment......","review":"The latest of Turow's fiction writing is dull, bumbling and poorly executed. A story line that has possibilities is mired in the most convoluted and inane writing. As a Chicago lawyer myself, I would love to applaud this book.........but can only wonder what is wrong with Turow. The book is that bad. This book is a severe disappointment from an author who has had great inspiration in the past. I do not plan to read another of his books unless his inspiration and abilities rocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personal Sleep Coach","review":"This book is just awful. The characters are underdeveloped. Evon and Robbie have NO CHEMISTRY at all. Sexual chemistry? What are you talking about?I was only half way through this book and I want to throw it out. After just a chapter, I'm falling asleep again. But I was determined to finish this book as awful as it was.This book was a waste of money. The plot was unoriginal and dull. Robbie dies in the end, big freaking deal, you are glad he dies, he was as dull as Evon and the rest of the castHORRIBLE BOOK, DO NOT BUY unless u want to use the book as a firelog, that I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turow's Worst","review":"I've enjoyed Scott Turow's fiction. He's more literate, thoughtful, and thought-provoking than John Grisham and the rest of the pack. But this effort was awful -- I gave up about a quarter of the way through; the plot failed to grab me and, more important, life's too short to waste time with these unpleasant and uninteresting characters. I listened to the audio version, and I agree completely with the comment below about Ken Howard's poor job as a reader. I doubt that I would have gone much farther with a different reader, but Howard's dreary and uninspired style sent me straight to the exit. Giving up on this very disappointing novel made me feel that I'd stopped hitting my head against a wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book","review":"This book was horrible. The characters are unbelievable and unlikable. It's very slow reading. I forced myself to read it because I've enjoyed Turow's other books. Save yourself the money and don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much happens but it takes many pages to not happen.","review":"This was my first novel by this author and it will be the last novel I purchase by him. The characterization was non-existent, the plot was never engrossing enough to fully draw you in and the story would have played better if it had been told at a faster pace. Accentuating the slow pace of the book was the superdivision of chapters into months, which only made the feeling that this story was taking forever to unfold that much worse. Although I could see elements of storytelling in this novel which indicate that the author can spin a good yarn, he missed entirely for my taste in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio version became confusing","review":"CD/abridged: It was okay. The narrator is in first person, but he relates conversations and events that he was not witness to. It's a strange way of writing. I'm not really recommending the audio, even though Joe Mantegna did a wonderful job of narration. There were a lot of characters between the FBI agents and so-to-be indite-es. I did have to rewind and go back to earlier discs to double-check names and characters. If you're going to read it try the book version instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as I remember!","review":"I have recently picked up the Turow books again after having first read them years ago and am finding them even better now. This is a great story and I love these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"great writing, characters, and plot weaker on plot turns","review":"This is a terrific character study with a strong, captivating plot. It is also thought provoking in terms of the prosecutorial amorality of the criminal justice system. My only disappointment was that it did not have the plot twists and shocks that are found in typical mysteries or other legal thrillers --including several of Mr. Turow's other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent character study","review":"I would have preferred a different ending, and the Kimble County conceit strikes me as a strange device. Why not come out and say Chicago? (I know Turow claims KC is a combination of a variety of cities, but it sure reads like Chicago to me.) The story might not be as engrossing as Turow's previous works, but the characters were the stars here, and they were excellent. Even the minor players were well drawn. I don't agree with the criticism about too many people to keep track of. If you've ever read a Russian novel, this was just small potatoes. Definitely worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the author wasn't interested in this one","review":"I have read and enjoyed Turow's other books, but I gave up on this one half way through. The narrative is confusing, the characters are unidimensional, and the plot is boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, compelling, moving - Turow is a master","review":"Scott Turow does not write John Grisham novels. Many of us who read Turow read him because he doesn't churn out the the lowbrow, predictable pablum of other popular genre writers. Personal Injuries is magnificent - filled with complex, multi-faceted characters who are never entirely good or evil but, like most of us, somewhere in-between. The character of Robbie Feaver kept surprising me and challenging my initial perceptions (kinda like some of the people in my own life, how 'bout that!). I found the plot involving corrupt judges to be absolutely compelling and helped immeasurably by Turow's obvious experience with similar circumstances. I finished the novel last night and couldn't help but weep while reading the final 20 pages. Not only did I find the conclusion moving but the novel and the challenges of its characters left me with questions about my own life to think about. Now, what more could I ask of a piece of fiction?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating character study and procedural-style novel","review":"Turow's latest is a superb character study that hooked me a lot more than his last book (Laws of Our Fathers). The characters of Feaver, Evon and Stan Sennett were fascinating to follow in their twists, turns and moral and legal dilemmas. Turow suffers with some critics because his books are perceived as \\"genre\\" fiction rather than the serious, mainstream novels of contemporary life they're clearly intended to be. Similarly, some readers seem to expect John Grisham-style thrillers. Best advice: read Turow if you enjoy serious contemporary fiction. This new one is an outstanding read and consideration of law and private moral codes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I wish I had read these review before I attempted to read the book. I struggled to get involved, but after 300 dull boring pages of nothing happending but a lot of \\"wearing a wire to listen to corrupt people who know how not to incriminate themselves\\", I read the ending and called it quits. I've read and enjoyed all Turow's books; but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Job Mr. Turrow!","review":"Personal Injuries captures the torment of being an undercover agent/handler as well as the torment of living the life of an informant. In this novel, Mr. Turrow manages to describe how it must feel to not only end a life defined by power and luxury, but to end the lives of all those around you who have entered into the same unlawful yet seductive method of doing business. A method which is readily rationalized as \\"the way things are done\\". However, most poignant is Mr. Turrow's straight-forward portrayal of life with ALS. He neither sugar coats this hideous, unfair desease nor does he employ any tear jerking quips; he simply places the reader in a position to learn a little about coping with the illness as well as coping as a family member. His endnotes are equally moving as he thanks those brave individuals who are living with ALS and continue to find meaning, humor and compassion for the rest of us who have for whatever reason avoided this desease."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Insomniac's Best Friend","review":"I was very disappointed in this latest from Scott Turow. It started off slow and continued on just as slowly. I couldn't drum up the slightest bit of sympathy for the characters. And worst of all, it was predictable and took waaaaay too much time to slog through. The only way I got to the end was the promise of another book to wash away the taste of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows that a literary thriller can sell","review":"The publishers of Turow keep calling him a thriller writer - probably afraid that if they don't, they'll loose readers. But the truth is, he's a good writer, period, just one who happened to kick off his career with rather a good thriller plot. Since then there's been lots of good writing, and relatively little in the way of thriller-type storytelling. But people (like me) go on buying his stuff regardless. Why? Because the combination of strong writing and a good story is a lot more satisfying than you get from most regular thriller fare. Good writing just brings things ALIVE, and makes the reader more willing to follow the author into areas that aren't essential to the plot. That's Turow's great lesson to the publishing world: quality writing sells. Thank you, Scott!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"This novel was a major letdown. Kept waiting for something to happen. Too many names to keep track of - never really cared about any of the characters. Forced myself to finish reading this one.

Unfortunately the story line gets terribly tangled in the lives of some characters who are not very interesting or appealling."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth Outs","review":"Finally someone in a position to know writes a semi-plausible scenario explaining why, at times, there is no justice in the justice system.The book does not rise to the occasion completely, as much of the plot is implausible in the real world of legal practice. The best parts of the book are found in the situations where it is not clear whether the judges are taking bribes or if the bribing attorney just thinks they are. This is razor's edge drama until Turrow allows the scales to tilt anticlimactically. A bit lazy, like the plot that a personal injury attorney can rake in the dough for a decade without a jealous insurance defense attorney picking up the phone to discover that the rich PI attorney doesn't even have a law license.Come on, Turrow. Let truth power your fiction. And sneak in a tale or two about the camaraderie of judges and insurance defense attorneys . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Captured My Interest!","review":"As most other readers who reviewed this book negatively, I am a Scott Turow fan.

I only got halfway through his last book before I gave up. This one I got about 3/4 through before saying to myself \\"Enough already\\". I agree with one person who said Turow's habit of using charters first, then last, then full name to be very confusing.

Not recommended, at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have been a fan of Turow's for some time, but I was disappointed by \\"Personal Injuries\\". Like so many writers who become successful, he has abandoned the style that made him famous for a more \\"artsy\\" approach. He has thrown out tightly written dialog and replaced it with long narratives that add little to the story. He has created characters that no one can really care about.

The bad guy turned 'mole' because of wife's deadly illness felt like an contrived 8th grade plot.

The story is mostly 3rd person narrative based on the lawyer's ideas of what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to get into and even tougher to finish","review":"I have read all of Turow's books but found this one real tough to get into. It was extremely tedious, in my opinion, and there were no characters that were particularly likeable. Bottom line is the book drug on.

Robbie is at once devious and charming and Evon is complex beyond words. The rest of the cast, which really should appear on the big screen, played their parts well.Personal Injuries seemed slow to start then picked up and gathered speed. Even though I saw it coming, I was caught off guard, like everyone else, especially Robbie, at the end. And I thought only Personal Injury lawyers were bottom feeders.

The rest of the book picks up some, but not enough to make up for the slow start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent Turow book with minor problems","review":"Personal Injuries was an excellent book that had one major flaw--too many characters! The plot was well developed, clever and very interesting to discover layer upon layer of deception. The main characters were unique and watching them evolve was good reading. The descriptions of a person with ALS were stunning and heartwrenching and speak to the excellence of Turow's writing and compassion. But with so many charcters to keep track of the narrative line almost became lost and by the end my brain was tired trying to keep everyone straight. I look forward to his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I checked this page, and wondered why a best-selling book had so few reviews. But then I got the book, and saw why: it takes a while to get into the book, so few readers had finished to be able to review it right away. Having said that, once I got into it, I liked. It's not a stream-lined thriller like Craig Furnas' THE SHAPE, or Michael Crichton's AIRFRAME, both books I loved, but more slowly-paced, and literary, and satisfying in THAT way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow...very slow....","review":"I love legal novels.

Author is usually better than this effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlong At Some Points, But Still A Good Read","review":"First, let me say to all of those reviewers who complained that there was no likeable character in this book - there is no law that states that the author must present all players as 'good' or 'bad'. In fact, books that have protagonists that are too good to be true are boring and predictable.The characters in this book have definite shades of gray, and are motivated to their actions through a variety of influences: greed, loyalty, fear, love, guilt, sense of duty, etc... This is much more interesting than 'good' vs. 'bad'.I do have to agree that Turow did a little to much 'navel contemplation' here and there throughout the book - much of this could have been cut. But overall, I say it was an enjoyable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this a bestseller?","review":"The characters were somewhat interesting, but the plot was duuuullll.

I kept waiting for it to get interesting, and except for a brief period towards the end, it never did. There was an extra aspect of emotion for me because my father died of ALS when he was 59 and I was 24. So those parts were a bit difficult to read. But overall the story didn't enthrall me. I usually read novels in a weekend, and this one took over a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try . . . but","review":"Started out slow and from there, went nowhere. It lacked the suspence of a Grisham novel. After finishing the book you're left with the same empty feeling you had at the beginning. However, Robbie Feaver is a very likable character. It's a shame he's not around to star in a more well-written novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I won't take if personal.","review":"Turow and Grisham two of the best new age legal/mystery writers. I say new age because I started my legal/mystery reading with Erle Stanley Gardner (Perry Mason). Honestly, I like all three writers. I would not call Turow's Personal Injuries a legal thriller. The characters are too well developed for this to be a thriller and the pacing seems too slow. In Personal Injuries Turow has given his fans a superbly plotted and methodical yarn. A yarn told step by step much the say way a lawyer would plan and strategize for a case.For me to enjoy a story I have to care about the stories characters. And while Turow has developed his characters very well I didn't give a flip about them. Maybe I wasn't supposed to care? We all have our own reading preferences so I would not take it \\"personal\\" if you disagreed with me when I say, I enjoyed Personal Injuries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"Using the device of a riveting legal drama -- complete withintrigue, deception, double dealing and plot twists -- Scott Turow haswritten a novel that's really about his wonderfully layed characters and their complex relationships. Whereas in so many other novels of this genre \\"the plot's the thing,\\" I found myself wanting to know more and more about the characters and what made them tick. And Turow delivered as the story unfolded. Well constructed and literate, this novel reveals much about the human condition in our modern age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Really, really boring.

I'm still hoping it will pick up the pace soon....... but that outlook seems dismal.HORRIBLE BOOK"},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't make this mistake again.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Presumed Innocent and Burden of Proof. The remainder of Mr. Turow's previous books seemed to be of lesser quality. I had made the decision not to read Personal Injuries, but after reading the professional reviews, I decided that I would give it a try. What a mistake! The book is very slow getting off the ground. When I finally think he is making progress with the story, Mr. Turow develops a situation where the characters go off in all directions again and the storyline is lost - one more time. It is good to get some of the history of the characters to be able to watch them develop, but this book does more than necessary and gets sidetracked from the storyline very often. I found myself frequently saying, \\"Who cares!\\" I should have stayed with my original course of action and not purchased the book. I will not make this mistake again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Effort Borders on Tedious","review":"The characters, the story and the outcome solicit only a big, \\"So what!\\" When all was said and done I cared little for these characters and the beds they had each made for themselves to lie in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub Par","review":"I found this to be a very \\"annoying\\" read. For an author to write in the first person and then switch to scenes where he was not present, and to read the thoughts of others,as in the third person,is too much. The plot became more and more of the same with characters performing unbelievable actions. I have enjoyed reading other Turow novels, but this was a definite turn off which I just managed to plow through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I've read all Scott Turow's books and enjoyed all of them except Personal Injuries and Laws of Our Fathers. Has he forgotten how to write? I had a difficult time following the first half of the book and was ready to give up on it. However, my curiosity took over and I forced myself to finish the book. At least in the last half of the book, I could make some sense of it. In my opinion, it was a waste of my time, and from the last two experiences I have had with Turow's books, this one is my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Search of More Poetic Prose in a Thriller.","review":"I am an author and I love thrillers. My biggest disappointment in today's world of adventure fiction is the inability to find a mesmerizing adventure constructed with poetic and living prose which allows me to feel the southern Louisiana heat, smell the toasted bagels in a Manhattan deli or wince along with the facial expressions of a lawyer caught ambulance chasing in the hospital room of a critically injured patient. While a better yarner than Turow, Grisham's works lack the sort of living color which fiction demands. I recently discovered an author who accomplishes this and a thriller in which he does it. The author is Gary Wickert, and the book is DARK REDEMPTION. If you like Grisham's storylines, but want to be riveted to and made love to by the prose which are the building blocks of any piece of fiction....READ 'DARK REDEMPTION'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lame","review":"I ordered Personal Injuries, The Triumph and the Glory, and Cold Mountain a couple weeks ago.

I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A SCOTT TUROW HARDCOVER AGAIN"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, tedious read; a 'forced finish' for me.","review":"My expectations we not met in my first Trurow novel. The characters were unrealistic (particularly the main one - Robbie Feaver), and the plot was tepid at best. The device of narration by \\"George\\" in the first person didn't work and was hard to follow. The ending lacked credibility, given the preceding slow buildup. I kept reading, hoping it would pick up...it didn't. This will be my last Scott Trurow book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"This book is terrible -- I almost did not finish it because, you know, you never get that time back after you've wasted it. The lead male character is a pompous, smarmy, womanizing crook/attorney whom the author apparently believes you will learn to like. The lead female character is a lesbian (not that there is anything wrong with that) who becomes confused about her sexuality when she is inexplicably drawn to the creepy, crook/attorney. While the topic of an investigation into lawyers bribing judges is interesting, the book never builds up any suspense. In fact, you could say that there is an utter absence of plot. I enjoyed Presumed Innocent, but found this book to be a complete disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turow this one back!","review":"Reading Scott Turow is like going to Law School; it's in Chicago and it sucks. Another pound or two of legalese from this master market grabber. True fans of legal fiction should enjoy this, but people are better off watching Matlock on PAX-TV. Turow's main problem is his attention to detail; everybody knows an olive fork doesn't twist like that, why draw our attention to the flaw by high-lighting it in detail? He could have just said \\"fork.\\" I can't believe I put down Louis Ferdinand Celine for this. I am so sad and it is Scott Turow's fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to exercise its strength and becomes tedious","review":"Turow has legal knowledge, and when he chooses to write about it, explains in clear English why the law operates as it does. That part of this book is interesting. He's almost onto something with his lead character Feaver, except that the guy is not endearing or interesting in any way, being a scam artist like many other tedious characters we encounter in life. It develops well at first, but then falls into a plodding pace, with a predictable ending. Sentiment and comedy fill in the gaps but let the wind of emptiness through. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow, dry start but increased tempo to the end","review":"The start was really dry and slow and a little confusing for a usual bestseller kinda of book. But when the story was unfolding, you got to admire the plot twists, good and convincing writing by the author. It was hard to put down as the story progressed. Overall, a brilliant story from a good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Much A Waste Of Time","review":"Author Scott Turow wrote one of the best books I have ever read titled, \\"Presumed Innocent.\\" This book - \\"Personal Injuries\\" is one of the worst I've read. I believe the author has superlative writing skills but there is no character in this book that a reader can admire, or identify with, or root for. The plot is like a bad dream wherein the same stupid things keep happening or almost happening over and over. This book and his previous book, \\"The Laws Of Our Fathers\\" are a depressing waste of a great talent. I keep hoping that Turow will find a good \\"leading man\\" for a decent plot (someone we would enjoy spending time with) - and I am sadly disappointed that he does not. Also - this book could have eliminated one-third of its verbiage and it would be a slightly better read. What annoys me is the list of effusive reviews that appear in the first pages of the paperback edition. Where in hell do they get reviewers that praise this dreck?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Turow I couldn't finish--I'd never have believed it","review":"The Law of Our Fathers left me waiting impatiently for his next book. What a great disappointment. The heart seems to have gone out of his writing. What happened? And please, please tell me why the book wasn't written from Evon's point of view. I didn't know George. I didn't care about George. Evon was present at the action but somehow she remained mute. I hope that Scott Turow, the lawyer who writes who can actually write, will please his fans next time and not just his bank and his publishers.I found that the people who gushed about this book had never read Turow before. Now that his face is on t.v. and he's an instant best selling author will the quality continue to diminish? I sure hope not. I'll still be waiting for the next one, but not with much excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Turow needs to re-energize!","review":"As a fan of Turow, I was not displeased until mid-way through when this book just stopped dead.

The ending was OK, but too much effort to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 400-Page Newspaper Article","review":"I've read Scott Turow's earlier novels, which I greatly enjoyed! Unfortunately, Personal Injuries was a big disappointment. I kept plodding through it wondering when it would pick up... it never did. It was like reading a 400-page newspaper article!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Personally Bored","review":"A very slow, tedious, and shallow story. Very disappointing. Makes you wonder if he wrote this to be instantly sold as a screenplay. I lost interest in the story several times because I didn't really feel I got to know or care about the characters, and I only went back to the book because I was determined to finish it. Very contrived ending. Glad to be finished. The book doesn't display the skills he used in Presumed Innocent, his best attempt to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turow's Worst","review":"I am an avid reader of any type of book. Scott Turow's new book, Personal Injuries, in my opinion, is the worst book he has written. There are too many characters, it is too hard to follow, it is hard to understand who is speaking in the book. I got through three chapters of this book and had to put it down. I found it grueling to get through, which really surprised me. I have read other Turow books and found them very interesting. Maybe it is just me, but i found it terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are you, Scott Turow?","review":"I have read all of Turow's novels and was anxiously awaiting this one.

What more can I say, except a disappointing yawner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get it from the library","review":"If you absolutely, postively have to read this book, get it from the library. Whatever you do, don't pay good money for it. I have read all of Scott Turow's books in the past and found them to be very good. I was really looking forward to this one coming out. What a disappointment! I am over halfway through this book (and it has taken me three weeks to get this far) and it is still going nowhere. I like to finish any book that I start, but I don't think I'll be able to wade through this one. The characters are stiff and wooden. There is not one character that I've run across so far that I even like or could care about. The plot trudges along, with neither twists nor surprises. My advise is don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sympathetic portrayal of human failings","review":"Turow's work here shows an impressive maturity in portraying the ostensibly shallow Robbie Feaver as a complex character. We're introduced to a classic slickmeister lawyer who we ultimately come to know as a multilayered and sympathetic human being. Fine writing set against the background of an involving legal sting operation! I think it's Turow's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK - A Mystery Masterpiece of Skilled Writing","review":"I can't imagine why any readers have panned this book, other than the fact that they are so used to page-turning, easy reads that they don't know a masterpiece when they read one. This is a masterpiece. I am not a fan of 4th. grade level literature of any type, so I don't usually read thrillers and especially lawyer fiction, but this book is superb. Each chapter carries you to the next. Each scene is well-laid out and you are there, in the action and in the suspense. The plot is exciting and keeps you riveted until the surprise end. This book will be a classic and I plan to read Mr. Turow's other books, hoping they are even close to as good as this one. Hooray for you, Mr. Turow! You have created a real masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a good editor","review":"While starting slowly, this novel gradually builds interest. While I found the narrators voice to be difficult to follow, I grew more and more interested in the interaction between Feaver and the female FBI agent. And then...the novel just drags and drags, becoming more and more confusing. There were several times when I wasn't even sure the narrator hadn't been changed. Case after phony case, judge after judge are dragged into the plot, creating a huge cry for sharp editing. Then, as the novel moves to its denouement, Turow seems to give up and throws in a most unsatisfying and, quite honestly, unbelievable ending. It's like he just gave up, not wanting to bother with fulfilling the lives of Feaver and Evon. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a disappointment for fans of Turow.","review":"\\"Personal Injuries\\" fails on many counts. The characters are not compelling. The plot drags interminably. Turow makes the unfortunate choice of writing the novel in the first person (a lawyer narrates) and then switching to the third person throughout much of the book. This device is awkward and it weakens the narrative greatly. Another problem is that the book has no clear focus. It veers between the pathetic plight of a woman dying of ALS, her loser husband who must participate in a sting to nab corrupt judges, and a female FBI agent who is exploring her identity. The book lacks warmth, humor, suspense and frankly, it is not worth the reader's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when its over","review":"I thought that this might be a pretty good book, but I was wrong! I kept trying to continue reading further, but decided that it would be an exercise in masochisim to do so.

At any rate, I am thankful that it was only a library book, because I wouldn't have been impressed had I paid money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gift Purchase","review":"I had to get this particular toy as a gift, so I had to pay what I thought was a very unreasonably high price.

I knew about the book for years as well, but it was nearly impossible to find. I'm hesitant to pay top dollar buying a used copy, but I strongly advise looking for it at a library.The book is short, and a very light read. While it starts simply, the characters grow and unfold the longer you read it.Character arcs aren't as straightforward as they're made in the movie.But the really noteworthy thing is that the book has material that is both lighter and darker than the movie.We hear about students doing more cruel things, as well as at least one outlandish prank.The book is considerably more evenhanded in the treatment of characters. Damone comes across more sympathetic, and Linda is detailed in a way that explains a whole lot of her personal motivation.I strongly suggest finding the book.

It was that good. Steinbeck so...perfectly captured the Arthurian tales, taking the originals and modifying them so anybody could read them without having to battle their way through Mallory's old English. It was stupendous and breathtaking, and I would recommend it immediately to anybody looking for something to read in the historical fiction genre.Read more?[...]~Thalia Anderson"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST out there","review":"I have read many of the books about the legends of King Arthur and Merlin...I don't know if it is the fact that I am American, but Steinbeck hit a major leaque award winning grandslam with this book. It has all of the bravery, gore, valiant, chivalrous efforts but his direction of the characters and flow from scene to scene sets it as if you are watching a play being performed before you. This book should be in every young girls and boys rooms who appreciate being human and want to become something in their lives. Sir Marhalt entranced me and before so much focus has been on Arthur but this somehow brilliantly veers away from Arthur and you don't miss him, in other efforts he is obviously out of the scenes.

It's only a partly finished work with a look at =why= it's partly finished included in the correspondence in the back.The book goes from not-very-interesting, almost literal translation of Mallory's work to, at some point, pure Steinbeck. He's inside the characters' heads, he's inside Mallory's head, and at its finest this is a mature a treatment of the legend as has been done. (In particular, the damning impact of Lancelot's single kiss with the Queen--the point at which the book unfortuntaely stops.)Then there is the correspondence, which itself is telling.

It looks like it's all steel and the sales pitch hypes the abundance of metal on this device. However, it has plenty of plastic and seems somewhat flimsy. Also, the motor feels totally week. Slicing hard bread seems to strain the motor. It seems to me that this slicer may have a place for you but any hard slicing jobs just seem too much. Also, there was a little plastic knob to turn in case you wanted to remove the blade. Our knob either came broken or broke when we tried to turn it. Basically, unless you are buying professional grade you get alot of plastic and a week motor. There are no detours. I almost wonder if my dads hand slicer would work better than these electric slicer. Oh how I long for the days when things were built to last. But hey we all like the thrill of buying new junk and China obliges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"On my first use I realized how low the power is. It bogs down slicing cheese. Many parts that should be metal are made of plastic, including a screw holding the blade and a drive gear delivering power to the blade. No wonder people have complained about these parts breaking. Additionally, cleanup is unnecessarily complex because of the design, making it hardly worth ever using. And because of that design, removing the blade exposes lubricant on the flip side of the cutting blade that surely must be replaced constantly because of that.I've made a very poor choice and should have read the negative reviews and not gone just on the cumulative rating.I'm tossing it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for slicing bacon","review":"I ordered this because I hoped it would be good for slicing fresh cured bacon or side pork, but alas it is not. As others have said it leaves a trailing edge of meat that has to be cut off. I had to cut my slab of bacon in half width wise because it was too long for the slicer to work. I had short bacon instead of the normal length kind, which was ok. I also partially froze the meat prior to slicing to help firm it up.I tried it on a loaf of wheat bread I made and it did not do a very good job of slicing it. It left the edge raggedy.I will be returning it because it does not meet my needs. I am disappointed 'cause I really wanted it to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to clean.","review":"It does a good enough job, I suppose, but it's very difficult to clean...to the point that I don't use it much because it's such a job to clean it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE it","review":"This thing is AWESOME. We save so much money now by buying the uncut meat from Costco and slicing it ourselves (price is so much less than the presliced meat from grocery store).It is so versatile too....we use it to prepare several dishes (well...the wife does the prep including the cutting - I do the eating haha).Only con is it's difficult to clean (so I've been told lol)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent for the money","review":"The picture makes it look better than it is. Keeping it sanitary will be a big concern as it packs the meat into a crack on the bottom. Some of it can be cleaned by removing parts, then there is the those other places. Someone also mentioned that it doesn't cut slices evenly, which is true. You can flip the meat over, or push slower, either helps. Overall, it is decent for the money and I would recommend or buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good home slicer","review":"This slicer does a good job of cutting and is easy to clean.NOT plastic junk but is solidly constructed.It has a good weight that is not to heavy to be stored easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 years later this slicer is still going strong","review":"After looking through all the options and reviews on Amazon, I purchased this EdgeCraft slicer to slice raw meat to make jerky.

I am pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not a Hobart 'cause it's Only $100","review":"I need to remind myself sometimes to look at things in the context of what they sell for. It ain't a pro deli slicer nor does it pretend to be.The Model 610 is good value for the money and for occasional home use. Just a few points not mentioned in other reviews:1) The unit is noisier than what I had expected. With that aside, it has plenty of power and the motor did not labor while slicing meat.2) The feed carriage adjustment is not precise. It tends to back out when simply dialed to a detent setting resulting in a thicker a slice than intended. I learned by using it that the most positive thickenss setting should be done while putting a slight force on the meat toward the blade(to remove any backlash in the carriage slide)while setting the thickness knob.I rated it a 4 out of 5 because ot the noise. It baffles me how what appears to be Nylon gearing can make such a racket. Then again, I'm not running a deli."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the money","review":"For $100 you really can't go wrong with this machine. When I got mine a few weeks ago, there was an insert alerting me that the plastic screw so many other users have negatively commented on has been modified to a better design. Although it is still breakable (if you twist it in way too tight, duh) it is much more sturdy than the previous reviewers must have experienced with their original equipment.Cleanup is fairly easy, except you will need to invest in some food grade machine lubricant for after you clean it. The blade is sharp and can cut razor thin slices of hame and cheese (all Ive tried so far).The amount of money you save by buying large hams and turkey breasts will pay for this machine easily.I learned a lesson about buying cheese in bulk though - use it up, give it to friends, but don't freeze it.Overall this is a great product and is great around the house - I just wish I had a food saver to go along with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgecraft 610 Good Cuts!","review":"I originally thought this appliance would be a cheap plastic hunk-o-junk, but it was nothing of the sort!

It really doesn't work very well - it bogs down, it slices unevenly and it's a bear to clean. I gave it 2 stars because at least it did \\"work\\" sort of. Really not worth the time or money. Invest in a good electric knife, or a good slicing knife and learn to use it. My only joy with this thing was putting in the trash after using it - so I didn't have to clean it this time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive job","review":"My wife was not keen on me getting this slicer. She is very skilled with the chef knife and other slicing blades. She thought it would be a waste of money. However I wanted to get it to deli slice meat for sandwiches. It worked great doing that and slicing cheese, but what really got her attention was when she got out a large frozen pork loin roast from which she planned to cut slices for Chinese stir fry. Normally she would hack off a chunk and then wait for it to defrost before she could slice it. I picked up her roast (frozen) and quick as could be sliced off enough for the stir fry. Then I sliced the carrots and then the cabbage in a matter of seconds. She admitted she was impressed.The reviews are correct about having to let it cool down while doing a large job. I can get hot. It got rather hot after slicing a 2 1/2 pound roast into deli thin slices."},{"rating":"2","title":"good slicer","review":"It is a good slicer for average household. I was using Rival before, so I compare them all the time when I use it. It does a good job with meat, salami and cheese. However I would like to have more sensitive slice thickness dial. It is hard to adjust for thin slices. Otherwise I am fully satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs well","review":"The slicer was a gift for my father. He really likes it and uses it frequently. His only complaint is tht it is difficult to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great meat slicer","review":"It is a wonderful time saver. My wife used to slice raw meat rarely because the meat had to be partly defrozen, and it was still a very tough job. Now even I can do that. I sliced meat directly taken out from the freezer, it worked great. I also tried it on pork liver, it worked very well too. You just need to be cautious when your fingers are close to the blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great slicer for the price!!","review":"I am very pleased with the Chef's Choice 610.

If you compare it to professional models you will be disapointed, but for home use I think it is great. - LC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I purchased this machine about 3 weeks ago and have used it for slicing Pit Beef and Pit Turkey. It doeas a wonderful job of slicing and is extremely easy to clean. It slices onions very easily as well - can't wait to try it on other veggies.

With such a busy household and a limited income, it offers me the option of making my own cold cuts. Did five pounds of roast beef last week and had lunches for the entire week. The only problem I had with it is that the meat doesn't always press against the blade and sometimes the slice isn't even. A minor thing at worst. Otherwise, I don't think I could have a productive kitchen without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this","review":"This slicer works fine if you dont have to clean it. However the blade is attached with a plastic screw!! I read the reviews before I bought this machine and all the negative reviews mention this, so I was prepared. I made sure I did not over tighten the blade so I would not break the screw. The very first time I used it I sliced a beautiful roast no complaints, but when I went to clean the slicer up I broke the flimsy plastic screw. I knew it was fragile. I took care not to break it, but it is impossible not to break. Do not buy this machine!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great home use","review":"Bought this slicer to suffice until I found a better replacement for my German model. I am in no hurry now. This thing gets the job done. It's relatively easy to clean (they are all a pain) definitely more so than my last one. Dollar to value I humbly submit tis the best buy. I liked the design even better than the higher priced models which I was prepared to pay. The only reason it got 4 out of 5 stars is that the center lock is flimsy plastic and although mine hasn't broke I can see the future. My last model did have a better center blade lock about the size of a 50 cent piece with thumb grooves and made of hard plastic. Probably easy to improvise a replacement but I am being extra cautious with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very handy","review":"I've been using it to slice little mini loaves and then drying the slices to make rusk crackers.

I also ordered an additional slicer since I was going to be using it for proscuitto and it was only about $29.99 - but it has been coming in handy as I've been using it quite often and worth the spending the extra for it to have it cut the slices the way I want.

The key is, when remounting the blade, to use only fingertip pressure to tighten it.

My first time using the package, the plate that my food push against wasn't holding its place and the thinnest I can cut was about 1/3 inch...then after I turned the knob past the max thickness setting, something clicked and suddenly the plate was on tight and now I can get paper thin slices out of a red onion and tomato (like a deli) I put it an idaho potato and made got very thin slices for potato chips! My advice is if your machine isn't cutting as thin as you want, mess around with the control knob in the back...maybe its just not on correctly. I ordered the non-serrated blade (after asking the deli guy what kind of blade they use on the big machines)...so hopefully this will give me as good a results on meats as it did on the veggies. (its a mess cutting up meats with a serrated edge...its doable, but must be partially frozen and the slices aren't as thin as the veggies)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied with this product's performance.","review":"This product works well, and provides clean, precise slices. Thus far I've used it on ham, roast beef, turkey breast, sopressata, and various cheeses. It's relatively easy to clean.As others have probably mentioned, the plastic part that attaches the blade to the base is a little flimsy and requires caution, but other than that, the construction is solid.In my opinion, in order to get the full benefit of a product like this, you should also have/get a vacuum sealer like a Food Saver or a Seal-a-Meal. Then you can really have your own home delicatessen.I've already saved a lot by making sandwiches at home rather than eating lunch out.

I set it to slice thin for jerky and let it go. Even though the inside of the roasts were still frozen, the slicer worked great. The uniformity of the thickness of the slices was very good. My old slicer couldn't keep a uniform thickness at all. The motor never got hot. Clean-up was very nice. I had it taken apart and cleaned in 6 minutes. I make alot of jerky throughout the year and am looking forward to using this slicer. At this time, I will place it in the 5 star category for price paid, however, it is new and I've only just begun..... I will add comments as time passes on.3-3-06 Still enjoying the slicer.

This slicer is a basic, economical home slicer and does not perform anywhere close to a deli slicer. The unit itself it to small to take a large product and the blade runs to slow for doing a good job on hard cheese. The engine actually starts to smoke on the tough jobs. Additionally, it really can not achieve a super thin slice - it is just not that robust.But, what do you expect for $100?? It does slice and for small products and a limited amount of slicing it can do the job.If you want to slice larger pieces and/or achieve thin perfect slices - move to a bigger blade and more powerful engine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Machine!","review":"All the other positive reviews are dead on. If you are looking for an electric food slicer then this is the one you want. As stated in other reviews, this machine is well constructed and cleans up easy. Despite it's smaller than commercial-grade size, it slices the same sized meats, cheeses, vegetables, etc. as the bigger ones do. It doesn't slice as fast as the commercial grade units do but there has to be a trade-off somewhere, otherwise you will be spending several hundred dollars more. Also, the machine is compact enough that it should store easy.

Even before the first slicing, attempts to remove the blade for first cleaning had failed because the center of bland plastic tab broke in my hand. Instead did a simple wipe prior to slicing.

I sent it in to Palm for repair (and their customer service isn't very easy or fast) and received a rebuilt unit. That one lasted about 4 months (just beyond the warranty) and its digitizer started flaking out.Today I can't write anything, and I refuse to pay Palm to fix it and get another dud.Too bad - I've loved Palm for years, but they lost me on a bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with battery... won't buy again!","review":"I bought a Palm TX about 3 years ago.

Why?The Palm Desktop software (and hotsync tool) was made by a company called \\"Access\\" which is mostly defunct now.All newer PDAs run Windows for Mobile devices and those will sync.So - if you're running Vista or at some point will be upgrading your Windows XP box, don't expect your Palm to sync if it is not running Windows for Mobile devices.I'm saddened that Palm would show so little support for a good product.

Unfortunately, it will be my last. The device worked well but one day a turned it on and there was big black spot on the display and the screen was washed out with lines across it. However, the screen was not scratched or cracked. I called Palm Support who told me that they don't cover broken screens and it would cost $140 to fix. I didn't do anything that I can think of to have broken it. I didn't want to pay that much money for something that can be broken so easily, so I've moved to a Blackberry Pearl. I've stuck with Palm for so long because I am used to the operating system and have purchased a fair amount of 3rd party software. The Blackberry OS is actually much easier to use. I would recommend that you do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an unreliable product - look elsewhere","review":"We bought this for my husband's cousin who graduated high school and was going onto college.

Instead, we end up with two different ones that don't function which need to be sent back.In all honesty, I am embarrassed that this gift has become such an ordeal.

Technical support says it might be interference with third party software although it has not been hotsynched and no software loaded. Tech support does not answer the phone even for the $25 fee.

Draw a straight line across the screen and it scatters short broken lines allover the screen facing all directions. An attempt to calibrate takes you on an infinite loop. Contacting customer service was so annoying as they told me I dropped the product or spilled fluids on it which never happened. I have searched online and discovered this is a common problem with Palm TX, in fact there's a company I found specializing in selling TX screens which should tell how common this problem is.

Recently when trying to HotSync the TX the unit quit working all together. We tried charging the unit over night to see if the battery was drained which could have caused the unit to stop working, to no avail the unit is still dead. Although this product has the great name of PALM, the unit itself is not worth the price you pay for the it when the shelf life is less than a year. Palm's customer service for repairs is $129.95+ which is almost half of the original price of the Palm TX. I would not recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a Handheld.

This is the first device I've owned that truly feels like a small form computer. The rest, although nice, were more like glorified organizers, and not much more. With the TX, I can connect effortlessly to WIFI, and browse the Internet on a screen worth viewing. The speed of the applications is not bad at all, and the times it does lag, is not really that often. Overall, I'd say that it out performs the expectations that I had for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a Palm, but that's just enough","review":"First a caveat, I received this as a gift and this is my first PDA since the black and white Palm m100.The Palm OS excels at being an electronic organizer. It integrates itself with Outlook very nicely. Easy to jot down notes and search through them. A big bonus of the wi-fi is being able to sync with your computer wirelessly. The wi-fi e-mail client is very nice for reading your e-mail on the go or as a fast way to send your palm a note. Media playback is adequate, although I would not make that a primary reason to purchase this device. The only features I would like to see improved are the web browser (Screen formatting issues) and the concurrent drain on the battery while using the wi-fi; however, these are to be expected with a unit this size. The use of an offline web browser like avantgo solves these issues though.Bottom Line: Efficient portable organizer that is decent at the web and media playback with the nice perk of wi-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WARNING, not a review","review":"I have owned the original Palm, the Palm V, and 2 different Clié from Sony (when available) and then I changed to the Palm TX.I had problems with its software because it crashed very often. After that the SD/MMC card drive did not read the sticks. So I took it for repairs.They didn't fix it the first time around, just shipped it back. I sent it again and they returned it with the problem solved but now the screen made a horrible squeak when ON. I sent it back three additional times, always with the promise of a new unit, but I somehow seemed to receive the old one everytime. To make a long story short, they took 2 COMPLETE MONTHS to deliver a new PALM.I decided to get rid of it right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Palm TX Problems","review":"I have an old Tungsten E.

The last one I took to the Palm store for them to setup and they could not get it to work either. Don't know if it is just the Palms that Amazon is selling -- the Palm store said they have not seen this problem previouslhy."},{"rating":"2","title":"still figuring things out","review":"I've had my TX for about a month now, and so far, I love it. There are a lot of sites where you can download freeware for shopping lists, along with a million other things like games.I have had one minor issue using Graffiti 2, in which the backspace command creates a period. I have tried re-aligning my stylus with the screen...but it doesn't seem to help. It's a tolerable problem, and may just be something with the amount of pressure I put on the screen.For those looking to get a case, do NOT get a hard-side case unless you plan on packing around a unit that's twice the size of the Palm itself. They're all too huge. What I found that I really like, and doesn't hinge onto the TX so it feels like it's going to flip out every time I open it, is a leather top-flip case. RhinoSkin makes one--it's supple, leaves the connectors open, and leaves the stylus reachable.Overall, I'm really enjoying my TX, and I have not had any crashing issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Problems","review":"Internet / mail features seem nice, and it does sync well with ical AND Palm desktop, but it has big problems in the screen department. Calibration has been a problem since day one, often getting so bad that attempts to re-calibrate fail because it doesn't believe that it's THAT much off (there's also no way to calibrate the bottom 25% of the screen). After about 8 months, it became unusable. I waited 6 weeks for it to get fixed; when they sent it back, it not only wasn't fixed, but it wouldn't turn on without forcing me to re-calibrate it (which it wouldn't do) . When I called, they said they can only fix one thing at a time and asked me to send it back again for another 6 weeks. So I just payed the $40 to have them send a complete replacement. That one had the exact same calibration problem as the one before. Save yourself the $$$ and the hassle and get something else. The new features are nice, but it's absolutely not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winner","review":"The Palm T/X is a great product. This is my third Palm (had Palm IIIc, Palm Tungsten E) and I love it. The handwriting recognition software (Graffiti) is much improved and when I write letters, they trace on the screen as I write them. The writing space for capital letters, small letters and numbers is clearly separated. The writing space can be made to appear and disappear depending on what I'm doing on the screen. The coolest part of the T/X is the Internet web access, which can wirelessly connect to a public access network or through the cellphone. I can remotely use the web and access my email. It's fabulous and makes the Palm even more versatile than before. I thought about getting a Treo (cellphone with Palm) but I hated the idea of having a big clunker up against my ear when I'm on the phone. The T/X takes care of all my connectivity needs without having the cellphone thrown in."},{"rating":"1","title":"No CD replacement, no support","review":"Don't lose your CD, there's no way to download the software (now).The hardware is good, I actually like it, but the lack of support is awful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PDA review","review":"I have never had a PDA before and so it was complicated trying to figure out how to use it and download my nursing software since no instructions were included.

After using it for some time you'll begin to notice that in spite you calibrate again and again your stylus never seems to be right on the target. And you will begin trying to compensate for its behaviour, aiming just a little to the left, or to the right, or lower. Later, things go worse and the calibration program itself goes crazy. You aim to the center of the target numberless times -last time I tried I counted up to 150- and the program never ends. According to what other people have said here and at other forums this problem is very common. It's obvious Palm has had a serious problem with their screens - or at least with a very large number ot them- and it not recognizing its failure. Otherwise it would have to recall a lot of devices. My advice: don't ever think about buying the Palm TX. You're going to regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"no Wi-Fi","review":"I bought this PDA after the screen on my Tungsten C gave out, because I wanted Wi-Fi in a small, convenient package.

I fear the cable is not the problem and it is the device it self and I will now be stuck with this $300 piece of junk. Without hotsync you have nothing more than a fancy calendar.

Haven't tried many of the recreational features but for business while on the road it's been just what I needed.Would have given 5 stars but sometimes you do have to press buttons 2-3 times before they function properly, gets annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficulties with HotSync and Instability","review":"I've been trying to keep a good attitude about my next TX since I've paid $300 for it. But I keep having problems with HotSyncing. For some reason I can't get my calendar to HotSync at all right now (but everything else does). My TX also freezes for no apparent reason requiring a hard reboot at least once a week. When I type in things to do on my laptop, for some reason they haphazardly show up on the list. All in all, there seem to be more glitches with this PDA than the previous 3 Palms I've owned. It sounds like from talking to people at work that Palm is also in the process of changing their OS to something like PocketPC. I'd hang tight before I spent money on the TX.Disgruntled Doctor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great device but not quite a five-star","review":"After researching and reading numerous reviews of the Palm TX, I decided to buy it after doubting and doubting for a few days. As a college student, I don't have a lot of money to waste on a $300 organizer, but I'm glad I got it as it is more than just an organizer. This little machine works wonders! The battery-life is superb. I can get up to a week of it with normal use. However, there are a few glitches w/ Wi-Fi...the TX sometimes freezes and a reset is necessary. It can get annoying, but it doesn't happen all that often. I definitely recommend this all-purpose machine. If you're looking for affordability + functionality, then get the TX."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Palm","review":"After searching around for the best price on my Palm TX, I ordered it through Amazon.com in May 2008. The ordering was simple and I received it about 3 business days later which was great. I chose Palm because my previous two units over the past 10 years were Palms and I had a ton of information to transfer to the new unit. It transferred pretty easy, with the exception of the old Palm Reader files... they never could be transferred.A few weeks later I ordered a webcam that works great, but along with the webcam came ANOTHER PALM TX! Whoa... I immediately called Amazon to tell them they made a mistake and sent me a second Palm (also charging me a second time)! They were very helpful and emailed me a pre-paid address sticker and told me to keep the webcam, but send back the Palm in the box it came in. It was very simple to do and didn't cause me a lot of trouble.I'm very pleased with the service and will continue to shop at Amazon.com.(I'm also enjoying the Palm TX that works great!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated & expensive, but works well for its intended purpose.","review":"Great for updated medical data (drugs, labs, procedure) and synchronizing to PC MS Office.

The M130 lasted 3 years and only parts of it worked after the second year. The TXs should be so good. Three units in 3 years and the current one is very sick. Hardware problems are too numerous and varied to detail. IMHO they all were just above simply junk level. With the TXs hotsyncing with a MAC will work for awhile then goes to you-know-where and I spend an hour or two getting it back to work. About twice a year. The screens seem to go the fastest. It resets itself while I am using it every few days, sometimes several times in one session.I like the product. If it worked reliably it would be 5 stars. But I now am looking for anything but another Palm"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousiest product I ever bought","review":"You'd think that a company with as much experience with touch screens as Palm,would make them usable. Not so with the tx. First one developed dead spots almost Immediatelythen came the calibration errors. This piece of junk cannot be accurately. No differenceafter they replaced the screen and the on off switch. I went through their tech servicedepartment and they kept wanting me to hard reset and that didn't help. I can tell em it's asoftware flaw, but they don't admit it. Guess they'd rather have disgruntled customers.Even if you're a palm addict... bypass this offering.

Four times I tried to install the software, four times it failed. The culprit is a little subroutine called VMDialogWrapper.exe. I looked on Google, and found 3 references to this problem, and tried the solution mentioned there, a neat little program put out by Microsoft called Windows Installer Cleanup. Even that did not help. I know from previoius experience with Palm that they will not service what they sell, except with gobs of money, so I am reluctantly returning this unit. It looks like a great design, has the WiFi and Bluetooth I wanted, etc. Were it not for the lousy little subroutine, I would happily rate this either 4 or 5 stars, but if it's DOA, then the rating has to be lower. I hope others have more success, but for me, I'm moving to Windows Mobile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Palm TX YES","review":"I have had a Palm top for many years, back when the Psion was what was happening. As time progressed I bought a Sony Clie T127. The Sony worked good for about two years, but it needed to be charged way too often. I got a replacement battery, but it was not the battery, it was the machine it's self. After much searching, investigation and even reading these reviews I bought a Palm TX. I am absolutely delighted. It does all I really need and more. The battery life is fantastic. I can not find ONE thing to complain about. One of the things that I most appreciated was the was my old Clie information went in to the Palm TX with little to no problems. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero support!","review":"Warning! Once you buy it, unless you are trying to buy more software or accessories, there is NO support.

But it has wifi and is supposed to do email and internet. The browser works fine on my home wireless network, mostly. I have been struggling for almost two weeks to send or receive and email message with it. I followed the directions in the PDA manual for set up and I get error messages with an authentication error message. Talked to Palm who said it was the ISP's problem. The ISP says it is Palm's problem. I found another Palm instruction page that gave different instructions for set up from the manual and that did not work. I set up email accounts at hotmail, google and yahoo and the browser on the palm refuses to deliver the front page for google. It just delivers the ads on the hotmail page and no log in. Yahoo refuses to recognize the password. If you want email in a small package for traveling forget this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited E-Mail and Wi-Fi Capabilities","review":"I purchased a Palm TX for my wife, who mistakenly believed that this device would be an inexpensive substitute for a Palm Treo or Blackberry. A representative from the IT Department at her office spent a great deal of time unsuccessfully attempting to get the Wi-Fi feature to work, but she could never get it to receive email or web access from the wireless network in her office. The IT representative said that the office network was not compatible with the \\"VersaMail\\" feature used by the Palm TX.At this point, the TX became an overpriced PDA, for our purposes. It was returned to the retailer. If you buy the TX and think that you will get seamless access to email and the web, forget it. The internet and email capabilities are limited.

Tengo mis reservas con la LifeDrive, no fue una buena idea.Si quieren estar seguros que comprar pueden gastar una buena fortuna comprando y comparando, ahora pueden aprender en estos comentarios y avanzar en un camino ya recorrido por otros sin gastar dinero, acepten los consejos de quienes ya pagamos para disfrutar de buenos productos.

Then that stopped working. I couldn't turn it on at all.Screen freezes a lot and then resets itself on all 3 Palms. You loose data and if aren't by computer to hotsync, you have to start over.Customer Service is horrible. They are very nice on the phone, but they don't follow through with what they say they are going to do. It took over 6 weeks to get one of the Palms returned to me. Another time their DHL tracking system didn't update and they didn't have record of me receiving a new Palm or the return of the broken one.I guess I am going to buy an HP now.

After downloading the software from the Palm website, the sync worked normally.Separately I ordered the Palm folding keyboard, which worked immediately and is a very valuable accessory. I also order the cradle, as essential element that should be included in the original purchase box, which would add only about $25 to the cost of the unit.Overall, I am pleased with the Palm TX, which replaced a much older HP PDA that lacked the e-mail and web features that make current model PDAs much more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all in one Device","review":"This is my first PDa and i love it.I did not experience any problems that other reviewers had but i am careful what third party software i install on my palm, some software that you download can cuase palm os problems.With an extra 2 sd card i can hold a few songs and video clips.With a program called tcpmp i can even watch divx movies.The tx connects to the internet with any hot wifi zone, it truly is an affordable alternative wifi, i can leave my laptop at home for trips.The Screen is gorgous to look at and it impress many of my friends, you can view screen data in portrait or landscape mode.The kit i recieved included plug adapters for different countries"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice screen, nice device but have to reset almost every week","review":"Pro: Nice screen, support SD card, 802.11G with WPACon:1.

Recently I even paired it with the Jensen Bluetooth receiver and am able to play the contents of the TX over my stereo. I use it for writing emails that I then send later from my pc.So why only four stars?1. The battery life isn't great and the battery is a built in rechargeable, so it's necessary to charge it every couple of days.2. The display, while gorgeous in indoor and subdued lighting, struggles to compete outdoors, making it hard to read an ebook outside.3.

Super bright screen that was bigger than the TX and low glare high contrast. I like the Palm OS better, but will probably go back to a PPC if this is as good as it gets.Mostly, I read ebooks on my PPC and some e-mail. I'm on planes a lot and it's easy to see.

I keep this mainly for the organizer features, which are a lot better than on older Palms or the Ipod touch, which I also have. If you are wanting to buy the Palm for mainly the music and internet features, I'd go with the Ipod touch or IPhone instead. But if you want a nice organizer with some other cool features, I'd say this is the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful for continual reboot problem","review":"My TX is about 6 months old.

I have had continuous problems with this device and will be returning my 4th one today! What a nightmare! After receiving and returning 3 separate Palm TX's due to power issues, I will now be returning my 4th one due to severe misalignment of the stylus when trying to select items on the screen. What I touch with the stylus isn't even close to what is actually activated on the screen. I don't recall ever having had so many problems with an electronic device in my entire life. What I found even more disgraceful is that if you have a problem with your Palm TX and you return it for repair, they won't send you a new one. Instead, they send you a reconditioned one. To me, that is extremely disrespectful and unsatisfactory. If I buy a brand new device and it is defective, then I deserve a brand new one as a replacement. I really wonder if people realize what a sham this company is - I know I didn't. I do not recommend this device to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible service from repair facility in Pharr Texas","review":"My Palm Tx worked fine for a few months then the OnOff switch started to go bad. After three phone calls they finally gave me an authorization number to send it in. I sent it insured w the US Postal Service. It was signed for on May 12th. Now two months later and after a flood of emails and phone calls I still don't have a hand held. They can't find any record of it. I will never buy another Palm product. I'm afraid part of the problem is the language barrier of the people on the phone. I can't tell where their accent is from. I have to repeat numbers three and four times for them to understand and they still got my email address wrong(the first time, which led to a delay while I waited for a reply)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not NEW as advertised , but refurbished","review":"I found out after providing the serial number to customer support that this IS NOT a new Palm as advertised, and therefore it is not covered by the warranty.

It kept crashing and performing the infamous reboot cycle with no third party software on it (only the factory load). I contacted the dealer and exchanged it. The second one had the same problem. I called dozens of times to the dealer and palm. They stalled until the 30 day return policy was over. I then contacted Palm for the 1 year warrenty. They informed me the warrenty exchange DOES cost $140!!!! To make a long story short - the device is garbage, and the company is crooked. After a faithful customer for 10 years - I'm done with Palm."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like it but for one fatal flaw, buyer beware!","review":"There is a lot to like about the Palm TX: light, small, reasonably fast, lots of available accessories, and simple interface. There is a lot to dislike too, but my main problem is that Palm DOES NOT support Media Center Edition of Windows XP. If you use Media Center Edition, you will NOT be able to sync your TX with Outlook and your syncs to Palm Desktop WILL be unreliable. What's personally infuriating is the amount of time it took for me to find this out. It took me a long time and many hours of troubleshooting - via suggestions from the Palm Website - to realize the incompatibility. I only found out when I called Palm Tech support (toll call too!). Palm should be upfront that this will not work with MCE. Be sure that the operating system you use is compatible before you buy!* I tried to e-mail Palm several times since the phone call that figured out this problem. No response. Get used to that if you have problems with your hardware or software!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A word of advise.","review":"This is my 4th palm device and this is the first time that I have ever had trouble with a Palm. The desktop software is buggy. On two computers, the software crashes. It appears that Palm did not do their homework for a user that is upgrading.At times the device will do a reboot when I go to check my e-mail.A software glich causes the device to not see it's expanson card, and only a hard reset will cure it; for a while.Palm tech support was worthless. First attempt, they told me to return my first TX because the expansion card slot was defective. Second Palm did the same thing, but I discovered the Hard Reset fix. E-mail tech support & you will receive a form response to reload all software & no e-address to respond to. They will send you a survey. :-)This unit may have been rushed to quickly into production.

Oyster and Siren are absolutely always in my 5-disc changer, singly or together. Her incredibly true lyrics and ethereal voice deceived me into believing that Heather Nova could do no wrong. Well, now she has. If Heather Nova's previous albums had not been so unutterably gorgeous, maybe I wouldn't regard South as a betrayal. She got lazy, poppy, and boring. All of the emotion is drained from her voice; it's like she's pulling Mariah-Carey-tricks. Just one standout song would have been enough to keep me happy, even if the rest of the disc fell flat...one \\"Truth and Bone,\\" one \\"Paper Cup,\\" something true and transportative.But there just is not one redeeming track on this entire album.The only thing I am grateful for is that I managed to restrain myself from plunking down $30 for the import."},{"rating":"1","title":"this isn't heather at all!","review":"Heather Nova has definetly gone downhill.

Her album Siren was original, etherial, enjoyable. I could listen to that CD and would calm down. This album is the complete opposite of all of those. Whereas Siren was more akin to light (true) alternative, this album more akin to a softer Jennifer Lopez, or some other dull repeative pop artist with a beat. Do yourself a favor, do not buy this album, but get Siren to hear how good Heather Nova can really be.Don't get me wrong, if I never ever heard Siren before I would think this album was fairly good, not great. It was a massive let down. Curiously enough, she switched labels, from Sony to V2. I don't know if V2 is owned by Sony, but I thought it strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite the otherwordly one here...","review":"Four years in the making and a few release date push backs later and HEATHER NOVA's 'South' has finally arrived. Sadly though, it doesn't come close to living up to any of her past releases. She sounds too produced here, and she doesn't need to be. Her unique and otherworldly voice is either restrained in places or placed in settings far too unfamiliar. 'South' isn't without its moments, though. 'Welcome', which was co-written by Dido, is a terrific way to lead off the album. It's a chugging rocker with a memorable chorus. There are other songs on the album that sound like typical Heather songs, but, there's too much genre shifting and no real direction, and that's just a total waste of Heather Nova's immense talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heather Nova at her worst.","review":"How can anyone say this is a \\"more mature Heather\\"?

Not only is this 19th symphony recording mislabeled and incomplete but the sound quality leaves very much to be desired.While this CD could still be purchased by anyone interested in obtaining the 17th symphony, the above rating is partly attributable to the unwillingness of the manufacturer to disclose accurate information (with a sticker or otherwise) and to the willingness of retailers to overlook this flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't go wrong with batteries","review":"Seems nowadays everything uses AAA batteries so this 30 pack is perfect for just about anyone that needs them.

The whole album is fantastic for ABBA lovers and also gives insight to the workings of Benny Anderson and Bjorn Ulveaus, as they had just completed the musical CHESS before working with Josefin Nilsson.

Mendelbaum won a National Book Award for his translation of \\"The Aeneid of Virgil\\", and his translation of Dante's Inferno is equally superb.The format of the book is italian and english, with translated pages on the opposite of the italian verses. There are some great illustrations throughout the book, but it is the imagery created in your head that makes this such a great read.Highly recommended. I have read other translated versions of Inferno, and this is by far the best I have read so far. An excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Better Translations","review":"Dante's Inferno is a truly magnificent piece of art that is deserving of an equally magnificent translation. For those of us who are unable to translate on our own, Allen Mandelbaum does a superb job of it on his own. Having both languages set side by side gives the reader a unique perspective and allows the reader to get a better feel for the flow of the poem.The notes and asides that are provided are helpful but the essays at the end of each chapter leave something to be desired. If you are simply reading The Inferno for the pleasure of it then this is the version to get. If you are a scholar who is attempting to get a better understanding of Dante and his works than you may be better off finding a different version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb English, Italian, and Pictures","review":"Mandlebaum's verse is beautiful: he manages to keep up an iambic 11-syllable line throughout the work--just like Dante. If you can bear his comically pedantic and effete introduction, his notes are very thorough(they even point out the location of the epigraph to \\"Proufrock\\"). This edition has the Italian on the opposite side of every page as well, so it will doubtless be useful to those lucky enough to be able to read Dante in the \\"linguo volgro\\".

So why only 4 stars? Because like other liberal theologians, Laughlin somehow thinks you can remove most of the orthodox beliefs of Christianity and still have a viable version of Christianity. After his deconstruction you are left with: a)a God so ill defined as to be incomprehensible and essentially meaningless b) a Jesus (if you even believe he existed as a historical person) who is an inspirational teacher even though you're not sure how much of what is attributed to him is even factual c) a Bible which is a collection of fables which nevertheless has some kind of transcendental value.Liberal Christianity has no \\"meat\\" to it.

Unfortunately, Laughlin's book is a prime example of someone who has gone all out to prove their particular doctrine but has forgotten the command to love in the process.

Michael is a man who has it all and most people would think thats what it takes to satisfy a person, but as this film shows, you are always driven by that one thing that you can't have. Despite his guilt about his family and her youth he is drawn to Magenta because she is forbidden and the passionate affair he has with her not only gives him an amazing rare rush of adrenaline but it opens up his eyes to the facade of those around him, which creates interesting twists in the film that shatter his perception of his 'perfect life'.Magenta is innocently beautiful but still seductive which makes him attracted to her more.

Anyway, I checked it out from the public library and figured I'd just listen to the extras. But the remixes of the old songs are really compelling. It's almost like the original is FM radio and this one is CD. Whatever.

They didn't make enough money off me the first time, so why not try to get just a little bit more. And they wonder why people pirate music.

This helped fill the grooves and make the repair secure. The glue doesn't foam up straight out of the bottle, which makes it easier to work with. Excess foam can be wiped away immediately or cut/pulled away (I missed an area on the bottom of the drawer).Since then, the drawer bottom hasn't budged.

Perhaps this is because of the fresh, friendly voice of the narrator, Jane Bee, a smart and lively young woman from Prince Edward Island, who, while visiting Great Britain, happens into a housemaid position at Buckingham Palace, and very quickly stumbles (literally) upon a dead body, right at Her Majesty's sensible-shoe-clad feet...And perhaps it's because of the writing skills of C.C. Benison, who gives the reader the feeling of being a Palace insider, with all the good gossip, the pet names for the Royals, the unmentionable scourge of the corgis, even the secret of what the Queen actually keeps in her purse...Really excellent good fun, and I can only say that I wish that there were more of them to read and re-read and recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder Most Royal.... - You can't put it down","review":"Jane Bee came to Europe for adventure, only to end up with the job is a lifetime--housemaid at Buckingham Palace. Now her greatest challenge is removing gum from State Room carpets--until she comes across a nasty accident right outside the Royal Apartments. The Queen herself has--literally--stumbled across the dead body of Jane's good friend, footman and aspiring actor Robin Tukes, in what appears to be a suicide. But why would handsome, impetuous Robin, having just toasted his engagement to a gorgeous housemaid, not to mention his impending fatherhood, want to die? Buck House buzzes, but only Jane--and the Royal Personage known belowstairs as \\"Mother\\"--suspects foul play. At Her Majesty's behest, Jane launches a discreet inquiry that takes her from Servants' Hall to the highest echelons of the Palace. Yet the more Jane uncovers, the more clear it becomes that this latest royal scandal is a real killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting idea and place for a muder mystery","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, mainly because I am interested in the lives of the Royals. It is a clever idea to write a mystery featuring the queen. However, as for the plot goes, it is unnecessarily complicated with too many red herrings. A good travel companion book, or if you want a mystery book on a rainy day on a camping trip, or want to escape to a different world from yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"I love this mystery series. I couldn't find my original copy so I got another one. I'll reread it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too improbable","review":"A story must be somewhat believable for the reader to get involved and this is so improbable that I gave it up half way through. The idea of Queen Elizabeth not only telling personal things to an unknown housemaid and that housemaid questioning her and other high officials was just too silly. And the idea of footmen running naked past the royal rooms was too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"TYR's greatest mistake","review":"These goggles reminded me of the old spectrum TYR goggles, a great silicone gasket set that never leaked and lasted for litterally years (I wore mine for 2 years without issue). I was so impressed with them that I thought I'd try these out.I was severely dissappointed. These goggles leak like mad, and tightening them only makes things worse, since the nosepiece is not adjustable. Shame on Speedo and TYR for making so many models without adjustable nosepieces!! It's impossible to control leakage if there is excessive, turbulent motion to the face, so expect to get an eyeful of chlorinated water after that flipturn.Stray far, far away from these. If you want a soft silicone gasket that will last and practically never leak, stick with TYR's tried and true Racetech style, or even better, try to track down a pair of the discontinued spectrum goggles (good luck)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Read","review":"I would recommend this as a light, uncomplicated read, but by no means is it the run of the mill read. As I read I was keep guessing as to what had happened in her past. There were several funny moments, her tooth, the washing machine... So the right amount of humor was written.

I gave it to my mom for her cats. Again, they looked at it a few times and lost interest. We finally donated it to charity. Besides the lack of interest from the cats, the design is rather flimsy. I suspect this is why my cats didn't like it. When they tried to sit on top of it, it would shake unsteadily. When they leaned against it to scratch, it wobbled.

I felt excited writing such special things to my baby, and now that she is born, I love writing even more things to her, knowing more of her personality and the joy she has brought to our home. As someone else stated, the lead-ins really get you thinking, and help you relay more personal feelings than you might normally consider.

Cal thru the eyes of surveilance cameras. We look at cop killers, pedophiles, cheating husbands and wives both gay and straight, and other characters with very little appeal. \\"Look\\" is ambitious in that it takes on many characters, plots and subplots and attempts to intertwine some of them. The problem is that the characters are just not very likable and that it's hard to care about most of their fates. The film takes a bleak and dark look at its characters and all the negativity and crime isn't much fun to watch.

Totally predictable and we learn nothing new we didn't already know. It was so painful to watch that I began to speed-search till it was over and I guessed every conclusion to each mini-story! There is no reason for you to watch this film. If you want to see a good docudrama-type shocker, (even if you don't learn something new), check out the French \\"Man Bites Dog\\".

The stacking feature is a joke, it takes about 5-10 mins for the switch to begin normal operation after powering it up in a stack.

Particularly if you are a fan of his older works, you will enjoy this stale, formulaic sequel about as much as you might enjoy Rocky or Lassie Part 4. The plot of this book is unoriginal and predictable, and the sophomoric mentality and humor of Mr. Corey - which were amusing for the first book or two, long ago became tiresome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great John Corey book","review":"I love the John Corey character, and had to have this book the moment it was released.

Tally-ho! On to the bad guys! A little of that goes a loooong way. I pitched the book about 1/3 the way through, before I started gagging.

Despite the premise, not an awful lot actually happens. Much of the book is spent with John Corey, whose endless wisecracking and bantering ultimately becomes annoying. There are pages and pages of tedious dialogue between Corey and his wife - back-and-forth, with Corey making snide remarks and his poor wife telling him to behave. Enough, please!

However, I only managed to slog through the first 90-100 pages before I literally couldn't take it anymore. The dialog basically consists of incessant four-letter-word laden insults/wisecracks after another, and that soon became too much for me. I've read countless novels featuring grizzled veteran detectives, but both John and Harry are insufferable. Add to that the volley of political remarks of the so-called 'heroes' made it even more annoying. So annoying that I immediately found myself rooting for the alleged 'villain' throughout the portion that I read. Perhaps I will try another DeMille book, but not one of the John Corey series. This one will be buried."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love the cynical character of J. Corey","review":"I loved the book. DeMille is one of the few writers, with such great sense of humor.

This book was not up to DeMille's standards I even got tired of Corey's wisecrackingThe premise made no sense. The middle of the book was endless. The end was predictable and the only interesting question in my mind in the whole book was not answered.My recommendation is to read or reread an earlier effort.One of the reviewers said DeMille said this is his last book under this contract. I only hope the next effort will show a fresh start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the heads up! I just saved time and $.","review":"I just returned from Nepal and was aware that Wild Fire would be released while I was away. I can't say that I'm surprised that most knowledgeable DeMille fans feel let down. A year ago, on his website, DeMille comments that Wild Fire (at the time unnamed) will be the last book in his contract and that if he ever writes another, it will be on his timetable and not his publishers.Give us an honest effort and we'll excuse a book that doesn't meet expectations, but take advantage, and ..... lets just say they're a lot of choices out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time and a Real Disappointment","review":"When I realized early on the time I would waste on this assemblage of leftover quips packaged around a absurd concept, I resolved that I would alert other readers.Generally I enjoy this author's works and anticipated this latest tome. I was surprised and dissappointed to find a lengthy novel which did nothing to disguise it's clues or probable developments. Everything was telegraphed and nothing was original. The conclusion was so lame that I was shocked that there was no effort to build suspense or intrigue.My advice is to skip this one and wait for the reviews on his next."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have not yet received this book, and it's been more than a month since I ordered it.","review":"I have not yet received this book, more than a month after I placed the order. I am not very satisfied, to say the least!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jingoism, pure and simple","review":"I read this novel until the end of Chapter 4 and then quit.I realized that the author actually promotes (in the foreword)that the MAD(mutually assured destruction) doctrine be used in the following way:If any American city is nuked by unknown terrorists, then the US should nuke all Muslim cities.Jingoism pure and simple.Psychotic politics under the guise of fiction,andthe plot is sleepily slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment......","review":"I had preordered this book and was very much looking forward to reading it. I'd read 4 other of DeMille's books and enjoyed them immensely. What a let down this book is. It's just way too cute and flippant while at the same time raising the specter of the greatest threat this country has ever known. The protagonist characters are completely unbelievable in their actions given the stakes of a suitcase nuclear devise being detonated in a U.S. city. It's not a graveyard or pointed type of humor that permeates the book, it's rather sophomoric and shallow and not even very funny. I kept waiting for the author to get serious and ratchet it up but it ends in a predictable, typical shoot out. Save your money (and time). This is a total waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"The only reason I finished this book was loyalty to my all-time favorite author, Nelson DeMille. Smart a** John Corey continues to be the disappointing main character he was in Plum Island and Night Fall. The book is mostly dialog with a minimum of action. Why does DeMille have his characters talk their situation to death? I was bored stiff by page 100! Could hardly wait to finish! Where is the meat of The General's Daughter and Gold Coast? I will skip the next John Corey adventure while still hoping for the old DeMille in a sequel to Gold Coast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read just a few DeMille books and prefer other authors and this book definitely justified why for me. The main character John Corey seems like a real jerk and was hard for me to root for him at all. He has a smart mouth and is incredibly cocky and has to make a wisecrack to everyone he comes across. The first part of the book when he was not involved was fairly interesting as the plot by the bad guy Madox was laid out, but once harry muller was killed and the story went back to Corey and his wife it really bogged down for me. The ending was nothing spectacular as was wrapped up far too quickly in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, exciting and at times hysterical!","review":"I loved this book! The plot and characters were so interesting. I loved the witty banter between the main character, John Corey and his wife Kate. It's one of the few books that had me laughing out loud! I listened to the book on CD and Scott Brick did an AWESOME job as the voice of John Corey and the other characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Improvement","review":"I have read most of DeMille novels. The early ones: Plum Island, the Gold Coast, the General's Daughter, and later, the Lion's Game, to mention a few, were all terrific and rated at least 4 stars. His later novels have really been disappointing.While John Corey is a real likeable character, DeMille, in this novel, stretches the limits of one's patience. Even the story line here is not very original. At over 400 pages long, this novel could easily have been condensed into a good short story, say 50-75 pages. The huge amount of useless dialague and descriptive material in this novel is just a waste of time and is to be skimmed over. How any one could rate it a 4 or 5 star, is really beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked his older books, you won't like this!","review":"I am astonished by all the rave reviews. I found this book to be unreadable - really cartoonish and reminiscent of countless other dumb thrillers. More importantly the characters were cardboard - especially the villain, but also the \\"hero\\", defined only by a few mannerisms or characteristics (the villain was \\"evil\\", etc.)Where is the thoughtful author of such memorable stories as \\"Up Country\\", with complex, nuanced, stories and characters? I used to love deMille because he was so much better than the kind of book that \\"Wildfire\\" is.I assume he deliberately made the choice to write something by the mechanical thriller recipe book - it must take a lot less time than the satisfying novels he used to write, and, judging by the rave reviews, satisfies a lot of people. But I won't be reading any more.In short, if you liked the denser, more thoughtful books and characters, my advice is not to waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to recommend","review":"I run hot and cold with this author. He is very funny when he's got his main character wisecracking about other people. For this reason I really liked The Gold Coast and Plum Island. But I had to put this one down after several chapters that alternate between men sitting in a room expounding their silly theories, and the protagonist spending time with his girlfriend. I guess, and I'm truly guessing here, that the silly theories are meant to be so terrifying that it would create drama just to have people talk about them. Wrong. I would have given it one star based on that, but I credited him an extra star because he can put a sentence together well. I recommend you avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first DeMille read...excellent","review":"I have to admit I usually shy away from longer books, I don't have tons of time to read so I stick to a quick Koontz or Saul novel usually, but I was glad I picked this one up.If you like conspiracy theories,mystery, crime, then this is for you. A remote cabin in upstate New York is under surveillance by a member of an Anti-Terrorist Task Force and he goes missing. His friend and co-worker John Corey takes it upon himself to get to the bottom of it. With his wife who is in the FBI they encounter Bain Maddox, the owner of the cabin, who with help of the govt. is putting together a plan to destroy the middle east.The first 130 pages mostly take place in this cabin and gives a lot of unnecessary information, I always think it's better to learn the plot as the detective does (like in Koontz novels). Once you get past that tho, the other 600 pages fly right by. I highly recommend this to anyone who thinks the government is up to something."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid premise, obnoxious corey","review":"I was really disappointed with this one -- I had enjoyed a couple Corey novels in the past, but I had to put this one down after about 30 pages. The premise seemed so stupid, and none of the protagonists pointed out some of the obvious problems with the evil plot. And Corey was just a crass, crude buffoon in this one -- I don't remember him being so tiresome in Demille's other novels. It was unreadable. Won't read another Corey novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"I've read to date The General's Daughter, The Lion's Game, Up Country, Plum Island and Nightfall. By far, the best book is The Lion's Game. Demille is a great writer. You understand this when you read someone like Vince Flynn. Yet Wildfire was a disappointment.I will say that this is the first book I've listened to on CD read by an actor. Maybe that was why I didn't like it as much. It seemed so tedious. The action and suspense was almost absent entirely. I think John Corey needs to go away.The Lion's Game needs to be a movie and done much better than The General's Daughter. That movie was painful to watch after reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dreadful Book","review":"I find the quality of Nelson DeMille's writing to be extremely variable - his books with a military backing such as Word of Honor, Up Country and The General's Daughter were superb, but his other books are generally only fair to mediocre.This one hits rock bottom, an unbelievable plot - and an even more unbelievable way for the plot to be uncovered - plus a silly sub plot about John Corey and his previous nemesis, cardboard characters, an overdone smartass approach by Corey and banter between him and his wife that becomes tedious to read.A big disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"I have read most of DeMille's books over the years and this one was not a page turner like others; i.e. Gold Coast, Cathedral, Lions Game. The plot was average and the book relies a lot on Corey's wit. However, I just finally read \\"Word of Honor\\" and it is a great book if not one of his best. I hope DeMille is not getting burned out like some of my other favorite authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go John Corey, Go!","review":"I have really come to love the John Corey story line DeMille created with his book, Plum Island. I would put this one up there just behind The Lion's Game for quality story line. I thought the interaction between John and his wife Kate was really cute. I love the attitude DeMille has given his primary characters and look forward to another in the future. I hope DeMille doesn't quite writing on other topics and limit himself to the John Corey story line because he has some excellent reads in his library of novels. As for this one, good job, Mr. DeMille."},{"rating":"1","title":"DeMille, the human Ambien","review":"At the beginning of the book, DeMille congratulates himself by saying that this book has kept some of his readers up nights. I would like to state for the record that this has to date been one of the best sleep aids I have every come across. The B-movie narrative and action less boredom that DeMille commits to paper made this very possible the dullest book I have ever read. I kept waiting for something to happen but other than your typical Hollywood impossible ending where the 5 foot 2 inch 96 pond girl takes on and tears apart the six heavily armed Navy Seals and wins, I got nothing. Other than being really pissed that DeMille wasted a week of my reading time with this pathetic work I received no emotional stimulus from Wild Fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, yet disappointing at the same time.","review":"The first book of DeMille's that I ever read was a used copy of Charm School, one I never hear mentioned. I was immediately drawn to the author's style, and put him on my favorite author's list. Since then, I have read all his titles.I must say, that I had to struggle to get through the first hundred or so pages of Wild Fire and it's predecessor, Night Fall. Three factors led me to persevere: I am stubborn about finishing a book, the topics are plausible/relevant to today and I am committed to this author. For those reasons, I gave the book an \\"I liked it\\" rating, as I would Night Fall. They are not books that I would put on most people's must read list. Overall, I was disappointed as I was hoping for, and am still waiting for another book of DeMille's that I would give a 5 star rating to.Perhaps DeMille has been trying to hard to fill 400 pages or so, and would be better off trimming the fat to, say, 300 pages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wild Fire","review":"It's been a disappointing read. For someone who wrote Gold Coast and The General's Daughter, this book is a cheap knock-off of really good suspense formula novels. I have not written one of these reviews before, but wanted to take the time because I felt that Nelson DeMille is so much better than this third class effort, and, actually, if I could, I would ask for my money back. Although the basic story line is believable, the behavior of the characters is childish, contrived and highly unlikely. Usually buy DeMille's work immediately when it comes out. Will think twice before I waste my money and time again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"\\"Wildfire\\" is a huge disapointment and not worth the time it takes to slog through nearly 700 pages. What starts out as a fairly compelling idea of purposely nuking a U.S. city to provoke an attack on the muslim world, quickly bogs down into a generic police procedural. The main character, John Corey is without doubt the most annoying person in any novel I have read in a long time. His in your face attitude and NYC cop schtick grows old very fast. In the real world this guy would be beaten up every other second as he mouths off to everyone. For some reason I keep reading Demille's novels hoping at least one will live up to \\"The Charm School\\". No more, I won't be fooled again. \\"Wildfire\\" is a bad boilerplate \\"thriller\\". Don't waste time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book!!!","review":"This book was farfetched and far below my expectations for DeMille. My husband called it \\"God Awful\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have read all of DeMille's previous novels and have enjoyed them greatly. This book is a real disappointment. The book could have been written as a short story, instead it is puffed up with endless and I mean endless dialogue. If this was my first DeMille book it would be my last. My suggestion to him in future efforts is a lot less talk and a lot more action!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not this time","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but it was actually annoying. I really liked John Corey in Plum Island, less so in the Lion's Game, and hated him in Wildfire. the wisecracking was way over the top, and his wife came off as a lame straightman/sidekick.I hope Mr. Demille doesnt do this in the sequel to his greatest work: The Gold Coast. That was the first book I read by him- luckily it wasnt this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable Claptrap","review":"I just started this book this afternoon. I have been a big fan of DeMilles especially Night Fall which took an actual event and wove a compelling story line that makes sense.Wildfire makes no sense at all. We are not fighting other countries but indiviuals in the current confrontation with Islamic extremists. Kill half the militants in the world and you will still have to deal with individuals who live in Cleveland or Manchester.I'm moving on to some better reading like the new Joseph Wambaugh and dumping this turkey before I waste anymore time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this DeMille book!!!","review":"I am a huge fan of DeMille but have to agree with other reviewers and say this one is BORING!!Talk ,talk talk and pages of missed chances wears very thin.Could no one in this book comunicate with any one else?The book is tedious and I do hope DeMille gets back to form soon.Want to read one of his great books--try the Lion's Game."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the calories to lift it","review":"DeMille should hang his head in shame.I suggest he either retire or give his next book a whole lot of though.Actually,the premise of this book is very possible whomever holds the button.BUT.I first take exception to the simplistic cliche that is the villian.ho hum.Read that a thousand times.Boring boring boring.Second,these people are nitwits.A plot this big would have a well rehearsed scenario.Third,the husband and wife team dialogue.Well,that was when I put the book down.I doubt I'll finish it.I don't care what happens though I am sure I know.Read that before in another book.save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves You Wanting More","review":"John Corey is one of those alpha male characters you just cannot get enough of. Hours after finishing this book, I found myself wanting MORE and sad it was over. Of all Mr. De Mille's books, this is the finest. He is truly the Ian Fleming of the 21st Century and John Corey is the new James Bond. Every page of this book is beautifully researched and detailed and to be savored. It is impossible to put down. Mr. De Mille presents a scenario that is like a sliver in the back of every mind in America. Whether we admit it or not, we all have wondered once or twice if something like this was possible. The idea of accepting that the world was actually a safer place during the Cold War is strange, but it seems to be sadly true. This book is a post 9/11 wake up call. It was interesting it came out the very week the Democrats sent a message to Washington that we will no longer \\"stay the course\\" and we want a new policy in the Middle East. I only hope the powers that be are listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of customer service","review":"It's been over a month and I still haven't received the book I ordered.

Why, like a James Bond movie, do the bad guys never just kill Corey when they have the chance. The conclusion was so predictably unbelievable with the \\"race against the clock\\" ending. However, the worst part of the book is Kate, Corey's wife. These two could never exist together, and her character seems to change back and forth from weak to strong character. Take a pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"good plot but horrible writing","review":"Although Nelson DeMille can be an excellent writer, this book which has a provocative plot should have been substantially edited by DeMille or his publisher. The continual wisecracking and sophomoric antics of the main character John Corey detract from the plot, not to mention the fact that the reader can hardly imagine someone like Corey employed in a responsible position within the framework of law enforcement. Editing of Corey's continual wisecracking would have shortened the book substantially and allowed for a quality final product. Although DeMille employed Corey's character in Nighfall, his previous book, in the latter book (which is vastly superior to Wildfire) DeMille exerted reasonable control over Corey's antics and wisecracking."},{"rating":"1","title":"This One Stinks...........No. I Mean it.

I eagerly await my next read - The Lion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Thriller By DeMille","review":"John Corey returns in another enjoyable detective thriller by Nelson DeMille. If anything, this book is put together even better than Nightfall. The characters are engaging and often hilarious. I'm sure I laughed out loud five times at Corey's sharp dialogue. FBI wife Kate is also someone to root for.If I had one complaint, it would be that Corey acts out of character just once, suddenly finding himself with moral qualms when he knows the right thing to do, but if he did, the novel would end abruptly, so DeMille held off.Nevertheless, Wildfire is a gripping and very satisfying read.Top recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"I'm a huge DeMille fan - but Wild Fire fails on many levels.Let's start with the total implausibility of the plot.DeMille says such a plan as Wild Fire probably exists - but the book fails to make me a believer.Let's continue with the sheer stupidity of the main characters, whom you are supposed to respect for brazenly rushing into danger, rather than following protocol, and with total disrespect for their adversaries AND their collegues.But I can live with all that.It's just that the book starts weakly, with no real suspense or drama, and goes downhill from there.The last straw - for the main bad guy to explain to the people who he knows are trying to foil his plans, exactly what his plans are, and how they can indeed foil them; to lead them around at gunpoint instead of just simply blowing them away - well, I guess he never saw a James Bond movie or an episode of Get Smart.Sheer stupidity.Sorry Nelson - I love your other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great cure for insomnia...","review":"You might want to skip the first 125 pages that drone on and on and on and on and on. Things pick up a bit around page 145 as if DeMille had had a shot of adrenaline (or Scotch) while his hero plays detective. His hero by the way has few redeeming qualities, with a not so witty smug remark for everything. Then the author runs out of steam again and by 250 pages or so, brings in the formulaic.Just skip to the end of the book to the they-lived-happily-ever-after-saving-the-universe conclusion.If there is one thing DeMille achieves in this novel, it is not thrills, not excitement, not derring-do, but pure, supreme emphathy for the long-suffering wife/heroine. And that is no justification for reading a non-thrilling thriller. You will, however, read a lot about bears. Bears, bears, bears--which the hero never encounters but seemingly fears, a literary device which the author uses to justify his impossible ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very disappointing!","review":"This book has about 3 interesting chapters; the rest is all dialog between a man and wife. All this chit chat does nothing to further the plot, but simply takes up time and space. There is no suspense until the 49th chapter. Take my word for it; this book is not worth the $$, or time to read. What a waste of talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is the latest of the John Corey series, and the worst! The author Has Corey sounding like a bad stand up comic with too many wise cracks at the wrong times."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment From Demille","review":"I really think that Nelson Demille is an excellent writer. Lion's Game and Gold Cost are superb thrillers, way above the avarage. That is why I'm so disappointed with Wild Fire - a makeshift piece of work that is so boring and shallow. John Corey is an obnoxious hero. If Demille is to write another Corey book, He'll have to decide whether Corey is a law enforcer or a stand-up comedian. One thing for sure - Corey's smug one liners strated to get on my nerves after about 50 pages.As for the plot, nothing really happens, the nuclear conspiracy is left to the background, and we are left with a lame mix of episodes from Mcmillan & Wife and Colombo.Don't waste time and money on this one !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch detective story!! Loved it!!","review":"It is a rare event when I finish a book in 5 days. I simply don't have time. However, in this instance, I found the time. Just like DeMille's last John Corey novel, Nigh Fall, I simply could not put it down. I think Wild Fire is a top notch detective story. It is a captivating, well thought out, plausible story.I recommend NOT reading most of these reviews simply because there are too many spoilers in the reviews (both good and bad).If you are a fan of John Corey and Nelson DeMille Wild Fire is a must read.I am convinced that those you are giving this a bad review are the same \\"right wing loonies\\" DeMille alludes to in the book. Relax you crazy Republicans! Don't take it out on Nelson because y'all no longer control Congress. It's not his fault!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to Demille's usual standards","review":"What happened? DeMille usually produces a thick meaty thought-provoking enjoyable thriller. The problem here is too much silliness. Hero John Corey is constantly making silly comments about bears, and the non-stop sarcasm and other \\"humor\\" is jarring, distracting, and off-putting. In addition, the way Corey deals with his superiors is so unbelievable and unrealistic as to further detract from the plot. If this is your first Demille, don't give up. His other books are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real good read...","review":"I love Demille. He's my favorite author and this is a very good book.

It is a class A page turning suspense thriller that is almost impossible to put down.This book is part \\"Dr. Strangelove,\\" part \\"Fail Safe\\" and part James Bond all rolled together and updated for the 21st century. It also has elements of television's \\"24.\\" A group of powerful, far right Viet Nam veterans seeks to end global terrorism by extraordinatry means. The rest is for the reader to find out for himself.\\"Wild Fire\\" does not have the literary or informational depth of \\"The Gold Coast\\" or \\"Up Country,\\" but it does have some factual information and a couple of interesting ideas for the reader to chew on. As for readability and excitement, it is right up there with \\"The Lion's Game.\\"I recommend this book highly for readers who like action and suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been a DeMille fan for years--but this book was a major disappointment.

Wild Fire is fast-paced. The plot is intriguing, but far-fetched. However, John Corey's incessant flip and insulting remarks are a huge detriment and bring the entire book down to 2 stars. He deserves immediate retirement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It. A Very Entertaining Read","review":"This was my first exposure to Mr. DeMille. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I could hardly wait to pick it back up and starting reading some more. A very, very quick exciting read. If you like the TV Show 24, sprinkled with a bit humor, this is the book for you.

What I don't understand is some of the reviews on Amazon that unjustly blast \\"Wild Fire.\\" It's simply good entertainment from beginning to end.

I read a lot and generally of this genera. DeMille took 706 pages to tell a story what should have been 300-400 pages. The book is weighted down and burdened with excessively cutesy dialogue by the main character. The only suspense is the waiting for something to actually happen and nothing happens of exciting consequence until about 680 or so pages. If you like wise-ass dialogue, intricate, unbelievable plots, and the unbearable suspense of waiting for something to actually happen - this book might be for you. I'll stick to Randy Wayne White, Douglas Preston, Lee Child - writers who write at least as well as DeMille, but who can actually tell a well paced story where things actually happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildfire book","review":"Soooooooooo terribly disappointed.

This one is so far below his usual standard I couldn't believe it. Right off the bat the bad guys tell all their plans to one of the cops... just showing off I guess, but far from credible. Surely the DeMille of old could have found a better device to let us in on the plot. Also, the author acknowledges that some of his law-enforcement readers thought his hero (Corey) plays too fast and loose with the rules. He should have listened to them. Corey becomes ridiculous.And, instead of dialog, the non-stop wisecracking is tiresome.

As always, his story line is so hard to believe that it's believable, leaving us wondering if it is truly fiction ... or is it real? The quick wit of his characters, Detective John Corey in this series, provides a little levity to a scary scenario. I remain a DeMille fan, and look forward to his next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"wildfire","review":"DeMille has regurgitated most of the coy behaviors of his central figure, John Corey, and shoved both he and his wife into the northwoods looking for...not sure what. Once again Corey's superiors are after his skin which he hides from them at all turns. Basically NOTHING really happens before the last 50 pages of the book, then by the use of some clever dime store bear-scare devices our heroes manage to blow the faces off the bad guys and prevent nuclear destruction! There was so much to explore here, however DeMille's Wildfire barely produces a spark. He just picked up his cash on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"There were some very interesting story elements, special transmitters, false submarine codes, and egomaniacs. There are other posts her that give the story line,so I won't go into that and will try not to give any real spoilers, though I'm especially glad that Ted Nash won't pop up again. I did have a problem with the amount of time the story spent away from the main characters, and a lot of time was spent setting up the antagonist. Otherwise, anyone that likes thrillers has to consider this a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, I loved it!","review":"Nelson DeMille is a great writer, and WildFire is a page turner. I have read a lot of his books, and can only hope he will continue to write. I am not sure why this book is getting low ratings from some of the reviewers. Maybe I am just easy to please but I think this is a wonderful tale, thought provoking, flowed very nicely...and you have to love the protagonist, John Corey. His delightfully irreverant (or should I say a smart ass) personality is alway fun. Of course Kate, his wife, is delightful always. This is a fun book, I recommend it highly. Maybe some of these folks don't like John Corey? I could see that happening. He tends to be as big as life and could be intimidating to some. ;- Great book Nelson."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Corey never gets old","review":"To anyome who has read a Demille book and more specificly one from the Corey universe, you will not be disapointed. Almost as good as The Lions Game and the characters have evolved since the events of Night Fall (no spoilers) for the better. Read without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book by Demille","review":"This is another of Demille's good books about Terreism in the U.S. This time is domestic ones. Good all around read. Funny, entertaining, and some suspense. One of his better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I've read all the DeMille books. This is by far the worst. Tedium, routine plot, routine action. Smart arse remarks by the hero constantly distracts from the story line. Want to read an even better plot along the same lines: \\"Seven Days in May.\\" Now that was a classic. The DeMille books up to this one have been at least 4 stars. Maybe he was behind his deadline when he came up with this one. Let's see what the next one will bring."},{"rating":"1","title":"pick another book","review":"I read DeMille other books and have enjoyed them. This book is terrible. The writer puts sarcastic words into the mouth of his hero which detract greatly for the rather interesting plot. It is almost as it the author is thumbing his nose at us the reader to see how sarcastic he can get and still keep us reading his books. This is best shown by the author's acknowledgments where he is again is unnecessary sarcastic and whose only purpose seems to be that the author is trying to show how clever and funny he is. Maybe he is thumbing his nose at me as I was dumb enough to buy and read this book. That mistake that will not happen again as I have given up DeMille books"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Nelson, what happened? Did you get bored with your own style and decide to tone it down?Others: forget this one unless you find one in the cafeteria. If you do, skip to page 275 and read till the end. That will get you back at your desk in about 4 minutes.Bottom line: Its hard to believe this book was written by the same guy as Plum Island."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Jacket So You Don't Have to Buy the Book","review":"If you read the jacket of the book you know most of what is going to happen in the story. If you have read other Nelson DeMille stories, you know that John Corey is not going to die. There's plenty of wise guy remarks and humor in this tale. Basically the story tells how John Corey and his wife discover the sinster plot that you already have been told in the jacket of the book and in the beginning of the story. Nelson DeMille is starting to resemble James Patterson. That's no compliment."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"It has some entertaining value, but it is very close to an absolute loss.1. The investigative part of the two day story is very thin.2. 80% of the book is an unnecessary detailed description of the great John-Corey-against-the-world pissing marathon.3. The tense final standoff is very artificially constructed from unmotivated actions taken by all sides.4. The pretense is kooky beyond all borders of reasonable: we all know that to incinerate the Muslim World all we have to do is to stop propping it up and it will incinerate itself; there is no need to use nukes for the purpose.5. CIA participation line is even kookier, can you believe that george tenets and valery plames of this world would ever participate in nuclear terrorism conspiracy?6. I am tired of yet another millionaire cop constantly complaining about \\"the rich\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Worst","review":"I like Demille's work and looked forward to this one. I can only think it is the result of a contractual obligation. A plot not even \\"24\\" would try. Tedious. Massive amounts of irrelevant chit-chat and scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sizzles with wit and sarcasm","review":"Detective John Corey wants to know what happened to his friend and colleague Harry Muller. Harry was given the assignment to run surveillance on the Custer Hill Club, the home of Bain Madox in upstate New York. He was supposed to be a bird-watcher on a weekend trip but his assignment goes terribly wrong. Incidentally, John was first given the assignment but his boss, his wife Kate told their boss on the Anti-terrorism task force that they were busy that weekend. Still haunted by the memories of 9/11, and the many funerals he attended, John wants to find out what happened to Harry. The character of Bain Madox tends to run too much towards being the stereotypical villain. John and Kate end up on the run as they try to keep ahead of their bosses as they gather evidence. John was the most intriguing and engaging character who kept my interest especially when the surrounding events and dialogue took their time to unfold."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of paper!","review":"The story is lame, poorly researched and badly told. The characters?! OMG! The only good and well thought sentence in the whole book is when the FBI agent tells her husband: \\"Evolution and natural selection should have taken care of people like you\\". People like that exist but they are usually part of a gang and they die early (natural selection). They are certainly not performing tasks where they have to show any level of responsibility. We all know that the public servants that populate the ranks of the FBI, Police Departments and others may not be always \\"the best of the best\\" as they like to call themselves simply because they are human like everybody else. But this book is an insult to these people from whom our safety and future depends. I hope that Nelson DeMille retires very soon because, if not, we may still have the privilege to read in his next book how \\"Bubba the Pimp\\" his running the show at the Pentagon..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Through Knowledge of knowing who we are in the creator.","review":"When I first ordered this book I was some what not quite sure if it was such a good idea.

And who wants to understand prophecies of Ezekiel. This book will open your eyes to a better understand of the world and the condition as to why certain people in our society are at the bottom of the food chain."},{"rating":"1","title":"hostile author","review":"From the very opening of the book the author insults the reader with streotypical views of black people. He also seems to arbitrarily through in GOD in places where it doesn't seem to make any sense. I'm only half way through and some of it does make sense but I think if he had left his opinions out it would have come across better to a reader. I almost wanted to stop in the very beginning but felt I could try and get an understanding for where he was coming from if I kept reading. Only in the middle of the book does he begin make sense to me but I'll keep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved by my four year old pirate","review":"Bought this as a birthday gift for my grandson who loves pirates.

I agree that it is a problem but much smaller. If we look clearly, taking away the job of an average white collar american is much more devastating than not inviting one immigrant into the USA -- immigrants are big part of Mr Florida's creative class.3.

Richard helped me understand that I'm not alone. Yes! I sincerely believe its not just happening in the US. All over the world, the creative class is reinventing how companies run their businesses. I also believe this is for the better. Money is not the main issue here, its having environments that let our creative juices flowing. And companies who can provide that will flourish.

Some folks belive that we need to lure factories and manufacturing plants to provide jobs, even if they bring along adverse quality-of-life effects. Others (like me) hold the viewpoint that if we can maintain a pleasant quality of life, creative people will be attracted to the area who bring in cashflow without concomitant high ecological impacts - for example, consultants, artists, writers, and the like.This book basically makes my case, and backs it up with data.

Rockefeller None of the three would have fallen within a \\"creative\\" occupation on Florida's telling. Yet each of the three illustrates the kind of creativity which creates wealth for society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Explanation of Changes in Our Society","review":"The Rise of the Creative Class is a solid explanation of many of the changes going on in our society. In defining the concept of the Creative Class, Richard Florida provides an effective way to discuss the behaviors and trends of middle-class Americans.The central idea of the book is presented in Chapter 9, \\"The Big Morph (A Rant).\\" In this chapter, Florida proposes that neither a traditional \\"Protestant\\" work ethic nor a Bohemian artistic ethic is an appropriate model for understanding the lifestyles of modern professionals. By understanding the Creative Class on its own terms (instead of according to past models of success), business and government leaders can make better decisions about how to build strong organizations and communities.The rest of the book provides extensive research leading to and supporting these conclusions, show that the ideas Florida presents are not only reasonable, but also grounded in fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book resonates","review":"Much of this book is spent on demonstrating how Mr. Florida's ''creative economy'' is reshaping society, not as is commonly believed the other way around. It's a bit of a kick-in-the-pants for the holier-than-thou family values crusaders who chastise gays and others who don't fit into their perfect world. It goes on to provide a strong argument that diversity is the breeding ground of creativity and therefore the bedrock of our economy.Mr. Florida presents plenty of research, antidotes, personal experiences and astute observations throughout the book, and he oftentimes had me looking up, gazing at nothing in particular while pondering how the new information I was taking had indeed already taken root in my own life.

What I did find to be distracting was the underdeveloped characters and plot and careless writing. It's true that \\"Eyeball Wars\\" is fast-paced, energetic, and exciting: in fact, I read the book very quickly and honestly enjoyed it. But in terms of craft, it was low on the totem pole: the characters were two-dimensional and difficult to like, and the plot was predictable. There was also an unpleasantly distinct air of mysogyny running throughout as well, and that certainly didn't help. I certainly wouldn't say it's any masterpiece of literature because of these glaring issues, but it did have its moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inside Politics","review":"I found the book a bit too much inside politics.

True, when Scott was writing this in 1999 and 2000, these words rang true--you really COULD go online with no business model and little content and make tons of money--generally through venture capital. Now we'd laugh at the notion, and that's why at this point no one could really take this book seriously. We've already seen how the dot-com boom didn't pan out and it was oddly enough because of the very business practices outlined in \\"Eyeball Wars\\". Yes, it's still horribly written, dripping with mysogyny, and lacking in character development, but from a historical standpoint \\"Eyeball Wars\\" is purely (unintentionally) fascinating, and a much more relevant and interesting read than it was two years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks!","review":"Unless you are an Internet junkie, I can't recommend this one.

If you're not very competent at the guitar and want to eventually be able to bust out the solo from \\"Last Nite\\" at parties, this is the book for you.

It says it on the front of the F-ing CD. Well I think this is a really good compilation and I will be buying the next one also. The DVD is the best part of this package and should be viewed by everyone despite what side they are on. My favorite songs on here are done by Alkaline Trio, Anti-Flag, Against Me!, Rise Against, and Denali...even though it does not go with the CD. I don't really like the Epoxies song, the Ataris', or the verses of The Frisk song. The rest of the CD is good though.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is a collection of idiots shouting unsupportable propaganda with all the confidence you'd expect from anyone whose \\"knowledge\\" centers around their own ego (and id, for that matter). Which is to say, it mirrors the MTV generation perfectly. After listening to this, anyone would understand if you were moved to exhort the next slack-jawed 15-year-old drooler you come across to read a history book instead of pawing through Howard Zinn.

And I got better things to do on my time. I can see singers/rock bands expressing themselves on how the world is going and why they don't like what's going on, but to make a group or a concert or an entire album basically called \\"We Hate Bush\\" is unacceptable. Thank God Garbage is too good to be on this or the other cd. Why don't the so called \\"bands\\" get a fricking life and sing what they know best and leave the politics to the politicians.

Perhaps we will in the future vote based upon studying the issues, not because Bruce Springsteen or NOFX thinks voting for Kerry is cool. Conversely, perhaps those on the right will vote based upon calm reflection and study as well, not because some country singer at a Sean Hannity Freedom Concert told them to vote for Dubya.To all of them, I ask them to consider the relevance of Bob Dylan's query:How does it feel?To be on your own?A complete unknown?Like a rolling stone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"sigh - washed up bands snatching your $$$","review":"Oh goody, another music album against President Bush and the war.

The problem is, the songs are average at best. The Alkaline Trio song stands out but I think it's the shortest song they have ever made. Everything else on the cd seems to be filler tracks. This release has generated a lot of opinions on the current state of political affairs. No matter how messed up they may be, I disagree with the fact that artists such as these (ie. Fat Mike) feel the need to assert so much of their own ideas on to the very easily influenced youth of this country. I buy cds for the band's music. I don't give a crap who they voted for. Entertain me. That's all. It's good to educate kids who know little or nothing about our government but don't use your status as a rock star to do it.

Fat Mike used to make some lyrically dumb music in his early career so I never took him super seriously, but now he's bringing together a young sub-culture to positively attempt social change. 4 stars for trying!

Neither of the principle characters, Connor McCloud and Erin Riggs, has a single personality trait that's attractive. McCloud is tortured to the point of psychosis, filled with self-pity and uncontrolled lusts. Erin, the object of his obsession, is a compulsive snot who plays on his emotions like a mandolin, is at one moment a totally dedicated business-woman and at the next a sexual wanton. What she sees as attractive in him is merely physical, and creepy physical at that. Otherwise, he's rude, coarse, ill-mannered, and slightly crazy. He wants to dominate her and she wants to manipulate him. You wouldn't want to go to lunch with either of them, even if they were buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"My own fault...","review":"I am disgusted that I read this book and it's my own fault. After reading Behind Closed Doors and finding it a ridiculous waste of time (how many ways can you describe sex on page after page after page??), I told myself this one had to be better.After all, it couldn't get worse, right?? I was WRONG!The male and female leads are cartoons who apparently don't have a functioning brain cell between them...but why do you need brains to have sex 5,6,or 7 times a day?This is nothing more than a copy of Behind Closed Doors with the names changed. Same bad guys, same sex scenes, same ridiculous plot right down to the dressing of the female character in sexy clothes and makeup, just like the first book.What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"I read about this book in the back of another, very good story and foolishly got my hopes up.

A notch above those stories people send into Playboy and Hustler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over use of profanity","review":"The story line was very well written, however I cannot get past the over use of profanity in Ms. McKenna's writing. Her characters use the Lord's name in vain as if it is the catch phrase of the year. I was so taken aback by the use, I wrote Ms. McKenna concerning this unfortunate choice of expression and she said she was sorry, but would continue the use because the characters in her books are alive in her head. If her characters are so insolent....what does that say about her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth finishing","review":"Few books are so bad that I won't even finish reading them. In that respect, this one takes the cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top and uninteresting..","review":"I think the only thing that prevents this book from reading like a bad movie is that the hero doesnt have a catch phrase that he repeats every time he beats people up. I am willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the premise of an entire family of stunningly handsome super-ninjas but everything about this book over the top! The villain is sooo bad that he is a cliche and his master-plan is so convoluted that it makes James bond villains look normal. It is good that the lead characters are already in love with each other because I don't think the author would have been able to create a bond between them convincingly. It would have helped if the unending sex had any sizzle to it :).Overall, not worth the money or time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standing in the Shadows","review":"This is the second installment to Shannon McKenna's The McCloud Brothers Series and this story is about Ex-FBI agent Connor McCloud and Erin Riggs. I definitely liked this story better than Behind Closed Doors & Out of Control. I have yet to finish the series, but am looking forward to it. This story has all the suspense, romance, thrills, & erotica thrown into one. I loved Connor's character: tough & strong, yet vulnerable. Erin was also a likeable & strong heroine. Their relationship was well developed and believable & together, they burn the sheets with hot, scorching flames! The story moved at a good pace with lots of suspense and twist & turns. I really enjoyed this book & highly recommend it for those who like their romantic suspense with a sprinkle of erotica!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs editing","review":"Frankly, there was TOO MUCH SEX. Ordinarily that is not a problem <g> but in this book, it really didn't advance the characters much after the first critical scene, maybe one or 2 others, but mostly began to get repetitive, while trying to be erotic. Connor was an interestingly tortured hero, but Erin was not as clearly defined, and her dialog/motivations occasionally slipped very close to ludricrous. And jeez for someone she loved for so long, she doesn't trust him much, doing almost completely opposite of what he wants her to do, just to get herself into trouble. Yeah, the bad guys were really creepy, but c'mon, once you get the girl in your clutches, ya let her go?? Argh. And, jeez, all that talk about no-condom sex and no repercussions? How very un-politically correct!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa!!! HOT!!!","review":"One of my favorite things is finding a new author!!!

I liked the charactersand the plot. Definitely a fun sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Started off great...","review":"This book started off great. Connor and Erin were hot, with just enough longing and emotional buildup to make it very interesting. But then the plot just dragged and Connor was being setup to look crazy for hundreds of pages with no relief. I really think that about 100 out of the 470+ pages could have been edited out. The plot was just so obvious, I started skimming whole scenes, just to finish the darn thing. Regardless, if you are looking for a hot romance, Shannon McKenna is hard to beat (well maybe by Lori Foster), you may just have to suffer through a lame suspense plot to enjoy the romance though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazz Baby!!!","review":"Brick - Good High 19761.

You have limited characters to chose from, but you can change your clothes. I really enjoyed Knights of the Old republic, so I looked at these reviews. Some of them said oh this game really sucks and I chose to ignore them because I really enjoyed Knights of the Old Republic.

The graphics are blocky and unrealistic. The gameplay overall is generally fun, with helpful first-person shooting and third-person lightsaber combat. However, lightsaber combat is basically hacking at each other until eventually one keels over and dies, pressing the button over and over until you win. Often I found it difficult to know what the heck I was supposed to do/where I was supposed to go. The controls are simple, but basically you use the two thumbsticks and the fire button. That's all.

When I first played the game I was very impressed with the graphics, the sound, and the levels. I found the default controlls to be a little weird but... Overall it is a must buy for all Star Wars fans and has entertained me for hours, and hours to come.....thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"hmmmmmmm....(Sigh)","review":"I have to say that this is the biggest disappointment in videogame history. Being a big fan of Jedi Outcast, I egarly rushed out to buy this game. What I got was a rushed peice of crap. The graphics are really, rally, bad. The story is weak too and you don't even get to play as Kyle! Yah sure you get to create your own character, but the cration isn't nearly as cool as Kyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty fun","review":"this game is not bad. Its is not as good as Jedi outcast but it matches up. The sound is good and hte praphics not bad at all. The only thing soo far is the enemies are kind of dumb. they don't move or anything soo far of what i have played bu that is really the only thing wrong. You can pick yuor race, gender, and the neccessities for your lightsaber. You have the same powers as in Jedi outcast with one extra i think it is sense power. You get to have two sabers and a double bladed saber which is really cool. have fun with this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Fun!!","review":"When I first got this game for christmas I was thinking oh-no because I had played it before on PC and it wasn't that fun. Well when I played it on X-Box I had a really fun time playing it. From just joining the academy to killing your friend. This game is really fun.Pros: The levals are cool. The lightsabers are cool.Cons: You can't really make your person look like you want him to look like there are only three male human heads to choose from . The graphics aren't the greatest luke sometimes looks like a girl.All in all this game is good and I recomend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it Too Late","review":"Jedi Knight Jedi Academy is a great game. But, during online play it lags alot. I always find myself in one place and then in the other. But, if you take out the ethernet cable then put it back in, it works fine. I like all the character changes that you can make in xbox live. Everything is great but I wished the graphics were better. But, that's what I get for not getting this earlier. t's just that i'm used to graphics like Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3 and Halo 2 that I expected the same effects. But, that would be unfair to compare this game with either of those games because they came out so much earlier. It's a great game, just got it too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't disappoint me.","review":"This game is a well rounded addition to my collection of games. Some of the common complaints are enemies AI, and simplicity of the enemies. Storm Troopers do not just stand around waiting to be defeated. Obviously whomever wrote that only played the game on its lowest difficulty. The Lightsaber Duels are awe inspiring. The controls are a little off when it comes to powers, but actual combat with other Jedi looks like the movies. Switching combat styles is also very cool. It's nice to be able to change the pace of the battle with the press of a button. I only gave it four stars because the voice acting and cinematic scenes are just plain bad. But you aren't going to play the game for voice acting and cinematics. You're going to play it because of you can Lightsaber Duel, and that's all that counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the finest shaving cream made.","review":"Not an exaggeration.

We have a maltese and this crate is great for our dog, a little bit big for an 8-lb dog, but I like it that he can move around in there. The dog is well behaved, so the crate door is always open, and he uses it as his little doggie house. I recall locking him in there one time when the cable-TV guy came over. We actually put it in the middle of the high-traffic area (we are lucky the area is somewhat spacious)... it was placed there and we never thought to put it anywhere else! I use it to throw a jacket or books, packpacket, etc on top...LOLs. Anyway, it looks good and doesn't bother us being there between the kitchen and living room. Very nice product. sturdy. portable, although my wife probably couldn't lift it into the minivan by herself.

With 2 people, putting it together is easy, like the plastic floor...put puppy pad down, and still enough room for a lambs wool \\"bed\\".

My English Bulldogs sleep in these pens which double as night stands on either side of my king size waterbed. I put a poster frame over the top and cover it with a table cloth that coordinates with my color scheme; the table cloth covers the poster frame and drapes down the sides and back of the pen to give the dogs the den effect while creating a color coordinated piece of furniture that works perfectly as a night stand.

When I saw this one and read the great reviews I decided to take a chance and buy it. I purchased this kennel for my aging incontinent minature poodle. I use a small puppy training tray with a pad on one side of the kennel and a small pillow on the other side. If the pad is soiled by the time I make it home from work, I can easily change it out by removing the top of the kennel. It sure beats mopping my laundry room every day. My husband and I put it together within 30 minutes, the wood is very nice and the bottom plastic tray is easy to clean. It doesn't have a removeable tray, otherwise I would rate it 5 stars.

Robert Redford did an excellent job as a World War I flying ace being forced to adapt to a civilian life style after the war and at the same time watch the world, as he knew it, slip away.This happens to many of us as we grow older and the world around begins to change. Like Reford in The Great Waldo Pepper you try and grasp onto what your most familiar with. The world and it's changes leave you behind. What do you do? In this well made, well filmed and well acted movie you will find out about the life and dreams of one man placed where there is no return.The Great Waldo Pepper Has some of the most beautiful flying scenes that you will see anywhere. It turns back the pages of time and gives you a little glimpse of what flying was all about in its infancy. My suggestion: Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Waldo Pepper","review":"This is a moving tale of a daredevil hero ace from aviation's early days who can't accept changes in the field during the post-War period. Beyond that, Redford's Waldo Pepper is a tragic hero of mythic proportions, determined to fly too close to the sun. The bi-plane sequences are breathtaking, and George Roy Hill's direction is what you'd expect from the maker of \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" and \\"The Sting.\\" Unfortunately, Goodtimes Video's policy is to release films \\"enhanced to fit your TV screen\\" and the power of this film's visual majesty is severely diminished. It's another case of a distributor who just doesn't get it.

This ranks right up there with Jedi Knight: Jedi Outcast and Academy for my favorite Star Wars game. The reason for this is simple: the aerial fighting is amazing, and this is actually two games in one. That being said, a downside of purchasing this game is that playing Rogue Squadron II requires a second player, but that shouldn't be incredibly hard to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"soooo FUN!!!","review":"Whoa man this game is fun!

When I rented this I was ready to stay up all night playing it, after an hour I put it away. This game is a horrible disgrace of the star wars game license which is getting a bad reputation as it is. If it didn't have ground missions this game would have four stars, but those idiots at LucasArts thought \\"Let's try to annoy game fans in an all new dimension\\" and they added pointless idiotic ground missions. The flying missions and AT-AT or AT-ST or whatever missions are pretty good but can be annoying/confusing, hard core star wars fans should buy this because they will actually keep trying to win those stupid ground missions, but if you just want a good space shooting game get a different rogue squadron game A GOOD ONE!!!

This game was pretty bad. Soem major plot flaws. Some horrible control (can't control the camera on foot missions) and just plain stupid elelments like \\"sonic weapons\\" in space. When I came across that, I just turned the game off. Fortunately I rented this because I wasn't sure I like it. I loved Rogue 2 and it's one of my favorite games. I liked the idea of flying some missions with a friend, but the single player version is dumb dumb DUMB.People who like this game probably also like Jar-Jar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but this game blows.","review":"You cannot change the camera angle at all; sometimes you can't see where you are or what you are doing. The only even partially good missions (no missions are any good, I just mean the ones that are better than others) are the ones in which you are in space in a starfighter. On land, walking, you can't see what you are doing most of the time, and there are only a few controls: shoot your gun, move, and roll or jump. There is only one weapon, the gun, and one way to use it. Aiming is strange, the game is overall completely boring, with a hideous storyline that gets old fast, and poor controls. I have not played the other Rogue Squadron games, maybe they are better.

There's a 2 player mode!!!!! yeah but the only thing exciting about that is the co-op of Rouge Leader. some of the missions are kinda cool though the problem is you'll have to play through so much garbage you'll be afraid to continue on to finds these rare gems.

Nice to get new missions and new vehicles. The speeder bike ones arent too much fun as they are a little to unforgiving. The AT-ST is a nice addition but the missions seem to easy with them, they take a lot of hits and dish out lots of firepower. The biggest flaw by far are the foot missions. This should have just been left out. They didnt take the time to make them full featured and seem more of an add on, a really annoying add on. Some of the missions are great but the foot action in between the flying ruins the overall effect.

I would strongly advise having some basic guitar techniques down before tackling these excercises including some fingerpicking dexterity, chording and feel for the music. The included DVD makes this an absolute value with visual demonstrations of many Flamenco techniques an audio CD alone would not be capable of. Juan Martin is an experienced master of the genre and educates the student about the palos or rhythmic forms and their origin. Having just received the book, I'm looking forward to picking up many of the techniques and adding these pieces to my repertoire."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't run before you can walk","review":"Firstly, from my own experiences I am convinced that learning solos before experiencing authentic flamenco first-hand in its land of origin is rather like building a house from the roof down. I started with a Mel Bay book and as my fascination grew I bit the bullet and went to Jerez in Spain and studied with David El Poeta, an actual human teacher, and a good one. In a few weeks I learned a whole gamut of essential techniques and nuances without which playing these solos would have been meaningless.Mr Martin presents some good examples of flamenco playing but they are all based on his deep knowledge of flamenco rhythms and harmonic structures which he acquired by acompanying singers and dancers.So although it's all great stuff, a trip to Southern Spain where you can see flamenco guitar played in its natural context would be a sensible step before buying this book and attempting the solos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great presentation","review":"The DVD is like a presentation / demo with great explanation on the background and terminology of Flamenco.

I did not like the lead characters at all. I didn't like most of the characters actually and the dialogue was grating on my nerves! The author went overboard with the cliches. Nikki (main character) came across as rude, pushy, flaky and boring. I listened to the audiobook and I didn't like the narrator, that might have contributed to my exacerbation with the book. I kept with it only because I was curious to see who the murdered was, and it kept me listening to something while I finished my chores.

I like distracters in a book because it makes the reader wonder who did it, but there were so many characters used to distract (junk up a really good story) that I finally lost count. It was a struggle to remain focused because of the \\"junk\\" the author continued to include in the story. Also, these people were buried alive, where was the emotion from the hero and heroine? The hero was lacked emotion and depth and the heroine was awful.

There are several problems I had with it:1) Way too many characters -- and they are virtually indistinguishable in tone and voice. Not only that, I never became attached or interested in any one of them.2) The book uses, inexpertly at that, every single cliche in this genre -- amnesia, serial killer at large, etc. I could add a few more -- but don't want to spoil it for anyone.3) I could see the \\"surprises\\" in the book coming a mile away. There was nothing at all that I didn't see coming.4) The romance aspect, perhaps because of the vast number of characters, was unconvincing and downright creepy. Again, can't say more without spoilers.This book barely held my interest. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great study; don't overpay here!","review":"First of all, don't buy this used here - it sells new for $[...] each unit (there are 4) at [...]This study systematically goes through all of the bible.

There are additional timelines, cd, and workbooks available through bibestudyguide.com although they are NOT necessary. They can get expensive & I don't think they add much. Personally we are doing 3 studies a week with fun crafts/games/projects the other days. Then we have time for an alternate study a year (heaven, creation, world religions, purity, etc.) This study is great for homschooling, but is invaluable to any Christian parent wanting to obey the command of the home being the primary source of Biblical education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first attempt...exceptional chords","review":"Ben Gibbard knew what he was doing on this album.

This record is non-stop fun. Such Great Heights and Clark Gable are both fantastic. The beats grab hold and you have to sing along. Ben Gibbard is the best. Altho I love his DCFC work, it's nice to hear him let go and be upbeat with this record. One note, I heard on Radio@Netscape on the Indie station, an acoustic version of We Will Become Silouhettes...it was so nice. I wish there was a version of the album with similar sounds. And it's only $9.99 at Tower! What a steal. I was so happy to see it in the top 10 of best cds for 2003. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, terrible.","review":"NO, NO THEY ARE NOT............they are not groundbreaking, original, or any of those other positive adjetives people have been throwing out about The Postal Service. Hard to believe DNTEL could have his name put on this. And for all the skeptics who were waiting for Death Cab to completely fizzle over and show how truly bad they were, well, here is your sneak preview."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"My girlfriend listens to it so i downloaded a dozen songs to check it out. I tried over and over to enjoy it but its very monotonous and downright horrifying to listen to.The vocals are sometimes half-sung or just spoken. If it weren't for the cheesy keyboard beats and the half-ass effort vocals I may have more interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Postal Service goes out of service","review":"My indie loving friend recommended this album to me. When I complained that there were only two good songs on the CD, she said, \\"I know, but I just listen to the whole thing anyway.\\" Strangely, every other person I know who has the album listens to the whole thing for just two good songs. What is this odd phenomenon? It is the plight of a lousy album that has somehow become popular. Listen to The New Pornographers instead, or Stars. Don't be surprised when indie kids actually listen to the songs and The Postal Service goes out of service."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is considered music?","review":"This is the worst excuse for music I have ever heard. Since when does playing tunes on a Casio Keyboard qualify anyone to think they have what it takes to become a musical artist? I am baffled by the fact that there is someone out there willing to produce such garbage. I would rather listen to a bunch of starving, whining alley cats than be tortured by The Postal Service. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 reasons why i want to rip my ears out","review":"It is an appaling age in musical history when synchopated beats like those emenating from the Postal Service are held in high regard by people who usually have good musical taste. Let us compare the teeny-bopper sounds that Give Up produces to some of the previous and current music that is available so that we can realize that this band is really not worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT GOOD AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AWFUL!!!!!! YUCK!!!!","review":"This band is terrible. death cab for cutie is awful too and has a much uncooler band name. do not buy this...as bad as metallica's new album."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Wish They Where, \\"THE ANNIVERSARY\\"","review":"First off this is not a great album by any means. Yes, greatly produced but it seems WAY to fake. I absolutley hate when albums are controlled by the engineers who make it sound as if zombies are playing music. Any body can have this sound with a great engineer and little experience with insturments(BAND). The electronic beats with indie music has been done. Please try the \\"ANNIVERSARY\\" for more heart felt lyrics and just plain better electro-pop. The Anniversary has the most heart felt lyrics that are genious.Just cause wherer i live the postal service is number 1 on the radio deosn't mean its good music. You guys are like corporate zombies walking in straight lines following one another. WAKE UP get some good music.Who is more foolish? The fool or the fool who follows?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such Abyssmal Lows","review":"To be honest I've never heard this record but the radio plays that song \\"Such Great HEights\\" about once an hour at work and it's the most remarkably annoying song I've ever heard in my life! Good sweet Lord! It sounds like a cross between the pet shop boys and Jimmy Eat World. I've had people tell me that I gotta check out Death CAb For Cutie, but not after having this guy wail nosily in my ear every hour! It sounds like it should be playing in the background of some U.P.N teen drama or something. Pick up a Fall record instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Postal Service \\"Give Up\\"","review":"The Postal Service is the electronic-pop combination of Death Cab For Cutie's Ben Gibbard and Dntel's Jimmy Tambarello. I was a little skeptical coming into listening to this album on whether or not i would like it, but i was not dissapointed. It was much much better than i had expected. The songs are not too drawn out and boring, which i myself find in many synth-driven songs. In fact, many are quite catchy and have a sing along quality. Highlights include \\"Such Great Heights\\" and \\"Sleeping In.\\"Rating: Four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps getting better...","review":"When I first got this album, I couldn't get past my initial impressions of it as simply boring techno. However, once I sat down and listened to it, I found that I LOVED it. It seems to just get better every time I listen to it. My two favorites were: #1: \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" and especially the melodic duet #4: \\"Nothing Better.\\" If you know what's good for you, go out and buy this album NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving it.","review":"I've always liked DCFC but found them a bit morose. The album boasts intelligent, glittering detail and infectious melody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy Synth Pop","review":"Let me preface this by saying, I'm a huge Ben Gibbard fan and this album delights me fiercely. The album starts out with District Sleeps Alone, which is very catchy. The second Track, Such Great Heights, a cover of Iron and Wine is simply fantastic. The melodic hooks inspire. Nothing Better features Jenny Lewis from Rilo Kiley and her sweet, sultry voice is a delicious match to Ben Gibbard's vocals. This song will have you tapping your fingers to the lyrical beat.The middle of the album is a bit boring but it gets better towards the end. Sleeping In and Natural Anthem are great songs. If you savor catchy synth pop and want to hark back to the 80's with a new millenium feel, then this is the album you've been searching for. This music sounds good really loud too, I have an amp in my trunk and the bass on District Sleeps Alone rocks my rearview mirror which is delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!!!","review":"Out of the thousand of albums I own this is one of my favorite albums in my collection. Ben Gibbard is one of the best songwriters of his generation and teamed up with Jimmy Tamborello the two of them create wonderful indie pop music. From the opening track \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" to the final track \\"Natural Anthem\\" I can't imagine this album being any better. When you have an amazing song like \\"Such Great Heights\\" and it isn't even the best song on the album you know that you've got a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lol at their theory on Kennedy","review":"Sleeping in... because they want to be ignorant of Cuba's involvement? The apparent truth does seem to look bad for the US, this feels like propaganda."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome cd","review":"i normally don't listen to the genres of music postal service falls into (i guess it's electropop and sort of emo). i mainly listen to hip hop (del the funkee homosapien, madlib, atmosphere, latyrx, etc.) and very few groups/bands/artists of other genres. after a friend who was a huge fan recommended it to me, i went out and got the cd and really loved it (well the first 2/3 of it anyway...i usually pop another cd in after clark gable, the rest just got boring, hehe). just about every song up to and including clark gable sounds pretty good, except recycled air...that one bores me.i'd recommend it to anyone hoping they'd give it a chance. the lyrics and the vocals just sound so good. the vocals and the synth beats also compliment each other so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music marred by bad production and iffy lyrics","review":"*Give Up* is very appealing the first few times one listens to it. Much of the music is pretty good, but the album suffers from uneven lyrics, uninspired instrumentals and bad mastering.Ben Gibbard's lyrics sometimes work very well, but frequently make me wince:\\"I'm feeling green / like teenage lovers between the sheets.\\"\\"Nothing Better,\\" starts with a neat line but then turns into a silly emo mess. The vocals are a kind of annoying whiney monotone and have a emotionally vacant quality that matches the cheap synths a bit too well.The most serious problem with this album is the production. The tracks are insanely overcompressed, and there is almost no dynamic range or variation in the instrument levels. The sound has no presence and the Game Boy/Casio keyboard synth loops get very old very fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"love life love postal service","review":"I am a person who belives in living my life to its own soudtract. There are dozens of Cds that I have in it, this is one. Its romantic for that hopeless romantic in all of us. I love the lyrics. They come across so sad yet so hopeful.It just goes to show you that we all need what John Lennon talked about all his life \\"LOVE, peace, and harmony. What more could a soundtract ask for in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect synthpop album!","review":"The best thing I've heard so far in 2002. Tamborello's delicate glitchy beats and catchy hooks mesh perfectly with Gibbard's lyrics and vocal style. What is there to say that hasn't already been said? This is the new New Wave. No cheese. No shlock. This is the real thing. \\"Nothing Better\\" is the best song I've heard in quite a while and might beat \\"Don't You Want Me\\" for the best male / female vocal exchange in a synthpop song. The boys go New Order style all over \\"Clark Gable,\\" another great song. There's only ten songs in all. You'll wish there was more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome 80s throwback","review":"I bought this for my husband, a huge Duran Duran and The Cure fan. He absolutely loves it. You can tell who these guys were inspired by. If you like synthesisers, this one's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet pop music that rocks my a$$","review":"The district sleeps alone tonight is so sweetly atmospheric it breaks my heart and i've never wanted to be in love more than when i am listening to such great heights..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, Can't Wait for More!","review":"The Postal Service is a great band and Give Up really proves it. The CD is full of great songs. I recommend Give Up and any other Postal Service music to anyone who loves electronic/indie music. I can't wait for their next CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay!","review":"I absolutely love the melodies that are sung on this album. *The district sleeps alone tonight* is definitely a great song. I am usually not a fan of electronic music, but this album is very catchy. Good for a long drive. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad I found it...","review":"I picked this up after hearing \\"Such Great Heights\\" on the VW Beetle/iPod \\"pods unite\\" website.It's quirky and a good mix of moods. I've enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album - great music","review":"Give Up by The Postal Service is a great album. It has 80's textured synthesizer melodies with post grunge song structure. The lyric content isn't original but a nice breather from the pessimistic millennium rockers, the pop princesses, and the hip-hop wanna-be's. This album has a huge replay value, and makes an interesting addition to anyone's rock and/or pop CD collection. This CD is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!","review":"This album is sweet. It is a new sound and great to relax to. I recomend the band Pinback to anyone who likes this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pet Shop Boys of the 90s.","review":"Is that a good thing or a bad thing, you ask? That all depends on how much you like the PSB. But if you are not a big fan of them, the Postal Service still offer enough updates on electronic beats that can make a great listen. This Cd is one of those that you can leave in the CD player for heavy rotation."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Fave","review":"I really like this CD. It has such great lyrics that really hit home. I needed a new CD to help me get through a break up and this was perfect. My favorite song is District Sleeps Alone Tonight. It is beautiful.This man has the most beautiful words... this CD has some of the most romantic songs I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite.","review":"This album makes me want to dance in a wheat field somewhere in Northern Ontario. Is that wrong? This is a gorgeous meeting of the minds. Flavours of Future Bible Heroes, Stars, and of course the remarkable beauteous sounds of Death Cab for Cutie and Dntel. More, more, more. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could anybody not like this album?","review":"Well a couple turnoffs include the sickeningly dull, totally non-poetic lyrics and weak, emoish singing style. No not beautiful so much as realllllllllly sappy. A couple of the melodies are kinda memorable but in an annoying way. And come on people, can we maybe stop with the \\"anybody who loves music\\" will like this s%@*. I happen to LOVE music but not this. It's also insulting to bands like the Shins or New Order to be compared to this. For cool \\"warm\\" electronic check out Plaid's \\"Not for threes\\" or for cool catchy music try the Shins, the Strokes, the Pixies, Spoon, early Cure, the Smiths among countless others . Don't get duped into wasting money on one of the most overrated/hyped products around."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit of dread.","review":"it is so saccharine, making me want to check my pulse and my insides to make sure i havent melted into cheesy mess. this band demonstrates why i tread carefully around all things indie pop. (but this kind of electronic sound, all soft and sweet, is no longer good for me..coupled with the fact that i cant get down with the death cab)"},{"rating":"1","title":"the singer isn't cool","review":"the singing is too horribly imperfect, it destroys the otherwise beautiful album. go buy light yourself on fire by stars. It's very similair, but they can sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Return to Sender","review":"This girl I was dating listened to the Postal Service, she thought they were a pretty cool band. What's interesting, I told her they have this indie-rock sound about them; an old eighties/early nineties sound. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, they're this indie-electro band--much like Depeche Mode, New Order, OMD, and the Pet Shop Boys--riding a wave of unparalleled success, in the dynamic electronic-underground music scene. If it weren't for the uninspiring vocals on this unimpressive CD, it would've ended up in people's mailboxes all over the world. Unfortunately, the unwilling participants are led to believe this band has any merit, in the unbelievably craptastic way it's put together: It sounds arbitrary, if not ridiculous, as if though some teenage kids got together after school in their garage, hoping someone out there would notice their broad vocal range in some of the songs. It's stripped of any value as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuse me while I kill myself.","review":"Listen to M83, Depeche Mode, and New Order.Hell, even Air.This is the most pretentious and dull electro-indie I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Postal Service=Terrible Music","review":"Wow! I dont mind Death Cab for Cutie that much, but that doesn't mean that I will force myself to like all of the crap that is created by any band member.If i wanted to hear \\"experimental\\" souds with electronic edge, I would listen to the masters, not some suckass wannabe supergroup. You want some \\"breakbeat\\" sounds? You want electronica and noise? Try Beck's \\"Odelay\\" or \\"Midnite Vultures\\"If you admire this ablum's \\"daring\\" sound, try listening to EVERY OTHER BAND THAT HAS DONE THIS BEFORE! (note: the other bands did it much, much better too!) Broken Social Scene, Sonic Youth, the Flaming Lips.Catchy choruses and Death Cab appeal can't save this album from one simple fact: it is terrible music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I tried","review":"I listened to this CD various times in broken parts and then once from start to finish all the way. I found it to be extremely irritating. I'm sorry, I just don't get it. The Postal Service is not for me. It has nothing that I look for in music. My tastes are a lot different than the other people who reviewed, so take your pick..... It just sounds like a seventeen year old kid who got dumped by his girlfriend and now he's using his PC and Nintendo to make cute music for little girls to dance to. Why anyone would wanna buy this album is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"um...","review":"The beats are ok, but dated already... the lyrics are sappy and bad. Good for the high school crowd though who have heard nothing better. Melodies are pretty poor.To the reviewer who said \\"Shoot me in the head if I ever find better music than this, please. \\"You need to seriously expand your horizons. I could name about 50 bands that are eons beyond this stuff. You can start with My Bloody Valentine."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh","review":"I love the song Such great heights, but the rest of the album sounds like a cartoon or tetris is being played. It's gets stupid and the lyrics aren't good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy the hype-KG","review":"In indie music circles, fans tend to protect the work of their heroes with motherly rabidity, even if it is not entirely justified. Ben Gibbards stab at electronic pop is no different. I was never overly impressed with his efforts in Death Cab for Cutie, but for foot tapping melodic pop, i thought that Death Cab ranged from catchy to merely passable. The Postal Service, on the otherhand, sounds like a man just trying to do something entirely different just for the sake of doing so. His pop sensibilities adapt rather shabbily to electronica and creates a gutless form of techno-pop that seems suitable only for 13 year old school girls who are doped up on pixie-stix. This is indie music at its most tooth-achingly mainstream."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit bland, but ok if you have nothing better to listen to","review":"there's a few nice songs on here, but for my money, fans of indie electronic music should go check out the Morr Music label. bands such as Lali Puna, Ms. John Soda, Solvent, Isan, Styrofoam, etc... are making music that's 10 times more emotional & beautiful than this stuff. also you should check out Ulrich Schnauss: \\"a strangely isolated place\\". perfect shoegazer electronica to blow your little indie mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"This is a great collaboration album, driving Ben Gibbard into a more techno-pop electronic sound. Adding to the charm of this album is his erronious reference to sports in Nothing Better, discussing the goalie tending the net in the fourth quarter. In what sport is there a goalie and a fourth quarter? A must buy for Death Cab fans, and then go get the Iron and Wine cover of Such Great Heights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its like looking at the milkyway and dreaming","review":"Personally I find this album breathtaking. Fun synth pop at times (Such Great Heights), gushing strings that break your heart on other tracks (Recycled Air). The end track that's drum and bass influenced just sticks in your head for days and inspires a nonstop smile. I liken the sound to the melodies of The Cars with the synthpop sensibilities of every great 80s band, and the song lyrics that you wish you could have written at age 15 when a boy named Brian or a girl named Lula broke your heart. For anyone who's ever lost young love, this is the album to confront your sadness head on and be born a stronger and more radiant being. Bravo Postal Service, you've made a gentle and beautiful album that speaks for me and no doubt countless others."},{"rating":"2","title":"For everyone who loves music","review":"Basically, I can't live at the moment without listening to this album at least once a day. I'm not a huge fan of techno music; it has no soul. But this music, combined with the amazing vocals and lyrics, has a soul so deep you want to dive into it. Favorites: \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" and \\"Natural Anthem.\\"My friend gave me her copy of the CD with the words, \\"If you don't like this I can no longer like you.\\" Well, obviously we're still friends. I've been encouraging everyone I know to buy it. This is how music should make you feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album I've Heard in a Long Time","review":"This album is wonderfully put together. It mixes a twist of Aphex Twin's ambiance with Belle and Sebastian's poeticness. It is the best album I've heard in a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best in its Genre","review":"First, if you like Death Cab for Cutie, these guys are basically the same. I don't typically like music like this, but I think this cd is quite good. The lyrics are depressing at times, but definatley relatable. Overall, I think it's a good music for when you need relatively quiet, peaceful listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's synth newwave is back.","review":"I could not believe how good this album was every song rules. Fans of the 80's synth bands like depeche mode erasure and omd,will love this album. Has the old new wave sound mixed with modern music. This album is highly contagious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Great Album","review":"I agree with everybody that this is an extremely interesting and fun album. However, if you are looking for good lyrics, do not buy this album!! Frankly, the lyrics are not their strongpoint, and in my opinion, they ruin a couple of the songs. If you are the type of person, however, that doest not mind bad lyrics, then by all means buy this album. Extremely interesting rythems, electronic sounds, and pretty cool melodies. The District Sleeps Alone Tonight is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard. Such Great Heights, Brand New Colony, and Natural Anthem are completely awesome too."},{"rating":"2","title":"could only be better if...","review":"this album is perfect and could only be better if it included postal service's cover of \\"against all odds\\" by phil collins. its great. look for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different .","review":"I had never heard of the group when I first listerned to the cd , It is one of those cds that the more you play the more you like it/"},{"rating":"2","title":"such great heights","review":"though ive yet to purchase the cd (hard to find in my area) ive heard most all the songs and know alot about the band... i just wanted to note that Jimmy and Ben arent the only members of the postal service-- Jenny Lewis, front girl for Rilo Kiley, was invited to be a member when they needed a angelic female voice. i abosolutly love postal service and i VERY highly reccomend Rilo Kiley to all. thanku the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it stop??","review":"Another reviewer had it right... This is 80's Nintendomusic with mediocre vocals. Just ashamed. Why do peoplelike such cheese? Don't people have any taste at all??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Be Good If Only...","review":"Wow! Talk about impressive! Impressively bad vocals, that is. While the music isn't going to save the world, and it doesn't reinvent the wheel, it is still fun. And then the guy starts singing. If someone sang this badly during a high school performance, they would be booed off the stage by disgruntled family members. The vocals could not worse. The girl singer is much better, but her voice doesn't carry enough weight to make the fluffy music mean anything. Recommendations for the Postal Service - hire a real singer and you might have a career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Band In The World","review":"I can't believe that I'm NOT ALLOWED to give this zero stars.This band is garbage. The record is worse than garbage. It's septic sludge. The music is unoriginal, cloying and boring. The vocals are the most annoying sound I've ever heard. I wish the courts would gag and restrain this band.This band couldn't stop a war if they had a nuclear bomb.Boycott!"},{"rating":"1","title":"*Yawn* This is boring.","review":"This sounds like songs an 8 year old would make on one of those Casio pre-programmed keyboards. Add a few wimpy guitar lines and the \\"sensitive\\" vocals of that chubby guy from Death Cab and that's all this band is: boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent movie!!","review":"Hello there:So I heard this album when it was initially released a couple of years ago and I thought that it was ok. Certainly nothing to write home about. I noticed that a bunch of 15 year old girls really liked it, but then again, their taste was pretty questionable considering that the latest Peaches and Tori Amos records were also in heavy rotation.For a much better new release, check out the latest Cam'ron LP, \\"Purple Haze\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"bo---ring","review":"I bought this album based on the appeal of the radio single (\\"such great heights\\") but found the rest of the album to be trite AND uninteresting musically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"You have to admire Worlds Greatest Air Guitarists brutal honesty when he says \\"Thi5 band really sucks, and I'm not just saying that.

There are cringe-worthy lyrics in nearly every track. Too bad it all isn't as good as the first song."},{"rating":"2","title":"postal service","review":"postal service has a unique sound. They are nice to just sit around and chill too. They have a sound similar to emo/soothing techno. Over that past few months since i first heard them they have become one of my all time favorite bands. I would recomend them to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly different...","review":"It's hard to find something to compare this album to. The closest thing I can think of as comparison is the synth pop of the 80's, but it's not quite the same. This is a lot cleaner, more organized in its composition. It's really experimental, soothing, energetic, fun & whimsical at the same time. The lyrics have a poetic quality that didn't strike me at first, but the more I listen the more I love it. give it a listen, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFULLY ENCHANTING","review":"Hauntingly wonderful. Some beats are upbeat and some leave you so relaxed. I have been listening to Postal Service for over 2 months and they are in my six cd changer in my car. It's not at all hard to listen to, it leaves you mesmerized,and simply... I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's synth pop returns!","review":"The Postal Service combines the ambient energy of Fischerspooner (or the more palatable beats from Squarepusher) with intelligible, quirky lyrics. At times sounding like Belle and Sebastian in terms of the ennui-soaked bourgeois sentiment of lost love, regrettable folly, and unrecapturable happiness, The Postal Service delivers a fresh breath of electronica. \\"Nothing Better\\" and \\"Brand New Colony\\" stand out as keepers produced by these up-tempo synth dreamers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way you move me","review":"Arguably the best album of the millennia. Listening to it makes you cherish where you are and who you are with.This Place is a Prison (SLEEPER!!)- The first half separates from the Second bringing in an intrepid drum-beat. Many people have already experience how amazing it is to SLEEP to. Try it, you owe it to yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is nt a good compact disk","review":"sounds like detah cab for cutie rip offthey should call this group postal service - it sounds like they did this comapct disk through the mail and it was sitting in the post office when a guy whent postallamewhats it even?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite there","review":"\\"Give Up\\" had a lot of potential from the start, but fell flat after a few tracks. A couple of songs stand out (\\"Such Great Heights\\" and \\"We Will Become Silhouettes\\") and are really great tracks, but the rest of the album could easily be mistaken for some guy sitting around a studio messing with the Super Mario Brothers soundtrack.Ben Gibbard, the lead singer, has a very weak, faint voice that sometimes makes you want to cringe, especially when it's in a somber setting, but all that changes when he gets a solid beat and catchy rhythm moving. Unfortunately most of the tracks didn't provide the jolt he needed, so it's tough to get through the whole album without losing focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"holly mouse's ....ah butt","review":"my god. this cd is one of my favorites.i think its going to win the nomany of best cd. they have a great teckno rockish beat.i heard that there is only two people?! when i heard that i was like wow! i heard that one sings and the other one makes the bet on they internet! they are way way way way way way way way way way way better then green day and finger eleven even condbedi think its a great cd i mean imean a good cd!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Gave Up","review":"I picked up this CD when I read an interview with Ben Gibbard mentioning that this CD outsold all the DCFC records combined before \\"Plans\\". I thought I missed something given that I really like all the DCFC stuff before \\"Plans\\". I didn't. This is just electronica dribble and not very interesting, actually blaned would be an improvement.DCFC continues to soar and can really hit the ball out of the park on some tunes, but honestly \\"Plans\\" which set them on the path to über status is my least favorite DCFC effort. I don't like it at all and if that along with this Postal Service work is what sells then I hope Ben Gibbard falls flat on his commercial appeal, because that will be one damn record I will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont give up on the postal service","review":"listen to the 30 second bits...you'll be hooked! this is what makes me go to classes during the week! i just get in my car, pop in the postal service, and away i go! i love #1 (it's what got me hooked) and i LOVE the first 5! the others are ok, but those first 5 are great! i dont know what kind of music to fit this into (emo i guess?) but it's GREAT! i love it so much! i use the quotes all the time, its great for listing to and just undwinding!*****5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"The Postal Service's \\"Give Up\\" is truly exceptional.

That's because this music in unlike anything you've heard before.I came across this CD when a friend recommended it to me based on my interest in Death Cab for Cutie. I am thankful I have that friend.The songs are expertly crafted. The arrangements are complex but accessible. The lyrics are heartfelt and sincere. Overall it's just a damn good CD.My favorites are \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight,\\" \\"Nothing Better,\\" and \\"Recycled Air\\" (a gem of a tune, with a subject so simple, yet the song seems so deep).I would recommend this to anyone who like's good, solid, trance-like/trance-enducing music that is brimming with atmosphere, style, substance, and above all quality.You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album I've ever experienced... a must hear!","review":"Electronica with a human touch. Rhythmic beats that drive lyrical beauty. It couldn't be better! I adore good electronica and its ability to transport the listener to places they've never been before. This album combines that experience with a human voice, and not just any voice, a soulful, expressive, dynamic voice.I highly recommend listening to this album for anyone. It transcends genres and labels. I hope they release another soon..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way To Go Ben","review":"This is how art is supposed to work. The artist puts art into the community. The community reacts to this art, and the artist responds. This response is now where evolution is supposed to happen. The Postal Service is Ben Gibbard's (guitar/voice...) evolution. Along with Jenny Lewis, Jen Clark(?), and the Programmer From Dntell, this album spans genres from indie-shoe gazer-sap-pop to electro-synth-hop. Finally, something unique has come out of the indie-hipster community. And it's dancable. Also you should take note that it is over three years old. So, if you don't have it, where you been? If nothing else, this album is fun and sounds neat. So I say Way to GO Ben."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not squeezable or very small","review":"The only reason to buy this mouse is for the picture stamped on it. The \\"squeeze anywhere\\" is an outright lie.I bought this for my child because it was supposed to be smaller (for their smaller hands) and it claims \\"Squeeze my head anywhere and I will click!\\". Well, it is a bit smaller, but you can find many mice for laptop computers that are this size or smaller. The mouse I already have is the same width and only a little bit longer. I don't know where they get away with saying squeeze anywhere because this is just an ordinary mouse with regular buttons. If you don't press the buttons it won't click. You can't even press or squeeze the buttons sideways.It doesn't feel very durable either. There is a lot of play in the buttons which seems to be just waiting for a button to snap off. Especially if you squeeze sideways."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect kids mouse","review":"I am very pleased with this purchase. Installation was a snap. I downloaded the one-button driver and installed it in less than 10 minutes. I can activate/deactivate the one-button feature using an icon on my desktop. I use a front panel usb port and can unplug/plug in the unit and it does not require a restart. When the mouse is unplugged, the icon shows a red circle with a line thru it. When I plug the mouse in, it activates immediately and my adult mouse continues to work normally all of the time. Thank you KidzMouse and Amazon!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ernie Optical Mouse","review":"I still haven't been able to get the mouse to accept only clicks on one button but I am sure it is me and how I installed the software to make that happen.

The person who refers to a film as a \\"great flic\\" will be thrilled by the mysterious treasures they find within these pages.

If you were to invest in a multi tool, go with the Juice S2, its worth every penney and much more. The weight is perfect and the its small enough to put in your pocket. Take advantage of this tool, due to the fact Leatherman can no longer makes this tool, so availability is limited. The leather sheath is a nice add on as well, its small and not bulky off your belt and protects the tool.With Leatherman, you pay more, but you in return, you receive quality and craftsmanship at its finest. I'm a true Leatherman fan and I would spend that extra money any day for the quality they put on the shelfs in stores or online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy multitool","review":"The Leatherman Juice S2 is my favorite multitool for EDC use but, the design of its can opener falls well into the, barely usable, category because of its unsharpened, stamped metal design.

The sound editor doesn't seem to understand how to make words clear so in the many scenes where groups of people are gathered what they are saying is almost incomprehensible. The director has no idea how to move the movie along because there is no sense of pace. In fact, it is clunky, awkward and amateurish.Glad that I borrowed this from the library at no cost.

For two hours we spoke, told stories, tried to learn from each other. My new friends there own property, have relatives there.I'd recommend this.

Just as he did in that book, as well as Weird Ideas that Work, Bob is able to take on the issues and problems that we all deal with and rarely discuss. I had the opportunity to read an advance copy of the new book and the funny and insightful anecdotes combined with real research, make a great case for what these jerks really do cost us in time, money and stress. It is also a great reminder and warning of how easily we can all fall into the trap of becoming a \\"title character\\" from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Best Book on Empowerment in the Workplace","review":"I have never written a review on Amazon, but feel strongly about writing a review for Sutton's No A**hole book because I feel many people whose might be concerned about the \\"taboo\\" title might not look beyond it and do themselves a great disservice.As a female professional, I felt highly empowered reading this book. Dr. Sutton acknowledges the bullying and crass behavior that frequently occurs in the workplace and offers concrete ways to combat these trying individuals. I have already practiced his technique of publicly discounting bullying behavior with great success.I found his suggestions for handling office place bullies - as both a superior and subordinate actions extremely smart and well-grounded.

The accounts here are not a \\"how to\\", but a \\"why not?\\" Why not shift the dynamic so that it no longer favors butt heads? I keep it on my desk and recommend it to anyone having difficult interpersonal relationships. More import, I used it with stunning success in a prison setting to help an inmate defuse an imminently violent situation by shifting the conflict dynamic and getting other inmates to join him. The would-be perpetrator backed off and was forced to find a different way to relate this inmate in the violent and hyper-masculine setting that is prison.I'd recommend The No \\"Butt Head\\" Rule for use in any kind of confrontation training and behavior management education program you can think of. It's a powerful and empowering tool for anyone who'll take the time to explore it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exposing & Dismantling the Tyranny of the A-hole","review":"Great book!

Robert Sutton's book is an essential guide for anyone caught in the toxic grip of the soul sucking, self centered, win-at-all-costs, aggressive or passive aggressive bully whether it's at work or while waiting in line at the grocery store. This thorough and unapologetic examination of the financial, mental, cultural, and structural costs (and limited benefits) of the \\"Chronic A-hole\\" makes a compelling business argument against employing A-holes despite their high productivity, sales numbers, experience, or some other perceived value. Perhaps most importantly, it serves as a convincing call to arms, for readers to step up, reclaim their right to a enlightened work place, and dismantle the destructive powers of the Chronic A-hole wherever he or she may try to reign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring books rehashes itself in every chapter","review":"This book has about five decent points, all of which the author could have made in 2/3rds of the length. It is poorly written and feels like a series of essays that were simply strung together rather than crafted into a coherent narrative.

If he can't take the time to address us like adults, or articulate exactly what he means by 'a**hole' what's the sense in taking advice from him?..and now that he has grabbed our attention, what do we get? fluff. Another article padded into a book, which plenty of examples of unpleasant people at work but little substance how to deal with them, or the unpleasant fact that it's often effective form of management- think of the marines for example and toughening up of mama's boys.Of course with the baby boom generation it's all about me me me and my feelings.

I work with politicians during the day and perform in community theater at night.

Let's start with Amorah Quan Yin, the Kentucky-born psychic who wrote those two seminal works 'The Pleiadian Workbook: Awakening Your Divine Ka' and 'The Pleiadian Tantric Workbook: Awakening Your Divine Ba'.

In the eyes of Robert Sutton, Ph.D., it was the non-tipping customer who was the a-hole, not the obviously abusive waitress (who should have been fired on the spot, and charged with assault and battery for good measure).Aside from that world-class academic insight, life is too short to waste on books like this--a 1,000-word article would have said all that Sutton has to say on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the concept but not the book","review":"I ordered and read this with much anticipation - and there is a LOT of talking, but to be honest the free shortened version published online or in WSJ is enough.

If you expect progressive metal - OSI is not even close. I let a buddy of mine borrow this CD (a huge PHISH fan - yuck). He liked it - that should tell you plenty. A lot of Floydesque music after the first two songs.This CD has a really nice package and quite neat. However not only will the music probably bug you - the lyrics will too. Very VERY political - of course - extremely liberal. There is NO doubt these guys wanted to \\"say\\" something politcally.A real disappointment all the way around.

Great performance from everyone in the band...

Quite honesly, the first dics in this set is the American release of the original OSI album (2003). It is reminiscent of Too- Eistein, but on the BONUS disc you hear this band in heavy prog action!

Maybe I'm missing it but I don't think so. I was hopeing for more of a Liquid Tension thing and that could be my fault for going into it with a pre-conception and expectation.

The menus are also easy to read and navagate overall as well. This is a basic 7\\" 16:9 frame, nothing really fancy about it though. It is 480:234 output for the pictures, decent enough, somewhat grainy at times but average for most frames. I know you could potentially get better frame picture quality, but you will pay for it. Also, this frame does not feature MP3/MPEG technology, so you can't set the slide show to music or play short videos like some other frames, again those features do cost more, and polaroid does make their XSA-0720 that has them.

This book covers most topics in AI. It is more comprehensive than most AI book i have read. However i dislike the writing style employed in this book.

The only changes I would have made (for me, not everyone else) would be to include a few short chapters on second order logic, and the basic mathematics and math terms used in the book. It assumes more knowlege in math than I have. It would also be nice if it had a \\"recommended reading\\" page, listing those texts that would be useful for an AI beginner to review in order to understand the math and logic referred to.

They cover everything from quilts, wall hangings to table runners, stockings and Christmas tree rounds. You can mix and match the ideas here and make everything you need for Christmas.The nice parts are that the directions are complete for both hand piecing and machine (called fusible in the book) sewing & that most of the designs require small amounts (1/2 yard; 5/8 yard there) of fabric so if you have leftovers you can find places to use them here. Also nice is the ability to copy the designs for your own use. A nice present in itself.The downside? You should be near a copier and have sharp scissors.All in all, a great way to get into the Christmas spirit. It's a real joy to view and look at. I wish some of the designs were shown bigger in colour but it's a minor quibble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for Christmas - great applique reference book!","review":"If you love Christmas and love to applique, this book will definitely have something for you. With detailed, clear color photographs and patterns that have registration marks for precise applique placement, there are whimsical, cute designs with Santa and his toys and fun and funky trees, or more traditional images with poinsettias and Old St. Nick. The section on applique is invaluable, detailing the Piece O Cake way using overlays and vinyl to get accurate placement, and with tips and instructions for special techniques such as circles and reverse applique. The only issue I had with this book is that some of the patterns need to be enlarged. Know that before you get involved in a project that you just *have* to get started on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much fun!","review":"These patterns are a lot of fun!

She asked if I could order it for her. I began looking for it and low and behold I found one copy of e-bay for $375.00. I called the lady back and told her I found her a copy buy she would have to order it herself at that price. Her answer \\"Oh, I found that one. I'm looking for somebody who has one and doesn't know the value of the book. Maybe I can talk them into selling it to me, maybe for 10 or 20 dollars.I didn't call her a bad name but I wish she could have read my mind.I'm glad I bought the book for a keep sake but I don't think I will piece anything in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A third or second book the subject","review":"Generally I would agree with the reviewer who titled his review \\"Mindstorms meets NN; same strengths and weaknesses\\".This is a decent book that provides some interesting insights into the subject matter. There are some very nice intuitive ideas that gives meaning to some of the math. Unfortunately, other parts of the text lack this intuition and seem like a presentation of network structure and algorithms more than a presentation of the ideas behind them.I started my research in this area with a software engineering and management background with some intermediate signal processing experience on top. I also read Duda and Hart's Pattern Recognition book along with months of literature review on the subject before tackling this one. I must say that I am still confused on many points.This is not an introductory text and will most certainly require the reader to seek out other references to fill in its gaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you hooked yet?","review":"Ron Moore's Battlestar Galactica still delivers the goods.After a nailbiting cliffhanger that leaves the life of Galactica's Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos) and the future of the fleet in peril, things are just starting to heat up.The stories get better and darker as the crew on Galactica struggles to deal with the startling revelations from season 1 that threaten to tear the fleet apart. The 2nd season cliffhanger is an awesome nod to the original show and serves as either a ray of hope for the rag-tag colonial fleet, or a dark, troubling storm on it's horizon.Sci-fi television has been pretty lame... until now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing ripoff","review":"I love this program and I bought the first season on dvd and it is a welcome addition to my SF collection. I did not expect it to be as good as it is due to the fact that the original was so cheesy.Having said all the above I find I am extremely annoyed by the fact they are releasing the second season in two sets. Man, talk about milking the same cow twice!The only way that Fans of the show can combat this corporate greed and show them we are aware of the contempt they apparently have for us is to refuse to buy into this sort of scam.I really wish I could give this no stars at all. The show is great, but I can't say the same for Universal Studios."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Ballestar","review":"Battlestar Galactica was a perfect series, and season two just exemplifies how great the story line progression is.

Its one of my favorite series, along with 24, Lost, and soon to end Alias. I'll surely grab the new sets for this series going forward. Its getting quite some bashing because it is releasing half a season worth. But I think its okay, as this gives some of those who would like to get the series now, an option to watch it now. And I think its great. Of coure, the true test is if and when they release a complete season 2 for a good price. If they do, then please, do this all the time, as it gives us all an option to get it sooner than later or wait for a complete set. If they don't, then I'll join in on the bashing ; )For now, this gets a 5 star based on the quality of the series. How gorgeous this series is, esp. if you have a good widescreen TV!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent content, but what a rip-off!","review":"The series easily deserves 5 stars, and I have nothing to add to what has already been said in the detailed reviews.

All the characters have true grit to survive even if some characters are a bit shadey. Sci-Fi has done a great job with this program and I'm a big fan. The special effects are brilliant for a series and even though you may tire of hearing frak every five minutes, you'll still feel satisfied with the viewing experience after each episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Drama Not on HBO","review":"I am not a big fan of the sci-fi genre and shows with weird aliens and inter-galatic wars turn me off big time. However Battlestar is far from a typical sci-fi show, it's more of a deep and dark tale about human survival and politics than anything else. The acting and writing is top notch and each episode there is a feeling of impending doom which is uncommon in today's tv landscape of neatly tied up procedural crime shows. This is show easily tops anything the networks have to offer and is the best show period that's not named the Wire, Deadwood or the Sopranos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlestar Galactica is the best sci-fi drama on television!","review":"I think that Battlestar Galactica seasons one, two and now three (currentlyairing Jan '07) is the most interesting and well filmed sci-fi dramas ontelevision right now.

I was not amused to receive only half the series with no prior warning at all. Some reviewers have commented we should have guessed since TV was only half way through airing. However it is still false marketing to call it series 2, and as I mentioned, in the UK we are often behind the US in terms of airing shows.

I was one of those '80's diehard fan of the original show, but this new version is beyond my expectations. I don't watch much television, but I cannot miss a single episode.Regarding the DVD, it's a great opportunity to get into the show if you haven't been watching it regularly. The only reason that I didn't rate it 5 stars is that it isn't complete. You have to buy the second half of Season 2 that just came out to complete the season. (Battlestar Galactica Season 2.5). You will love this show, even my teenage son is watching the show with me faithfully. It's worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait!!!","review":"I live in the UK.

The production values (fx, costume etc) all makes sense to me - who needs all that shiny star trek stuff!

Stargate SG-1 is about 50, Quantum Leap averages 30-40, Stargate Atlantis is going for 45 dollars. Even the greatest season of television ever, X-files Season 4, started at 100 but has come down in price to a more reasonable 57 dollars along with the rest of the series.

It's a little difficult when they release season 1 and half of season 2.In season 2 vol 1 we get into the characters more and learn more about the society that had been the 12 colonies of Kobol. Some memorable moments are:- Cheif Tyrol decides he's tired of losing Vipers one at a time and designs and constructs a new model.- Col. Tigh tries to take over after Adama is shot, but his personality flaws make matters much worse.- The Boomer Swapperoo: Cali gets a Cylon kill (not bad for a deck mechanic).- \\"Kobol-henge\\"This is Sci-Fi TV at it's best. The stories are tense, serious, and funny (in spots) and I definitely will be buying any season they care to put out.

So I really don't relate this show to the original. I have watched and enjoyed them both. I like the stories in the new series, they are suspenseful and captivating, but I do have one gripe. I would like to see more action sequences, particularly in space. Case in point, one space battle in one episode was not even shown, but rather showed BSG crewmembers listening to the battle via radio transmission.....I know it may be cheaper this way but c'mon. That could have been a good episode...."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE BSG - hate the technology","review":"I'd love to post a review of whatever it is that Ron feels like telling us.

NO!

My review, therefore, is not of the series itself, but of this awful boxed set. In an act of sheer profiteering Universal decided to break Season 2 into twain, offering half the season in one set and other in second. The upshot for consumers is that we have to pay close to $80 to acquire the full season 2 - far above the average price for a single season set, even for imported series like Doctor Who and Torchwood. I would advise any fan of the show to borrow this season from a friend or rent it, until Universal comes to sanity and issues a reasonably priced single boxed set."},{"rating":"2","title":"it really is the best show i've ever seen","review":"as a good friend of mine recently said, 'it's like watching a movie every week.' truer words never spoken.you don't need me to discuss the merits of the show. about 500 people have already aptly done so. but i will just say it's actually a *pleasure* to watch this show. i feel like i want to give ron moore and his team a big, fat hug. they don't condescend to their audience. they never rest on their laurels. they reward the loyal viewers. and they never, never, never insult our intelligence. and yes, the production values are incredible. and yes yes, the CGI is better than anything you've ever seen on the silver screen (kind of makes you wish he'd been in charge of the star wars prequels).thanks, gang, for a truly terrific show. i feel privileged to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this!","review":"If you're buying this, or interested in it at all, it means you've probably already bought the First Season, so there's not much to say.

It's also fine that some of us aren't happy with that. Some of us would prefer something more affordable, complete, and closer to what Moore said it would be.The \\"Captain\\" would have you believe that there's no problem with Universal trying to milk the fans of their hard earned cash. I don't agree. I'd prefer to be able to purchase complete seasons with what Moore said would be on them. I also don't agree with the claims that by not buying this we are killing the series so we should just buy it and shut up.

One big black mark for the Amazon reviewer, who refused to take the studio to task for this rip-off. I can't call it anything else. We all wait for the series to be released one year at a time. What's next...one episode at a time?I do not intend buying this until the year is together, and I encourage all readers to do likewise. Delay your gratification until the entire year is released.

This is nothing but a pathetic cash grab by whoever is in charge of releasing the DVD's.

It's a rip off and an insult to the fans. I really love the new Battlestar Galactica, but if the SciFi Channel doesn't go back to the regular full season DVD format at a reasonable price I will NEVER buy another Battlestar Galactica DVD.Shame on the SciFi Channel and anyone involved with releasing HALF a season on DVD like this!!! Do NOT buy this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This show transcends genre","review":"This is not really a sci-fi show. It's really a character driven drama that explores ethical and moral issues ranging from religion to democracy. It's not preachy and it truely doesn't argue for a liberal or conservative viewpoint. To give you an example, every person in my family from my ex-Marine Born again Christian cousin to my new-age liberal sister loves this show.Beyond the great scripts, the acting on BSG is the best on television today. I promise you this. Edward James Almos and Mary McDonnell give consistently outstanding lead performances but they are not alone. Katee Sackoff, Starbuck, is a wonder and Jamie Bamber's American accent is so good that you'll never even remember that he's British.I agree with other reviewers who called this show addictive.

In case you have read info on this disc set elsewhere saying otherwise: there is NO longer version of the final episode \\"Pegasus\\", there are NO Podcasts for the final 2 episodes and one other (so 7 podcasts for 10 episodes). Not much in the way of extras either as per Season 1 though over an hour of deleted scenes, though again NONE from the final episode. Sooo, yes this was very much rushed out of the door in time for the holidays in what one might consider an incomplete form. The big question now is: will we be forced to repurchase all of these episodes to get the remainder of the season or will we be able to just buy the second half? And I think it's mean spirited to have a coupon for $10 off the Serentiy DVD or $5 off the Seaquest DVD but NO coupon for the rest of Season 2. They are SO taking monetary advantage of their core fanbase. Supergreat show, lame-o boxset."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome sci-fi tv show","review":"Very good storyline as the visual effects.

It's amazing that the quality has been maintained. And it's good to have a strong storyline where several elements are unpredictable.

Are they spending so much money on this show that they have to con the fans into forking over money top pay for the second season themselves?This isn't the first time they'd done this either. When season 1 came out, it was released as a \\"UK version\\" and sold exclusively to Best Buy. Fans forked over their $50 for this, but 2 months later the American version was released for a LESS than $50.So now they expect fans to buy this half season, then 9 months later, buy the entire season as a whole?I'd think even fans of this show should would be outraged by the greedy studio's cleaver little ploys at having fans pay twice.Don't be duped, folks.

But unfortunately, half way through i thought, why bother? The only good thing about this book was that Haydon has managed to create her characters well enough that they managed to annoy the hell out of me. I just couldn't stand them, especially Rhapsody, she has to be the most irratating character i have ever meet. (And i've read some pretty appaling fantasy books)But that wasn't the only problem, the story was predictable and not particularly original, and although i read the trilogy, by the end of the first book, you knew what was going to happen. Although i quite liked her writing style, i found the application of it on this particualar plot line characters very poor.I would not recommend you buy this particular book, it makes you cringe, it lacks depth and charaisma, with the maion character being the most pathetic and throughly stupid heroine i have ever read about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Characters. Could Not Get Past First Chapter","review":"For some reason, Amazon links the author Robin Hobb (of \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\") with Elizabeth Haydon. Intrigued, I decided to check out \\"Rhapsody : Child of Blood\\".Unfortunately, after the first chapter of the book, I was groaning in disgust. There is no depth of character, nor do there seem to be any plausible situations. In the first few pages, the main character is transported in time. Somehow, he just accepts this. It is as if the author does not care to go into detail.The hero then meets a breathtakingly beautiful, innocent and perfect girl. He realizes that this is his soulmate. They immediately fall in love. They have sex. (They are 14.) They become separated. End chapter one. It's that simple.I presume that the rest of the story details their struggles to find each other again.

This means generally poorly conceived and much of the characterization and actions are re-tellings of decades-old tales.Main character is a joke. Starts as an prostitute who has somehow become an amazing singing mage, but then later she becomes so beautiful that people are stunned by her. Also, at this time she starts acting wide-eyed and ignorant for some reason.Her side-kicks are equally stupid and un-explained. Divine powers in combat, such as slaying enemies from miles away with odd projectile weapons or gracefully wiping out everyone in hand-to-hand combat without breaking a sweat.So if you read and enjoy most modern fantasy novels this equally trashy book might be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Antifeminist Tripe","review":"I thought this was going to be a good book.

The main character, Rhapsody, is so beautiful & perfect that every man wants her, though she, of course, doesn't realize it--or if she does, she sweetly charms him into losing desire. Moreover, the pandering to male sexual fantasy is disgusting: Rhapsody is beautiful, blonde, skinny, and rather unintelligent (instinctual kowledge is acceptable). Moreover--and here's the kicker--she's an experienced prostitute who manages to become revirginated. What an antifeminst fantasy.

The male characters in this book are some of the best I've ever seen, male or female author. Achmed has to be the greatest anti hero, an unabashedly obnoxious assassin whose better side is there, but not miraclously transformed.

Enjoyable","review":"I found myself wanting to know more and more as I read. The series is purely entertaining and magical. Character development is superb. For fantasy lovers, I highly recommend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good fantasy","review":"I've read my share of fantasy novels, I love them. And this one was even a tad bit better than most. There were many things about this book that struck me as very unique, and interesting. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"I was struck at the way Elizabeth Haydon pulled off the journey on the root. Although the time jump made me pause and scratch my head, the willing suspension of disbelief was not long in coming. I disliked Meridion and the whole concept, since that seemed to me to be an add-on and a distraction, but the book was really great. I read the whole series and must admit that the first one is my favorite. Rhapsody got a little whiny toward the end of the series and things dragged a little, but I would certainly pick them up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I'm not normally a reader of fantasies, but something about this book made me pick it up and take it home. What a fortunate circumstance! I think Haydon is a brilliant writer with a wonderful imagination, and her characters are marvelous. She could have spent a little less time in the tree root, but that's my only quibble, and perhaps not a valid one, because that part of the book firmly establishes the relationship between three of the major characters. The sequel is even better, and I can't wait for the third installment! If you like outstanding writing, you won't regret buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhapsody","review":"Rhapsody is one of the best books I have ever read. Elizabeth Hayden does a wonderful job of developing the characters' personalities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Romantic Drivel","review":"I found this book tedious and annoying. It was like reading a romance novel put into the Sci-fi fantasy format. A-la Mills & Boone.Some of the adventures were fun, but overall the book just went on, and on, and on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I did not know what to expect when I picked up this book, but wow what a great story. Unlike many fantacy novals there isen't a big fight that everything is leading up to, it is just an amazing story. Their isen't anything gripping about this book, yet I could not put it down. Also a warning to any who feel the need for 'closer' at the end of a book, you are not going to get it here. The book just ends and leaves you wanting more. I sugest buying Prophecy along with Rhapsody, as it imeadatly picks up the thread of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"Child of Blood starts up quite well. I found the Prologue and the first chapter very interesting. The rest of the book though drags on and on, narrating the endless travel of the protagonists through the root and drowning the important bits in sea of irrelevant descriptions. Rhapsody, the title character, becomes very inconsistent. While her change from an innocent young girl into the scarred, tough and resilient prostitute/Singer/Namer is realistic and believable, her later backslide into a sweet and fairly helpless, blushing perfection is rather hard to swallow. Her companions are a bit better, especially Grunthnor, but I lost interest in them fairly quickly. Dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fantasy!","review":"I really loved this book. I bought it to get some variety in my reading. I seem to read the same handful of authors over and over. This was a great purchase! Elizabeth Haydon will definately be added to my list of favorite authors. From the moment I started reading, I couldn't put it down. She also managed some twists I wasn't expecting. As soon as I finished this one, I picked up the sequel, and it is just as good. I definately recomend it to anyone who is a fan of fantasy or romance novels. This is definately a fantasy novel, but she throws in just enough romance for the truely girly side of me. A reall great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"I gave this book a try... I really did.But, and others have written better than I, it pretty much sucked.I am not going to go on and on as to why.I just found it boring and silly.It didn't grab me.It didn't excite me.There are authors out there that are amazingly good at worldbuilding.They do not need to resort to some authority-figure character spending pages and pages telling the history of the society to the protagonist and the reader. More than once.I just finished Jacqueline Carey's Kushiel series for the second time and was looking for something new and as good --- but this was not it. Not even close. And I am still looking....."},{"rating":"1","title":"fantasy for romance readers","review":"This book is a sort of experiment when several characters and concepts which belong more to the realm of romance novels are introduced into fantasy-like world. Among the things thus transferred there are too many stereotypes for my liking and not even a shade of humor to make them beleivable. The strongest example is Rhapsody herself, who is too full of sachharine to inspire any kind of compassion. While there are several creative ideas in the world design (I liked the tree concept), the totally volumeless characters kill the awe quite effectively. Also the \\"film-editing\\" approach felt artificial to no end. The bottom line is - if you hate romance novels, you'll hate this too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definite Love-Hate Relationship","review":"This one really was a difficult one to decide on. On the one hand, the many details in the plot are creative and do get your attention and interest. On the other hand, a lot of them go nowhere. Over and over again I'd find myself waiting for some explanation of some intriguing beginning -- only to find myself going down some other path altogether.I guess if you don't care much about continuity it's a fun ride, but I found it just too frustrating. Still, by the end of the book I was kind of wishing for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another one for Professor Rhodes","review":"Great book, inspirational, funny, well-written, with strong use of language and obvious scholarship applied to the mythos. Beautifully printed. Great cover art--very sophisticated. Excellent plot, the threads of which are actually tied together with great subtlty.Drawbacks of the book: somewhat small type, at least to those of us with bad eyes, though the science fiction book club version is bigger. I don't like the weird curvy letters at the beginning of chapters, and there could have been more space between the chapters.On balance, a thouroughly wonderful read, and a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's going into my Library of all around good read","review":"This is the sort of book I have been waiting for a long time. To Elizabeth Haydon you have written a brillant book that for once knows how to write comedy and actually make the reader laught out loud.The characters are beautifully made with both the good and the bad sides equally balanced showing the emotions as they are usually felt. The fact she wrote both sexes and didn't make either of them look like imbociles is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my weekend","review":"I started off really liking this book because I thought it had interesting ideas. However, the book soon turned into a huge historical lecture with too many similar sounding names and events that I started to get confused and to not care. The worst of it for me is Rhapsody. I found the fact that Rhapsody became a perfect woman who lost her previous \\"soiled\\" state and who transformed into a beauty that causes all men to become blithering idiots totally degrading to women. By making Rhapsody unaware of her beauty and the power her beauty has over men, the author appeared to try to cover up how ridiculous all of this is. I'm just very tired of reading books that portrays all heroines to be skinny and beautiful. What is wrong with an imperfect woman, both in the physical and mental sense, that saves the day? I felt disappointed and angry that I wasted a good part of my weekend reading this horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saturday Morning Cartoon Heroes","review":"Childish dialogue and plot like a comic book. Writing isn't bad, though. I am very happy that I got this from the library and didn't buy it. Other critical reviewers have covered the flaws well, be sure to read them before wasting your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why fantasy shelves aren't worth perusing for adults","review":"Characters straight out of Saturday morning cartoons.Stories that make no sense.Written for the junior high school set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!","review":"I bought this book sight-unseen after reading glowing praise from many sources, including this website. Don't make the same mistake. This is purely amatuerish writing - worse, the author seems to thinks that more text equals a better book.While the characters and some of the concepts in the story are interesting, they are very poorly developed and sometimes the characters seem to change personality just to fit the authors current needs. The plot is downright terrible. I'm an avid fantasy reader and I'm willing to accept the fantastic, but some of the thing that the reader is asked to accept in this book are too much for me.I've been struggling with this book for a month now because I feel the need to finish books that I start, but I don't know if I can make it through the last 60 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it is written on","review":"Wher can I start? This is a story that could have been great. The plot and the book, if written by an experienced writter, could have made you awestruck. However, Haydon makes you wonder if the publishers even read the book before it was printed.So many loose ends, so many plots within plots, made my head spin. If you are one of the few lucky patient ones, you will get a little bit of surprise at the end of this first volume. But it is a surprise that is just not probable. I am not going to spoil the book for those who still want to read it so I should stop right here. A word of warning, I know that there are not many good fantasies being published lately, but you can wait a bit longer and spend your money on better things for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read this book","review":"I get the feeling that the people who gave this book five stars are of the female sex. I had never read a fantasy author that was a women before and thought I would give it a try. To my disbelief, I found myself reading about a girl power charle's angel wanta be, who adopted every child that she looked upon. This showed me that a women does not know how to write for the male mind and therefore I resorted to picking up my father's old Robert E. Howard's Conan books. There is just something about decapitating a band of warriors, then throwing a naked girl over your shoulder, then retreating to your sleeping mat for the night that dispells any of the girl power, romance crap Haydon wrote about. So in conclusion THANK YOU to all who gave this book five stars, thanks to you I wasted $8.49."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! Stinks Bad!","review":"After reading the reviews here, I thought it would be the greatest fantasy novel ever, and that I wouldn't put it down. Boy was I wrong! it was quit easy to put it down...in fact I nodded off and it fell down. Astonishingly poor character and story development. Previous critical reviewers covered the flaws well, read them I won't repeat them here."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"it was awesome! The only thing i didn't like was it ended short. Well thats why theres a sequal. Don't listen to some of the people who gave it a bad review. Their arguments aren't true or just stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is the best book (and trilogy) I've read since Robin Hobbs' Liveship Traders trilogy. It's exciting, well-written, and has great characters who are fully fleshed out. Rhapsody is pretty amazing, but I pretty much fell in love with Gunthor, tusks and all. My only quibble is the prologue. I understand it's purpose, but the flowery romance writing lets down the rest of the book. So don't let it sidetrack you - it's absent from the rest of the book, which is a cracker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was amazed by the poor quality of this novel","review":"The summary sounded good. The cover was generic, but not terrible. It had good cover quotes. So I picked up Rhapsody. I even fought my way through the sequels. I hated them. Rhapsody was quite possibly the most obnoxious character I have ever encountered. She's flat, far too perfect to be even slightly believable. She is, to use an internet term, a Mary Sue, a perfect and annoying female protagonist. Look up the original fiction Mary Sue test on google. You'll see what I mean. Even without being able to answer the questions about author intent, Rhapsody tests off the charts.I liked exactly one line of Achmed's at the end of Destiny. That was the sum total of the enjoyment I gained in over a thousand pages of reading. I'm aware that this is a diatribe. I rarely dislike books. I simply happen to hate flat characters. And Rhapsody wasn't just flat, she was linear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading","review":"She created a wonderful world of fantasy. The charaters were great, her description of them were great. The only thing I did not like was the sexual parts of the dialog and the love making scenes. But other than that it was an over, good, fun, and exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent series start--but sloooooow moving","review":"Acceptable first effort by the author with potentially interesting characters; however, they are a bit too cartoonlike and one-dimensional to be believed (the good guys are completely good, the bad guys are thoroughly awful). Well plotted story line, but it takes far too many repetitious sequences to get the action advanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Fantasy is more like it..","review":"Quite frankly I got extremely tired of reading about how beautiful Rhapsody was but how it escapes her notice. The woman was a former cortesan but isn't aware of the effect that she has on men? I've read books where I haven't liked characters but ended up loving the book. That's not the case with Rhapsody. Everything seems to come too easily to her, so she gains nothing as a character. There are no struggles for you to relate to, no lessons that can be shared. Her perfection is irksome as well as boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are worse books...","review":"But this one is not worth reading, in my opinion. I'm with the other reviewers who found this book aimless and dull. Characters litter the scenes and you're left wondering \\"why?\\", \\"who?\\", \\"what are they doing?\\".Dialogue and inter-character interactions are hopelessly contrived and stilted. Characters' emotions are handled clumsily and baldly, tears rolling down cheeks, winking, grins, lots of shuddering, etc.Since it's apparently OK to comment on other reviewers on this forum, I'm no fool with \\"reading comprehension\\" problems, this book is just old-fashioned junk reading. Regarding the flood of 5-star reviews, it's not hard to get 4-5 star ratings in the fantasy area, shoot, apparently every fantasy novel was the greatest book ever according to numerous reviewers. I'm warning you to avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version not worth the money","review":"Don't bother buying the kindle version of this book, I don't think an editor even glanced at it and the typos, errors, mistypes, punctuation, and other mistakes made some sections simply unreadable. Due to the very poor job done on the first book, I'm taking a pass on the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLAT AND BORING","review":"I read the first fourty pages but this novel just didn't work for me.The hero was time warped by some type of deity just before the fall of a previous civilization. So we then spend too much time as this character meets a potential love interest. To add to it, the meeting is flat, prosaic and predictable. Lastly, the mentalities are little too contemporary to fit into the equivalent of a medieval, agrarian culture without a special explanation.My feeling is that this story would have prompted me to read more if there was more detail of the old civilization, other conflicts which could add some texture, less predictability andmore Historical details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I like this book","review":"Honestly, I've never heard of this book although, it had rave reviews from Amazon, Borders, and all other bookstores. I grabbed a copy because Amazon readers gave it such great ratings.I do like this book, mainly, because upon reading the overture, I wanted to find out whether there will be a happy ending. All of us are familiar with Shakespeare's stories and how they mostly end up tragic. Elizabeth Haydon wrote the characters and their feelings so well, that I do not want them to have a tragic ending! With Valentines Day looming, Emily and Gwydion deserve that. I have not read Prophecy and Destiny yet. Beyond that, the plot itself is excellent - How the characters travelled through time (the means itself is unique) and how GOOD must prevail against EVIL."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever","review":"rhapsody is one of the most enchanting books ive ever read. immediately in the beginning haydon hooks you into the book with an enchanting love story turned tragedy and after that its adventure after adventure exploring rhapsody's emotions and growing love for achmed and grunthor her two kidnappers/savers.

I can't wait to read the sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhapsody: Child Of Blood","review":"I'm 13 and REALLY enjoyed this book..... my mom yelled at me at 1:00 in the morning to stop reading it! This is absolutly the best fantasy/adventure book I have read! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read and has A LOT of time on thier hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful New Novel","review":"I love this novel and am waiting for the sequels anxiously. I think the characters were great and I enjoyed the comic relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhapsody - a beginning","review":"I found the book to be exciting and plodding in places. The story line takes off after a confusing beginning. There are sections of information being discovered by the characters that doesn't seem to have anything to do with the story; then you get through 600+ pages and find out there is more to be told. This actually added to the story as it began to create a more interesting story. The seemingly unrelated pieces are now tied to the future stories and lend an aura of anticipation to the next volume. The bad news is the next volume is not out yet. I am awaiting the next installment to see where these characters will go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"This book has gotten so many good reviews that I hesitated to get it. I have been burned by books that many people are enthusiastic about. This time they are right, however. Rhapsody has great writing, a fascinating plot and wonderful characters. It's a terrific read, whether or not you are a fantasy reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Ugly Review","review":"This is my first review here on Amazon and I'm here because I feel compelled to prevent others from wasting their time with this flabby, long-winded stack of paper. This book is all over the place, it goes from shabby romance, to stale sword-n-sorcery passages through just plain baffling passages such as the endless tromping through the underworld for who knows what reason. And you wouldn't believe the stuff that passes for dialogue. Ridiculous. Go elsewhere for your reading pleasure. Or you can have my copy, it's clogging the toilet at the St Louis airport."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in many years","review":"I am not a reader of epic fantasy any more, having been disappointed with the current crop of offerings which all seem to be variations on the same theme. I was given this book by a colleague who urged me to put aside my ambivalence and give it a try. This is the first 5 star rating I've ever given a book, and will probably be the last for some time to come.As authors go, Elizabeth Haydon is one of the most accomplished I've ever read. She has a true gift for subtlety and humor; her characters talk like individuals and do not all sound the same. Rather than resorting to the cheap techniques many fantasy writers use, like cliff hanger chapter endings and a constant state of emergency to build action, she understands the stops and starts of storytelling. This is an amazing book, and one of the best in any genre out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and entertaining","review":"Like so many things in life, \\"Rhapsody\\" falls somewhere between the earth-shattering revolutionary and ordinary failure that so many seem to be trying to place it. However, although it may not change the genre, it is certainly worthwhile and a wonderful read.If Haydon improves over time, as she well should, we can look forward to wonderful books for years to come. \\"Rhapsody\\" is a terrific first effort by this writer, but you must stick with it to really appreciate it. At first you'll be confused as to what is even going on, then you hit a section that, frankly, drags on a bit too long, but then the story truly comes alive. You'll get to know exciting characters an intriguing world and a good diversion from the boredom of everyday life."},{"rating":"1","title":"High fantasy!?!","review":"I don't know how this can be billed as high fantasy or be compared with Tolkien. It's poorly and inconsistently written. There are some very strange swings in the character's motivations and personalities and the story wavers between attempts at high myth and scenes that are ridiculous and embarassing. Example: At one point the main character uses her magical abilities to make the astounding discovery that a particular artifact is a toilet. The further I got into the book, the more I stopped caring about the characters. Frequently, the dialog made me wince.Throughout, the book lacks the sort of ethical and aesthetic vision necessary to high fantasy, although the author occasionally does a good job evoking the grandeur of a fallen past.This is pulp fantasy. There are some interesting ideas and scenes here, and the author has some talent--but she lacks the judgment to use it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A classic with a twist. Definitely better than Jordan's books(too confusing). Well developed characters. Enough background info for reader's imagination. Two things I don't like about Rhapsody this character are : why after Jo's adoption she(rhapsody) kept threatening her two other companions with her separation? Also, it appears that sometimes she seems to have air between her ears (might it be because when she's near the children she is incapable of thinking?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"An blindingly bad book.","review":"While derivative post-Tolkien fantasy continues to predominate in the marketplace, it is heartening to see someone who has done away with Tolkien altogether and derives only from Ray Feist, Anne McCaffrey, R. A. Salvatore, and Robert Jordan. Unintentionally funny in its badness, the only fantasy work I have read that made me laugh this much was The Eye of Argon. I was utterly finished by the \\"proud, insolent thrusting\\" of the Bad Guy's one-eyed obelisk (who *did* he get for design-build??), and the author's willingess to wallow in multigenre cliches means that this will set a new standard for swill.Apparently it is not possible to award zero or negative stars here, but this book merits a thumping minus-ten. With this book, Tor insults the intelligence of its readers, and raises questions about the role of the publisher in shaping the field and public perception of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even read the book it was so bad","review":"I attempted to read this book due to the fact that it seemed from the cover that it might be interesting. Unfortunately, it wasn't. In fact it was so boring, so poorly written it failed to capture me past the first few chapters. Usually I give an author some time to build it up, but the writing in this story was so poorly thought out that I gave up in disgust and went to read something better. I've seen reviews for her books after this, touting how wonderful she is now and how great her talent is built up and frankly, I find it almost hard to believe. This book isn't worth full price. If you must try it out, go to the public library to see if you'd be interested in it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"RHAPSODY by Elizabeth Haydon is a treat for the eyes. Besides the beautiful art, there is a real sense of language and of plot. It is a unique book filled with magic. It is not a candy-read, it takes some attention, but it is humorous and witty and extraordinarily well written. I recommend this to everyone I know. I'm now a dyed-in-the-butternut-hull wool Elizabeth Haydon fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare find","review":"RHAPSODY by Elizabeth Haydon is funny, sad, warm, bitterly cold. It has scenes depicting great ingenuity, and scenes depicting great stupidity. There is tender romance, hot sex, creepy manipulation, and the sadness of age disparity among lovers. There is an amazing battle scene where the protagonists wipe out their enemies; there is a crushing scene where the protagonists are themselves wiped out. When you read this you feel haunted, tickled, pained, inspired, claustrophobic, frightened, amused, hopeful, creeped out, rejunventated. How many other fantasy books contain all these emotions? How many other writers paint with all these colors?Answer: None.Conclusion: BUY THIS BOOK! You will be missing out on greatness if you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"It is a wonderful thing to get to see a book at early stage, then see it come out in all its glory. Months ago I saw a tattered advance copy of RHAPSODY that had obviously been passed from hand to hand. When I finally got my own hands on it I could not put it down. Elizabeth Haydon has the ability to paint pictures with words, to compose music and transmit it through the eyes. Reading this book is similar to listening to a symphony building to a crashing crescendo. It does not throw in pages of hack-and-slash gore to keep the plot going. The plot moves nicely on its own. Now seeing it in beautiful packaging is even more impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone is terrible","review":"If you want to spend all day trying to figure out the manual, you have come to the right system.

They sent me another one and didn't even want the defective one back! The second unit was no better than the first - it won't hang up when a caller doesn't leave a message and the resulting very loud beeping tone drives everyone insane. The phone doesn't distinguish between messages on different lines. The sound quality is so muddy that people are constantly asking me to repeat myself. Setup is unnecessarily difficult.

Our LORD Jesus Christ put it plainly, \\"What profit is it to gain the whole world but lose your soul.\\" Regardless, of any contrary opinions, I will be watching developments very closely and keeping my eye on who I now believe is the Antichrist.

I was sure it was the pressure sensor that was the problem. Sure enough, the spring sensor was stuck. In an attempt to free it up, I broke off the rather fragile, brass micro-switch post.

Bacon fortunately doesn't overdo it -- more like dicaprio in gilbert grape than the irritating hoffman in rainman.

Miles was releasing some of his most intense music ever during this time, partly the result of a Sly & the Family Stone obession and partly due to an intense cocaine addiction. This album features a couple of tracks from the controversial \\"On the Corner\\" album (Honky Tonk & Rated X) and has some moments that could be described as less-than-stellar, but the dirge for Ellington \\"He Loved Him Madly\\" is worth the price of admission alone.

By contrast, Season 3 is an assortment of low points punctuated by the occasional great scene or episode.I have to agree with other reviewers who have noted that the drama throughout Season 3 felt contrived and overwrought. The biggest issue in my opinion is that I couldn't confidently say of the writers, \\"And they have a plan.\\" Conflicts between characters are drawn out seemingly to fill time; the Cylons transform from frightening to nonsensical; compelling questions from earlier seasons are answered badly while uninteresting - or downright annoying - twists are introduced.There are some very entertaining high points in BSG Season 3... but they don't begin to make up for all the lows."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the continuing voyages...","review":"The best sci-fi show since the X-Files!

This season is almost all about character development and does much to deepen our understanding of the emotional baggage that some of the main characters are lugging around that influence and explain many of their decisions. However, this process necessarily involves a slowing of the dramatic pace and story progression. This season is back-fill, not new ground.

In its second season it became a political drama. In its third season it became a soap opera with cheating spouses, a ménage à trois, emoting Cylons, sex scenes and many shots of nearly nude hunks, dream sequences, imaginary lovers, etc. I assume that the producers and writers decided to abandon the original fans (mostly males who liked action stories) and appeal to soap opera-loving females.Of note is that the genre changes of Battlestar Galactica failed. Viewership declined throughout the second season and declined more rapidly during the third season. The show's Nielson ratings averaged 2.3 in season 1, 1.9 in season 2, and 1.4 in season 3.If you were a fan of the first two seasons of Battlestar Galactica, I recommend that you rent DVD 1 of season three to see if it appeals to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"BSG Season 3 - excellent!","review":"The series continues to confront current issues and entertain at the same time.

I pre-ordered the item about a month before it was released, and it never arrived once it was shipped. Amazon did fix the solution immediately, though, by sending a new copy within hours of my informing customer service of the item's non-arrival.My problem could have been a one-time occurrence or a problem with the local post office, but several of my friends using Super Saver Shipping have noticed delays and non-arrivals, too.

We loved it when the producers brought in the 2nd Battlestar, but hated the fighting between the commanders. They should bring back a 2nd Battlestar and this time, have them work together to save the fleet. If these writers' would focus more on this instead, they could really bring the show back. As it is, it seems like it is going to tank if the writers do not stop doing all the useless sex and more on a real story. Developing the stealth craft was great, it gave them an edge on the cylons. We stopped watching the show for these reasons, it is getting boring! Sorry. Wonderful job, however, on the graphics. Beautiful photography.

BSG season 2 and 2.5 were equally gripping and held high some cinematic excellence. Season 3 was a tremendous disappointment and letdown. My wife will no longer watch.

It is not your common scifi series with the low budget acting. Edward James Olmos is always steady and composed, delivering these completely perfect performances, and the performance of the ensemble that comprises the crew is tremendously understated, and each character seems perfectly cast.

I was enjoying myself so much that I had completed three chapters without even realizing that I had went that far in the book. The illustrations are way too cute. Even an adult such as myself can appreciate them. They give the book more of a fairytale theme, which is less intimidating to some, when learning a new language.

Add to it errors on 2-3 pages where mini test included words that were nowhere on the list.The only useful long-term venue of using this book that I can think of is to take it as a starting point of building associations/connections with foreign words.

My mother called to tell me what was in the basket and how late it was received. She told me that she felt bad, but wanted me to know considering what was paid. The items were tasty though, according to her. The items seemed shorted as to what was pictured.

Impossible to find any specific references unless willing to read the entire book , which will quickly bore you. I bought it for reference material for British movies and found it to be worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book written in a weekend while pissed","review":"This was one of the biggest disappointments in my reading life. I love British TV and humour, so have gone all out on books about social history and culture. This was so poorly written that some of the definitions appear to have been pulled out of a hat (I am referring mostly to the US equivalents). Some slang words and phrases gave an example; most did not (oddly, there were a few that seemed to merit half a page). The examples were very poor. Here is one of the worst: \\"Toad in the Hole; pork sausages covered in batter. U.S. equivalent: Toad the Wet Sprocket.\\" WAAAAHT???? Many of the words or phrases would be familiar to anyone (same in both cultures) and didn't really need to be included, while others were missing that should have been included. Wow! Don't buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Knickeres in a Twist","review":"Fun resource in comparing slang in England and our use of words.

The book contains so many of the 'slang' expressions I slip into our conversations, that it has become great sport for us to exchange and then hunt the meaning or origin behind what can be judged a bizarre phrase or word. It is much more than a 'coffee table' tome. Originally my son or myself had to give an explanation which was to the best of our understanding, but now with this book as reference all parties are fully informed. It goes a long way to explain to newcommers of the English language the idiosyncracies of British slang."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be great","review":"I've been using these speakers for about 2 weeks and haven't been impressed at all. It seemed like they were ok at first, but I periodically lose the signal to one of the speakers every few seconds or so. I've tried everything to resolve this by the way, taking out the batteries and plugging them into the power cord, even carrying them into the house, near the transmitter, adjusting the volume on the source. Not sure if cell phones are causing the interference but I'll probably return them soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheezy","review":"I am learning that hard-wired speakers are the way to go if you want really good outdoor sound. I checked these wireless speakers out at the Sharper Image store; they are cheap plastic, the sound is very poor quality, and each speaker has to be fiddled with independently and sometimes loses the signal. One of the two speakers in the store was even broken. When you're entertaining, you want the background music to be good quality and effortless, right? If you still think you want these, go see them in person in a Sharper Image store, and then decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Scratchy!","review":"My husband and I bought this with high hopes we could listen out by the pool but the speakers were soooo very scratchy and NOT worth the money at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad That This Book is One of the Few Available on This Topic","review":"This book is about one mother's obsession with having the \\"perfect\\" child. While it purports to examine the larger issue of disability in our culture, this book really just provides an exhausting accounting of the tiresome complaints of an author who wants so badly to be accepted by her upper middle class academic peers that she hates the disabled child she's bearing. Finally, the author makes peace with the idea of raising disabled child by imbuing him with \\"magical\\" abilities. If you are looking for a book to answer questions about raising a Downs Syndrome child, this is not it. If you like to read bizarre memoirs of people with convoluted and unresolved mental issues who need lots of therapy, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disliked this book","review":"I had two pregnancies (and babies) as a graduate student at a prestigious institution and I'm also quite familiar with the culture at Harvard. Granted this was recently and not a decade or so ago, but her portrayal of Harvard's culture is ridiculous and frankly offensive. I'm so tired of our society's anti-intellectualism and this just feeds it. My experience of graduate school is indeed stressful, but very supportive and my deans, professors, and advisor have been truly patient with my progress and doting on my babies.This book just seemed over-the-top contrived and emotionally manipulative. I was given it as a gift and was unable to be genuinely greatful to the giver once I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my all time favorites","review":"I've been in a book club for 20 years. We've read a lot of wonderful books. This is truly one of my favorites. It's a book filled with miracles. I wonder who couldn't believe that there's a God after reading this book. Though it's been quite some time since I've read it, I still get chills when I tell someone about it. This is a book that will show you that God has a plan and a purpose, even though we don't always understand or see it. If you want a book that will make you laugh, make you cry and make you a beliver, this is it. Thank you Martha, for sharing your wonderful story with us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking it on faith","review":"Read this book if: you are struggling with the belief that you must be perfect to be loved. I have read other Beck books. I especially liked Leaving the Saints. And like some of the other reviewers here, I occasionally pause, scratch my head, and say \\"can all of this stuff really happen to one person?\\"and \\"is it possible she is taking literary license with some of the details? And then I look at my own life, and I think, NO. If all of us told the truth of our own existence, the late night thoughts, the dreams, the spiritual experiences, we'd all sound like lunatics. These are the things we must share with each other and these are the things we don't share because we are afraid some \\"reviewer\\" will skewer us or smirk or otherwise besmirch our integrity and sanity. I loved this book. It brought me back to the power of my dreams and my connection with the divine. I thank Martha and Adam for the inspiration and love shared."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memoir that will stay with you","review":"I'm not the most patient of readers but this book grabbed me from the start and continues to stay with me. Whether you're awash in spirituality or a total skeptic, this book will leave its mark. Martha Beck shares an almost unbelievable story of living the Harvard life and learning that her unborn child will be born with Down's Syndrom. Her spiritual journey and courage throughout this story are truly inspirational. Reading it, I hope, will make us all a bit more human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking memoir that reminds us of why we're really here","review":"I'm an editor. I read a ton -- maybe even more than a ton. I'm not sure what prompted me to pick this up and read it -- maybe one of Martha's Bunraku puppeteers. . . I'm not a mother nor did I go to Harvard, but I do have a learning disabled sister (though not with Down's.) This is the first book I've read that really demonstrates -- in magnificent lyrical prose -- what these special people bring to our families, lives, communities and world. Everyone must read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tearful and painful journey of realization and heartache","review":"Wow. I have to admit that I am a woman of the 90s and I have never wanted children because of the selfish overtones that it obviously applies. But after reading this book, it really hit me the beauty and love the literal pains of childbirth can bring. A whole new appreciation of my parents came into the picture. My favorite part was the actual birth itself and the precious details of first seeing their son. Several of the descriptions really hit home with me: the magnet alphabet, having Sesame Street as the babysitter and so on from my own childhood. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVES","review":"This story would make such an awesome film! It's got all the elements of a great, uplifting family drama. It really makes you think about what truly matters in life, and what is essential to see in others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting","review":"Expecting Adam is refreshing and uplifting. Martha Beck writes as if speaking to a dear friend, and her honesty and humor immediately draw you in. Her perspective on expecting and living with Adam challenge any preconceptions on disability, success, and beauty. A lovely read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...was this BAD!","review":"I was so excited to read this for book club. It was a good topic and looked interesting and had lots of great reviews here on Amazon. Let's just say that only 2 of us in book club actually took the time to finish it. We didn't like the author's personality nor did we find much of the book believable. I love a great story if it is true or not, but this was BAD storytelling. It didn't ring true for the most part. I so wanted to love this book, but I didn't like it in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I read this wonderful book not once, but twice, and recommended it to all of my friends and family. I found it beautiful, charming, uplifting, even transformational. Then Ms. Beck published a new book: \\"Leaving the Saints.\\" For anyone considering purchasing either, I refer you to this thoughtful, intelligent review: http://www.sunstoneonline.com/Download/book-review.pdf. After reading it and many other reviews, I have sorrowfully arrived at the conclusion that \\"Expecting Adam\\" is a fictionalized memoir, and not the truth, as Ms. Beck claims. To find that Ms. Beck has so taken advantage of her readership's credulity is a grave disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I really liked this book. My book club chose it and I was a little skeptical. While the \\"visions\\" were not my favorite part of the book, I genuinely enjoyed the story. The author's humor in the face of adversity is truly a gift.Of course I read this book for pleasure but a lot of the themes really hit home. There are a lot of messages about living within your beliefs and values that affected me personally.I passed this on to a friend who recently experienced a death in her family and she enjoyed it as well.I would say read it without any preconceived ideas and then draw your own conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am Conflicted","review":"First of all, the writing was beautiful. But the story, though tender and moving, was unbelievable. Ironically, I would have raved about it if it had been presented as a work of fiction the way the author is said to have written it originally. But as a memoir I cannot accept that many of the events the author relates could possibly be true. And I am more than surprised that so many readers seemed to accept all that the author said as gospel. I felt actually embarrassed for her and sad that her brilliant, luminous prose had to be tarnished by the untruths that she told."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I found this book to be very disappointing. In my opinion, it lacks a feel of authenticity. I believe there is partial truth, but I couldn't help feeling that the author exaggerated and sensationalized a great deal of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giving hope to the rest of us.","review":"Reading Martha Becks story of her pregnancy and birth of son Adam gave me optimism and hope again that we're not struggling along in life alone. She is surrounded by coincidence, synchronicity & angels and intuitively I felt it was true. We may feel alone all the time but there are other souls watching and hopefully helping from the other side of the veil. I recommend this book to all women; it is beautifully written and emotionally satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a story - what a book.","review":"I am thankful to have never been put into the situation Martha Beck found herself in in this book. Well written & thought provoking, I shirked my chores until I'd finished this powerful book. My only complaint is that there were no pictures. I wanted to see that front page photo of Martha & her daughter coming out of the burning building. And I wanted to look at Adam - as the ultra-sound Polaroid on the fridge, the tiny newborn they first met and the child he had become by the time the book went to print. I wonder why Ms Beck didn't want to share those images with us when she had us wrapped around her mystical finger through-out the entire book. I recommend this book to read no matter who you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eloquent discussion of what few are willing to discuss","review":"For those who are criticizing Beck (the few who do), remember the Indian adage about walking a mile in someone else's shoes. Beck does a fabulous job of sharing intimate details of her life and her struggle in accepting her son's physical condition. She is an excellent writer who narrates the story very well, and a sensitive mother who is doing a fabulous job raising her special child. Those who deserve the boos are the members of the Harvard (and general) community who discouraged her, criticized her, and would not look her in the face when the condition of her expected child became known.As for the mystical aspects, if Beck were a Latina and wrote this as a novel, people would commend her for her excellent use of magic realism. Her title acknowledges that this is part of the story. I for one wouldn't mind meeting the healing presences who guide her along the difficult path to becoming Adam's mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Not able to really get into the book. Keep trying but not enough to keep me into it more than a page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"This book was not very good. I am a true believer that every child is a gift, and that all children especially those with special needs teach us as parents what is really important in life. I was excited to read the book but it really fell short. After reading 1/2 the book I really have no interest in reading the 2nd half. The author tries to turn her morning sickness into a major dramatic highlight of the book. I don't doubt she was sick but it is not very interesting to read page after page detailed description about her morning sickness. I found the author to be rude and insulting toward her husband's family. Maybe she thinks her in-laws are boring and difficult to be around, but it seems cruel and disrespectful to talk about them like that in a memoir. I would be surprised to hear that her inlaws still talk to her after the horrible things she says about them in the book. Would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...great book.","review":"What a terrific book. When you initially hear of the subject matter, it's not quite so inviting, but it is one of the best books I've read in some time. The way Beck moves from one emotion to the other made me laugh, cry and stay up late to see what was going to happen. Very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Writer","review":"I was about three chapters into the book when I realized that I knew too much about the author of this memoir from recent news. I have no doubt that all of the things she describes in the book could happen and possibly actually happened to her and her family but how do you know what to believe from a person that you don't trust?That being said, Beck is a decent writer. She is sarcastic, caustic and occasionally funny (I enjoyed her descriptions of Harvard). Read as fiction, the story is moving and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment!","review":"I was discouraged when I read this book. I had heard wonderful things about it and looked forward to reading \\"Expecting Adam\\" -- a selection for our book club. I was unhappy with the author's writing style -- she really does not write very well. It was too much of a memoir of her less than positive experience at Harvard and I kept thinking we were supposed to feel sorry for her. Going to Harvard full time, raising a child and then learning she was expecting a child with down's syndrome. Please, there are far more demanding problems in life! The paranormal experiences did not add much either. I would not recommend this book. It was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Book","review":"I heard Martha Beck interviewed on the radio last fall and thought her book sounded interesting. It has taken me this long to find it in my library.I was put off by her way of going back and forth between present, past and future. It spoiled the flow of the story. The Harvard experience sounds awful, but Ivy League people have that mind set. As a Midwesterner I know, but don't let it bother me. There are many more important things than a degree from Harvard which I think she finally found out.The paranormal experiences were interesting and believable, but am sure bothered some readers.The last few pages (316-18) were the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed forever the way I will look at downs children","review":"A true look into what having a special needs child is like. This should be required reading for any parents expecting to join the parenting club. Beck shows the reader that not getting the \\"perfect\\" child of your dreams can give you the chance at unmeasureable joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A joy to read and savor","review":"I am about 2/3 of the way through this wonderful book and I already feel it has had an effect on my views of life, on both sides of the \\"veil.\\" Not only did I become immediately captivated by the story, but Martha Beck's writing style, with its blend of wit and deadly seriousness, was extremely refreshing. I too have a somewhat offbeat sense of humor, so her descriptions of her in-laws, family of origin and the general nuttty pace of life at Harvard all rang completely true to me. And Beck's style of writing, presenting her paranormal experiences and letting the reader decide how to view them, was like the icing on top of a very satisfying cake, the cake being, of course, her relationship with and love for her beautiful son, both before and after his birth. Thank you, Martha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down, but I did not want it to end!","review":"Martha Beck has a quirky, brilliant way of writing that hooks you from the first chapter. After reading Chapter One, I was compelled to call my closest friend and read it out loud. Being a mother to a child with Down syndrome, I am proud to have her in our \\"fraternity\\"! I have read most of the literature out there in regards to a parents' perspective of coping with the birth (and rebirth!) of a child with \\"DS\\" and her book is far and above the best one written to date. She lets everyone in on \\"our little secret\\", which is, that our special children become the best part of our lives. I am anxiously awaiting an update about Adam!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorption","review":"I was so disappointed in this book which our book club chose. Martha Beck is incredibly self-absorbed. I am curious as to how a book with so flimsy a plot could get published. Perhaps its Martha's ivy league education that allows for this after all. The stories of morning sickness are so exaggerated beyond belief. She should have lost her other child due to neglect. A disappointing read and author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book so far.....","review":"I haven't read the whole book, but so far it is good. It is also sad because the author Martha Beck, her son Adam has Down Syndrome, and it makes me sad just reading about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More on Fake Memoirs","review":"This book was recommended by a writer-friend saying it was well written and an interesting read. I was sucked in by the writer for a few pages, but then decided to start listing all the inconsistencies and reality-defying events. By page 95, where I am now, I have 10 major ones listed. Then I remembered the lately discussion about Fake Memoirs and thought, hey lets see what the reviewers on Amazon say. I'm surprised at the large number of reviewers who believe this stuff actually happened as written. She might have gone to Harvard and might have a Down's syndrome kid, but after that, it pure fiction. Try imagine writing about what you had in the refrigerator on day 26 of vomiting 10 years later. But you have to give Ms. Beck credit for a vivid imagination; similar to a paranoid-compulsive nephew I know who can make up the most compelling fictitious event scenarios; way better than I can."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT INTELLIGENT & SMART WRITING!!","review":"This book is a blessing. The author Martha Beck is a smart very well educted person who faces real issues in her life, which all can learn from. She is pregnant with a Down Syndrome Baby and the experiences she has while expecting are wonderful. The dialogues she has with herself are a lesson in disguise. I would absolutely reccommend and encourage all to read it. You will finish the book with a smile and tears in your eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read this book for our book club. It was fascinating to find that half of the book club members absolutely loved it and half absolutely hated it. There was no in-between. While I found the writing style engaging, I found the author to be an obnoxious, self-centered, arrogant whiner (not to mention mean-spirited). I grew weary of the perfect \\"Marth\\" and her equally perfect husband. The puppeteers were \\"cute\\" at first, but after the 8000th mention, I was ready to scream. Don't get me wrong, when I started the book I was ready to love it for Adam's sake. But this wasn't a book about Adam; this was a book about the wonderful Martha Beck and her condescending greatness in dealing with an imperfect child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm, funny and intriguing description of a magical birth","review":"I've never read anything quite like this book. It's a fascinating description of Martha Beck's pregnancy with and delivery of Adam, a magical child who happens to have Down Syndrome. Martha's writing is at once funny and profound. The book left me much wiser about parenting so-called \\"handicapped\\" children and, more broadly, what it reflects on the priorities of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"I read Beck's columns and enjoyed \\"Leaving the Saints,\\" so I decided to try this memoir. One of the most moving books I have ever encountered. Everyone should read this book; it isn't just a story about Down Syndrome, it is a story of reclaiming a life...wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expecting Adam","review":"This book gives the reader a perspective about carrying and raising a baby with a birth defect and how God provides for all our needs and how God uses those situations to bless us and teach us to see things that others that don't share those similar experiences will never have the joy of seeing or experiencing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book","review":"This book is incredible. A must read. It is about a multitude of things but to me it is a simple message of seek happiness and it just might be in something or someone you never expected so stop and look and listen. My words don't do it justice. It refers to the fact that so many of us don't see is that just because someone has a degree, let a lone a Ivy League degree doesn't make them wise. Sometimes wisdom comes from a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expecting Adam","review":"Martha Beck's understandable and eloquent writing made this book a delight for me to read. It is a beautiful rendition of personal changes she has to grapple with and, I believe, changes that are very relevant during our current, challenging times. Truly a wonderful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage ! ! !","review":"Do not buy this bike. I got to ride mine for about 35 minutes before it was broke.

No matter what we've needed guidance on, this book has had the best answers.The book goes into great detail on a variety of subjects from how to word the wedding invitation, to how to keep the guest list under control (our biggest nightmare so far!!), to how the ceremony and reception should be planned and even on how to make your vows more personalized.We can't imagine having done our wedding without this book. All the other books we bought been helpful, but not close to this one. Even if I were straight, I would pick this book up since so much of it applies to anyone gay or straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an update","review":"I bought this for my sister when she told me she was going to have a commitment ceremony. I was honored when she asked me to be her Maid of Honor. The book isn't bad or anything but it could use some updating. My sister said only some of the information was helpful to her. There aren't many books on the market for this topic though. So if you can't find anythign else it's worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"I'm a wedding DJ doing research for some same-sex weddings I have coming up. This book had some helpful stuff about social customs as they may pertain to gay couples. Some of that was helpful and interesting to me. However, it reads quite outdated now (ah, the 90's!) so it feels pretty stuffy. I got a couple of books like this and I would have to say with more choices out there I can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"As wedding guides go,this isn't a bad book but the title is misleading. There's very little in this book that is specfic to the gay/lesbian community. Its more of a generic wedding planning guide. I was looking for something with ceremony content tailored to this specific population. I was looking for some insights into this particular population to help me best meet their needs. I was disappointed on both counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, inspirational film","review":"I loved this film about Mother Theresa. I was inspired by her willingness to sacrifice all that she had and was to serve God. It has inspired me to be more selfless and sacrifice more of myself to help those in my reach. I can't think of many people who have inspired me more and I appreciate those who put forth the effort to make such a beautiful, inspiring film about this incredible woman of faith and devotion. We could all benefit from knowing better the truths that came from her lips, and more importantly, her actions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie about a great woman","review":"Mother Teresa was truly a great woman whose life should be celebrated. Lives like hers should be discussed in schools instead of the lives of those whose main goal is to amass money and fame. Mother Teresa gave herself to the poor and helpless and shunned praise and earthly rewards. Olivia Hussey was an excellent choice to portray her. To anyone who objects to the actress because of Ms. Hussey's personal beliefs, I say, \\"You're supposed to be concentrating on Mother Teresa and her message, not judging the actress. Leave that to God. Mother Teresa loved Princess Diana, who did not appear to be a model Christian. She loved the Princess and everyone as a human being. We should all do the same.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A small woman of stature & charity","review":"I have always been an admirer of this incredible small-statured bent-over nun. This movie beautifully paints Mother Theresa as a woman of love and charity whose humility made her a giant in the world. I enjoyed seeing her faith walk and how she never flinched in her mission. Olivia Hussey IS Mother Theresa because of the breadth and depth of her interpretation of the nun. I had previously read her biography and was not disappointed by this elegant and touching film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The entire family enjoyed this.","review":"The family and I watched this together in rememberance of Blessed Mother Theresa and really enjoyed it. Usually I preview a movie for the kids (ages 6, 4, and 2) but I hadn't had time. My fears were for nothing. Yes, there were some scenes that brought up questions but all the scenes were done tastefully and my simple answers satisfied the kids (my oldest mainly). I also think the accents helped them miss some of the strife going on. It truly seemed like the kids understood the love of Mother Theresa and the others as they helped the poor and forgotten of India. And it tastefully opened their eyes that not everyone lives as we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the Greatest Saint's Movie Ever!","review":"After being disappointed more than once with Saints movies, my family and I sat down to watch Mother Theresa. As far as we are concerned this is the greatest Saint's movie ever filmed. I can not say enough about Olivia Hussey's performance. She was Mother Theresa.The writing and directing is faithful to this once living saint. A must see for anyone who wants to see what true love is. Mother Theresa brought love to everyone she met because in everyone she met she saw Jesus.Half way through the movie my 5 year old son proclaimed \\"wow, she REALLY cares about everyone!\\"This is a must have, and I am very happy to own it as we will watch this time and time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"performance outweighs information","review":"Olivia Hussey's performance gets better and better through out the film..but if you have no understanding of the life of Mother Teresa you can get a bit lost...it doesn't do a good job of informing you of the sequence of events or give enough information to follow her life from a biographical point of view but if you want the spirit of MOther Teresa this film has it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scenes for the Ages, show pctures of Despair, Poverty, Hope","review":"This awesome story of Mother Teresa who prayed to God by listening rather than only in words, gives scenes of Poverty, utter despair, gastly suffering, gradual Healing and Hope. As it flows along with pictures of Poverty, Suffering, Death & Dying I was reminded of 15 months of Clinical Pastoral Caring! At the Emory hospitals in the rooms of Billy Carter, Former GEORGIA Senators, Chap Douglas Turley and Joe Surber, I faced head-on Death and Dying nearly every day and many late night On-Call times.Olivia Hussey surely earnes an Oscar or Two!

Good learning tool for anyone interested in true charity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother Teresa (DVD)","review":"This film is excellent! I am skeptical that films can capture the lives of great saints in just 2 hours. Of course you can't get everything, but they did a great job on this one. I loved the fact that so many of Mother Teresa's quotes and sayings are distributed throughout the film. Olivia Hussey does a great job portraying Mother Teresa. It's definitely a can't miss!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment and broken case","review":"The movie was not factually correct. The case was broken on the inside, so the DVD slid around inside. The woman did not accurately play the Joy of Mother Theresa. She was far too worried and concerned for much of the movie. I would not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mother religious","review":"There's a pretty interesting approach to these religious films, an approach of cultic religion and of people using it as a veneer to hide serious structural defects in their souls and lives, and what happens when that facade starts to crack and fall off.This Mother Teresa flick is a bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful portrait","review":"This film captures the essence of Mother Teresa rather than a linear biography of her, which I think she would prefer. It is an inspirational portrait of a true follower of Christ's teachings. She lived her life being true to her belief in him and his teachings and thats an inspiration to anyone no matter what your specific beliefs are. Olivia Hussey is amazing and the film is well done. A dvd worth buying because its something you can watch whenever you need perspective on your own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Pretty good. Acting was not the best I have seen but i still liked it. WOuld recommend to others. Hope you like as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blessed Woman","review":"I believe that probably the greatest missionary or catechetical tool for Christians today would have to be Mother Teresa. She exemplifies what Christianity is all about and epitomises the life and teachings of Christ.I think Mother Teresa: In the Name of God's Poor is a much better movie and would much more highly recommend it over this production.Consider also Mother Teresa by Petrie and the legacy as well.Truly a blessed woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olivia Hussey is still lovely . . .","review":"More than twenty-five years before, Olivia Hussey was just as lovely when she played the Virgin Mary in Franco Zeffirelli's \\"Jesus of Nazarus,\\" and did so brilliantly. She reprised the beauty of that performance in \\"Mother Teresa,\\" which is timeless too. Serving the poor in Calcutta for most of her life, this Saint brought hope to those who had none and taught Jesus' Love to those who had seldom if ever experienced love before.She received a Nobel Prize, but no earthy honor was her reward. Her faith truly found a way when there appeared to be none at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother Teresa / Olivia Hussey","review":"Wonderful story and acting.

It was extremely well made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hundreds of wonderful/rare photos in best print quality!","review":"Highly anticipated book on the World's Greatest Rock'n'Roll Band... left nothing to be wished for! Text and pictures show this is the work of a true insider, especially to the tour life and the back stage scene. I happen to own more than 200 books on the Stones, this one ranks among the best five, in the company of strictly limited, much higher priced British publications. Congratulations to both authors for their thorough but never indiscreet interviews with the crew and the band members themselves, and of course to all the talented (and lucky!) photographers! This book is a MUST for all Stones fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven glorfication of the current Stones.","review":"THe book is just uneven and self glorifying. Not nearly enough sixties pictures in here and again they pick on Brian and Mick Taylor the two best musicians to play with the group. Of course Brian is given no credit for starting the band. Frankly looking at photos of the Stones past the seventies (let alone hearing a good amount of their post Tatoo You music) is pretty horrid and they take up probably a good two thirds of the book. Skip it and buy Wyman's fantastic Rolling With The Stones. He is much more self aware as far as what the Stones best era was and is much more even handed assessing the groups talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"albanian propaganda!","review":"I bought this book because it is the only one on the market these days in a western language. What a pity the editors of Blue Guide debased themselves to edit such a one-sided and partisan work.Not only does it make no difference between Albania itself and the (now thoroughly ethnically cleansed) NATO-protectorate of the Serbian province of Kosovo; even part of Macedonia are, without commentary, included as part of Greater Albania, and the book even includes a map of \\"ethnic Albania\\" including parts of Montenegro, Serbia itself and Greece (even Corfu!).Now I understand why other guidebook producers such as Lonely Planet did not undertake to make a book about Albania.As the author often points out himself, only the commitment to the \\"Albanian cause\\" in this book is important.I suppose the next step of BLue Guide will be some books about Libya by M. Ghaddafi, or about Palestine by A. Sharon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Blue Bible for Albania\\"","review":"I lived and worked for 18 months in Tirana and traveled throughout the country from Kukes to Korca to Saranda to Shengjin and I always, always carried my Blue Guide. It was indispensable for my personal exploration of the country and allowed me to act as \\"tour guide\\" for visitors. I used the Albania-only edition until this edition came out and immediately upgraded. Any book can tell you how to get to a country or which hotels are available, but they quickly become obsolete. By focusing more on the history, culture, and environment, Pettifer avoids that trap. Albania changes every day and any attempt to recommend which hotel is good, which is safe, which is cheapest will be oudated before the ink is dry. This book tells you more about why things are the way they are. It also covers more areas off the beaten path. Yes, I own the Bradt guide too, but prefer the more detailed, denser content of the Blue Guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy Blue Guide for history rather than travel","review":"I found this book in the bookstores in Albania in both English and Albnanian versions. As is typical of the Blue Guide publications, it is geared more toward a historical rather than travel context.It is somewhat 'dated' because Albania has developed quite a bit since 2000. Roads and accomodations are improving. Even Internet cafes can be had in most of the cities, although inconsistent power is still a problem in many areas.Now that Gillian Gloyer's guide is available, I would recommend buying it instead since it is better as a travel resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description misleading","review":"Description said some wear, there was writing and highlighting along with tears and a broken binding."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid and bad acting","review":"Erika is a bad actress.

It definately was a big step for her to take, in comparison with her previous albums. This new brave step opened up a new bubble gum pop Tina, where she portrays happy, and lively songs, and to constrast she presents her deepest emotion in songs like 'Woman' and 'Something's Gotta Change'. This album is definately worth having. Tina Arena is an amazing music artist, song writer, and singer with one of the most amazing voices. So its a DEFINATE yes to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This album features one of the wrost performers around. Poor voice, poorly written songs. Get another album.

She has produced an \\"explanation\\" of how the Jews of Germany could have been taken in 500 years after the events decribed and how the \\"fear of the Other\\" continues today.This is a hard read as she skips back and forth and from place to place. She details the pogroms but not the accomplishments of the Jewish community. She virtually ignores the events in the rest of Europe and cannot tell us why Spain was different from France or Italy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent music - poor recording quality","review":"I was disappointed by the recording quality of this CD. The sound is very flat and muffled. Compare \\"Cali pachanguero\\" from this album to the same track on Grupo Niche's Serie Azul Tropical CD and you'll find that the latter has an audibly cleaner sound.

It has a whole lot borrowed from \\"The Thing\\" and one particularly memorable scene straight out of \\"The Ruins\\". Not that that is bad. They are both awesome. I'm not sure that calling this a monster movie is totally accurate. If you thought \\"The Ruins\\" was a monster movie, than you will think this is too. This is more akin to that than say \\"Jack Brooks\\". Love the idea and the FX. It's brief and worth checking out for horror fans.

And I will even give thumbs up to a movie even if it has only 10 minutes of goodness for 70 minutes of blah blah (but not ridiculously bad). This movie, Splinter, sucks. It's boring through and through. No real tension and only about 10 seconds of a good part (not worth seeing the movie for).How do I base my star rating? I have friends over to watch horror movies. Last night was my night to pick. I picked this movie. The way my movie group works is that you get to pick until your pick bombs. Because of this movie I don't get to pick for at least another five weeks. I can't even say this movie sucked... it didn't irritate enough. It was just blah, there, boring. So I give this 2 stars b/c movies like The Witch of Pine Barrens (Blair Witch stole this movie) is by far better. And I can't give it 1 star b/c I don't care about it enough to hate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome horror movie","review":"great conflict between good and bad, then good humans banding and bonding with bad ones against the greater evil.

The directing is by the numbers so it's not hard on the eyes. The acting is average for a direct to DVD release. The special effects aren't overdone and help add to the overall creepyness of the film. What really makes this shine is how creepy they've made the creature be. They've taken a very simple concept for a creature and turned it into something you definitely wouldn't want to bump into on a dark night. It's a very simple story that'll leave you wondering right up to the end. I gave it 4 stars because it did what I wanted it to do: it kept my attention and helped me pass the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Little Horror Film","review":"The vast majority of straight to DVD horror films are garbage, pure and simple. This is not one of those films. At a tight 82 minutes, Splinter is a fun, intelligent, simple horror movie that will delight fans of the genre. All the actors of whom I had heard of none, were top notch. It's not particularly scary, but it does offer some decent jolts. What impressed me most was the dialogue. Pretty realistic and as I said, every performance was excellent. I wouldn't want to watch Splinter over and over, but it is better than many of the wide release major hollywood horror offerings as of late.

In some movies, 'shaky cam' is necessary (e.g. the Blair Witch Project, and Cloverfield) due to the fact that we are supposedly viewing actual footage shot by a camcorder. It made no sense to do that in Splinter. Ultimately, it ruined the pacing and suspense for me because I was sitting there trying to figure out exactly what was going on.

Unlike any other artist, he created such melancholy and images of nature through his songs, complementing them with his soaring, tenor voice and his excellent guitar playing. When I heard he was killed, I sat in my living room and played and sang every Denver song I knew, trying to give them some of the justice they deserved.Though not all of his best songs are on this compilation, I do believe that this collection captures all parts of Denver. Songs like \\"Sunshine on My Shoulders\\" and \\"Rhymes and Reasons\\" and \\"Leaving on a Jet Plane\\" evoke a melancholy spirit while others like \\"Eagle and the Hawk\\" and \\"Country Roads\\" makes one long for the beauty of nature that only Denver can capture in song.Denver will be sorely missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"John forever!","review":"Favorite male vocalist; sure miss him.

There is some other good stuff like \\"The Eagle and The Hawk\\" I would've loved it if Denver stretched it out for a little longer than the 2 minutes and 10 seconds that's on here, \\"Sunshine\\" is also a lovely song I can't deny that, \\"Leaving On A Jet Plane\\" is pretty decent, but I like Peter Paul and Mary's better.

You can't compare this singer to anyone else, a voice that seems to be asking for a headphone or your ear on the speaker, and at the same time with such a perfect diction you dont need the lyric booklet at all. The music is also understated, everything here is the opposite of the big hit. It's like one of those Satie gymnopedies. Morrissey is telling the listener: Sit down and listen, but if you dont want to do it that's OK too.If you liked his precious cd's then you'll like this one too for sure.

I was starting to get sick of seeing some of the season 1 episodes a hundred times so i decided to purchase seasons 2 and 3. If you liked season 1 because it focused on the accident and the investigation, you might be disappointed with these 2 seasons.

In many ways, Petrouske's poetry and imagery resembles the Upper Penninsula itself: Beautiful, often delightful, and sometimes tragic.In this collection of poems, Petrouske focuses on the relationship between mothers and daughters through the eyes of a woman who fulfills both roles. This offers readers a unique insight into the thoughts and feelings of a woman who is making the transition from being a daughter to becoming a mother herself.\\"A Postcard From My Mother\\" would be an excellent addition to the library of anybody who has experienced or would like to gain awareness of the inner workings of relationships between a mother and daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run, don't walk away from this one!","review":"I have some experience in this field, but was hoping to sharpen my skills.

The industry has moved on and left this writing in the dust.The book is poorly written. There are countless places where the proof readers (assuming they were used?) failed. Example: \\"While each individual case is different.\\" This is NOT a sentence. It is an incomplete thought and this book is chocked full of them.The book is supposed to be basic and the chapter on \\"documenting the loan package\\" is nothing less than pathetic.

I heard Sarbacane in 1989 while in France and hassled a woman in a burger van till she told me who he was. His hit tune at the time was 'C'est Ecrit' - a monster! In fact such a monster that I re-wrote the words and recorded an English language version four years later. I don't understand anything of what he's singing (it's non-textbook vernacular French) but the energy is palpable, the melodies are fabulous and I can't believe there are only a handful of people outside France who are into him. Of course, he's sold 1.6 million copies of this album so he's by no means obscure, but it's a crying shame that because he's French he's confined to other French speaking areas of the world. Now if I could get my version of 'C'est Ecrit' - now retitled 'Remember?' - released, who knows?

Missing is beautiful verdant cinematography of the Pacific northwest.Newer home theater systems and DVD players are meant to exploit new technology and not sent it back to the days of top load VHS players. Disney's arrogant approach shows they have no respect for the consumer and the buying public should not tolerate this attitude! - - A note to Roy Disney: I'm so sorry for the shoddy treatment given to this film; I believe your Uncle Walt would want this movie to be viewed the way it was filmed.**And why is this wonderful DVD available in its OAR of 2.35:1 in Region 2 Europe?

This movie is a rarity for family fare in that it is uncompromising and un-sappy. It treats the depression theme in a very mature way, but the journey itself transcnds what could be a very dark and somber mood throughout the movie. Interesting to me that it was all filmed no more than 15 km. from my neighbourhood in Vancouver . Seeing it for the second time 20 years later, I got to see a small slice of my past- the old train station, the law courts building, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appearances are deceptive","review":"Majestic Scenery, the look of a family movie, and the Disney name all give this film the impression that it's going to be a nice family movie. However the content finds the movie to have un-necessary swearing ( God's name is taken in vain more than once ) a very gloomy outlook, and the fact that all adults appear to be deceptive and malicious toward children. Definitely not a movie for the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Pan and Scan?","review":"The Journey Of Natty Gann is the story about the adventures of a young woman from Chicago who is on the road to find her father who was sent all the way to Washington to work. Along the way, she befriends a wolf-dog(the same animal that played in the 1991 film White Fang), and a drifter. The bad thing about this dvd version is that it is only in pan and scan when it should be widescreen. We are only seeing half of the picture! DvDs were developed to make movies look as good on television screens as they did when they first came out in theaters. It is a matter of choice, but I refuse to buy any DVD, Disney included, that is not in its correct aspect ratio, and I urge anyone who feels the same way to contact them and try to get them to release a widescreen version of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, terrible DVD in ONLY Pan & Scan!!!","review":"I had pre-ordered this DVD weeks in advance, assuming that the film would be in it's original aspect ratio, 2.35:1 Widescreen. However, when the DVD arrived, it was in the 1.33:1 Pan and scan version! No extras! What a waste. The movie itself is so good, and yet Disney releases a below-average DVD. Why bother with the DVD if you already own the VHS version, that's already pan-and-scan? The DVD is at a good price..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible video quality","review":"Disney should be ashamed of themselvs for caring so little about this excellent film. It looks like they took the original analog telecine from 1985 and simply converted it to DVD. There is obviously wsa not anew digital transfer from film (which the film deserves). The image appears to be less than DVD image quality. Plus the image weaves all over the screen like a worn out film print shown at a discount movie theatre.In my opinion, this DVD is simply a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"No OAR, No Sale","review":"I really loved this movie when I first saw it & would love to have it on dvd, but sadly, Disney has decided not to release the movie that I saw, they decided to release only 1/2 of it.Set in the Depression, Natty Gann runs away from the woman her father had left her with when he got a job in the Pacific Northwest. Her journey is truly exciting as she dodges Child Welfare, befriends a wolf and meets up with John Cusack. In the meantime, her father has to search for her when he finds she's missing. Definitely an overlooked gem of a film. I will definitely buy this when Disney chooses to release the entire movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite movie","review":"It's simply too bad that one of the best films to come out of Disney is not being released on home video.

It's such a well-written and well-crafted film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD of a fine film","review":"This is one of the reasons to own a region-free DVD player.

Set during the Depression, Meredith Salenger plays a tomboy who runs away from her caretaker in Chicago to find her father (played by Ray Wise) who's gone off to the Pacific Northwest to cut lumber - the only job he could find. Salenger, along with a wolf she befriends, has all kinds of adventures as she rides the rails west in boxcars, the most interesting being meeting up with John Cusack, who is also hoboing on the trains, and who gives her pointers and helps her out. It's sentimental but never corny, and the ending has just the right amount of suspense and good fortune the viewer expects. The photography is stunning. This Disney movie is a winner all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful, but...","review":"... excepting \\"Un coup de des\\" by Barry Guy, the contempoprary pieces commissioned by this group sound less \\"modern\\" than the medieval music usually presented in other CDs by the same singers."},{"rating":"1","title":"seats 6'2\\" person comfortably but very poor build","review":"After much window shopping (research) I bought this chair two weeks ago and yesterday the thing fell apart while I was leaning back and watching a movie on my comp.Here is the problem, the back support is connected to the seat only by the two handle bars which are made of plastic.

Also leslie drunk off one shot of moonshine that will be just a joy to watch. I am really excited about crazy Entertainment 7/20 will be as well. Oh and to scent.

The first one claims they mailed the item, but I never received it and USPS has no record of the shipment. The second person I tried to order it from claims her granddaughter must have taken the book from her inventory and used it for a babysitting job and she cannot locate the book...and the charge on my credit card is still showing pending even though I was assured the order was cancelled. I am not happy with Amazon.com right now. As for the book, I know it is a good book because I had it as a child.

For example, the short vowel in the words 'bird' and 'work' does NOT sound like that in standard English 'book,' but more like that in 'thud.'Adams would have been better off transcribing the sounds in some standard phonetic alphabet, or, to make the book more accessible, in the same mix that Jamaicans do.

I was turned on to it by my friend Sam, and though initially quite wary, I took the plunge and bought it.An album of contrasts, it seems to be a synthesis of everything from folk to hip - hop to sparse electronica, and yet in the truest sense of the defintion, exceeds and extends beyond these references which cannot really do it justice. A talented production team and a really rather excellent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothin but the hottness!","review":"Neptunes do it again! Once again on their side project entitled \\"In Search of...\\", the Neptunes come out on top with no worries. (What were the reviewers at Amazon thinking) Pharrell laces his soul over hot tracks creating love, lust, and rock & roll. After feeling the origional album, i had to cop this one to hear the changes. On words to explain it .... this one is alive and breathing. After the underground got ahold of the original tracks, the neptunes had no other choice but to recreate. and recreate they did! i dont see them doing it any other but to play it live! Props to SpyMob. Hot Tracks? All! Favorites, \\"AM I HIGH\\", \\"Truth or Dare\\", \\"Provider\\", \\"Rock Star\\", and \\"Bobby James\\".

WITH CATCHY HOOKS AND GREAT BEAT LAID THEY'VE SHOWN THAT GOT SOMETHING TO PROVE TO THE WORLD AS ARTIST AND PRODUCERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding beats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This album has the best beats I've ever heard. The beats are as good as Timbaland's beats. I don't like the way Pharrel raps, though. He sounds like an r&b; singer instead of a rapper. That's one thing I hate about the album. The chorus of the song \\"Brain\\" sounds so stupid, also. The song that doesn't have a good beat is \\"Provider\\". My favorite songs are:Track 1) Lap DanceTrack 2) Things Are Getting BetterTrack 5) Truth Or DareTrack 10) Rock Star.If you like phat beats with a lot of bass, then I would recommend this album. Don't buy a Neptunes album expecting good lyrics or good rapping, becuse they basically focus on their beats."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the hottest slept on albums of all time...","review":"I am always intrigued by music, and this album just put me over the top. Being exposed to a diverse genre of music as a child, I found all of that in this one album. Talented isn't even the word to describe the production team on this album. It incorporates real issues looking at things from both perspectives ( i.e. Track 4- Provider, then Track 11- Bobby James) It is hot, actuallyI fell in love to track 7 , 'Run to the Sun'.So trust you won't be dissappointed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS CD!!!","review":"When i got this cd i didn't really know what i was buying but tried it anyway.

DOn't hesitate to buy it, it's so worth your time!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"superb beats and great songwriting","review":"On this release they get a rock band to play their music and the results are spectacular. They fuse classic rock, modern rock, hip hop, and futuristic Neptunes sounds. This is probably the best N.E.R.D. album, it is eclectic and original. the import version is available if you want to hear this album with the drum machines and synths, how it was originally intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Level","review":"... Anyway moving on, I can only say great things about this CD. N.E.R.D. has really taken their art to another entire new level. I love this album and would recommend it to anyone who is a true lover of music not just one music style but all music as a whole art form. The sadest part of this album is that the people that would really enjoy it will probably never be exposed to it. Because of the limited music style selections in most stores today the CD will get labled at 'Rap' and stuck in that section despite the fact that it is not a 'rap' album. It is its own style without needing a rap, rock, pop, or r&b designation pigeon holeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Nerds","review":"I'm sorry....this album is horrible. It sounds like a bunch of high schoolers got loose in the studio. I think I'm a very open-minded person, but to say I was disappointed is a huge understatement. .... Pharrell's voice may be fine for singing hooks, but it certainly cannot carry an entire album."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"Listen, this is one of the most honest and original LP's that I have heard in a long while. Classifications cannot work for NERD, they are music, they are all genres, the cross every line and do it with ease and skill. Open-minds are all this CD needs to be an instant classic in the rotation. Me personally I would call In Search Of... an eclectic array of good, heartfelt beats and lyrics. This album is a must-buy and deserves the credit all before me have given it. Do yourselves a favor and buy this one, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an insult!","review":"I listen to all types of music, and very often become quickly bored of the mundane material put out by today's artists. This cd by the Neptunes however is the furthest thing from that. I have listened to this cd from beginning to end over and over again, and yet I don't grow tired of it at all. The range of skill and creativity of this group is unparalleled in mainstream music today. As for that reviewer, you might want to listen to this cd again without your happy little TRL playing in the background!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My daughter asked to use my account to buy this","review":"After listening to it with her I am less than impressed.

I believe these guys wrote this album not to make money - because I get the feeling they don't particularly care about money. There is not an iota of talent - lyrics, production, vocals - on this album. It is completely lacking. I get the sense this is a tongue-in-cheek cd, an elaborate ruse, an experiment to see who will buy this utter tripe. Sadly, I am a victim. My only consolation is that I realized it after track 3. Rockstar and Kelis' contribution to Truth or Dare are the only lights, however dim those light shine. Please save your money for something else, anything else. That sound you hear is the Neptunes, NERD, whatever, laughing all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD","review":"For some guys who have made some of the most memorable beats ever and who seem to really \\"get it\\" in the interviews they have done this is an INCREDIBLY WEAK disc. There is exactly one style spread over 12 songs. The vocals are extremely [poor], the only thing worse are the lyrics. Sounds like they have some serious rock star envy problems.If you're looking for some intelligent musicianship and skillful lyrics, SKIP THIS and check out something like Deltron 3030 instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of 2002","review":"Haven't listened to a new CD as much as this upon purchase. Can't classify the type of music either. What miffed me was that my favorite song is in between the 11th and 12th track. The rest of it is classic, BRAIN is JAM of the year, RUN TO THE SUN (EW&F/Al B. Sure??) for your girl, BABY DOLL for the mistress, LAPDANCE might be my anthem. Genius. Runnin' on top of the cop car, BOBBY JAMES, 17."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"This album is a true gem. A hip-hop/rock/funk hybrid that really works. This talented production team can do more than just make hits. They have crafted an album of pure bliss here. Lapdance is the obvious stand-out cut, but most of the album is brilliant. The live instruments really give it a classic feel and compliments the rapping nicely. Grab this for a breath of fresh air in the hip-hop world. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"GENRE-BUSTING COOL!","review":"Not the usual - no matter what you think that means.

And When I Heard The Tracks, They Blew Me Away. Am I High, Things Are Getting Better, and Run To The Sun are the songs to hear. Though They Are All Amazing, Those Are My Personal Favorites. Some Of The Critics Are Really Stupid Thinking This Album Isn't Great. Maybe You Don't Know Music. In Search Of... Is Definitely The Best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The coolest album","review":"Ever since they've came out I've gotten just about every song ever produced by the neptunes. They are now artists and it was soo good to listen to a album that is different than what u would usually expect from a hip hop group. I love Pharrel's voice and the sound of this album is so eclectic. It's Hip Hop, funk, rock, and it can have a motown feel at times. I can't wait for the clones to drop. My fav. are Lapdance (tight beat), Bobby James, Am I high?, Run to the sun. I also have Neptunes Startrak vol.1. It has this song called \\"popular thug\\" with Kelis and pusha from the clipse. The neptunes produced that one too. You have to get this album!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprise rock from rap super stars","review":"This album really suprized me. I put it in to hear the hip-hop that the neptunes are known for and I wound up with artsie rock and sexual hip-hop. There are songs that range from present day rap superstars to classic '50s style surfer rock. This is truly a unique album and they diserve all the credit they can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Search of ... Pure Fun!","review":"This is without a doubt the best album there is if you looking for Groove, Funk & Freashness (Is there such a word? if not there should be one).I'm not going to write a long review with favorite songs and stuff like that because the entire album is great.All I want to say is - B*U*Y T*H*I*S A*L*B*U*M."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little over-hyped, but still crosses genres","review":"I'm mainly a rock fan, but when i heard all the hype about this CD being a mix, and crossing genre's, and being really good, i decided to give it a shot. And the CD plays more like a rap CD than anything else- obviously, as the only subject matter is mainly sex and drugs. And the first song \\"Lapdance\\" is very catchy and fun, there are about 3 or 4 songs that sound exactly like it on the CD. While NERD has definately created a style of its own, there isnt too much variety throughout the CD... similar sounding guitar riffs, drum beats, etc. I praise them for actually using real drums, something that most hip hop stars dont dare do. And i'm glad they have put some of the stars they produced (Kelis, etc) onto this CD to guest in a couple songs. But if you like rock OR rap, or just want somethign different, you will probably like this CD. The problem is, its not as good as it is hyped up to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD I've ever heard!! Really dissappointing!!","review":"If you're expecting hip hop instrumentals or the neptunesstyle of beats with lyrics then look else where. This cd isbad (as in not good). All the tracks sound the same,repetative \\"my girl\\" theme, and cameo apperances by keli andvita are wasted -used for chorus. But the worst part if youcan stand every track sounding like fabulous's \\"Holla backYoung Un\\" are the lyrics. The lyrics are simplistic and laughable."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Search of... THE FURTURE!!","review":"This album is tight,they rappers they have on this album are also good,I have they original version of In Search of... and it was good, but this is even better,the only track I don't like is stay together,but other than that song, this album rocks with other three albums I have:System of a down-toxictiyLinkin Park-Hybrid TheoryNappy Roots-Watermelon,Chicken & GritzThe Neptunes & Shay are going places with this new music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great JSP Book for Beginners to Intermediates","review":"This book is a great book for beginners to intermediates. It is chalked full of real world examples. The book is very easy to follow and goes at a good pace. It does have a few spelling errors, but still a very good book. If you are looking for an intro book to learn JSP, this book is a great starting off point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move along...","review":"I bought this book and found the first 3 chapters usable. They devote over 100 pages to Appendicies that aren't all the useful. The remaining chapters(beyond the first 3 or 4) are useful in gaining an understanding on how to attack business problems, but lack a real solution or 'good' code, which they even say themselves isn't what you would use in corporate life. Not even a good book ... Complete waste of $ in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite frankly, a waste of my hard-earned money.","review":"Hilliard and Miller do little more than compile an itty-bitty picture booklet of mediocre, vacation-quality photographs of southern Spanish homes, and tout the whole mess \\"a book on style.\\" Commentary was utterly lacking, and what the authors did include was pseudo-arty and condescending. If I had been able to browse this book at a real bookstore, I never would have bought it, especially at the full price. This book's only value is in teaching the lesson that the online bookshopping experience can mislead the unwary buyer into making a purchase she or he will regret. Read the reviews, and review books you buy! As for this piece of trash, save your money for a REAL book, not a pretend... one like this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"~Heavenly~","review":"It's so asuring to know that there are still beautiful voices on this planet...Orlagh Fallon is truly among the best of them!!! I absolutely love this album and I can't wait to buy the next one....thank you Orlagh for giving humanity such wonderful music!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Very Best","review":"I am so pleased with this CD. I listen to it almost daily. The beautifll voice so innocent and haunting and the expression and feeling almost gives me goose bumps. I read another opinion that complained. Im no expert but would pick this CD over almost any others I have heard. You wont go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good voice is not enough.","review":"Orlagh Fallon has a good voice, but is unable to convey the feelings and emotion of the lyrics. She sings as if she is reading the words and has no understanding of their meaning. Her renditions of She Moved Thro' The Fair and Carrickfergus are about as bland as I have heard. These songs have so much emotion, pain and passion to express, none of which I found on this CD. Like Enya's recordings, this is beautiful music but has no soul. If you are a lover of traditional Irish Music, this CD is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great performance..","review":"I absolutely LOVE Orla in Celtic Woman, which is why I bought her personal CD - she's my favorite of all the women performing in CW. I was expecting more of the same.. her haunting vocals similar to Siuil a Ruin, Newgrange, and Harry's Game - but no. The entire CD is her and her harp, like on Inisfree from CW - BORING. It's more fit as a CD of children's lullabys then anything for an adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please give us something new","review":"BORING!!! Why are these girls all hacking out the same tunes with the same emotionless sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic to the max","review":"Orla is clearly the best interpreter of Celtic music of any member of the Celtic Woman troupe. Her clear voice and style give this repertoire a new life that is thoroughly enjoyable. I find myself listening to this CD repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully charming","review":"Having first encountered Orla Fallon through her work with Celtic Woman, I began to explore her solo work and was enchanted. She has become one of my favorite artists. I have three of her albums at this point and am not disappointed with a single one. Her voice transports me to the shores of Ireland and soothes both heart and mind. I particularly enjoy the songs such as Carrickfergus in which she both sings and plays the harp so beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Orla","review":"A gentle, soothing album complete with Orla's nostalgic, sad voice and her faithful harp that was her trademark during her stint with Celtic Woman. Some of the songs may sound alike, but they are all beautiful and haunting. This is the real Orla, just her voice singing acapella with the harp and perhaps a few other instruments. This fits her perfectly, so much more than \\"Distant Shore\\" does. I would have liked to see her tackle a bit more of Clannad's sound like she did with \\"Harry's Game\\" and \\"Newgrange\\", but this album is definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant hard-edged rock","review":"Shihad are the masters of riff-driven rock. This album isn't their best (check out their second album 'Killjoy'), but still shows off their superb skill at combining monster riffs with great melodies. Tom Larkin's drumming is always a joy to listen to, and the rest of the band continue to evolve their sounds into new areas. Great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak plot, relationship of Jane Bee to Queen unrealistic.","review":"Much weaker plot than the first book in this series, which was quite \\"amusing.\\" The author includes heaps of unnecessary comments, Brit jargon, meaningless yakkety-yak which distracts the reader.

I thought it would have all the great songs that were in the movie, but they were not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shelby Rules","review":"Hear Shelby Lynnes' new single here because you certainly won't be lucky enough to hear it on the radio since programmers avoid intelligent adult oriented pop. Lynne takes her new song in a more upbeat pop direction and hopefully it is a preview of whats in store for her follow up. Her voice is as mature and full bodied as Linda Ronstadt--wise and heart felt, hard to find these days huh? Other tracks take a backseat to Lynnes' dynamic opener but are worth a listen. Most notable is Gabrielle whose CD \\"Rise\\" was one of the most criminally overlooked of the past couple of years. This is a chance for the masses to get a taste of what they've been missing. Ignore the negative reviews here, this is as good a soundtrack compilation as any these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"leave Dina alone!","review":"Please stop dissing Dina Carroll. The woman is a wonderful singer and though Van's version of someone like you does rock, Ms. Carroll's rendition is beautiful and a very soulful and original take on a classic and in no way is it an inferior version. Check out her songs circa 1994 - Perfect year etc. A very talented woman who needs to be rediscovered by popular music lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the SCORE?","review":"Yeah, yeah, sure these are fun pop songs to listen to. But if you want to hear these songs, just go out and buy that artists cd with the song you like on it. What I want to know is, where is the original music that was writen specifically for this film by Patrick Doyle? I think it's a real slap in the face to one of the finest film composers in the industry to only give him one little track on the film soundtrack that he composed. Do not buy this cd if you like film music."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Joke","review":"I fail to understand how anyone could like this soundtrack that is not a soundtrack at all of Bridget Jones' Diary. I did not recognize have the tunes and Someone Like You was a disappointment since the nuance of the song was made by the orignal singer in the movie not Dina.

I would have given it zero stars but you did not have a spot for that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want 'someone like you' by Van Morrison?","review":"If you a frustrated w/not having Van Morrison singing 'someone like you' on this soundtrack, get this CD and also pick up the soundtrack to 'Someone like you' starring Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S AN OKAY CD","review":"To tell the truth, I completely disagree with the main review I just read on this CD. I agree with you lot who say that Geri's song is the best on the track! I am a huge Spice Girls fan as well as a Geri Halliwell fan and this song is definitely the only GOOD thing to happen on the album! The other songs are okay, Chaka Khan's and Rosey's are pretty good. Robbie William's are okay but I like his own songs on his albums much more than the ones on this CD. Yeah, Sheryl Crow's song stinks, it is way too much like all her other ones. Geri Halliwell rocks the soundtrack though, she's the reason I bought it and the only reason I put up with the rest of the songs chosen for the movie!!! GO GERI! GO SPICE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Packs a few punches","review":"This compilation perfectly complements ths essence of the movie: sassy, playful, girly, yet slightly less sophisticated than the original. The best songs are Shelby Lynne's punchy \\"Killin' Kind\\" and the bubble bath-like \\"Dreamsome\\". A few other notable songs that fit the movie are Dina Carroll's diva interpretation of \\"Someone Like You\\" and Diana Ross & Marvin Gaye's \\"Stop, Look, Listen (to your heart).\\" Despite a few sophomoric attempts from Robbie Williams and Geri Halliwell, this record is worthwhile for true Bridget fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Van Morrison","review":"Let's be honest about this, Morrison was featured twice in the film singing,\\"Someone Like You\\" and no where on the sound track.He was featured twice because his performance is great... which this sound track is not.. It does show up on an old John Candy film from a few years back.. good luck finding it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diary Tells All","review":"First time listening, it was just OK. Second time, I had to hearit again to be sure. Third time was charm--it's one of the bestsoundtracks recently--right up there with Runaway Bride andReturn to Me. Very pleased--it will remain in disc changer forquite some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect music for a girls night in","review":"As soon as the movie of Bridget Jones is released in England, I will definitely go and see it, but in the meantime all I can do is listen to this amazing music. With songs by Shelby Lynne and a beautiful slowie from Gabrielle this is a guaranteed feel-good album. And in addition towards the end are a couple of great dancy-karaoke type songs like 'It's raining men' and 'I'm every woman' so you can sing and dance like the best of them. The best thing about this album is it feels like a mix tape that your friends would make for you as it contains a combination of old favorites and brand new tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect to Be Disappointed","review":"Be careful, the CD is described as the MUSIC of the Movie, which in part it is. However, it is NOT the SOUNDTRACT of the MOvie. The Artists in the Movie were all original performers, however, this CD has done something I didn't know possible. The CD has substitute original artists (ie Van Morrison )doing their signature songs...it was a real disapointment, especially after seeing the movie, which I loved, and trying immediately to get the soundtract which I also loved, only to discover I ended up getting the Music From The Movie...which is like getting Tang when what you want is Orange Juice....WHY???"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy it!!","review":"I dont know whats going on here, but this is not, repeat NOT, the great collection of songs you would have expected if you have seen the movie. I certainly hope that one day the REAL soundtrack is released but until it is do not waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel good fun","review":"This is one of my favorite cd's. I really like the variety of music and the tempo variations between songs (fast, slow, etc...) Sheryl Crow has an amazing track called \\"Kiss That Girl\\" (you'll seriously want to crank up the volume on that one)and I absolutely loved \\"Out of Reach\\" by Gabrielle (hey we've all felt like that at some point). A great cd to jam to when you need a pick me up or when you have it out with your boyfriend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the SCORE?","review":"Yeah, yeah, sure these are fun pop songs to listen to.

Do you know how hard it is to get Van Morrison's version of \\"someone like you\\"? I feel that when you want to replace the artist of a song, they should at least be the same sex. (...). Any way, Respect and Ain't No Mountain High Enough are also sorely missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not indicative of the movie","review":"I was VERY disappointed in the CD. I left the movie and drove straight to the music store to buy this feel good CD. It did not have Me and Mrs Jones on, it did not have RESPECT on, two of the most important songs of the movie. The songs that were on, were not sung by the right artists. DON'T buy this CD, it is not representative of the movie - which is fabulous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Bad Soundtrack CD!!","review":"My wife brought the CD after we were so impressed with the movie. Unfortunately, nothing could be more disappointing than to purchase a CD that has tracks (filler music) that have absolutely nothing to do with the movie. Maybe they were having trouble with negotiating the use of the music from the movie for the soundtrack, but this should have been cleared up before doing so. By releasing this CD, this was a grave disservice to the consumer. Don't waste your time with this and buy the DVD or Video!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one!

BIG disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful compilation of music","review":"Although I did not recognize some of the artists, I loved the songs instantly! Most of them are mellow, and if they aren't mellow, they're fun and catchy.This soundtrack is a wonderful mix of breezy remakes and new clever recordings, and it's great to play during a casual get-together with friends. The songs evoke romance, humor, and self-confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here...","review":"Pretty cheesy formulaic soundtrack.I guess they couldn't put out all the songs that were featured in amovie on 1 cd, but at least it could be a little more more balanced.But this feels more like some \\"oldies-mellow-country\\" type radioprogramming. It's got no spice.What's happened to that cool funky Craig David's \\"I feel fantastic, bombastic ecstatic...\\" song featured in the \\"cooking blue string soup\\"dinner scene.

So why isn't the soundtrack fantastic too? Because some of the songs from the film weren't put on it and the original artists like Van Morisson weren't used either. Firstly, where is \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\" which appeared twice in the film? Also Aretha Franklin's \\"R.E.S.P.E.C.T\\" or The Artful Dodger's \\"Woman Trouble\\"? The fact is that some of the best songs aren't on this, however, there are still some great classics on here like \\"All By Myself\\". Its just a shame really because this could have been an amazing soundtrack to top off this year's funniest film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD did not do the movie justice!","review":"I saw the movie, loved it, loved the music and rushed out and just had to have the soundtrack. I got it home, turned it on and it was horrible. I loved the song, Someone Like You, but on the soundtrack it was done by Dina Carroll, not the man who did it in the movie. It was a letdown after hearing the great music in the movie to listening to this soundtrack. If anyone wants it...Don't buy it! Maybe you can copy somone else's! Wait for the movie and just buy that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ain't No Mountain High Enough?","review":"What's up with this CD? This is not what was in the film. Some of it is, some of it is now by other people and \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\" was played not once but twice in the film and it's nowhere on the CD. I think if you saw the movie and just went out and bought the CD, you'll be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I recently purchased the CD sound track to the motion picture Bridget Jones's Diary because one particular sound track stood out. The song was sung by Van Morrison in the film entitled \\"Someone Like You\\". However when I purchased the CD the song was sung by Dina Carroll. Needless to say I was truly disappointed and feel cheated. In my opinion a CD should be sold as it is recorded by the same artist in the movie or at least some mention should be made that a different singer has recorded the song on the CD giving an individual the option to purchase!!Disillusioned Purchaser.

After replacing it with a higher voltage rated capacitor of the same value the player worked flawlessly and had improved speed on reading discs. I got a feeling that this capacitor was put into place to purposely fail down the road to make the consumer buy a new one.... well i'm not going to be one of them.

I have been using component output from my JWIN player, so my cable has to be good. I was able to get signal from the RCA output.

Its really helped me back off and realize that trying to control a teen can make them crazy. But to give them the room and let them hopefully come to the right decision will help them to become a more responsible adult. To let them fall on their own faces sometimes also makes for a learning experience that may make more of an impression than if their parents are always saving them.

I find it hard to believe the same author that penned the remarkable, \\"Thorn Birds\\", also wrote this tedious and dreary novel. Although the Historical content of \\"The Touch\\" is interesting (although rather long winded) and seems accurate, the character development is flawed. None of the characters are very likable, and all seem rather inconsistent. The author gives us no real reason to understand why they do the things they do. In fact, many of the characters and their personalities are just plain unbelievable. I don't think the characters fit very well into the time period that Mrs. Mccullough has written about. I found this book very unsatisfying, and it was a real trial to finish it. Without giving anything away, the ending was very disappointing, and did not seem in character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I love The Thorn Birds and have re-read it many times, but this book is nothing like it.

Ms. McCullough tells the story of sixteen year old Elizabeth Drummond, a young girl who finds herself marrying Alexender Kinross, a man that she barely knows.

One of the characters relationship to Morgan is mentioned in passing, but it reallly has nothing to do with this silly plot. This is more unbelievable soap opera stuff than good novel writing. Don't waste your money or your time. She also gets bogged down in technical stuff about mining and inventions that can be skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!","review":"I picked up this book in Nice hoping it would get me through the last week of my vacation. But no, only 2 days! I think the author's name was listed incorrectly on the front of the book. It should have read Danielle Steele instead of Colleen McCullough. Being a huge fan of Thorn Birds, this novel was thoroughly disappointing. Where the main character in Thorn Birds grew up and learned a thing or two along the way, the main character in The Touch just seemed to ride the tide of the other character's opinions. Overall, I think she gave women a bad rep!

At last, a new novel by a truly gifted writer who has written some wonderful, entertaining books. Unfortunately, The Touch is not among them.Predictable, trite, boring and unbelievable - a futile attempt to recapture the wonder, romance and majesty of The Thornbirds. And it fails on all counts. Reads more like Barbara Cartland than what we have come to expect from one of our major storytellers (all it lacks is Fabio on the cover).Do yourself a favor: if you haven't read Ms. McCullough's earlier works, choose one of them. Tim, An Indecent Obsession, The Ladies of Missalonghi - gripping stories well told. Or re-read The Thornbirds, it's still the best.The lady can write; we all know that.

It was very tough to finish it, I kept hoping for some clever or surprising development, but it was a disappointment right to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"As an avid fan of THE THORN BIRDS, I guess I was hoping for too much when I purchased and read this novel. All I can say is that it was a disappointment. There was far too much detail about steam engines and gold mining, and not nearly enough detail about interpersonal relationships. Some parts of the book were quite unbelievable, such as Alex traveling all over the world (literally)as a very young man in the 1800's. I am not at all sure that is realistic. Also, the ending was horribly predictable and again, unrealistic. This could have been SO much better. I've decided to give up on Ms. McCullough's novels in the future...

Even from the name \\"antioxidant\\" green tea, I wouldn't normally expect such a fruit-flavored beverage. Frustrating. Having said that, I do enjoy Celestial Seasonings Authentic Green Tea as one of the most drinkable low-priced greens, and I also appreciate their eco-friendly packaging.

Not so great packaging though","review":"I love the taste of this tea. It's very smooth and not bitter as another reviewer stated. Very mellow and soothing.My only gripe is the packaging. With all other tea I've purchased in 20 count boxes, the bags came individually wrapped in metallic packages. These bags are loose in the box without any wrappers. They're all hooked together like sausage links, and as stated in the description they have no strings. So you have to fish them out of your tea cup with a spoon.If they were individually wrapped and had strings, they'd be 5 star IMO. And if you use Amazon's \\"suscribe and save\\", not only will this be cheaper, but shipping will always be free. And you can cancel at any time. I love this feature!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is for the tea with the elephant on the box","review":"I prefer the green tea with the dragon on the box, not the elephant. The tea with the dragon tastes more like traditional green tea than the elephant one. The green tea with the elephant had some extra ingredients that put the flavor off to me...I believe it was lemon or orange in the ingredients. It made the tea have a mildly citrus feel, but not in a refreshing way I would have liked. It has been over a year and I have not finished the box. If you are wanting a more traditional flavored green tea, get the green tea with the dragon on it. The flavor is much better with a stronger roasted taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd sure like to read it sometime.","review":"I ordered and paid for the book (Midnight Man by Steven Laws) and was sent the wrong book.The seller then said that they would refund the money but did not have the book to send.Sure be nice to get what I ordered.JY"},{"rating":"2","title":"simple entertainment","review":"Ah, the old viewmaster that I use to play with back in the 60's.

It'd be hard to put a description on it, but I think it can be summed up with a few words: cold, depressing, atmospheric and funereal.Who could not feel a slight movement towards the thoughts and inner-most and deepest feelings of suicide after listening to this?The album retains a very sinister, decrepit and ashy quality - which I think is really pronounced at its karma-point on songs like: \\"Sigils Made of Flesh and Trees,\\" \\"Blood From the Roots of the Forest, Part 1,\\" and \\"The Awakening to the Unknown Perception of Evil.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb career retrospective of a unique talent...","review":"Bill's gravelly voice takes some getting used to, but it is definitely worth the effort. Once you \\"get him\\" his clever and powerful songs, mostly about life's troubled ordinary folks, will hold your interest through many hearings. He has been recording about 20 years, and these 20 tracks are indeed among his best efforts. I've owned three of the CD's, and love two of them. This collection is a fine introduction...some sad songs, some funny ones, but all well done. If you think you really like singer-songwriters, give Bill a chance. Listen at this three times before deciding you don't like him. I'm betting his writing talent will hook you first, and as you listen, you will realize this fellow is a fine musician. I hated his voice when I first heard it, by by the fourth song I was mellowing, and by the second listening to that disc, I was a fan.

This music comes from the very tradicional verve of east european classical music but offers a truly new view of it. No folclore is found in it, no political stance, no revolutionary insight view of society or people. This music addresses the inner core of all human beings unable to takle with the questions of life. Those without answers.

There is no analysis, not really much argument at all. Simply repeating that the Nazis were ruthless, sometimes using that word six times on one page, is not an argument. Nor is it news.

This is an excellent description of one way of accessing ones deeper self.

(I must confess that I'm starting to feel that the mood of the Potter books is becoming extremely dark) My daughter was given Night Biters by her teacher as a reward, and she couldn't put it down. The notion of skateboarding vampires terrorizing a city completely captured her fascination. Wanting to know what the so intrigued her I read it and realized what makes this book so unique is that it celebrates the diversity of the urban landscape.

There are no \\"Doctor Doctor\\", \\"Lights Out\\" or \\"Natural Thing\\" like riffs to be found. The album does not pick up any steam until track five.You know Schenker has it in him because \\"Beware Of Scorpions\\" kicks...; not here. This is really a Mogg-Way album with Michael Schenker taking a few guest solos. Michael is UFO and there is no such thing as UFO without him.I could go on, but there is really nothing here to justify buying this disc.

Despite all his best intentions the critics lambasted his efforts as preachy (which indeed it is somewhat) and weak (which it is certainly not) A much more spare sound to his previous piece this album contains some of his finest songs, with the highlights being the beautiful restrained \\"be here now\\" \\"the light that changed the world\\" and the lovely closer \\"that is all\\" After a few listens it has to be admitted that this is indeed a really good album.My only quibble is that this cries out for a remastering reissue, and they could add the \\"B\\" sides \\"deep blue\\" and \\"miss O'Dell\\" so come on EMI - get to it!phil from Cambridge Canada"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally remastered, but...","review":"I've waited a long time for this remastered \\"deluxe\\" edition. It looks very nice, but the sound is, sadly, not a big improvement over the original vinyl, particularly on the title track. This is still one of George's best albums; he was still on a post-Beatles roll. The songwriting is thinner than ATMP, it is definitley preachy (but so was ATMP), but the production has a straight-forward I find refreshing after the ATMP extravaganza. It's just too bad that it was not spectaclularly remastered, as I thought the Dark Horse titles were. Considering the great job on the Lennon remasters as well, I guess I was spoiled. It's nice to have this, I just wish they really would have done it justice, as I wish they would do with the Beatles' material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living In The Material World","review":"This is a good set to have if nothing more than to follow George's transition from the Beatle's breakup to Brainwashed.

The album itself wasn't as good as the former, but did have good songs. It has the grand arrangements of ALL THINGS MUST PASS and George's usual musical talents, but the songs aren't as memorable. The album starts on a high note with hit single \\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)\\" which sets the mood for the entire album. Highlights include George's version of John Lennon's \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" called \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues,\\" the mellow \\"Be Here Now,\\" George's last expirament with Hindu music, the majestic \\"Try Some Buy Some,\\" which was co-produced by Phil Spector, and the sweeping \\"The Light That Has Lighted The World.\\" Otherwise, songs like \\"Who Can See It\\" suffer from over-production, and the lyrics are extremely preachy. Overall, this disc is enjoyable and worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one","review":"This album has long stood in the shadow of the magnificent \\"All things Must Pass,\\" but it is a very sensitive, spiritual, and well-produced collection, the best Harrison would assemble for years to come. \\"Give Me Love\\" is a classic, and the textured, glowing sounds throughout the album keep it flowing like a river."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not The Documentary","review":"I bought this believing it was the Scorsese directed documentary.

Where this set is not quite up to the standards of his debut effort, it is still a strong effort. On both A.T.M.P. and Living In The Material World, George took the time to showcase his strong musicianship as well as his fine songwriting abilities. Many of the same musicians back him up on both. Billy Preston, Nick Hopkins, Klaus Voorman, Jim Keltner, Alan White and Ringo all make their presence felt. A highlight would be Sue Me, Sue You Blues which sounds like it could have come from the Let It Be sessions. It's a shame he got lazy as a musician as later efforts became less and less interesting. The only flaw to be found here would be with his occassional lyrical preoccupation with Hare Krishna beliefs.

This album reflects his \\"Krishna\\" philosophy better than any other he had previously released, and he praised the movement just at a time when the American arm of the movement was disintegrating into madness (see \\"Monkey on a Stick: Murder, Madness, and the Hare Krishnas\\" by John Hubner and Lindsey Gruson). George does speak to John and Paul in the title track in a plea to turn from crass commercialism. The album is actually pretty good, although George sounds rather horse throughout. It is odd at times only because he is speaking from the viewpoint of the far-east, which is often more than foreign to western ears. However, that \`foreignness' is also one of the interesting aspects of the album. Four Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living Still....","review":"This album was bought for me when I was 10 years old on vinyl and it's always been one of my favorites. It doesn't have a lot of the \\"wall of sound\\" schlock that the Phil Spector produced All Things Must Pass contains and it seems more authentically George. Another observation is that while the never ending court travails influenced one or two tracks on this album, George wasn't yet overwhelmed by the My Sweet Lord case which seemed to dominate some of his later music.

Sounds like a Tarentino/Rodriguez combonation doesn't it? The first half of this plays like an average crim film with an average plot. Nothing sensational aside from the unusual cast and some great Tarentino dialogue. All of a sudden when they go to this bar (I don't think I can print the name) to hide out and out of nowhere the place starts crawling with lots of vampires turning the crime film into a horror film with all the necessary gore to go with it. This film is quite an exercise and is guarenteed cult status in the future. Check it out if you haven't already. George Cloony, Harvey Kietel, and Tarentino light up the screen and Rodriguez directs Tarentino's script with brilliance. The film is a ton of fun and there is some great Southern blues/rock music in it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever You Do, Don't Take This Movie Seriously","review":"I loved this movie! Yes, it was mindless, dumb, special effects were cheesily gory and the acting was off and on...but hey, I was thoroughly entertained! Think of this as a Zucker Brothers (Airplane!) version of a vampire movie. Do NOT take it seriously...just turn up the volume and enjoy the campiness! It's hilarious and action-packed. The only drawback was a lame attempt at character profiles. Yes, the two main brothers are psycho criminals but when we try to put any spin on their relationship and how totally screwed up one of them really is it tries to be serious and lags the movie's true spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but I still love it!","review":"From Dusk to Dawn is well acted and directed but it's occasionly dumb too. I mean when the vampire band say \\"F this place\\" and just blow up has to be one of the dumbest things I seen in a movie. The movie still makes for an entertaining blood bath though. The performances by Harvey Keitel and George Clooney help make the movie watchable as well. Although the movie starts off like a Pulp Fiction style film in the first half it becomes Evil Dead with vampires in the second half. I mean George Clooney is pretty much like Ash (Evil Dead) and the vampires seem more like the demons in the Evil Dead movies than vampires. Although the script is all over the place Robert Rodriguez still manages to make it sexy and fun and it's still one of his better films."},{"rating":"2","title":"dusk to dawn","review":"takes a while to get going into action and when it does its gore and guts and vampires all over the place"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic Tarantino style film with two bank robber & more.","review":"One of the best films for the tough guy and heavy action.

Its for truck drivers and bikers only, but later on they find out those aren't the only people there. The club owner and workers all turn out to be vampires and start killing everyone.

There are three things that redeem this film from the trash heap of total worthlessness. Harvey Keitel, even in a trashy enterprise like this, delivers a decent performance as a preacher who is grappling with his faith. Even in junk like this Keitel didn't succumb to the urge to just phone it in. Cheech Marin has an amusing bit as the strip club's barker. Lastly, Salma Hayek's snake-dance. Thank God for chapter search, otherwise, you would have to sit through the rest of this dreck to get to the good parts. On a final note, Quentin Tarantino delivers one of the worst acting performances known to man. This is no reflection on the sicko character that he plays, it's just unadulterated bad acting. Tarantino is a great director but he is no actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Cinematography, Shame About The Script","review":"The film looks good. That cannot be denied. It looks stylish and is directed with flair. Unfortunately, the script plays out like it's the product of an immature adolecent personality who needs to get out more and mix with other kids his own age. The dialogue is just cringeworthy.One cannot help but think that someone indulged Tarantino based on previous successes in funding this project - indulged him to the point of allowing him to act in it - and made a big boob on all counts.I scare easy but this vampire horror movie with all its (much trumpeted) blood and guts didn't produce a single goosebump. It was like watching a cartoon.Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salma Hayek is about the only thing worth watching in movie","review":"I thought this movie could have been much better. It started out pretty good with George Clooney adding to another overly voilet crime/drama movie. The second half of the movie could have been interesting too but turned gruesome without any reason other than to make the viewer be bombarded with scene after scene of gore. Thank goodness for Salma's brief inclusion in an overwise dismal last hour of pure violence and little to nada storyline. She is beautiful!

Quentin decided that he wanted to write and act in a film, and he shows he can't act for &%$%&. He is really bad here.

Just plain awful and tacky--rent the movie instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you loved From Dusk Till Dawn....","review":"Great behind the scenes stuff from From Dusk Till Dawn, but so much more! Some really interesting information about movie making and the politics that surround it. Really get to see these actors/directors/film makers in their element, and what it really takes to make a film like this. Gave me a new appreciation for this movie and for film making in general. Definately worth watching!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted film from masterminds Tarentino and Rodriguez...","review":"The first half of this hardcore action flick has George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino hijacking a mobile home to get across the border into Mexico. The second half is our heroes fighting off vampires in a strip club. The two don't come together very well, but both halves are executed perfectly with a cutting edge and some very cool dialogue. This film is all about blood, violence, and gore mixed with some T&A, making this a young man's dream movie. Constantly exciting and always taut, \\"From Dusk till Dawn\\" is the perfect movie for parties or just hangin out with the guys. The special effects are cool, the direction is slick and the acting is [excellent]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do \\"Dawn\\"","review":"Miserable Blu Ray release of a great movie. The picture is cropped from its original aspect ratio, the sound is sub-par, and the picture quality is all over the map. There are moments when the picture is stellar, especially during the beginning moments of the film in the outdoors. Colors pop and the picture is crisp and clear, but then it will suddenly change to something comparable to VHS.Extras? Forget it! Nothing...zero...zilch.It's a shame that one of Miramax's best titles wound up in the hands of this company, who produced such a horribly shoddy transfer of this film. Skip it and stick with your DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"THere's not much I can say here that others haven't. This really is a classic vampire movie, with Tarantino's own touch, you can tell by the camerawork and what have you. Some people don't like that, but personally I think it is a good film nonetheless, and worth checking out whether you're a Tarantino or vampire fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like this.","review":"I feel that this is one of those films that I feel is a part of the contemporary polarization. Vampires are either romantic teenagers or nearly mindless killing machines. It's one extreme or the other. No one remembers balance anymore. I miss characters like Dracula who could be charming and occasionally sympathetic but still able to be predatory and vicious. Now that is an interesting vampire. I miss vampires like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!","review":"This movie was insultinly bad. It went from a very involved crime story, which was potentially very good, to several terrible, terrible action sequences following one another. How could anyone like this movie? How did they get such great actors to be in such a discustingly bad and rediculus movie? Bottom line: The director should be put in jail for steeling thousands of people's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"We have an absolutely great premise, A group of people thrown together trying to survive an attack from vampires. Hackneyed sure, but a great director and a good script write could make it something very interesting. Alas while some people seem to think Quentin Tarantino is the second coming of Hitchcock, but this movie does nothing to help anyone think this is the case. The movie is just bad. Bad directing, bad writing, just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Hack To Yawn","review":"If you took Quentin Tarantino's name off this movie (you can leave his B-movie acting though) and Robert Rodriguez's name off, then every four- and five-star rating would disappear faster than George Clooney's chance of playing Batman again. Someone might want to explain to the filmmakers the proper way a vampire movie should \\"suck.\\"And this ain't it.A night from dusk until dawn in a bordertown Mexican dive bar would be more enjoyable and entertaining than the hour and a half I sat through this movie.The plot is so thin and derivative and repetitious that the theory could be put forth that the only reason this movie was made was so Tarantino could have Salma Hayek's toes in his mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good scenes at the end but mostly lame.","review":"I thought this movie was going to rock. Sadly, it did not rock. The only good scenes were with Cheech. The few scenes he was in were hilarious.The action and violence did not start until the movie was more than half over.Basically Clooney and his gang of hostages barge in on a very festive mexican stip joint. Later they find out it is run by a psycho array of vampires. Towards the end of the film they fight off a hundred vampires that come out of nowhere.This movie had a pretty simple plot and it wasn't too interesting either.Some of the vampires looked scary while others looked corny.Overall I was disappointed.My favorite Tarantino movie is Kill Bill 2.Favorite vampire movies are Interview with the vampire, Blade 2, and Dracula."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Dusk To Yawn","review":"From Dusk Till Dawn is an awful movie. It is really bad. It's a shame. It had a lot of great, talented people in it and a promising premise. It completely went out of control. It was too much!. It was too much to the point where you lose hold of it and completely lose interest immediatley. An awful, awful waste of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regret having paid to see this","review":"Some horror films tray to present a moral message or political opinion. This film presents a great way to waste your money. I was looking for the action sequences claimed to be soo great or anything to justify entertainment. Well, it was nice to see a few of my favorite actors walk and talk.You are tossed into this film and will try to see if the story is going anywhere. It isn't. It's just suggestive summertime mindless celluloid fodder. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have done without it","review":"I love vampire movies, I have no problems with blood and gore and can even do without a distinct story line if the movie is at least nice to watch. This one however I could have done without. If you are like me and romanticise vampires, don't watch this one. If you feel you must see it, rent it, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT movie!","review":"This is a great movie! Tarantino has really succeed again. Quentin and Clooney plays 2 kriminals escaping trough the US from the police. The takes a family hostage (Keitel, Lewis) to help them over the borfer to Mexico. In Mexico they stays at a bar over the night. But it's going to be one hell of a night, when they get attacked by vampires.Another GREAT movie from the master."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie so much kicks ass!","review":"This is the best movie to date from rodriguez, and a new style for tarantino.These guys should team up more often and maybe do some more vampire flicks or even a goth films, theres not enough films about goth, anyone else out there agree....i knew you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy","review":"This is a cheesy movie though and though. It is about two brothers who, when escaping the police, run into vampires. Completly chessy. If you like cheesy movies and lots of blood, you will love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie on UMD","review":"Great movie on UMD. I was very happy to add this to my collection of movies on UMD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story, but the sound quality is not so good.","review":"It's a great example of Archie and Wolfe, but the audio is fuzzy. There's a buzzing quality each time an \\"s\\" is pronounced. Other than that, you can't beat it. I highly recommend the story, but perhaps the print version would be more fun, since the sound is a little off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still a fan of series","review":"I agree that this installment is not as enjoyable as others in the series. The two plot lines never seem to gel. However it did not stop me from continuing on with the series. If you enjoyed the novels preceding this one I encourage you to read on. Some of the more recent installments have better plot lines to keep the reader interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Imperfect Past","review":"The Rutledge mysteries are complex, absorbing. The mother-son team creates a seamless product that makes me think. It's refreshing to disappear into an imperfect past every once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long Shadow","review":"Loved it! So far, have enjoyed all books in Ian Rutledge series. Will continue to purchase Charles Todd books. Discovered writer(s) only recently so doing catch-up reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Inspector Ian Rutledge and Hamish, the voice in his head, are back and in good form. A warning that when you read this series, you need to concentrate. It is easy to lose track when are drawn away by the real world.The plot sends Rutledge away from London to a small town to discover who used a bow and arrow to injury the local policeman. Another line of the story deals with someone who is quietly pursuing Rutledge to perhaps kill him.Rutledge's superior in London may or may not be involved in something illegal and a woman is introduced who seems to understand Rutledge.Will Rutledge ever be able to live a normal life? It may never happen because he lives with a ghost. He seems to have adjusted to his ghostly companion, but will that put an end to any relationships he might have developed?Charles Todd's Ian Rutledge novels are all well written and interesting. They paint a picture of England just after WWI, a period I find intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Long Shadow\\" by Charles Todd","review":"This is another in a series of stories involving the detecting skills of Scotland Yard's Ian Rutledge. Rutledge's major handicap is the auditory hallucinations from a Scots soldier whom Rutledge had ordered shot for cowardice. Basically there are 2 mysteries going on. One is a personal problem for Rutledge of being stalked and the other is solving what turns out to be a serial murder case. The solution to the second problem comes to the reader early and the solution to the first problem is disappointing. On a personal note, there is now a woman who is entering Rutledge's private life. It was entertaining, but not the strongest of the Ian Rutledge stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long Shadow","review":"Charles Todd's Inspector Rutledge series gets better with every book. This series is one of the few I still buy in hardback, I just can't wait for the paperback to come out. These books would make an excellent PBS series. The characters are so compelling, so complex and so believable -- now who would be perfect for the lead role?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long Shadow","review":"As usual, Charles Todd challenges the reader to better understand Inspector Ian Rutledge and the voice in the back of his head and the plot and its idiosyncracies. In this book there is a sniper determined to kill Inspector Rutledge and a crime to solve. Other crimes--or possible crimes--are revealed and the book hooks you.Inspector Rutledge is, as always, a compelling person which the reader hopes will eventually find some sort of peace in his life, but perhaps the intriguing part of his character is that this peace is not likely to happen anytime soon.I make sure I don't have anything else to do for a couple of days when I buy Charles Todd's books because they tend to suck you in and keep you until the book is finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"Pages were folded over cover was ripped off.

The movie focuses on a newlywed couple with plans of having babies and going off to Portugal to live happily ever after. WRONG!No sooner than our couple arrives at their honeymoon site than the hubby is bitten by a zombie who comes out of the ocean? (Where in the world did he come from?). Anyway, the hubby dies for ten minutes but miraculously recovers---with a fiendish appetite.The movie tries for some dark humor, but the pace is so slow and the characters reaction so unbelievable, that the laughs are more unintentional I think than written. The cast is pretty bad, although Tracy Coogan as the wife has a certain Diane Laneish coquettishness and toughness that almost makes her convincing. Probably the first zombie love story, it tries hard but ultimately achieves very little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woof","review":"I was told by a friend that this was a really, really, really, really bad movie.I bought it because it was cheap and I wanted to see just what his idea of areally, really, really, really bad movie was.OK - now I know. The plot was lame and hard to follow, the acting was lousy and there wasn't any gratuitious nudity to at least give you a reason to watch it.Save your money and time and don't bother with this one, unless of course you are really zonked on marijuana. That might make this movie interesting! Confusing, especially loaded, but interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a love story with a Zombie that I can relate to!","review":"Buy this DVD. This film has zombies but contains more heart and soul about relationships than most romantic comedies! Furthermore, we get to see the hearts and souls being eaten!

This woman KNOWS he is killing strangers and eating them and then KNOWS he started killing friends. But, only when he starts after HER does her love for him desert her. Any normal woman would have left her husband when his skin started rotting and/or he ate his first victim."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD IDEA, BUT POORLY EXECUTED!","review":"I know I'm going to get it for this one, but this movie is pretty bad. While I like the premise, the film is too tame to be scary, played too straight to be funny and too silly to care about the characters! There I said it!....in short this movie is a c r a p - fest! If the makers of this film had just picked a path and stayed on it, this would be a much better film.I won't even touch on the plot holes as the film is too absurd to be taken, for anything other than someone's fantasy nightmare! It plays like an episode of 'Tales From The Dark Side'(not one of the better ones). On the plus side the low budget has good acting and FX. If you must see it, watch it on cable, it's not for everyone's taste ....certainly not mine.......and yes, I do get the film. OK, I'm bracing myself...........!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Away From This!!!","review":"This movie was horrible flat-out. And I watch alot of low budget horror and zombie movies.

Don't waist your money or time. I know most people's expectations will be low, picking up a DVD with the title ZOMBIE HONEYMOON on the cover. However this film is worse then you can imagine. Horid acting, insipid plot (stolen from other films), and humor that fails on all levels. Complete trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"a zombie movie so bad","review":"Seen a good zombie movie? Seen a bad zombie movie? Seen a zombie movie so bad that it needs to be wiped of the face of the planet? Well, this movie is just that. Equal parts poor acting, bad story telling. Childish cinematography and poor framing also bring the film down. It's no Shaun of the Dead, or for that matter your little brother's home made zombie video. Zombie Honeymoon is NOTHING the title claims it is, and more. Zombie Honeymoon never comes fully to life. There are too many long, overly monotonous scenes that wind up going nowhere; it seems that Gebroe may have been a little too close to, or in love with, his material. Definitely NOT worth a look for genre fans, or anyone else for that matter. Film fails as a comedy, fails as a horror film, fails as a drama. In other words, it does a little bit of everything, and fails at everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much narcissism","review":"As an asian american, I cannot tolerate the excessive narcissism in the video. Although the video tries to look weird and revolutionary, it turns out to be embarrassing. Among the episodes, only the last one is making sense, but its story is so plain and expected. I expected this video to be more creative, but I am disappointed. There are some horror elements in the video, which can be fun, but they are not fully explored. Not cool enough, to sum up.

Great price and free shipping on Amazon made these even more attractive.

Seems to me if the guy spent so many years making the DVD, he should have had more than enough without having to reuse the same scenery twide.
