I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline).

The track Helicopter has a brooding intensity that grabs me without having the tired nihilistic flair that characterizes so much new music. I always look for listenability in an album, followed by the ability to stand up to repeated listening. For example, My Bloody Valentine's \\"Loveless\\" has both qualities in spades and constitutes an end point on this kind of scale (with, say, anything by Peter Frampton occupying the other end). This album rates about an 8 as far as I'm concerned.

I found myself not laughing as much. I'm not sure why exactly, but I at least find the censored version to be more entertaining. Hearing the bleeps instead of the words makes me laugh more for some reason. For making uncensored the only option, I had to take away a star, which is a sad thing for me.Just a little more explanation: It would have been nice if there were a way to have some sort of setting to turn the bleeps on or off, that way those who prefer it uncensored have it and those who prefer it censored have it as well. I can't imagine it would be THAT hard.That should not stop you from enjoying this though. For any Robot Chicken fan, this is really great to have.

RB's creators have given us a brilliant variation on the art of social as well as political satire. The flight-suited George Bush doll says it all.

If you only need the wireless it is good although switching between ports can take a long time.Amazon did a fantastic job, I contacted them and they sent me a brand new unit, the only problem is that both units have the same problem.

No problems using a USB keyboard and wireless USB mouse (Microsoft).Only \\"issue\\" I could find is that all 4 sides have cables coming out of them. So you can't really put it on the desk because it doesn't stay well and lacks a clean look. Could have worked with the design a bit more, but again, not a big deal, I'm nitpicking. It's a good product and took no time to setup."},{"rating":"1","title":"usb ports are faulty, and issue with screen resolution detection","review":"Like others, I too experienced the USB ports going bad after a few months. The unit isn't very useful if I have to switch the keyboard/mouse dongle from machine to machine, rather than use the KVM switch, but that's my temporary workaround until I find a better KVM switch. Another issue is the screen resolution on the shared monitor gets messed up when switching between the 2 machines, I'd say about 10% of the time. I would have to switch back and forth a few times until it fixed itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work With Windows 8","review":"Worked for a short time until I upgraded to Windows 8...

Does exactly what it says... switches smoothly between computers. With Windows, switching is a bit slow because it takes a couple of seconds for Windows to recognize the usb devices each time. It's a lot faster with my Mac... switching is almost instant.My only complaint is the physical design. When connected to 4 computers, the cables are sticking out all four sides. This makes this huge glob of cables, and makes it almost impossible to set on my desk. It would have been nice if all the cables plugged into one side. For this reason, it gets 4 of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for the price","review":"First off, this is probably one of the cheapest 4-Port USB KVM switches out there so you cannot expect the same performance of one that is 4 times the price. It comes with all the cables you need. In general, it works - I have 3 Windows XP PCs attached to this with a USB Keyboard and USB Mouse. The hotkey works quickly and for the most part it switches within 3 seconds without any problems. Rarely, the switch stops working and I have to unplug all the connections and reattatch which is annoying. I do not use speakers on my PCs so I cannot speak to the audio switcing. I agree with other reviews that the design is stupid because all the cables come out of the 4 sides making it a spider mess of cables. Other than that, it's a good budget KVM."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRENDnet 2 Port KVM switch","review":"It was easy to set up my two computers using the switch butit is shaky at times and if I don't set the switch to computer \\"1\\" before booting up the computer the switch does recognize the computer.

This is when the mouse was switching with no problem. By the way, I just found out about the software KVM. If you have a home/office network you could use either Synergy or Input Director as a KVM!

So was I getting stereo? Amazingly they have a 24/7 365 day support line. It only took 30 seconds for the support person to tell me that the green was the stereo plug that I could plug into my laptop's ear phone jack and that the pink was just a stereo mic plug that I could use if I wanted that functionality.Ed Mincher"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work well with docking stations...","review":"... according to customer service, and no where is this documented. works great with XP desktop and lenovo laptop but when laptop is in the docking station windows needs to boot up to the sign on screen before it switches over which means hibernation on lid closing has to be disabled. Windows 7 (which is otherwise GREAT, BTW) desktop is also flaky. once it's running and hibernates, it comes up fine but when system is shut down it will not come up on the switch, I have to move the cables. which of course, defeats the purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with Wireless Keyboard & Mouse","review":"Thanks all of you who wrote comment about this KVM.This is my first KVM switch and connected to my two PCs last night.Worked excellent so far.

When I bought my new Windows 7 computer, it had only USB ports & lacked the PS2 ports. I tried using PS2 to USB converters by they failed to work properly. So I decided to go with this unit, since it had the additional audio switching capablity that my old unit lacked.

Small and efficient, this unit runs off USB power from each source. The only gripe is that, due to this KVM switchbox's small size, the cables plug in on all four edges of the unit.In the back: 2 VGA cables (going to the sources)On the left: 1 VGA running to the monitorOn the right: 2 USB -> sound cables (going to the sources)On the front: 1 3.5mm sound cable running to the speakers.I don't have the two USB ports in the front (for switched keyboard/mouse) in use yet, but I can imagine it would be quite a mess of cables.Despite not being very elegant, it performs the function it is required to perform: switching VGA + sound between two sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly as good as advertised...","review":"This thing is working as advertised. Signal is strong, audio sounds good, regardless of the computer the signal is coming from.Two reasons why I'm giving it 4 stars vs. 5. One, as another reviewer noted, this thing when all plugged in, literally has wires coming in from all sides. So, it's kind of a challenge to place.Second, the audio cords are shoooort. I had to completely reorganize my workstations under the desk (2 pcs, two monitors, wacom cintiq, wireless router, etc. It was a bit painful) to get all of the wires to reach properly. Buuut, now that everything is organized, I'm really happy with the results.But yeah. Monitor cords about 4 feet, audio cords about three or less.However, outside of that, I would recommend with vigor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Initially...........","review":"Out of the box the product seemed a little cheap. However, I connected it with ease and the product worked fine. Over the past 3 months, the switch began to malfunction.The hotkey function failed and I had to unplug and re-plug the cables to re-set the unit. The fix worked. I had to do the same a few weeks later on the other switch I bought. Now the keyboards and mouse (on both switches) become non responsive following switching, requiring unplugging and re-plugging of the USB cables.Pay a little more and get quality.. I purchased the IO-Gear 4 port switch for another set of workstations and it switches smoothly and am, after 4 weeks, still very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything but Automatic switching!","review":"This switch is unable to handle the USB keyboard switching at all. When turning on either of the two computers, the USB keyboard codes are scrambled. The only way I've found to resolve this is to unplug the keyboard from the TK-209, wait about 10 seconds, and then re-insert the keyboard's USB connector into the TK-209. That works about 80% of the time, but the other 20% requires a 2nd attempt. USB keyboards are cheap, so I gave up and connected a 2nd one, so each computer has it's own dedicated keyboard. I would not have bought this product if I had known such a problem existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after 6 months","review":"Worked pretty well until today.

If you need a switch and can handle the cables, it will do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"Great product!Here is an FYI that may help someone else.The initial install worked great but when I rebooted my second computer the system repeatedly hung at reboot. After some investigation I found that the hangup was occurring during the POST process of the BIOS boot. The problem seems to be related to keyboard output during BIOS boot.

Additionally and more seriously, the video resolution on some Windows 7 systems will change if the system is not the active client on the KVM, particularly if a reboot occurs while the client is not selected on the KVM.On the positive side, video signal quality is good at 1920x1080 @ 60Hz. Keyboard and mouse functionality has never dropped on an active client, which occurs often with certain IOGear KVMs. Audio support is solid.For very basic uses, the TRENDnet KVM's flaws are annoying but generally acceptable considering its relatively low price. However, IOGear products only slightly more expensive do not suffer from the same drawbacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 port switcher","review":"Worked okay but I found that my system supported HDMI ports.

There were three things that bothered me slightly. First, the cords could be a little longer. I have the switch on the top of my desk going straight down to my desktop. But the cord doesn't let me pull out the desktop very far to get to the back panel. Second, the device is too light compared to the cords, so it easily flies all over the place and falls behind the desk. Definitely need some velcro to hold it down. Third, it only has 2 usb inputs. So if you want to sure printer, external drive, etc. you need to attach a usb hub (which does work)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great kvm switch","review":"Product being used on two Dell Vista machines.

Both Windows XP Pro and Windows 7 (rebuild) recognized and installed drivers. Using a corded Logitech keyboard and wireless Logitech mouse and no problems at all. I unfortunately do not have a scroll lock key on the keyboard so I have to use the buttons on the Trendnet device and there is a bit of lag when switching (about 3 seconds) but no big deal.

However, that computer can only detect the monitor when any of the other 3 ports are selected on the KVM.Don't buy this item. I've had better luck with Belkin hardware.Look for a unit that will emulate the monitor to the ports that are not currently selected so that you can be working on one PC while booting another. Otherwise you have to set the KVM to the port of the booting computer so that the hardware will be detected. Life is too short to twiddle your thumbs waiting for each PC on the KVM to boot in sequence.

I bought this to hook up two laptops to one monitor, keyboard, mouse and external speakers. Straightforward, simple to setup. One laptop is on XP the other on Vista. The device only supports hard-wired keyboards and mice, so I had to abandon my favorite wireless MS mouse in favor of a wired on - not that big a deal. It has buttons on the device where you can switch between the two computers, but I accidently discovered that by hitting the 'num lock' key twice, quickly that this switched them - very convenient.

The one desktop with a real video card works fine, the other desktop using onboard video control from Intel forgets it's settings everytime I shut it off. The laptops, one an Acer mini and the other a new one running Windows 7 also with an Intel video controller, both take about five minutes to reconfigure each time I boot them up. I've downloaded the latest drivers and utilities from Intel and Acer but no joy. I've had a couple of iogear two ports and they both worked great.

They are things I have learned to work around but would rather not. I have the KVM plugged into two PCs. The first is a desktop PC running Windows XP. The 2nd is a laptop running Linux.1) when the active PC is turned off the KVM has no power, there is no way to switch to the PC with power. The keyboard and mouse should stay powered up and allow switching to the other PC like every other KVM I have ever used. It doesn't.2) When switching I use the keyboard shortcut because the KVM is behind my desk. I hit scroll-lock multiple times in Linux and eventually figured out that I have to hit the key combination scl-lck scl-lck num-lck num-lck before it will switch back to the windows PC. From windows to Linux it works fine with scl-lck scl-lck.I have almost tired of this product.

For more specific, practical information I recommend augmenting this title with Ozawa's \\"Kendo: the Definitive Guide\\" which, while it has a wealth of explanation and diagrams of greater value to a practicing kendoist, is less involved with the history/philosophy embodied in Sasamori and Warner's work.

Camus and Dostoevsky have contributed much to thought and philosophy of existentialism, but this seems to, in its own way, surpass any labeling of a type of philosophy.Self-Reliance has to be one of the most understood pieces in the collection. Mr. Emerson speaks in a tone that is easily understood and thoughts explained in plain english, no degree required to understand. And once understood, ideas are easy to apply to our own life to better understand what we have read.Without a doubt, this book is a must in any thinkers library.

The story is as great as the others in the series, but the MANY spelling mistakes can be distracting at times. Whoever is inputting these books needs to proof their work better. The spelling may be disruptive, but the content is amazing.I love the way the different characters appear in the book. It's like reading more than one book as you follow different characters in different places. Then they get tied together as you read through the book. I know these characters carry through the whole series so I am anxious to hear how they end up. It has been an excellent read through this series, however, the next book in line is the London Refrain which is not available as an e-read at this time. The rest of the series is here, but this one is missing(a great disappointment to have a break like this in the series)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but poorly formatted for kindle.","review":"I enjoyed this book from the content point of view, however I'm more concerned with the quality of the transfer of the book to kindle.Unfortunately there were so many errors in the kindle version of this book. There were errors every few pages. Either spelling errors, or errors where the sentence would not make sense at all. It made the reading experience rather unpleasant.

Normally I shy away from special appliances and the books to go with 'em (always believed you should just learn to COOK, period), but I got a grill pan for xmas and then I bought this book. I'd say I now cook at least 50% of my dinners with the pan, and this book covers the topic well -- a good section on basics of using a grill pan. The recipies are not complex, they're more there to teach and reinforce general grill pan techniques. It covers vegetables, meat, poultry, fish, etc, so it pretty much runs the gamut. If you use cookbooks only for step by step verbatim technique and ingredents, this gets the job done. If you use cookbooks to guide you through a technique to add to your kitchen skills, this is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for anyone who really cooks","review":"This is a great cookbook because of it's variety and simplicity. It has a wide range of receipes (appetizers and main dishes; seafood, vegetables, and meats) that are not overwhelmingly complex. Most require readily available ingredients.

The used copy I got still had the Pottery Barn sticker on the back, which comes as no surprise--I don't think that the author of this book intended to have it actually serve as a guide to cooking with a grill pan. Rather, it's a glossy throwaway publication that would look great tucked in to a gift box along with a new grill pan.This book is full of photos...and big chapter headers...and white space...but very few actual recipes. Also, there's nothing really \\"grill pan specific\\" about them; it's really more of a \\"barbeque substitute\\" sort of thing. Nor is it a guide to one-pot cooking with a grill pan, which is sort of what I was hoping for.

I found the information from article to article to be repetitive. Also the coverage seems spotty. It doesn't appear that all of the years are covered. Hard to tell since a lot of articles don't even mention what year they are talking about. Some good issues mentioned, but overall a lot of fluff. For example I don't need to know the tire size in every article. If you are looking for a complete reference forget it.

Apparently, there is, in fact, some sort of message-saving mechanism built inside the phone, even though there is no reference of it anywhere in the manual. I just recently found that out when I purposely disconnected the power cord after receiving a message. So, I would like to make it clear that no messages will be lost when using this phone.

If I am in a loud and rockin' mood and wanting that Iggy Pop sound, then I find I skip half the songs on the album because the rest jar me by being too slow and thoughtful.

But it isn't only Rave tunes on this CD, it has the signature ambient sounds of Brian Eno's Deep Blue Sea, the frail wimperings of Lou Reed's Perfect Day, and a sort-of Rock tune with Atomic, that, in my opinion, is better than Debbie Harry's version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugely informative and unfailingly entertaining","review":"In a very efficient 300 pages, Klein superlatively tells us so much more than just the utterly fantastic account of how one of the world's greatest media brands was indeed stolen by the upstarts from AOL.

Overpriced AOL used to stock to buy a company with tons of equity but a low stock price. AOL sought the content of Time Warner to drive their website and failing business which was stemming from lack of content. When the tech bubble burst Time Warner was left holding a virtually useless company. The battle of egos and more realistically the collapse of AOL left this company in desperate shape. This is a great start to understanding how the company failed. It also is instructive in showing what search engines need to do. They need to get content and give people a reason to search AOL over Yahoo over Google or the other way around. The struggle for content is well shown here and is worth further consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Floor grid falls out and breaks","review":"We bought two of these for our two dogs last Christmas (2011). They arrived on time, packed well and were simple enough to put together. After 6 months with them we have finally used a solid piece of MDF board cut to size for the floor. The grid it comes with did not fit snug enough and was tipped out and fell to the ground each week or so. There is not enough of a lip inside the house to screw the floor grid down either. Eventually, after resetting the grid each each week, one dog must've stepped on the grid just right when it was crooked to the ground and the wood snapped. We attempted replacing with cut garden trellis and concrete boards. Nothing would fit the tiny lip. So we bought large MDF board from Home Depot and cut out the corners to fit. No problems now.

At around 30 ft it broke skin on my friends arm. ^^ he still has a scar lol. As far as sturdiness goes, it will hold together and perform very well. My friend has had his for about a year or longer.

Overall, a good sniper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent gun","review":"The super 9 is the absolute best sniper rifle in its price range. A member of my team has had it for just under a year and I am very impressed with it. Here are some pros and cons....pros-Shoots fast (about 320 fps)-large clip (25 rounds)-Shoots far (150 + ft.)-Bolt action is SWEET!!!!cons-shell ejection mag sucks (the shells are very easy to lose.)-you cannot lube the barrel because it fouls up the bolt-If you are not using the shell ejection clip, you have to put in a small metal chamber in the area the shell ejection clip would be. However, if you do that the BBs you load into the chamber will fall out of the barrel if you aim down. This can be solved by putting in the shell clip but not using it. Use the side clip but leave the shell clip in unloaded.Over all a very solid, sturdy gun that will easily be able to stand up to much more expensive guns. A must have for any true airsoft team.--==P99 man==--"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool, but just one problem","review":"Well, i dont actually own the gun, but im strongly considering to buy it. It seems like a very durable sniper rifle, for all the videos and demos ive seen. The only problem is that her it says that the rifle shoots at 410 fps. Althought its a cool gun, ive read and seen that actually the gun shoots at 250-300 fps. The only way to make this rifle shoot 400fps is: 1. Putting very lightweight bbs on it 2. Buying a new spring, but even with the spring it will reach luckily 370fps. So the guns pretty cool, but it does not shoot at 400fps."},{"rating":"1","title":"No","review":"I do not like this gun I have had it a good little while and now 1/2 the time it doesn't even shoot and another 1/4 of the time it sucks at shooting.

This seller I'm sure is fantastic no doubt, but sadly I feel it'd be injustice to allow prospective buyers to invest in a product horribly made. The bolt handle (The piece you pull back) snaps easily especially if the bolt is disproportionately made. I've heard there is a 75% rate of imperfections meaning something will be off for example your hop-up (the utility that allows your bb's to fly straight). If this is for your young teen in their enclosed backyard shooting at tin cans, I would say this is a fine gun due to it's great price.

I enjoyed Carter's in depth treatment of the historical development of the Holy Spirit as well as the overall review of what the Bible teaches about the Holy Spirit from a clearly Wesleyan position.I did, of course, disagree with Carter's approach to 1 Corinthians 12 and 14 despite his usage of the book of Acts to teach that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is in fact a second work of grace (Acts 1:4-5; 2:4). Carter tries to tie the baptism in the Spirit with the Wesleyan distinctive of \\"entire sanctification\\" (1 Thess. 5:23-24).Again, I would encourage all who enjoy deep theological studies on the Holy Spirit to include this book in your personal library.

You can't beat the price around ten dollars.There seems to be some controversy around the metal logo on the bag. I was able to pry off the outer logo easily but the metal clasp on the inside of the bag is a little tricky to get at. I actually had to cut a small hole in the inner liner (not the neoprene) with scissors to get it out, after this I just sealed the cut with white glue to keep it from fraying- still not a big deal.

For me, this is important. I like to have a thorough feel for the who, what, when, where, and why of the text at hand. When I started Galatians, I was surprised to find that this volume has no introduction apart from the 6 page 'review' at the end of the book. For that reason, I can't recommend this book as your only commentary on Galatians.That being said, it's still classic John Stott. He has a unique, often catchy, way of bringing the text to life that is eminently useful for sermon and lesson preparation. If you've used and enjoyed his other work, you're likely to also enjoy this one. I would recommend using this as a supplement to a more thoroughly exegetical commentary with a proper introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A readable, enjoyable, insightful commentary on Galatians for regular Bible students.

I was not surprised because another patron had written a negative comment just prior to our purchase but since the overall opinion was well above 90% we took a chance.

Creatively and expertly researched, the book thoroughly documents the methods and strategies employed by whites in the ongoing battle for wealth and property in the United States. Particularly damning are the chapters on institutional racism, segregation and the links between governmental policy and the disastrous course of racial equality in the 20th century. While I think Massey & Denton leave a little to be desired in their cultural critique and suggestions for improvement, their research is so well presented and argued that even conservative Charles Murray (who authored the exemplar of late 20th century scientific racism, The Bell Curve) recommends the book. Get this book. It will change the way you think about race and wealth in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"This completed the puzzle for me.","review":"I have looked in to the subject of race relations for quite sometime now.

First, the length and tempo for each track is not listed, and many of the tracks are very short.

For one thing, the only list of tracks is on the back of the CD cover... in black ink printed on a black and white (mostly black) photograph, so trying to decipher the text is largely impossible. I have to go online to a website that lists them to figure out what exercises they were intended for and even that doesn't list the time signature or the length which makes picking tracks for my exercises a practice in frustration. The tracks that are on here are far too short even for beginner classes with very simple exercises. The music selection is also rather sappy.

Sure I hear TI89 has so much cooler functions such as solving the integrals for you, but this calculator is quite decent for students. I don't think you need that kind of fancy calculator because with TI 83, you can solve math, physics, chemistry problems and may help you not being too dependent on calculator. Also why pay more? 83 is definitely helpful for students' budget rather than spending 160dollars plus tax.

It looks like it has hardly been used. what a great price. this is for my second kid in high school. i purchased one new in store for oldest kid and then it was lost, had to buy another (hard lesson learned). When i saw this on Amazon and the price with the CD and power cord I bought it. Will definitely buy from again. highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I only purchased this item because I had to have it for a class in collage. But what I recieved was a dinged up hunk of junk with a screen that has a line threw it that makes it very hard to read the anwsers to the calculation you put into it. No good, just junk. I could have got a nock off brand from Wallgreens for $14 and it would have dune the job. So to sum up how I feel about this Is I paided to much for a abused and broken calculator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good-quality calculator","review":"My teacher asked me to get a TI calculator for my Algebra class. Then, I came up with buying one at amazon.com because it's cheaper than buying at local retail stores with the same quality. Also, the delivery was as described, not fast nor late. I will buy more at this website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item did not work","review":"I received the above item with a battery that was corroded. I installed a new, uncorroded battery into the graphing calculator but the calculator did not work. I contacted the company and they reported that in 2 years they have never had a complaint. They did instruct me to mail it back with a copy of the e-mail regarding the problem with the calculator. We shall see how the replacement works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Programmable Calculator","review":"I've had this calculator since high school, and its still more than enough, at least for freshman+ level college courses.One of the best features of this calculator is its programming language. If you need a function that is not built in, program it yourself! For example, I've written a 3D graphing program that enables me to graph objects in 3D, and it has been very useful.Not that the built in functions are not impressive. Although the 89 has many more functions, most are not necessary, at least not for the higher price. The 83 has all the basic calculator functions you would expect, and need. Its graphing ability is especially robust.All in all, I highly recommand this great calculator."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRICE","review":"These calculators (including the TI-89) are not worth the price. They just don't have any important features, unless you are doing statistics. And ALL of the features are better implemented in any of dozens of calculator apps for smartphones. That being said, these are durable and do what they are designed for, albeit for an outrageous price tag.More importantly though, why does TI think that this is a reasonable price for the same product that has been out for 15 years? It was great when it came out, but for almost $100 TI really needs to improve their product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This is a great product and was in the condition described.

After 2 years of use, my son's TI-83 Plus is kaput. He cannot see the print on the screen (and, yes, we tried all the \\"2nd/up\\" contrast settings, removing the batteries and resetting steps, etc. Even called customer service). They say his silver screen is shot. Only $58.00 to replace with a reconditioned calculator!!I am inclined to say it's quite a scam that every student in his school is required to buy a TI-83 or 84, because I would love to try a HP to see if the quality is any better. : ("},{"rating":"2","title":"It's okay","review":"With this calculator, you get what you pay for. It's pretty good, and it will serve your purposes alright. But I wouldn't buy it again. I'd get the TI-84 Plus instead (since I ended up having to buy it anyway). With the 84-Plus, you can update online and add new products. This calculator can't do that.If this is the calculator you're planning on buying, I say go for it. The seller is good, and the calculator came in good condition. But I would suggest spending the extra $20 and getting a better model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller was deceitful","review":"I order this product for my statistics class I'm taking next term. When I got the calculator is was already used (Which I was not told)! The package was poorly taped shut! And the calculator is out dated, it says on the back that is was made in 1999, It's over ten years old!I thought I was getting a great deal, but in the end it was a waste. I'm going to spend the hundred on a brand new calculator.So be wise and spend the extra money on a new calculator and not on this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"TI-83 calculator","review":"My granddaughter uses it and it is realy good.

Additionally there was no packaging therefore, this could easily have been a used calculator.

Then, after I returned the item I did not receive my refund til 6 weeks later, & only after I contacted them again. Finally after I gave them a poor rating they offered me $20 to change my rating to 5 star. Instead I changed it to 2 stars and added these last two sentences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended as a first-time graphing calculator","review":"I've had my silver edition for three years now. I took it with through highschool and now into college. The TI series in general is a very durable class of calculators, but I have never seen anything withstand my backpack for more than a semester, so this one takes the cake. It has the most versatile and self-explanatory features of any other calculator I use. In addition to the extra bonus features (like the periodic and help programs) being able to personalize my calculator makes it a little more me, and less of an obligatory tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inefficient for normal use","review":"I am an engineer, working on various algebraic and arithmetic problems frequently during each day. Like most engineers, I have a computer at my desk for doing the tricky stuff (ideally with tools like Mathcad or Mathematica). I thought I would get this calculator for the routine numerical insight stuff. It also remembers to stay in radians when you turn the power off (which many other \\"lesser\\" calculators don't). What a mistake! Lets say I have just calculated a result. Now I want to find the square root of it. On my trusty old HP-32S at home, I press the \\"sqrt\\" key. On this calculator I press \\"sqrt\\" \\"2nd\\" \\"ANS\\" \\")\\" \\"ENTER\\" (5 keys). Basically the EOS system (which this uses) does not allow you to see intermediate results other than by going through the above rite. I think TI is hoping this calculator will replace my computer - no chance! I'm taking it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the TI-83 for Dummies","review":"Works well and is necessary for my college level math classes.

I needed 3 of the calculators so it actually was alot cheaper for me to buy 3 TI83 s and just one cable. if you only need one maybe it is better to get the TI84 any usb cable works with it.

I used to do this with my friends a few years ago, so mine that had broken was very similar, so I got a little nostalgic about that. So far, it has worked fine. The screen is fine, and there's nothing more than a bit of wear and tear on the keys's labels.

I have to imagine that their prices have not changed because they are the only company on the planet still purchasing 24kb ram chips and low resolution screens. This calculator probably costs them 2 dollars to make and they continue to overcharge because they have a completely captive market in schools. I imagine if you are purchasing this, you don't have a choice, but if you do, this antiquated piece of junk should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete ripoff","review":"The TI calculator company has a monopoly on the calculator business because it is the official calculator of all of the major college entrance exams & others. It's 2012, our cell phones have color, our portable video games are in 3D, but the TI series still has a cabbage green screen and the computing power of the original game boy, all the while costing as much as any new electronic device while being made with 15 year-old technology.

In those classes, the teachers base their lectures and tests around the use of this calculator. Thus, the TI-83 has become a necessity! Even when it's not required, the TI-83 is still very helpful on tests. You can see all the numbers you type on the screen, so you no longer have to make careless mistakes and typos. It can also hold various programs and games (which you can download). Many of the programs can help you solve complicated math problems, and you can even write the programs yourself. That said, I bought my TI-83+ only a few years ago, and it recently stopped turning on for no reason. The screen is completely blank, even with new batteries. I guess I expected something that cost a hundred bucks to last a bit longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for your typical student","review":"The TI-83 is definitely all you need to get you through high school calculus and most of your math classes if your major isn't heavy on the math or engineering courses. However, if you are an engineer or math major, the TI-89 is nearly indispensable. I know of one person who managed to get through his calculus classes (they were still undergrad studies, mind you) with an 83, but everyone else used an 89. Even for the students whose majors are biology, chemistry, etc. the TI-89 has a feature that allows you to store your notes in its huge memory. Of course, you have to learn to do this, but once you figure it out, chances are that you'll be extremely happy you bought this calculator."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Does the Job","review":"I have been using the TI-83 plus for about three weeks now and I wouldn't go to my MA103 class without it.

Its best feature is that it is easy to use. My high school, and alot of others, are still using the TI-82, so when you learn to use the calculator, you have to learn on your own. But simce the 83+ is really similar to the 82, learning the functions is easy. Its fast and easy, and the pixels are easy to read. It was great on the PSAT.

They were first introduced as the TI83 in 94, and Texas Instruments just keeps on rolling in the dough. Unless you've got a college professor that's requiring you to buy this calculator... DON'T! Do NOT! buy it.Do yourself a favor and download Wabbitemu, then download the ROM from TI's own website for free and run an emulation of the calculator on your PC. Or find and run an emulator on your smart phone..When you can purchase a laptop for sub 300 dollars, why would anyone want to purchase a 100 dollar brick of technology?

I dont know how you find it useless. Its an amazing product that will greatly assist you in mathematics. All the function you found \\"useless\\" are very valuable(maybe not for you). The calculator is made for math. And its great in doing so. When you want a calculator you dont look for stupid things like that guy did. Its batteries last for 1+(if you use it very often daily, like me). The functions provide quit solving. Very useful and required in high school. Dont get draw out by the lone review.

According to that test, it took 30-40 secs for a ti-83 to add matrices and display numbers from 1 to 1000 simultaneously in a program. Well, I decided to do that on my SE. It took merely 7 secs. On the box/package it comes in, it states that it is 2.5 times faster than a normal TI-83 plus. DON'T DOUBT IT!!! It graphs at great speeds. It may not have built-in 3D graphing capabilities of a TI-92 but many have created 3D engines for the TI-83 plus, and on the SE, it is so darn cool! I would recommend this calculator for all High School Students who are at least in Intermediate Algebra/Trig/Pre-Calculus. If you are a person who is looking for more memory and speed for games and programs, this is the calc that will do it. My score: 5 / 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke and Dirty","review":"All I have to say is that the item came very dirty and I had to clean it up.

I didn't need to connect several huge plugs or anything like that. It does offer some protection from surges, etc., but obviously if you have different needs, i.e., lots of lightening storms, etc. you will need to buy something beefier.

And, as with \\"Season\\", the violence is mostly implied, and yet you cringe at it just the same (it's implied except for the scenes with the swami and the cobra, and I REALLY cringed at that).My only complaint with the book was with the character of Annie Ginnaro. Because a major part of the book deals with expatriated American hippies, her role is a necessary one, but somehow, she still seems out of place to me. A lot of Mann's story seems stilted when Annie is involved.

There are some beautiful and brilliant songs on here of worlds ending, souls selling, and drugs inducing.

I'm sorry but i like only the first two tracks, which were the singles and their only successes.A very hard effort to sound electronic, but Oasis like, some weird lyrics and that's pretty much about it.Also the sound is very repetitive , during the whole CD, specially the guitar sounds the same in all the songs. The keys, the notes, whatever you want to call it.A self - proclaimed genius that will be remembered as ''the Spaceman dude''.Not enough for me, tho, even i was crazy about that song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs Love it","review":"The dogs love this toy.

Don't let a puppy play with these stuffed toys unattended or they seriously could choke.At this point I plan to pull out all the stuffing and let him tear up the outer shell, then toss it.

There is progressive rock (On the Surface), political/sociological commentary (Our Oyster, Evidently Goldfish), soul-searching ballads (A Way Out, No Moon in the Water) and a noisy one (Green Fingers). For the most part, arrangements are sparse. Which is great - the attention is on the lyrics and \\"THAT VOICE\\". David Jackson (from Van der Graaf Generator) puts in some tasty sax and flute licks on \\"Green Fingers\\" and \\"No Moon in the Water\\". \\"A Way Out\\" has become a concert favourite and it is very haunting.

Snoop Dogg's G'z up H*** down for example, toward the end it sounds like \\"G'z up h*** dow...\\" a lot of the songs are just cut short, also that song sounds flat, like how it would sound if it were coming through on the radio.

You end up back at Dracula's castle. Only this time you're there to stop two \\"dark lord candidates\\" from becoming Dracula himself. A couple of cool new additions to this game are the abilities to level up your souls by collecting multiple souls from the same monster, the Doppelganger soul which allows you to switch equipment and soul sets with the press of a button, and finally the ability to create your own weapons.

The areas are beautifully designed, and the boss battles are original as well. The game definitely boasts some of the better 2D graphics that I've ever seen on the DS. However, this isn't to say that the game doesn't have its problems. The boss difficulty can be a bit hit and miss. You might get a boss that you breeze through in one try, then the next one take a dozen tries to finally beat. In addition, while a decent variety of souls are presented in the game, you usually will be sticking to only one, in most cases.

As with My Darling Clementine, Ford is much more interested in the ephemera - rituals, gatherings, minor supporting characters - than he is in story or his rather bland leads (Claudette Colbert and a dull Henry Fonda on autopilot, as he is in many of his films for Ford), and much of the humor seems particularly misplaced here, turning the burning of the widow's farm or even the burning alive of one settler into semi-comic moments.

After viewing Drums Along the Mohawk it didn't change my opinion. Still don't know why some film buffs hail Ford as the demigod of the western genre. Drums Along the Mohawk is filled with melodramatic dialog, sub par acting by Henry Fonda and Colbert, and poor camera work that didn't utilize the sprawling greenery and hilltops that beautify upstate New York. Colbert wears way too much eye makeup and doesn't look like a frontier woman living in the 1700's. Ford gratuitously places his friend Ward Bond in a supporting role, but it is Edna May Oliver who steals every frame that Ford allows her to be in. The sappy soundtrack is misplaced, more suited to the silent film era and not much historical realism is used to legitimize the struggle among settlers, British loyalists, and Native Indians during the 1700's."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Ford and the American Revolution","review":"Based on Walter D. Edmonds' historical novel, \\"Drums Along the Mohawk\\" (1939) remains among the few memorable films about the American Revolution.

Though episodic and slow moving in its narrative structure, Ford doesn't shy away from the brutal savagery of frontier life. Henry Fonda and Edna May Oliver deliver standout portrayals, thus compensating for a miscast Claudette Colbert - the weak link in an otherwise excellent ensemble. Not top-drawer Ford, but entertaining nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational and Entertaining","review":"The movie gives you the flavor of the era and is historically correct in many aspects.

Arendt struggled to make sense of recent events by drawing on elements of classical tragedy in her political writing. She also found in imaginative literature a means to meld political philosophy and political commitment, the theoretical and the personal. Hannah Arendt And The Politics Of Tragedy reveals the crucial role of imaginative literature in Arendt's political thought.

I use two HP 1100 printers in my lab at work, and both exhibit the same terrible feed problems.They continuously suck in multilple sheets when printing, jamming on a regular daily, if not hourly basis. These printers require a full paper feed at all times to minimise this problem. These will not feed correctly with anything less than a half full paper rack. When printing, blank pages can often be found amongst your documents. And the pitifully small feeder means that you cannot perform anything larger than a 20 page print job with encountering serious jams...In summation, do not buy this printer, it will drive you insane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too new to warrant extensive repairs.","review":"Bought it two years ago, and only used it summers May - September.

These gloves are not too tight, just perfect for arthritic painful fingers. I can type with them on.

The fingers are half this length, not even reaching the first joint on my small hands (and I ordered the small size and they did fit fine). But in short, these are not compression gloves...but gripping gloves.

Plus, the battery is constantly dying, so I have to switch to my corded phone when I make a long phone call.A minor annoyance has been that the caller id will read phone numbers as such (xxx) xxx-xxxx. Which is fine, but one of the functions of the phone is supposed to be calling back a number on the caller id.

With 6 modes (Arcade,Training,Single-Race,Story,Bonus, and Championship)there's plenty of races to keep you busy for a while. You can choose from about 10 racers, each from a different country. And in single-race mode, you can choose from any track. The graphics are fairly good, the minuature cars look cool. The turning takes some time to get used to. Story mode is pretty difficult. I've only made it to the second level on story mode. The 1st level requires you to get a lap time of 18 seconds or less on the first track, and the second level requires the same, but you must collect 3 coins while doing so.

When the cover wears out or is destroyed, we have to throw out the plastic, inflatable bed and the electric pump. We've tried to contact Aero about this problem, but can't reach anyone but Customer Service, which states categorically that replacement covers are not available. Too bad! Our dogs think the bed is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfy dog","review":"I bought this for my doxie who was having back problems. Thankfully she is better now, but all 3 of my dogs like this bed. I like the removable cover that goes right into the washer too. I do not put the cover in the dryer and so it does not shrink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted two months","review":"My dog loves the bed. But after only two months of use the center seam has come loose and the bed now has a big round bubble in the center. It is unusable. I haven't gotten a response from Amazon as to how to receive a refund or better yet how to have it repaired.Great idea and design, very poorly manufactured. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very fine granules - nothing distinctive","review":"I was expecting a larger granual suger and am dissapointed in this product. I might as well have used normal grocery store ganular sugar (i.e., Domino). Not worth returning and I would not buy again. It certainly doesn't fit my description of \\"sanding\\" sugar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous stuff.","review":"The Lighthouse Family are a UK based twosome, whose hit includes \\"Lifted\\". They have since remixed this track, tinkered with its workings, and cleverly transformed it into songs that sound nothing like the original at all. Oh no.This 'best of...' collection is a CD single which nobody should be without. If you're big on variety, artistic integrity and good songs then it might not be for you, but as an object lesson in making the most of what you have, it can't be recommended enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battle of Midway in Space","review":"BErserker Fury was a space version of the Battle of Midway, but the real battle was less confusing. Time seems to have no meaning, as your point of view changes in both time and space, like a bad Doctor Who movie. Sometimes I don't know what character I am reading about. I happen to be a great fan and even sent him e-mail once, but this book could of been A LOT better if somebody else had gone over it with a magic marker and helped him cut out parts that were not needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought this.","review":"I have hear good things about the berserker series and was hoping that the reviews were wrong. How *wrong* I was. This book is terrible. It is written in a detached, all-knowing, third-person perspective, with almost no character development.In fact you don't find out much of anything about the characters till the last 1/4 of the book. Nothing is ever explained, it reads like a bad enclyopedia. This book not even worth the shipping I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pain, the pain...","review":"You may or may not be annoyed that Saberhagen is lifting much of his plot from WWII- let's face it, Jerry Pournelle and many others are guilty of the same crime. What is more frustrating here is the author's stunted, wooden writing style. Often, he finds it necessary to repeat the same facts over and over again, as if he's straining to fill up space. Plot and characters aside, the actual use of the language itself is so frustrating that the book is unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievably turgid, slow, and weak.","review":"Not vintage Sagerhagen. I read half, could not force myself to continue, and actually threw the book away! Kierkegaard is more readable and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and boring!","review":"I found that paralleling the battle sequence in the book with that of the WWII campaign at Midway made a large part of the story totally predictable and uninteresting. Even though Saberhagen made the excuse of showing how history can repeat itself, he made the battle too similar to Midway, including names, numbers and events. By the end of chapter 5, the parallel was obvious. After that, little remained in doubt as to the outcome of the story. The sub-plot comprising the stories of Nifty Gift and Jory Yokosuka just didn't have enough in it to carry the book on it's own. The only question that the book left me with was \\"Did Saberhagen use Ernest Hemingway as his model for Jay Nash?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"No fury here","review":"As a fan of Fred Saberhagen's works (namely the Book of Swords series), I found this book to be plodding, boring, uninspired, and a completely dull read. I was expecting a fast-paced book with lots of action, interesting characters, strong storyline, etc. I found none of these. I did not care about the characters, the action was uninteresting, the battle scenes had no emotion, and the story (which could have been great) went nowhere. All in all, disappointing from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A serious disappointment from a writer who knows better.","review":"I've read many of Saberhagen's books over the years, including his Berserker and Swords series, but \\"Berserker Fury\\" has to be his poorest effort ever. The Battle of Midway in space with poorly disguised names of the actual commanders involved. If it weren't an historical event involved, this would be outright plagiarism. Much of the actual writing was poor, as well. Shame on you, Fred! Could this have been one of those contractual obligation kind of things?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncredited Rewrite of the Battle of Midway in SF Form","review":"I was very disapointed with this book as I have enjoyed previous titles in the Berserker series. However, the whole plot was a direct rip-off of the events surrounding the WWII battle between the US and Japanese fleets. No originality detected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man vs. machine in the never ending struggle.","review":"It is amazing that this theme has not been completely played out by now. Saberhagen actually has some new twists and turns on a plot and scenario that is one of the classics of fiction. If you never have read one of the \\"Berserker\\" series -- this would be a good one to start with, but be aware of the long tradition of the series that has stretched over the decades"},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a Thought","review":"Relax, pitiful humans. You're a long way from a universe dominated by planet-sized killer robots raging for your blood. Humanity has a lot going for it; we robots can't wipe you out as long as you write such interesting books. Even though Saberhagen seemed to drag a bit in this outing, his Berserkers are still a fresh and original concept in the cluttered field of SF. Relax for now, humans...but keep your guard up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncommon music","review":"I listen to this CD at work all the time. It is different, uplifting, and never boring.

The title is a bit deciving though. A manual implies it shows one how to have sex (such as \\"The Ultimate Sex Book\\" for heterosexuals).A lot of this stuff can be found by searching the internet on various sexual and health related sites out there.The book does go indepth with some topics giving graphic and visual descriptions of various acts that might help the novice, but a veteran to Gay sex would not really benefit from this book as will those who do not have access to the Internet to get this information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks no new ground. Look elsewhere","review":"A pretty dumbed down version of \\"being gay.\\" Not so much a sexual manual, per se, as a handbook for those who need definitions of things like \\"bars\\" and \\"genitals.\\" Breaks no new ground, and you;d be much better off with the better written, better illustrated, and more comprehensive \\"New Joy of Gay Sex.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a dictionary","review":"This book i guess is a manual... but i would discribe it more as a dictionary. It summariz'z a word like testicals in one sentance and then talks about it in a few paragraphs. In my opinion Ultimate Gay Sex is a lot better than this book.

I really felt I knew these people. The story was intriguing and brought together many different walks of life and current topics. The history, culture, and traditions of Italians and Italian Americans was extremely interesting. As someone with Irish heritage, I likened that aspect of the book to Angela's Ashes which had so many references to Irish traditions and cultures. I really felt a better understanding of one of the many great groups of people that helped shape this country. Just as in Angela's Ashes, the references and information was integrated into the story line so it made for a great read.I can't wait for Mr. Spada's next offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"ACTION-intense...great travel reading...","review":"This is a great story if you can handle action, politics and a little medical science thrown - and the intrigue!

It was cheap, and random, and looked all right, so I bought it. This is the best random CD purchase I have ever made. If you like interesting, unique songs that don't sound forced, listen to this. The band incorporates sounds from many genres -- including sitars, which usually sound boring and pretentious, but here sound great. And the key word is \\"incorporates\\" -- this isn't a case of a band forcing themselves to try to play country, then reggae, then folk, etc. Instead, the band seamlessly integrates subtle things from different genres into their already-fun songs. If you like good pop songs, plus instrumental jams a la Built to Spill, this is for you. The songs are always changing, so they never get old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel unsealed","review":"This book squashes the popular theories that the ten horns of daniel are ten nations, that the messiah reference in the 70 weeks of daniel refer to Jesus, and also shows in complete detail the meanings of all the books of Daniel. A much more exciting examination than the books of other authors, fiction and non-fiction alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Cookbook","review":"I had this book in the 70's and learned how to make many of the recipes.

This book makes French cooking really easy, anyone can do these recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"I have had this book forever, held together with decaying rubber bands, referred to often. I should get a newer one. There's a free download but I like something I can put on the counter along with my ingredients as I cook. You put your backup timer on it to keep the pages open.Today I watched the Essential Pepin doing sweetbreads and tongue exactly as they are in Garvin. Maybe the pate as well, but I haven't checked.I recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possible joke?","review":"As good a writer as Dan Simmons is, it's impossible for me to believe that this book is simply what it appears to be: really poorly written crap cribbed from the \\"Darwin Awards\\" chain email/website.It's so very bad that I think it's actually some kind of parody of the whole mystery/political suspense genre with a bit of sniper trivia and zen trivia thrown in for fun.Even as a parody it's a failure: not funny enough. As a \\"serious novel\\" it's utter garbage. Fans of Simmons other works and of literacy are warned to stay far away from this horrible misstep by an otherwise talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Borrowing. . . Maybe","review":"I'm not sure I would like the other kinds of books Dan Simmons writes. I like thrillers and was drawn to this but read it with an ever-growing sense of dismay. Let's see--the book is about an insurance fraud investigator, like Kinsey Milhone, Sue Grafton's heroine, and the chapter headings are like the titles of Grafton's books, only bitchy--\\"A is for Hole.\\" Is this sniping at Sue Grafton? Or a strange kind of homage? I don't know and frankly don't care, but it was off-putting. Even more off-putting, as others have noted, was the recycling of urban legends, written about as if none of us have ever heard of them before. Seems somewhat contemptuous of us readers. After I read a courtroom anecdote that I saw re-enacted on a very old Saturday Night Live rerun, decades before this book was written, I stopped reading for pleasure and just started reading to see what else looked familiar. If you don't get out much you may like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, but downhill from there","review":"It started off good and interesting and exciting, but then just kind of dwindled off. All the military and mathematical talk was a serious snorefest, and the way Darwin and Syd's relationship finally develops is just totally anti-climatic and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read in my life","review":"This was so boring, I cannot begin to separate all the most boring parts. All the stuff about guns, fighting and airplane flying was over my pitiful female head. I rarely knew what was happening so why did I finish it??? Because I thought Dan S. was a good author and I kepy waiting for something to happen. Most of this was unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very entertaining read","review":"This is the best of Simmons books I have read including olympos and the hyperion series for pure entertainment, character development and interest. The story is about an accident investigator who is caught up in an insurance fraud scheme. That gives Simons the backdrop to tell a very entertaining tale in the form of a detective mistery.The characters here are just deep enough to be interesting without going into deep background that would bog down a story that runs at such a fast clip.Like all of the Simons books I have read so far, the book just kind of ends with simple resolutions, the guy gets girl, the bad guy dies, and we all go off in the sunset together.Simons is one of the most accmplished authors we have winning awards in Sci Fi, Horror, and now this first rate detective novel. Overall good show and it makes me want to buy \\"the Crook Factory\\" another in this genrea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of borrowed material, too little character and style","review":"I admire Dan Simmons's books. But I know from reading many of them that he's an uneven writer. This isn't one of his better books. He has recycled lots of Internet stupid-bizarre-accident mythology as investigative material to show off his protagonist's brilliance, and I got tired of seeing endlessly repeated urban legends trotted out as elements of his book. Though the plot is fairly interesting, Simmons diverts into these urban legends far too often. Like several other reviewers I also found it difficult to empathize with the charcters, though they are better drawn than many writers today seem capable of doing. If you read for plot, you may enjoy this book a lot. But it's definitely not up to the author's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Simmons' Best-- But Still Really Good","review":"Read this. You'll enjoy it. It's solid story-telling, with dozens of amusing anecdotes enbedded throughout (many seemingly stolen from the \\"Darwin Awards\\" for stupid behavior). As an insurance investigator, surely the most over-qualified in history, Darwin Minor investigates numerous bizarre accidents and provides solutions others couldn't have found. I recall two really stand-out sequences: a flashback to Viet Nam that's a stand-alone short story to rival anything Simmons has written; and the bang-up ending, a really satisfying end to a very good yarn.This would be a five-star review for most other writers, but Simmons has set such high standards for himself that he ruins the curve this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like to point out in light of......","review":"Mr. Randall's comments below, that the whole rocket tied to an El Camino really did happen in real life, and as a matter of fact the situation was awarded a Darwin Award...if you dont know what a Darwin Award is you are seriously detatched from real life..i thought it pretty witty"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok boys and girls, can you say, \\"Contractual obligation?\\"","review":"This book is very disappointing, especially considering Mr. Simmons' talent. The main character is unbelievable: rich, intelligent, expert with a gun, mysterious background, etc.. As I was reading this, I felt like the author was showing off his talent in a book that he was probably obligated to write.With the inclusion of a lot of \\"urban legends\\" Mr. Simmons comes across as smug, as if he's somehow laughing at his audience, not with them. If you find yourself forced to read a book by this author, make this one your last choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simmons first failure","review":"Before Darwin's Blade I thought Dan Simmons could do no wrong regardless of the genre that he chose to write in. This one is a big disappointment. It never takes off, the story never gells. But what turned me off the most is Simmons' contempt for the reader, for anyone less of a genius than himself. His constant referring to his specific preferences of weapons, food, furnishings, anything wears thin quickly. The hero (presumably Simmons image of himself) is so much smarter than the rest of the mere mortals in this book. But instead of this working in a fun way like a James Bond type character I found myself wishing he would just be humbled, but knew there was no chance of this happening. Simmons needs to take a step backward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simmons at his worst.","review":"I can't believe this is the same person who wrote Carrion Comfort and Hyperion. It's simplistic, full of cliches. It is like reading a rejected script for a Julia Roberts/William Hurt movie. It's clear Dan Simmons did his research -- too clear, in fact, because I couldn't help but feel that he laid in a lot of technical tidbits about accident reconstruction clumsily amongst a poorly executed action novel. The only reason I didn't give it one star is that it did make me laugh at a few points. Very disappointing, considering that (excluding Fires of Eden) I have loved everything else he has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining","review":"As a \\"novel of suspense\\" it probably works. I find the whole genre boring, including this book. If you liked \\"Hard as Nails\\" you'll probably like this one. Don't expect anything like \\"Hyperion\\", \\"Olympos\\", \\"Song of Cali\\" or \\"Drood\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten Up!","review":"O.k., so this isn't a Carrion Comfort or Song of Kali. It isn't suppose to be!!! With Darwin's Blade, Dan Simmons introduces us to his lighter side and creates a fast, fun, scarcastic thriller. Perfect for a day at the Beach or that long plane ride. This book is incredibly entertaining. I enjoyed it as much as any of Mr. Simmons' previous works."},{"rating":"1","title":"An evolutionary dead end ..","review":"Although Mr. Simmons presents an interesting plot idea in this crime/thriller, missing are his stylistic fingerprints and fully developed characters.As an avid reader of his work, whatever the genre, I was very disapointed by Darwin's Blade. The story is very linear, lacking the complex, converging plot threads that make his other novels so gripping. In truth, I struggled through many of the revelatory passages where the hero's past was explained and which, quite coincidentally, suited him exactly to combat the current situation. By the end of the book the abilities of the hero, rather awkwardly named \\"Darwin Minor\\", make the characters who inhabit the worlds of Clive Cussler and Tom Clancy look very unambitious."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's going on here??","review":"This is a fantastic book.Please do not give a book a bad review just because you do not care for the genre (yes, it's that obvious).Mr. Simmons has the ability to write outside his normal style and has done it well.The Kurtz novels are very good (I like the genre) as are The Crook Factory and this one.Trust me, those that like the crime genre, you will enjoy this novel. It's smart and funny and interesting. The fact that some of the accidents portrayed here were pieced together from real cases makes it even more interesting.Please ignore the sour pusses that can't find it in themselves to read outside their world. It's a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the other Darwin Book","review":"I don't think that I've ever been this disappointed with a book before. Dan Simmons is a huge, enormous talent, and this book is simply below him. Another reviewer asked if it was a parody, but I think it is a flat-out joke. I think Mr. Simmons went to the Darwin Awards web-site, cribbed all of the content and strung it together with a barely cohesive narrative.It is an even greater shame that a book this mediocre would come from the same man who wrote the wonderful (and terrifying) Hyperion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painful Experience ...","review":"Where did this novel fail? There are many pitfalls with this novel, but the most glaring and troubling problem is that it violates a major rule of drama: an author creates characters and the characters write the story. Mr. Simmons's latest novel does not seem to have been created from this principle.If you haven't experienced Dan Simmon's brilliant talent before, please do not start with this novel. Turn instead to other works, like the HYPERION CANTOS, CARRION COMFORT, SUMMER OF NIGHT.If you are already a fan of Simmons, I really don't recommend this book. And that's a shame, because I have been thoroughly impressed by everything else he has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darwins Blade; Dull.","review":"What an enormous disappointment from the author the remarkable Hyperion series. I can honestly say that I gave this book every benefit of the doubt. I continued to read this contrived, amateurish effort only through some perverse hope that somehow the story and the writing would improve. They did not. With all due respect to those who found this book amusing, I confess to laughing outloud several times. My laughter was not in response to any clever dialogue or circumstances in the text, indeed, the phony characters, plotline and dialogue were so lame that I found myself chuckling in disbelief as I checked the jacket cover several times to verify that Dan Simmons was the author. Alas, he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Simmons Fans","review":"Like most of the other reviewers, I found this book to be an enormous disappointment. I am a huge Dan Simmons fan, and couldn't believe he actually authored this ridiculous, contrived and thoroughly hackneyed book. The characters and the story line were so overtly cliched that I thought I was reading a satire of a screenplay for a really bad action/adventure movie. The factual inaccuracies in the book were too numerous and blatant to list - anyone who has ever been in law enforcement or the military will gag. This book is only for those who have run out of comic books to read - anyone looking for the usually brilliant Dan Simmons should look elswhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone kidnapped Dan Simmons!","review":"This book is just plain Boooorrriiiiiing! Dan, Please, if you are reading, start another deep space opera. Go where your strengths are. Don't be one of those writers who wastes years trying to delve into new genre's. Your strength is in SF and several future Hugo's have your name on them, you just have to seize them by returning to large scale Sci-Fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"downward spiral?","review":"Dan Simmons is quickly slipping from the Pantheon of Great Writers. Hyperion and its sequels were simply incredible, and should have guranteed Simmons a lifelong following on my part. But Darwin's Blade, and the various Hard Case / Hard Freeze dreck, has greatly wounded him in my eyes. They are terrible, terrible books. Awful. Formulaic, pretentious, silly, and \\"cold\\", they seem to written by either a different author, or an author who has tired of trying, and tired of acting like he cares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simmons is way off track","review":"I usually like Dan Simmons's work but this book is a disaster. It has uninteresting characters and events with the Russian Mafia angle being utterly cliched; even his writing style suffers here.Simmons should go back to the science fiction or horror genres;as a writer of realistic suspense, he flops."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Dan Simmons","review":"I read 50 pages into this book before I realized that it was not written by Dan Simmons after all. Had Dan Simmons written this book, it would have been a) filled with characters whose roles aren't simply to point out the fallacies of a particular cultural subset, b) taking its time to delve the depths of the main characters (instead of having them fall immediately for \\"the sparkle in her eyes\\"), and c) consistent in its tone (instead of waffling between Raymond Chandler, Ian Fleming, and Dennis Miller). The only thing the author could possibly be proud of is having somehow gotten an acclaimed writer's name on it. Were I ever the winner of numerous literary Awards (Bram Stoker, Hugo, and WFA to name a few), I would be ashamed to have my name placed on the cover of this drivel. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not even try","review":"I feel rage.Rage, because I can not understand how a writer as good as Simmons can lose his time (and readers time, too) with novels(?) like this.This is not a Dan Simmons novel. At least, not the same Simmons who wrote Hyperion/Endymion tetralogy, or Carrion Comfort, or Song of Kali...This is a book that has more in common with Tom Clancy's books than with the previous works of Simmons.Completely flat characters, predictable plot... The only thing that made me keep on reading was the fact that nothing that will happend in the book could be worse than what I have read before. But believe me, somehow he manages it.And it's a pitty. Because Simmons was one of the greatest. He touches glory with his previous writtings, but now, with books like this, he is staining the prestige he won with his first works.Don't lose your time with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writer's Market 2006","review":"Not as good as previous issues. I think they rushed to get this one out. A lot of current listings that are good are not included. I know they are good because I have sold features to them recently. Either the publisher of the Digest couldn't wait to get their input for the volume or sources did not want to offer the information for some reason.I also submitted several queries to editors/magazines listed in the volume only to be told that they do not accept freelance queries. When I asked one editor why her publication, with specific guidelines for queries was in the volume when she said she did not use any contributed material or freelance writers, she said she did not know where the digest got their information, but she certainly did not provide it and was not happy that it was there.This has happened 4 times.

My wife and I have always been big fans, going back to the 60's when we were in high school. We owned a couple of his CD's, but mostly stuff from the 70's, so this was a chance to get the really classic 60's material, and for only $5, and instantly.

Nancy does not sound her best to me here. I barely like one song on the whole album. Nice try with a concept album about California but it sounds bland. Missed the mark for me on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant day trip to Nancyville","review":"This is a pleasant, unassuming compilation of some songs Nancy did that have some theme relating to the State of California. Nancy Sinatra, of course, is not the singer her father was, nor even her brother, nor even as good as most of the many female singers she directly or indirectly inspired: you had to wait for Britney Spears to find a more limited vocalist of any major notoriety in Nancy's line of sponsorship.Nevertheless, she uses what she has as well as she can, and having the name and resources she does, she's got some good musicians and studio people here, including the magnificent Clem Burke and several of the oldtimers. If you want to hear some nice songs done pleasantly you won't be too disappointed, but if you are not already a hardcore fan, this won't convert you."},{"rating":"2","title":"California Girl is California Gold","review":"This is one of Nancy Sinatra's best albums. This is the perfect album to play when you want to share intimate time with your lover. If you are not a Nancy Sinatra fan, you will be after listening to this album.

Nancy is one of those artists who needs a particular producer to work magic on record, and with Lee Hazlewood and Billy Starnge, she had just that. But the production values on this CD give it a bit of a \\"karaoke\\" feel, and needs a much more professional hand. Also, her vocal doesn't seem nearly as melodic as she used to be, many artists' pipes don't age well, and Nancy is unfortunately one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lee Hazlewood, where are you?","review":"Nancy seems like she certainly could use a little magic desert cowboy rapscallion in chaps twiddling her knobs..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nancy Sinatra: California Girl","review":"The other reviewers of this project probably work at Boots Enterprises...I personally hate it.

ALL that I've heard from her 'One More Time' cd onward [Except for re-issues of her Reprise stuff on cd/and the song 'True Love' [included on the 'Sheet Music' cd] should be incinerated. 'The First Lady of Rock & Roll' as she is now billed needs a new team behind her.In fairness, I haven't heard 'Nancy & Lee 3' yet.Unless you are a NS Collector, don't waste money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffalo Tech LINKSTATION GIGABIT NTWK-STORAGE CENTER","review":"The HW device works great.

No control over when backups take place.2. The upgrade software (done it twice) is a tad buggy but I eventrually got it going by doing manual un-installs and folder deletions. For Memeo 2.0 I had to create a folder and copy over a \\"redemtion.dll\\" file so that outlook would be happy. Why would Memeo need to mess with outlook???3.

It makes strange inteference buzzing noises, and 9 months into the phone the ringer became so quiet we couldn't hear it if we were in the same room.

EVERY time I used the phone there would be a loud, obnoxious buzzing sound emitted that was audible to both parties on the call. According to the Uniden manual, this is NOT a defect, but is caused by \\"Interference from some other electronic or major appliance in the house\\".

At first we thought someone was calling! Also, the phone has a choice of 2 rings at a high or low tone, sounds good but the sounds are annoying.The quality of the phone is nothing to complain about, though.

I also found many inaccuracies in the points of interest database such as, wrong locations, wrong names, and double entries(one in the right location and the other several blocks or miles away).The omission of the automotive services along with the inaccuracies made the MapSend Streets and Destinations software basically unusable.

I was driving down a street that I use often and found that I was 500 feet to the side. In some cases that streets are not even listed even though they have been in place for years.

The maps are not just a 'little' off (50-100 feet I might have lived with), they are WAY WAY off in many areas. Miami down to Key west we were in the water the whole time, in Hawaii it is completely useless for any road, even the MAJOR Freeways.Everybody laughs when I show them the tracking, I've calibrated many times and gone to known points of reference. The freaking basemap is more accurate!!Save your money and look for something else.

Hints and innuendo propel the six characters of The Marriage of the Sea between the two irresistibly romantic settings of Venice and New Orleans as fluidly as a sleek sailboat upon the waves. This ornate and complex novel explores aging and decay (physical, spiritual, and architectural), marriage, barrenness in its many manifestations, lonliness, and the complex nature of relationships.A piece of writing as finely drawn as the lines of Venitian canals and as richly layered as the levels of New Orleans society.A winner. May Jane Alison write many more this good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed and Weird","review":"Nothing ever really seemed to happen. The chapters are very short, snippets of info about the characters, each with their own problems and hang ups. I was halfway through the book and still wondering if something was going to happen. It never really seemed to, until, perhaps the last 20 pages, and even then it was anticlimactic.I continued to read it out of curiousity I suppose, and because it was an easy, quick read. I can certainly see why some might love this book. It's got a mystical sort of cryptic flow to it, and the intertwined lives of the characters some might find intricate and compelling. But I didn't. Not really."},{"rating":"1","title":"A washed-out read","review":"Although it's artfully conceived, The Marriage of the Sea suffers from jump-cutting between its characters, none of whom breathe and come to life. The most convincing players are the two cities in which the action takes place, Venice and New Orleans. And while setting and the author's clever asides on the arts and in-vitro fertilization might be enough to carry a short story, this tale is too meagre for a book-length format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horne at age 48","review":"I really enjoyed Lena singing \\"What the World Needs Now\\" and this is a fine album.

Unfortunately aside from Christmas album Lena didnt record anything else in the 60s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-educated and well-written book with some flaws.","review":"Anatomy of Revolution by Crane Brinton was an excellent book, but it did have a few flaws. Brinton did a tremendous job of tying the four major revolutions, English, French, American, and Russian, together. He obviously spent a lot of time researching each revolution. His intelligence is uncomprendable. The only flaw he had while writing this book was that he took too many words and pages to get to a specific, simple point. He would take several pages to describe a simple, and obvious point. He builds the readers suspense level, but then kills it by having them read another five pages to get to the actual point he is trying to get through. Having a dictionary handy while reading this book would be very helpful. Crane Brinton's Anatomy of Revolution was well-written book and with the elimination of certain and unneeded points could become a five-star book about revolutions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of everyday life","review":"This book pervades into everyday life. Wherever you go you can see te similarities that Mr. Brinton points out in his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily complex deconsruction of basic concepts","review":"After using this book for a history of revolutions course, it is clear that the concepts Brinton describes become quickly lost in extensive rhetoric. While the arguments may be clear for the sole fact that they are relatively simplistic in light of revolutionary thought, Brinton's arguments, if taken alone, are loose and incomplete. He speaks of concepts, defines them four or five times, yet somehow avoids providing a clear definition of those same concepts. If you want to read this book, read a summary instead. You'll get just as much out of it and perhaps gain a clearer understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATTN: ENVIRONMENTALISTS--DO NOT KILL ANOTHER TREE!","review":"If you are looking for a good book in explaining a series of revolutions this is not what you want. Although it had many good factual references, he made you read 300 pages to extract about 3 pages of useful information. Not only did he ramble on incessantly, he also would jump from one revolution to another with no distinct change in thought. You may read 5 pages thinking it was one revolution and then he finally tells you, and probably accidentally, which he is speaking of. The opinions and knowledge he presents in the book are those than anyone can access through a good teacher, or even a mediocre book!! Save your $!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great easy but inspiring read.","review":"I read this book in 1973 when only a few years older than the author. It was a great story of grit and determination of a youth in early manhood who had not yet found his way in life. In a mere 131 days and 2,500 miles of hiking alone Eric became a man experiencing physical, emotional and mental extremes.Now 30 years later even with the passage of time, it still makes a good, easy, but inspiring read of an adventure that with current technology (cellular phones especially) could not be repeated.

I found the story and the characters completely unsavory and, while the irony did not at all escape me, I felt almost sickened seeing the way some humans treat one another. Don't get me wrong, I like historical movies and (especially) British mysteries, but most of them have some redeeming values; however, I could not find any in this film. I thought Glen Close's character was snakelike and repellent and can't imagine why any man with half a brain would want to sleep with her, much less go to a lot of trouble to do it. I did try to watch \\"Valmont\\" because I like Colin Firth, but this whole story is just too offensive to me to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisate","review":"An amazingly intricate and brilliant plot-line, acted in an understated yet powerful way by Close and Malkovitch. I never cease to get the chills as the power struggle between these two lovers reaches it's peak."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly amazing film.","review":"The leading actors are all magnificent in this diabolic plot that is created for the pleasures given by revenge and to obtain redress, and most of all is the result of vanity and a desperate longing for absolute power. The drama that is produced in front of us with such beauty and ease shows of an amount of cruelty that is matchless. The two main characters of Glenn Close and John Malkovich sets of a series of events that is not only to devastate the lifes of others, but ultimately to destroy their own. All because of their refusal to see clearly what emotions they are driven by and the nature of their desires. Finally, Michelle Pfeiffer has never been more radiant. With her fragile and restrained appearance that hides remarkable strength and courage to overcome that fragility she was born to play the part of Mme de Tourvel whose passionate heart becomes her ruin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty venom.","review":"This is a flawless film, from the stunning costume design and location scenery, to the incredibly exact and jaded performances. This may be the best work Close has done, which is no small compliment. Malkovich brings a sense of pervading dirtiness to the Vicomte, and Kurtz is a hoot as the smarmy Madame de Volanges. The direction is laser sharp. Don't watch it if you like your entertainment mindless and sentimental. This is a hard film, about deceipt and corruption: basic human nature magnified to the nth degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"perhaps one of the finest movies i have ever seen","review":"The casting in this film is remarkable. Placing John Malkovich as Valmont was ingenious. Despite the fact that he does not have convential good looks, one can easily see why he might be irresistable. By the end of the movie, the viewer is so intrigued by the character, that he becomes the sexiest man in the world. Michelle Pfifer also puts in a great performance - just the right blend of innocence, strength, and inevidably weakness. In addition, Glenn Close put in her best performance ever. If you have never seen it, by all means, go rent it. you will be amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating and heartbreaking","review":"This is a movie that I could easily watch 100 times over... The acting is simply superb. All of the characters come off so multi-faceted.. Are they good? Are they bad? Are they all victims of circumstances? It's hard to say.I love this movie because it makes me FEEL and it makes me THINK.. Goodness, how it frustrates me, but it does capture me. It is a really compelling film.I am someone who watches movies for the characters more than the story-- I like to see them, and empathize with them. If you understand what I mean by that, then you'd probably like this film, because it is driven completely by the characters. Who they are and what they do determines what happens, and you cannot help but get pulled in. GREAT GREAT performances by John Malkovich and Glenn Close, as the scheming and manipulative former lovers, and by Michelle Pfeiffer, as the innocent woman they set out to corrupt.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex Is Best Used As A Deadly Weapon. Excellent Satire On The Upper Class.","review":"This adaptation of the novel \\"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\\" which is based on a play adapted from the novel (like the 1931 film version of \\"Dracula\\") is really very good. Glenn Close and John Malkovich are excellent as former lovers who scheme to destroy the lives of others. The writing is very sharp, and witty. Michelle Pfeiffer is also quite good, as are Uma Thurman (long before she set out to \\"Kill Bill\\"), Keanu Reeves (in a very small role) and Swoosie Kurtz. I recommend this film only for a one-time viewing, though; two or three at most. Unless absolutley required by the storyline (ie. \\"Schindler's List\\" or \\"Excalibur,\\") I see no need for nudity in a movie, especially in a period piece.

I like historic movies that have bite and this one has it. First of all, the actors are superb in the roles they play. Everyone romanticizes the 17th, early 18th century. An era of fancy dressed men and pompadour women of the elite class. The ideaology of the time, the mind-set, and philosphy of those times is starkly portrayed.

However, Valmont also wishes to seduce and disgrace a remote beauty (Michelle Pfeiffer), totally uncaring and unaware of the tragic outcome that will envelope them both.The stellar cast also includes Keanu Reeves (THE MATRIX, PARENTHOOD), Swoosie Kurtz (LITTLE GIRLS IN PRETTY BOXES, REALITY BITES) and veteran Mildred Natwick (THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY).The DVD transfer is gorgeous and has a dynamic 5.1 sound mix that shows off the beautifully dramatic score by George Fenton.Remade as VALMONT (starring Colin Firth and Fairuza Balk) and CRUEL INTENTIONS (starring Ryan Phillippe)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone, but not forgotten","review":"I really liked orange craisins & I was sorry to learn from the Ocean Spray website that they have been discontinued.

I know the company has to make decisions based on business, but I hope that they will consider putting orange craisins back on the shelf.

In Golgo 13, you get all the above. In fact, this anime is more of a soft-core Hentai then a drama about a professional killer. This could of done with out the sexual content, and used that time to develop the plot more. The plot is good as long as you can get past the unnecessary Hentai scenes.

Walk for 2 1/2 hours in 100+ degrees, just to find the road you were on appears to have vanished? Don't hurry back, hell, take a precarious trail down so you can explore a bunch of wrecks there and pick up a lice ridden teddy bear for your little girl. Your family pet runs off into the middle of nowhere? Insist on sitting back down for dinner while you let your young son go off after it. Sense danger? Let your young son grab a gun and go outside (duh, Mom?). And that's just in the first 40 minutes. By the time we get to the radioactive mutants, the story has lamed itself so much that it's hardly worth watching. And the mutant part is so cliched, it is barely worth watching either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie!","review":"For some reason I only owned \\"The Hills Have Eyes 2\\" so I wanted to purchase the first one.

To enjoy the movie just a little more I've come up with my own ending...The little girl who saves the baby lives. The baby's father is grateful to the little girl.

If you want to be scared and psychologically challenged, don't waste your time. It's too bad - the premise for the story could've been developed into something really interesting, but the previews make very empty promises.

The brutal rape scene in this movie alone is enough to turn anyone with any sense off!

And when I think this stuff is geared to the teenage demography - it probably why this country is full of violence against women and violence in general.

Yeah, it's been done a million times.The massacre scene was really awful. This really nice family is in the middle of nowhere. The father is tied and burned to death. While the rest of the family tries to save him, the 2 mutants rape the sleeping teenage daughter. I mean come on, that's so nasty.

There was a scene in this that nearly made me vomit, and it was not because of realistic blood and guts - it had to do with violent sexuality and children. A baby and teenager being involved in a brutal rape scene is just vulgar. Is that really necessary? The only reason a screaming baby would be there is to make it more sickening, c'mon! I watch scary movies for fake blood and guts, not to start thinking about child molestation and traumatized babies. That one scene completely left me thinking nothing but bad things. I don't even remember the rest of it well enough to review it. If you're a woman that's been a victim of any sexual violence, or a mother this scene will likely be too much for you.

Seemingly to make up for the lack of interesting characters, the script-writers/director threw in lots of unnecessary gore. For the most part, though, the special effects were at least well-done; however, a few of the effects were somewhat misguided. For instance, blood on bodies that have been sitting out for awhile in the hot desert is red; wouldn't it dry to brown very shortly in that kind of heat?? Acting was mediocre. I've never seen the original, so I cannot say whether this is better or worse. The movie is not for the faint-of-heart simply because of the gore, but it definitely wasn't very scary.

I upgraded to the stereo version thinking that the box set would be overload. I'm so glad I upgraded again. This is almost a religious experience. The vocals only section of the box set is worth the money. Not to mention the original speed version of Caroline No, which was sped up for the original release of the album.

From recordings of different instrumental and vocal tracks to the final version, it is possible to follow the evolution of each song on the album. The Beach Boys became the Beach Men with Pet Sounds with their leader taking them into musical adulthood.

I think Glenn Close does a fantastic job along with Jeff Bridges.But truthfully, Bridges acting gives away the conclusion that he did it - around 40 minutes into the movie (if not sooner).

Part of its appeal, I think, is the viewer's familiarity with the suspense/courtroom drama genre. We know how these films go, and this one has all the elements: a handful of suspects, a conflicted defense attorney, a victim with a complicated past, and a likeable defendant on trial. The writing, acting and directing make these familiar materials into a particularly enjoyable film though, through their attention to detail and craft.If you enjoy watching real pros work their changes on a familiarconvention, you'll enjoy this entertaining suspense flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace and Happiness","review":"Aura Cacia's Sweet Orange essential oil reminds me of fresh-squeezed orange juice.

My plea: do not! They are made from mineral oil (a euphemism for petroleum), and excitotoxins. Despite their plesant smell, they are not healthful.

It provides a thoroughly biblical explanation of how God lovingly works ALL things in the believer's life together for good, will help you avoid thinking 'hard thoughts' of God and generally buoy your faith with that wonderful, pastoral M.

The real treasure lies in the dark reality of songs like \\"Local God\\", \\"Whatever\\", and \\"To You I Bestow\\" (arguably THE best song on this album). \\"Kissing You\\" is a wonderful love song, appropriately placed, and \\"Little Star\\" provides a calming lift after the turmoil of the rest of the album.This album is unquestionably a must for anyone who shows even a remote interest in music.

This is terribly naive.(Plus it's more than a bit incestuous, but I guess less so than the Bible.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her standard","review":"I adore Katherine Forrest's mysteries and Curious Wine is simply exquisite and I'm an SF fan, so it seemed like this would be a perfect match, but I'm afraid to say this novel was very disappointing. It felt very dated and cliche. The story moved at an insane speed with little or no support for some jumps of plot and logic. A good SF novel uses the alternative setting to free readers from expectations, but needs to have a logic in and of itself, but this felt like the SF backdrop was an excuse for implausable deus ex machina jumps in the plot. Very much \\"it doesn't have to make sense, it's SF.\\" Still, this is a classic of lesbian feminist utopian fiction and it was worth reading on that level."},{"rating":"1","title":"A not so interesting attempt at Lesbian Sci-Fi","review":"I was very dissappointed with Forrest's attempt at Lesbian Sci-Fi. After being totally tantalized by Curious Wine, I had high expectations about her work. This book was odd, incestuous, and lacked suspence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight Circus - Perfect for Halloween or Performing!","review":"After searching through dozens of CDs to find just the right music for my act, I finally came across Michael Hedstrom's \\"Midnight Circus\\" and have fallen in love with it. Hedstrom's music is the perfect blend of circus/carnival with an eerie haunted house and quirky \\"Munsters\\" or \\"Addams Family\\" feel to it. As a sideshow performer, I find that it works great as background music for acts like fire-eating, the human blockhead and sword swallowing. If you are a performer or are looking for some great music for your haunted house this Halloween, I would highly recommend giving this one a spin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Halloween Circus Music","review":"Awesome CD, we created a clown room in a haunted house this year and had this CD to fill in for sound affects.

The music is dark and haunting. I would however like it to be a little faster tempo. But I think it will work nicely with other cds I have purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"good introduction to museums","review":"I found this to be a good introduction to the history of museums and collecting, which really got at the idea of how collecting and displaying art is about far more than aesthetics. In fact, it made me re-think some of my assumptions about museums. For instance, museums have not always been seen as public places. And, as the author points out, even public museums convey someone's interpretations of the objects on view. The person who controls the museum controls the way the public thinks about art and history. It was really an eye-opening book. I don't think I'll look at museums in the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"Product is good .

There are two settings for different types of purifying. Helps me breathe better with both! Pretty quiet too, actually I sort of like the very low steady noise.

But this was definitely worth the sale price I paid for it, especially when comparing prices with other brands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Irish, mystical, and romantic","review":"This book reads like poetry. May be the most beautifully written book I've ever read. As an English major, I know a good book when I see one. This one is breathtaking! I do not read books more than once, this one I've read over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take your time with this one","review":"I read this novel after enjoying McBride's later book, The Land of Women. There are very few books that I will rate with 5 stars, but this is one of them. Every review mentions McBride's prose, but with good reason. I refuse to use the words \\"lyrical\\" or \\"luminous\\" to describe it (ugh), but McBride's writing style is unparalleled. Her writing has its own rhythm, it's orginal, it's effective, and it's absolutely beautiful. McBride takes the reader into darker themes, yes, butshe does so very, very gracefully. I found this book to be an aesthetic joy to read, but it also provided the escape (in this case, to drizzly Ireland coast) that we readers like make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read!","review":"Sure, it's melancholy. But it's so beautifully written and there are so many layers to these characters. This is a story that stays with you long after finishing. I'll definitely be picking up McBride's second novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting yet gripping...","review":"This book was unlike most books out there. The author has an incredible way of describing the most simple things and it really paints a vivid picture for the reader. The characters were all very interesting as was the storyline. It took a twist at the end that no one in the world would have expected. At first I thought the twist would be the demise of the mood the writing had created, however that was not the case. This was the author's first book and I cannot wait for the next one. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like an intelligent, haunting, and vivid read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Breaking","review":"To say that this book broke my heart is not enough. This book hurt me. Without giving away the plot and any secrets within it, I simply recommend this book to people who have the time and desire to read something new, different, and essentially life-changing. Not an easy read, emotionally or literally, but very recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy romance novel","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I only finished it because it was selected by my book club. Full of long flowery descriptions and a short predictable plot. At one point the author even describes in flowery language the experience of peeing on one's own feet as a pleasurable experience. The passion is this book will gross you out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Sorry to disagree with the majority on this one. It started off well but soon descended into drek. The author seemed to be trying way too hard to create a magical-mystical Celtic creature out of her protagonist (who really was nothing more than a selfish girl who wanted her way at any cost). Kathryn Harrison didn't succed in glorifying incest (IMO), and neither can McBride. If you want good Irish lit, go back to Joyce or read Jane Urqhart, William Trevor, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good read","review":"This is a very enjoyable book which mixes the magic and mystery of Ireland, spirits, and selkies into one story about a girl growing up and searching for information about her parents' identities and her own. Even though her mother is alive for much of the story, she isn't forthcoming with details, and Clodagh feels she hardly knows her mother, especially her mother's past. Clodagh's dead twin sister often feels as if she too is nearby. The truth about her parents, and also herself, comes as a surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"sexploitation","review":"Songs full of moaning, heavy breathing and sexual innuendo, none of which requires much talent.

You don't necessarily have to like the saxophone to enjoy these--you just need to be the type of person who is galvanized by such memorable tunes as \\"Harlem Nocturne,\\" \\"Street Scene,\\" or \\"One Mint Julep.\\" Great stuff. Incidentally, on this CD, and on volumes 7 to 11, there is a very enjoyable and amusing bonus track (it's not listed, but it's there after the last \\"real\\" CD track). Listening to a continental playboy-type wooing his lady while a lush organ percolates in the background is one of the highlights of these and the other five volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultra Lounge is fun","review":"Again, as with my other Ultra Lounge purchases, these compliations are great fun to mix together on your ipod and have drinks with friends on the patio during a hot summer night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Sax?","review":"Another get what you pay for thing.

Model# 1181 is the same as model# 1178. The only difference is that model# 1181, includes the technical data printed in french and english. Model# 1178 is printed in english only. This may explain why the description states \\"Canada Only\\". Why pay the extra cost to receive the owner's manual in french and english. I have pointed this error out to Amazon, but it appears they're not willing to correct their error.Model# 1183, which Amazon has pictured, has the additional feature of FM radio. The buyer would not be aware of this issue unless they had research the manufacturer's web site. Buy model# 1178 instead and avoid the nightmare of trying to explain to Amazon that they are at fault.

The other one had issues on the lenses.Will never purchase from them again!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to perfect!","review":"These sunglasses are great. I've had mine about 5 years now. The other review is correct about the silicone/plastic ear tips - they dry rot within about 4 years. I could not find replacement tips anywhere - not even from the Ray-Ban site. I just bought a pair of $5 specials that looked like they would work and pulled off the tips and put them on my Ray-Bans. Not perfect, but it extended the life another year before the ear frame piece broke (today! rats!).In spite of these drawbacks, I'm buying another, identical pair. What can I say; they look great and I like how the lenses don't re-color the scene. Maybe this time I'll wipe some Armor All on the ear tips every now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty pathetic, definitely a waste of time","review":"I'm a big Hoffman fan, but this one was a stinker. A very generic scriptwith big stereotypes about rock stars, psychiatrists, squares, etc. Very dated and very dull and boring. A lot of scenes where they just let the camera roll on and on while nothing is happening and the dialog goes nowhere. Hoffman's performance is pretty poor, but basically it's not his fault, because there was nothing to work with and I don't know what the point was. I turned it off halfway thru b/c it was too pathetic to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"CT experience","review":"I recently purchased this book and took the registry just 2 days ago. All the reviews I've read said that this was THE book to have and 80% of the questions appeared on the registry. This was not the case for me, unfortunately. I know there are several CT registries out there and quite possibly for some of them this book would be sufficient , however, I didn't find it in my case. The book was beneficial in that it mentally prepared me for answering all those questions and keeping my mind open but questions from this book did not appear on the registry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I used this book to prepare for my CT registry. It was not the only book that I used but I felt that it was very helpful. I took, and passed, my registry in October 2006. This book contained a lot of questions that I actually had on my registry.

I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Helpful","review":"I practically memorized this book. There were only about 5 questions on the registry that were in this book. I found it was VERY outdated. It did help with how the test is outlined, but as for it's content it wasn't helpful at all. I found it overpriced for a thin paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe after taking a CT review class...","review":"Silly me, I followed the advice of others and ordered this book without taking any review classes. It is great if you have already learned everything you need to know for the registry, and need a light review of test questions, but if you have yet to come that far - this is NOT the book for you. If you do not understand why you answered a question incorrectly - too bad! There is no explanation, so you are on your own. CT class first - then this book of questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"I love the answers portion of this book.

The book breaks the year into weeks/with timely family topics, bible verses, and excellent childrens' book recommendations and follow-up family discussion questions. Adults and children alike will be enlightened by the variety of circumstances discussed with a very open mind. This is the first book like this that I have seen and you won't be disappointed. Topics range from baseball and the \\"Amazing Mets\\", to miscarriage, abortion, death, Christmas, discipline,moving..and on and on. It's a wonderful book for today's busy families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, frightening but exaggerated","review":"'Sverige Sluten Anstalt' is Ulf Nilsson's attempt at 'The Rise and Fall of the Swedish Welfare State.' The book seems well-researched and does a decent job of discrediting part of the widespread belief that 'the swedish model' is a golden compromise between capitalism and socialism that should be admired and imitated. The book traces the rise of swedish social democracy in the early 30s through neutrality/collaboration in the Second World War to its expansion and peak in the early 1970s to its continuing downfall during the last 30 years. It is unfortunate that the author sometimes lets his very strong personal feelings take over and make the book less objective and its arguments weaker. Still, the book is a sobering and quite frightening account, short on optimism for the future, but never the less very interesting and informative. It's worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good yarn that tails off at the end.","review":"I liked the way this book was put together. However, I think that Card chose an easier option than what you would think (and not in a good way, per se).

Card has a talent for making his characters relate-able and believable. I have to give him props for creating black characters that aren't as flat as the paper the words are printed on. Also, I'm glad he didn't fill the pages with the broken made-up ghetto language that most white authors believe Black people speak to one another. Thank you Mr. Scott-Card."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well told story. Imaginative.","review":"This is not a scifi or fantasy novel and not what I expected from this author. It is however a well told story as are the other novels that Card has written. This one is about magic. Its set in Baldwin Hills, California. Based on the descriptions in the story and in the Acknowledgements section at the end I can even look at the location for the story on Google Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"yah..","review":"I like Orson Scott Card.. but when he starts talking about black people I just want to cringe. I'm still in the process of reading the book as it's just one of those you can't put down even if you try to. As a black person I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone who doesn't truly understand the black culture as this might give someone an off representation about how it really is to be black. It seems like Card tried really hard to get his characters right and I think it was nice of him to try... I think he just tried too hard to address racial and age related issues. The actual story is pretty intriguing if you're able to get past everything else... Read it if you'd like, but just remember that these are characters and not real people. Honestly, black people don't really think about their color all the time. They only think of it when they're reminded of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least favorite Orson Scott Card book","review":"I've read and enjoyed just about everything Orson Scott Card has written; however, this book falls far short of his usual riveting storytelling. I found myself looking forward to the end of the book, rather than wanting it to continue on forever like the Ender Series.His attempted use of cultural lingo just seemed to be a bit off. Rather than pulling me into the story, it just made me sigh and wish for characters that spoke clearly.I'll continue to buy and read his other works because he's still one of the most talented authors around, but rest assured I will not be buying any Magic Street sequel should he decide to pen one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jam, Jam, Jam, Jam Jam","review":"I have seen two or three of this model jam on almost every document larger than 10 pages.

They are great to use as part of a church service to add a little Christmas or Easter flavor, for example.I or others have simply read them (sometimes in costume) and they went over well. Churches with extensive drama teams will probably not find these useful. But small and medium churches with small or no drama groups could find these a great way to demonstrate the value of drama.If you are looking for another \\"layer\\" for church services, this is a great place to start.

Even to the average musician, music theory can sometimes be hard to grasp. However, with the simple but sufficient explanations, this book is definately the best one on the market today. Used with the workbook and possibly a supplimental anthology, students can get a thorough grasp of the theoretical concepts from early music to 20th century music including a bit of jazz, pop, and modern music genres. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you already know how to read music?","review":"If so, this book is a total waste of money. You learn how to read notes, rhythms, intervals, accidentals, and eventually chords on all the clefs. Tenor and alto clefs can easily be Wikipedia-ed any time. The book also eventually teaches you analysis and figured bass, integrating music history and all that good stuff, but the bottom line is that if you've played an instrument to any level of competency before, or know any shred of music theory, this is a waste of your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Use","review":"I was originally taught music theory from an impractical text. The descriptions were not very straightforward and seemed calculated to make the writers sound refined. Now I'm using Music: In Theory and Practice to review my knowledge, and it's so much better! Descriptions are plain, without nonsense, and the function of music is presented clearly. If I'm not mistaken, my father used an earlier edition of this good text for college in the 1960s. Clean, streamlined, sensible, and time-tested, this product is commendable."},{"rating":"1","title":"magellan power card","review":"The prongs on the reciever end does not make good contact.

Before the end of the first Summer I could hear a rattle in the small plastic box in the middle of the cable (the power supply regulator) and the adapter no longer worked.Since I am a Tech. and used to fixing things in the field, I pried the box apart and found that a small coil had seperated from the circuit board but as handy as I am I could not repair this unit.The ATV had never been used on very rough terrain and the Magellan GPS unit itself worked just fine so rough usage was not a problem. My conclusion was that this was a very poorly constructed power cable and I would not own and depend on another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screwed by ANTonline","review":"ANTonline sent me the wrong item and then wanted nothing to do with me when I went to exchange it.

After days of persistance and me being as rude to them as they were to me, they agreed to take the product back, but I had to eat the first shipping charge, pay to ship it back to them and pay a 20% restocking fee (for thier error!!)

It's one of those annoying packages that require disk 1 in the CD drive for operation.

The resolution appears to average about 50 kb per page with compression of about 30:1 or so - not hi-rez. I'm using a 2GHz, dual processor G5 with an Apple Studio screen, so obsolete hardware isn't the problem. The program won't run in OS X and it appears to be one of those packages that won't age well.

The first three songs on this album belie the fourth, which comes off as overly repetitive and stagnant.The obviously synthesized music comes off as very technically displeasing, as one does not expect (nor should expect) computers to do the work of old folklore, as their ability to scare is about as non-dimensional as their personality. Personally, I have seen better music from unsung heroes of television and movie fame as well as virtual unknowns in the music industry.The track titled \\"Storm\\" provides nothing more than about 3/4 of a second of fake rain sound on permanent loop and approximately three different lightning strike sound effects with only a hint of wind.

I printed out laffin-boy's measuring chart from his Amazon review, and when I got the spoons, took an electric engraver and engraved the correct fractions on the back of each spoon handle. NOW they fulfill the purpose for which I bought them......to precisely measure out 1/16 teaspoon of a progesterone cream, to which I am very sensitive.

I have always thought Dani Filth's vocals have been at their peak during Cradle's 'black' days. But the thing is, unlike a lot of other Black Metal bands around, Cradle of Filth can still be very melodic. Dani Filth is my favourite lyric writer.

The maps loaded by the software are pretty consistently wrong by about 200m. In most situations, this will get you DANGEROUSLY lost.The GPS itself is generally very accurate, so if you put in waypoints from a real mapping program, like the National Geographic TOPO! Series, you'll get where you need to be. Using the Magellan software, unless you know how far off it is where you are, can be outright dangerous.My worst experience with this was trying to navigate jungle on Kauai, but I have found it no better, in terms of accuracy (but the fact that you can see the terrain makes it less of a problem) in Southern CA and Northern Baja.The software also has not been updated in over 2 years, and no update info is available on Magellan's site."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very very bad product from Magellan","review":"As a matter of fact, maps are almost all inaccurate, from 100 to about 1000 feet. Also, the software itself is outdated. It looks like a Windows 95 software. Regarless how many times people positively reviewed it, Mapsend is unarguably not as good as the Magellan GPS units: I personally purchased the Meridian platinum. But what is the purpose of having a good GPS if the software does not compute routes accordingly?In addition, uploading maps into the unit is not as easy as I would have expected.Of course, this software will never compete with an expensive OEM Car Navigation System (Navtech is producing all the maps for almost all car navigation system, Magellan is not using Navtech maps) The first purpose of the handheld GPS is outdoor, not driving. But for the most part, hiking trails are omitted, this is the biggest shortcoming. What does Magellan believe an outdoor GPS is made for? back and forth?DON'T BOTHER"},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, Inaccurate, Expensive","review":"-Outdated:Street data is at least 3 years old, based on known construction dates for roads in my area (N. Dallas, TX). Both major roads and secondary roads are missing.-Inaccurate:Streets, trails, intersections, and points of interest are usually off by 100 yards or more. This makes the software essentially useless for navigation.Search by address feature generally places bullseye 10-15 addresses away from correct spot.On the positive side: Elevation data is very accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS SOFTWARE","review":"WARNING! Even though this topo software has accurate (though several years old) information for streets, rivers and some other things, it doesn't have good info for the things you want from a topo map - elevations and section lines. It shows a creek on our farm FLOWING OVER 100 FEET UPHILL! Ouch! The creek info is accurate, but the topo lines are from some other location. Heck, maybe they're fractals, I can't tell. It's a lot of money for this level of quality. I'd demand a refund if it hadn't been included with the SporTrak Topo, which I like.I emailed them a week ago and haven't heard back.The PC-side software is generally pretty user-friendly, but lacks a few minor features that I'd like to have, such as the ability to multi-select waypoints, for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Map info is off! Magellan says \\"sorry about that!!!!\\"","review":"I bought the MapSend Topo software, along with a 32MB memory card, to use with my new Meridian Marine GPS. What I've found so far is that the map locations shown in detail on the GPS screen are consistently off from the actual location. In the Pacific NW the error is moderate--when I drive down a street it shows me off to one side--consistently. In California it showed me off consistently by 1/2 block. In Hawaii it was consistently off by 1/4 mile!!!! Not very good when using the map data for hiking.I talked to Thales Navigation's customer support and they are aware of this problem. There is nothing you can do to correct the map's offset from reality. This seems to be related to the low quality of map that the support person stated they get for free from someone. The CD lists Woodalls (as in RV and campground guides) as a co-conspiritor, so I suspect the map data is from them...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"Like other reviewers have said, I found the GPS off by 50-500 feet.

It is excellent when used for navigating in a car or on a trail. OK, not EVERY road and trail is in there, but most are. And most are fairly close to reality. The software may not keep you from driving or walking off a cliff, it was never intended for that purpose. In order to fit the entire USA on one CD, and to allow the maps to fit on your GPS, corners were cut to minimize file sizes. But if you are lost, it can help you get back on track, and that's what I need most.This software is available as a bundle at most Magellan vendors, that is the cheapest way to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Map Send Topo We miss the trails","review":"Topo map is great.

Good luck.This put aside this is a great tool.Yves"},{"rating":"1","title":"MapSend Topo Limitations","review":"There are two limitations I've encountered in the very short time of use. Item #1 - The implamentation of the GPS to the software is very poor. Apperently MapSend, Streets and Topo, were written for the 330 GPS unit. Magellan has chosen to use the same software for the Meridian series. As a result, it's not a very clean solution. There are many work-arounds and bandaids just to get it to work. Most inconvenient! Item #2 - For the most part, hiking trails are omitted. Even the most popular trails here in the NW are not to be found in Topo. Question - Why else would one by a topo software package if not to see and locate trails?I've only had this software for one week and to find these two problems so quickly, leads me to believe I've yet to find additional limitations.Phil"},{"rating":"1","title":"MapSend Topo Review","review":"I've had MapSend Topo for about a week now and I'm not impressed with it for the following reasons: 1. Doesn't contain trails. Why would anyone purchase a topo software package and not want trails? Big oversight by Magellan. 2. Doesn't recognize new zip codes or towns. I've had my zip code for almost 4 years...Topo says it's invalid. Can't find my friend's zip in VA either. One would think that Magellan would have up-grades on their web site that would up-date things like cities and zip codes. By the way, it's the same for MapSend Streets. 3. Too many bandaids and work-arounds to get a map into the GPS. Lots of rules here. No maps larger that 8Meg and only 4 of those or the GPS unit will lock-up. Haven't tried that yet but I'll take Magellan's word on it...By the way, it does work with WindowsXP. No problems there for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Maps and Overpriced Software","review":"I am pretty computer savy and I had no real trouble installing and using the program. I did find the programs buttons and workings a bit arcane, but usable nonetheless. Where I ran into extreme dissatisfaction after spending [hard earned cash], was that the topo maps are way off. I use my gps extensively in the woods for navigating. I could watch my GPS and follow my position readings and see that that I had changed elevation by 500 feet. The maps from this topo cd would say that I only changed elevation by 10 or 20 feet. These maps are way off...the idea is good: Have your position displayed on a screen on top of a topo with countour lines etc. The problem is the maps are not usgs and in many cases are very inaccurate. GPS's are great. If you don't have one buy one. But don't waste your money on these maps. Wait and buy U.S. Geological Survey maps when they become available in GPS software form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magellan - Don't Waist Your Money !","review":"I do like the Merdian GPS Units themselves, but Magellan is seroiusly behind others when it comes to software. On that note, I would have to say until Magellan can get their act together - go elsewhere! The Mapsend Topo software, is what most other reveiws say- Inaccurate, no updates, no trails, no water topography data, etc... Also, if you have a Marine use- currently no software is available to show you the real stuff you want- the charts. Magellan soposedly has one coming out in 2003 Q1, but I don't know if I can trust it with how poor their other software applications have been. They really need to improve before they can compete and I think it is all on the software end. As I said earlier, the Maridian hardware is very nice, but they need much better software to make the package complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning !!!","review":"I just purchased this mapsend (topo) software. The maps are very good so far. When you open the box DO NOT follow their directions if you have a Meridian unit !!! Do NOT load the base map as it will turn your unit into a Map 330 unit and it will crash and need to be replaced per Magellan. While looking at the maps on my computer I found the detail quite satisfactory. They show all the info I was looking for and then some. If you know how to read a topo map you should find these to your liking. One other drawback that they are working on is the file size that can be downloaded to the unit. It is only 32MB. They are working on a patch for this problem though. For ease of use you may want to get an SD card reader to speed up the download process. You don't need to connect your gps unit to the computer this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful!","review":"Be sure you understand that the Topo maps on this CD do not contain trails like USGS 7.5 minute topo maps before you spend the money to buy it!! Granted, some trails are on the maps, but generally only if they are the size of 4WD jeep roads. Most trails less than that didn't make it. Very frustrating for me because I wanted Topo for hiking and mountain biking. I've since found out this problem is not just Magellan - it's all Topo software maps out there, Garmin and others too.If, however, you only want the software to plot trails you've already walked and recorded with the handheld, and then look at elevation change etc., it's probably a good product. But for navigation and planning it's worthless for trails."},{"rating":"1","title":"not compatible with windows XP...","review":"well since most of us will use this product with XP...considering it is also not compatible with Macintosh either..

I was really surprized at how fun this game was. But the graphics weren't all that good. The fighting moves are a little slow and its hard to keep your girl on the ground. The arrow on the top of the screen is very very helpful especially on the timed missions. So in conclusion, this is a great game and worth the money. Still, it could have had better graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"At first glimpse I assumed the game was more of an RPG and you can choose the girls as individuals.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!","review":"First of all i did not buy this on amazon. The price was to high for a kids game. I just wanted because i like the powerpuff girls. Now i am glad i did not buy it on amazon. I saw it for $5 at gamestop. Now i know why it was only $5 it was one of the worst games i ever played! The gameplay was stupidly hard for a kids game. the controls were terrible. There is an arrow that is supposed to direct you where you are going but it always points you to the wrong direction. The worst part is that it is very repetitive and super annoying. Don't buy this game even if your a fan of the powerpuff girls. Don't even buy it for your kids because they will also get frustrated.

It is written in the great narrative style of Steven Ambrose, Cornelius Ryan, and Bruce Catton. The reader is transported to the pathos of the Summer of 1945. It is a work that has deserved greater attention. Outstanding, vigorous scholarship, coupled with a poignancy and urgency that can create a visceral response on the part of the reader (especially in the Hiroshima narratives), it deals honestly with the likes of Stalin, Molotov, Churchill, Truman, and Hirohito. The only limitation is that the Pottsdam material is at times a bit tedious---however it is an important inclusion if one is to understand some of the policy issues behind the denouement of the war, as well as the policy issues that framed the Cold War. Once beyond Pottsdam, however, the book soars as a tragic poem about both the frailties as well as the aspirations of the human experience. Kudos, kudos, and more kudos!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Enough","review":"Eighteen tracks, plus a bonus, and probably 7 really good ones. All in all, a good collection.

Ya gotta like \\"Underwater Chase,\\" from the original album \\"Music To Read James Bond By.\\" An then there's the obligatory Burt Bacharach track, \\"Call Me\\" by the New Classic Singers. It's replete with those ubiquitous \\"bah bah buh-buh\\" non-lyrics, evoking those long-banned Benson&Hedges cigarette commercials.

The space between the supports and the chair was too wide!! His elbow was nearly dislocated when we removed it!!We contacted Evenflo, who gave us the NEW version of the chair, which had a much smaller space between the two. We thought this would solve the problem, and since we loved the chair otherwise, were happy.NOW, my daughter, who is 6 months, got her fingers pinched in the holes at the back of the legs that allow for the height adjustment feature.

Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this high chair","review":"The \\"brilliant\\" design engineers at Evenflo designed this chair with the release mechanism in the front of the tray and on the sides of the tray. Kids are very smart...smarter than the design engineers...and they learn fast. My son always reaches for the side release mechanism (he learned how to do this buy simply watching) and pushes the tray off of the chair. As a result, we always have food all over the floor...not to mention the potential hazard of a baby jumping off the chair after the tray is off.Do yourself a favor and do not buy this chair. You always want to look for a chair in which the kids cannot release the tray from the side. You only want to be the one to release the tray from the front.I am most likely going to use this chair as a secondary chair for visitors with kids and have to buy another brand.SUMMARY: THIS CHAIR SUCKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabric is not machine washable","review":"I got the high chair new few months back (May 2008) and once while eating, my kid puked on the chair.

Nico is a beatiful combination of music, lyrics, and vocals. Shannon Hoon's creativity and talents is portrayed throughout the each and every song. In addition to the album itself, Nico is an enhanced CD with many additional features such as: photo collages and a detailed story about the tragic death of Shannon Hoon. Nico is definetly worth checking out. Blind Melon will always be one of the greatest bands that ever was. Their cheerful, touching, and sometimes comical creations will go on forever.

Not only is its construction flimsy (Could they find cheaper plastic-coated wire? How much more would heavy-duty stock cost them?), mine was assembled so poorly that it couldn't sit down flat, no matter how hard I tried. My wife called it \\"The Sinking of the Titanic.\\" It hardly holds the middle tray (maybe because it was so tilted), and just failed to perform as promised. I ended up salvaging an old wire hanging bin from a discarded refrigerator, and that serves the job infinitely better. Don't waste your money. I know there are few of these add-ons on the market, so the choice is pretty thin, and refrigerator manufacturers want you to buy ice-maker equipped machines, but I've had too many issues with them, so I'm back to a 1960's approach, which always works.

Clearly, Mr. Maurer has a lifetime of experience working with very rich people and families whose affairs are very complex. But, if you have any significant property of any kind, the odds are that you fall into the same basket as many others--paying insufficient attention to making sure it works for you and that it gets into the hands you want (e.g., family and friends) rather than the hands you don't want (e.g., Uncle Sam and probate attorneys). This book feels like it's written by an expert, but written for everyone in this situation. I think it's first rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Millionaire Next Door","review":"The jacket and synopsis of this book read like it may have similar content to The Millionaire Next Door.

It is true Amanda can be a bit annoying, but since she is, after all, just the Means by which Heyer contrived to get her hero and heroine together (since, left to their own devices, they are driftingly gently but inexorably apart), I do not mind her. As a heroine, she would have been tiresome: as a catalyst, she's amusing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!!!","review":"It's been a long time since I read such a hilarious romantic adventure. The star of the show is naive but quick-witted heroine Amanda who is traipsing about the countryside trying to pressure her grandfather to consent to her wedding. Poor Sir Gareth is an innocent bystander swept up into her schemes. The book is a treat from start to finish with quick & witty dialogues, fast paced plot and of course, a satisfactory ending, tying up all loose ends. It is not a typical romance where the prettiest girl lands the best looking nobleman. But the story is plausible and by the time it concludes you are convinced that it couldn't possibly have ended any better for the characters!The only, tiny grievance I have is that the relationship between Gareth & Hester is not developed very well at all. I was annoyed at the simpering and shy Hester. But she seems divine next to Amanda's escapades.

The 'anti-hero' characters argue like bickering children and often commit actions that contradict previously established character traits. Each chapter begins with an index entry to describe a character, the ultimate betrayal of the 'show, don't tell' golden rule held by good authors everywhere. The dialogue is full of illogical lines, my favourite example to pick on being \\"This doesn't mean we have a common cause, it just means we all want the wizard dead.\\" One of the greatest qualities of fantasy fiction - that it offers you an escape to a world where heroes still exist - is sadly betrayed when none of the characters are particularly admirable. This isn't a fantasy novel, it's a circus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of action, complex characters","review":"I just finished this and it was superior to Wheel of Time or Fionavar Tapestry books, so if you like those black and white, good vs evil teenager stuff you might want to avoid this.

It makes the usual air conditioner compressor/fan noise of course but also a noise like a bug zapper, a loud crackling buzzing sound which is really irritating. If that noise gets quieter on and off there is a creaking sound and a sound like the compressor or fan motor is really struggling whenever it is set on \\"low\\". It makes so much noise we can't even hear each other talking in the same room. I understand air conditioners are not silent devices but I have had air conditioners twice the BTU of this one that were much, much quieter. Worse yet even when turned up to the top of its cooling range it doesn't manage to cool a tiny room very well.

As I head for the door I turn around to be sure, did I shave my legs for this?\\". These are a few lines from the title track written by Carter and Rhonda Hart. The songs written on this album, some by Carter, and others by Matraca Berg, Randy Scruggs, and Kim Carnes, reflect a woman's journey through falling in and out of love, reassuring us each time that she can handle herself in the best and worst of times. The stand-out single \\"Strawberry Wine\\" is a five-minute waltz of a young woman's first love encounter. \\"Like strawberry wine and seventeen, hot July moon saw everything. My first taste of love oh bittersweet, green on the vine. Like strawberry wine\\". What makes this album beautiful is the marriage of smart, comtemporary lyrics and Deana's Tennessee-backyard vocals, strong when they have to be, sensitive when not, and sweet throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyable CD","review":"I can listen to this cd over and over.

I kept reading for a couple of years out of curiosity, and found it amusing at times, but it has grown tiresome.The two main characters are unrelentingly and obsessively angry. Occasionally, McGruder pokes fun at their anger, but mostly he affirms it. More interestingly, the anger has turned the cartoonist inward. Originally, Huey hurled his anger at the other characters: an inoffensive girl his age, a black man in a mixed marriage with middle class values who wasn't angry enough to be really black, his teacher, etc. But none of these characters deserved it. So instead of having Huey learn and grow, McGruder turned Huey inward. Now, he sits at home or hangs with his only friend in the whole world, and spends his time ranting about all the things he hates.Frankly, Huey has nothing left but anger and hatred, and I suspect that McGruder is not much different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This book and every book he has done is excellent.Aaron McGruder.....

Back to the days of Barry, Sean, and Elliot. The new version of Rockapella that shows up on this CD pales in comparison to the vocal prowess of the Scott, Jeff, Sean, Barry, and Elliot concoction.This CD was full of cover versions of old \\"Summer\\" songs with a few thrown together new ones. The one bright light of this whole cd would be the aforementioned Shambala, which is incredible, with 7 Rockapella members. I bought the album the day it came out, and this was my only reason for keeping it.If you really want Rockapella, pick up 2, or In Concert (Forget about Live in Japan - don't get me started on that!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I have to say that this is one of the best Rockapella albums I've heard yet.

I was looking forward to the release of this album with great expectations, and found it to be over-produced and (much of the time) corny. The whole album sounds thrown together, and the unspeakable things they did to the classic \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" are simply unforgivable. Oh, what might have been! They could have made a masterpiece out of that song, and instead they made a mockery. Now, I'm not saying the album is terrible, just not up to their normal awe-inspiring standards. I did, however, adore Elliots exceedingly cool scat section on \\"Summertime Blues\\". Most of the songs were blended too well, keeping a cold distance from the audience. Thankfully, they will never be able to reproduce this over-blown sound in concert! And with regards to George, I will be diplomatic and simply say, Barry, you will be greatly missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Insider's View Of S/M","review":"This book isn't porn, it's almost an ethnographic study of people engaged in radical sexuality. If you are looking for a glossy wet dream of fantasy girls in leather then this isn't the book you want, but if you wish you could be in the middle of a real S/M scene with real players here it is. Rosen's artistry captures the passion and energy of the moment by using a journalistic soft focus and an amazing sense of what is most important to the participants involved. These are not models posing for the camera, they are players who have allowed Mr. Rosen (and by extension us) a privileged glimpse inside their most personal fantasies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexual Magic, THe S/M Photgraphs","review":"If I could send it back I would.

My son is almost 2, about 24lb and it fit him pretty well except for the helmet. The helmet was too big for even me and I'm a 200+lb adult male. Unfortunately there was a huge problem with the way this outfit was designed around the neck. There's a thin very sharp piece of plastic that goes around the entire neck that the foam is supposed to protect your child from but it does a pathetic job. My son fell once while wearing the outfit and the sharp plastic above the eyeball cut up his neck and underneath his little chin. After putting some bandages under his chin we had to put tape all over sharp plastic edge before we could continue trick or treating. It's really a cute outfit and we got some great pictures but it's stupidly designed and dangerous right out of the box for kids to wear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small size- reasonable product","review":"I bought this costume for my 2 year old (size 2T, 26 lbs, approx 34\\") the costume fit great, could easliy go up to a 3T.

He was 2 at the time. I honestly do not see how this costume could fit a six year old because it fit my 2 year-old perfectly. I would say it would fit up to a size 4.

I wish he could wear it every year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap quality, poor value","review":"This costume is cheaply made and cheaply packaged. The fabric covered foam of the main body is thin and the eye is inserted through slits, not attached. The helmet arrived smashed in and could not be made right by pushing the dented in sections out...it was permanently dented.

Not worth the money!","review":"I read the reviews for this costume and even though a lot were negative, i purchased it anyway ignoring the comments. This was a terrible purchase. For one the hat is the size of my adult head and my son couldn't even wear it with the costume. This costume is said to fit up to a size 7 i think it said. My son is a size 3T-4T and it was hard getting it on it was so small. The fabric is the thinnest crapiest material ever and with little effort i could rip it right in half if i wanted. The eye on the costume is not attached.. it merely slips into little slots.. since it kept stabbing my son in the neck when he would sit, he was able to pull it off with no effort and wouldn't allow it back on. So he walked around without the eye or hat. Next time i will just pay for a sturdy costume from a thrift store for $8 and not feel so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Costume Ever","review":"First of all- my son (at the time) was obsessed with Monster's Inc. I was so excited about finding this costume for him. When it came in the mail he wanted to wear it right away! When we went out on halloween, my husband and I could not believe how many people stopped us commenting on his costume. Seriously- it was ridiculous. I'd have to say that besides my other sons Nemo costume, this has to take the cake! It's not something that everyone will be wearing and the movie is relativiely \\"old\\" so it's not as popular, but I think that's what makes it so special, it's unique. I put my little guy in \\"feetie\\" jammies underneath. He stayed worm, wasn't fidgity. I also had him wear his ugg boots which went underneath the \\"feet\\" of the costume. It was perfect!The eyeball is removeable, which is handy especially when strapping him into his car seat. The pouch for candy is also something that he loved. I recommend if you have a little girl/boy about 3-4, get this costume!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can skip this one","review":"This film had potential, but the storyline collapses and really leaves the audience disappointed. First, let me start with the background music. Music plays an important role in a film. The quirky instrumental that continually played throughout the film set a bad tone. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be watching a thriller or a comedy. Turns out I was watching neither. The film lacked any sort of thrills or edge of the seat terror. The drama was at a minimum, and the few comedic moments fall flat. If you're watching this for Hayden, you'll be disappointed. She doesn't have alot of dialogue. If its Tim Daly you want, well, his character is a total bore. Overall, the reveal at the end is a let down. The film is only 77 minutes long, but I still felt I've been cheated precious moments of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this rate 5 stars?","review":"This had good potential but it just fell flat.

Why?Because yet again, the captions were NOT on the DVD.So, yet again, I have had to apply in order to get another refund.It really annoys me that some companies do not seem to be aware of what is needed to show the captions and do notinstall a menu option for switching the captions on or just don't bother putting them on.This makes me appreciate the hard work that some DVD companies do in order to make sure their DVDs arecaptioned properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, overwrought suburban design ideas","review":"If your taste in design runs to pretentious, overwrought suburban kitsch, then by all means buy this book. Otherwise, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere for bathroom design ideas. Containing very little practical information, each visual image presented was more horrible than the last. Bathrooms jammed with knicknacks like little miniature doll houses and exercise equipment. Bathrooms that appeared to double as sitting rooms with overstuffed furniture, and so on. Impractical, expensive, and ugly. yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best thing is the cover","review":"The best bathroom is the one on the cover of the book.

This is not even close to Goldeneye which one of the reviewers below had stated. The graphics are so-so, and the gameplay gets kind of boring after just a few run-throughs. To summarize...if you like games such as Doom, then you'll probably like this as a portable. If you think it's going to be like Goldeneye, then don't even bother and save your money for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISSAPOINTMENT SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"This game is terrible. Also very fake, for example, I used an entire G-11 Machine Gun clip on one SWAT soldier, Doom is Much better.Terrible storyline and very bad gameplay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Game that Tried to be Wolfenstein....But Why?","review":"First off, let me start off by saying, that i bought this game, and by later that day I was taking it back. For me, personally I like eye-candy style games which keep my attention through wonderful gameplay and amazing graphics. I must say, for the most part, that this game bored me, lacked the graphics that I normally enjoy, the depth of gameplay was prehistoric, and personally I would pick a third person side-scroller any day over this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!What a fun game!","review":"Let me begin by saying this:Ecks vs.Sever is undoubtably the best fps out for gameboy advance.This game is simple,fun,solid and just plain enjoyable for anyone craving some shooting action on the go.Games like Evs.S are why I bought a GBA!The graphics to E.vs.S are very nice clean and animated smoothly(although it is a bit pixy up close).The enemies are well designed and easy to recognise on GBAs small screen as well as tough.The cool thing about E.vs.S is the crossover between the charecters,for example:one point in the game you have to snip sever,but when you play as sever you must avoid becoming snipped.Eks vs.Sever is a SUPERB GBA title and should not be missed by any shooting fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"It keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat!!!","review":"In this book you are always guessing.

This is the worst formatted book I have received for my Kindle!!! There is no punctuation to tell when someone is speaking.Totally frustrating to try to tell if they are speaking or thinking or what, I have to keep rereading to follow the story.

The resume examples in it are also very current & helpful as well.Good Luck on your job hunt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE BOOK","review":"This book is so straight-out-of-high-school, its absurd.

I have gone so many times, and want to live there. But, I hate this movie. They filmed it when W. was brand new, so the trees are small and not all the buildings are the same. The acting is horrible! I would love them to have a new movie becuase they are such a wonderful place. If you love Williamsburg, don't but this. Buy the Tour of Williamsburg movie if you want to see Williamsburg at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational!","review":"In a few short minutes, this film captures the dilemma of ordinary citizens suddenly forced to make a decision that would change the course of history forever. This film offers far greater historical accuracy than the PATRIOT starring Mel Gibson. If you've never visited Colonial Williamsburg, it will make you want to see it. If you've already been there, this is the perfect item to bring back wonderful memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"only redeeming quality is some boobs and even they are not that good","review":"This movie is very lame. Horrible script, horrible writing and horrible acting. Who wrote this thing? It's so corny, and I do NOT mean that in a good or funny way. The only redeeming quality is boobs right? Well, then they should have at least had some hotter girls with better boobs. The opening scene in the locker room is probably the highlight of the movie and it goes downhill from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second-rate teen sex romp","review":"As you could probably tell from the title, this is a pretty simplistic film. The basic plot is a group of 5 ladies going to \\"Band Nationals\\" in Florida have their bus break down and run into a town that celebrates wild and raunchy spring break antics.This movie aspires to such heights of other teen sex comedies as \\"American Pie\\" or even back to \\"Porky's.\\" However, though there are some chuckles, the film really isn't all that funny. You will get some gratuitous nudity, but if you have any interest in anything other than that, you will likely be disappointed in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I love watching movies with lots of topless part's, and trust there where plenty! The story was good and I would watch it again with a group of girls just to see the funny stoniest part's and plus the wet t. Shirt contest was pretty hot I must say, I do love them wet t.

Extras are pretty much standard Clean opening and ending, some concept art and some previews.The show it self is very entertaining and may be one of the best anime to come out in the past 10 years. On the surface it looks like another Evangelion-clone but the series is so much more then that. I really don't know what else to say other then it should be in any anime fan's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Macbeth - rating refers to service not Wm Shakespeare's writing","review":"It is foolish of you to ask for a rating for a Shakespeare classic.

The label on the seat states it is for kids 40 lbs. and 40 inches or more. Going by the Amazon description, I purchased it for my 37 lb. & 39\\" son for a trip to grandma's house and unfortunately discovered this problem while at the airport the first time we tried to use the seat.

There's ample seating room even for big kids, but the seat itself takes no more space than the average adult would. Last but not least, they are remarkably comfy, even during long trips.There are only two reasons I'm not giving it a 5 star rating: (1) The toy box doesn't have any padding on the inside, so little toys tend to rattle inside (very annoying!), and (2) The cup holder has only one size (not adjustable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy it!","review":"Connect3D is not a normal company, it is a fraud company.

Ordered it from Amazon and received it in 1 day. The book was in good shape and the packaging was good too. AWESOME service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Before and After","review":"This set is a good example of what happens when a great band attempts to go commercial. Disc one is Playing the Fool, showcasing the live band at the top of their form. This is an amazing recording. All the players here are amazing multi-intrementalists, and they effortlessly mix straight rock with recorder breaks, glockenspiel trios and electric violin, all played in freakishly complex rhythms and with amazing vocal interplay. Listening to the second disc, then, you wonder where all that went. It's straight guitar-keyboard rock here. There's still a Gentle Giant flavor here, and this is definitely not a bad album, but the unadventurousness is disappointing. It's easy to see why they broke up after this album was released. Overall, the set is highly recommended. The amazing Playing The Fool far outweighs the relatively weak Civilian."},{"rating":"2","title":"5stars/2stars","review":"Playing The Fool is Gentle Giant's finest recorded live performance. Recorded in 1977 it presents material from the band's finest era. Each cut is terrific as are the performances. Civilian, recorded in 1980, is the weakest in G.G's catalogue. Very little of value here other than perhaps Shadows In The Street. The quality of the this two-fer is, unlike the ONE WAY RECORDS version, terrific. Playing The Fool is highly recommended, Civilian is not...Simon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Sims Forever!!","review":"I've read all of Ms. Sims' other novels and get a thrill each time she issues up another evening of pure enjoyment. Such is the case with \\"This Time Forever.\\" Ms. Sims' characters are \\"adults\\" with all pretenses striped away. That is what makes her novels stand out amoung the crowd of authors. Her characters don't simper and coo their way into each other's lives. Rather they march to a different drummer, heads up, shoulders back and take-no-prisoners attitudes. At the same time, the chemistry between her characters is like molten lava. The women aren't shy and retiring and the men don't have to beat their chests to be seen as men. If you're interested in reading about African American characters who are more than one dimentional, have interesting perspectives and are people you would really like to know, pick up any novel by Janice Sims. She doesn't know how to write an uninteresting novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Movie","review":"I got the chance to see \\"Buds For Life\\" and I really enjoy it! It is a funny movie, which in a way is something that always happens. When kids start to get older, they see how the other sex can cause such an atraction, that their friendship can pass to a second level. To try not to let this happen can be complicated and at the same time funny.I had a great time watching this movie, I really recommend it, you'll be laughing the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 5-, 4-, and 1-year old LOVE these videos!","review":"I got these because my 5-year old is improving his reading, my 4-year-old still needs to master his letters, and my 1-year old can always use a head start. Within a week or two, my 4-year-old is saying \\"C, like C-C-Cold!\\" I also wondered how to introduce the simple math, and Math Circus is awesome. I totally recommend these for just about any age (my 10-year-old nephew is also entertained by them), and they're well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alasks's Wolfman","review":"This book is a great read and one that will be enjoyed by naturalists, hunters, trappers, and adventurers.

Easy to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"Alaska's wolf man is an adventure everyone should read.Frank Glaser did everything from traping to dog sled freight hulling to government hunting. he knew how to hunt even the smartest animals and train the best sled dogs.

Myself, and many of my fellow Alaskans have read this book and enjoyed it greatly. It is full of history and adventurous tales about Alaska. Anyone with a love for the outdoors, wildlife, hunting or trapping would love this book! Rearden has a wonderful way of telling a story which draws you in. I couldn't put this book down until I had read it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Alaskan Hero","review":"Frank Glaser's story is a real, first hand look at Alaska in the early days. If you love Alaska and the wilderness, this is the book for you. Frank goes into the back-country and his adventures never cease as he traps, hunts, builds, explores and generally just checks things out. It amazes me that he is always so at ease, even in the most difficult of situations. He is the kind of guy you would just love to tag along with (if you could keep up with him!) His stories and accounts bring Alaska to life at a time when few tourists ventured into the back country. Jim Rearden has done a great job in compiling Frank's stories and amazing life. This book has given me a much greater appreciation of a great state...Wonderful Alaska! I doubt if anyone has ever experienced it like Frank Glaser."},{"rating":"2","title":"If There Were 6 Stars - This Would Be It !","review":"I read these type books on a regular basis & this one is head & shoulders above the rest. Captivating, interesting, & very informative. Well written & a true treasure. This should be included in the required reading for wolf relocation advocates & \\"Naturalists\\". Glasser has no axe to grind, simply tells of his adventures & experiences. I assure you, it is time & money well spent !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rarities... for collectors ....","review":"True, it is extremely difficult to find records of organ works by these three composers. So, if you want to acquire their complete works - this is my case - run for this CD. Hora's interpretation appears a little studious, yet (except for Glagolitic Mass' Intrada) I have no basis for comparison.Most reference books don't even care mentionning them. Maybe there is a reason: they are relatively early, minor compositions. Listening to the CD at full length results in experiencing boredom.Finally, if the word \\"complete\\" means something to Mr. Hora, it means something else to me. For example, Leos Janacek composed at least one other opus with organ: \\"Otcenas\\" (Our Father), for mixed choir, harp and ORGAN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, frameable prints.","review":"For anyone who appreciates the lush, organic lines of the Art Nouveau period, this modest collection of poster reproductions will leave you craving more. There are six posters, each one representing the work of a noted artist of the period. I awarded this 4 of 5 possible stars primarily because I feel that the book offers good value for the price asked. However, I feel compelled to comment that the colors seem somewhat \\"flat\\" compared to lithographs I've seen of the same works. All in all, though, the book offers a very affordable peek at some typical examples from an extraordinary (and all too brief) period of art history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great slippers, great experience.","review":"The slippers are very comfy and fit great for a narrow width.

Prestige's version does not fade or dull as the day goes by. Then again, it isn't supposed to since it is waterproof, right?

After about three months, it began malfunctioning. Sometimes, when the phone rang and you tried to answer it, it would not answer. It would also not charge when you put it back on the base, so the battery would go dead and there was nothing we could do. We tried to contact Panasonic to have it fixed, but we kept getting the customer no-service run around and finally gave up. I recently accidentally dropped the phone off the kitchen counter, and the antenna broke-so it's not too durable either. I came to Amazon.com and purchased the VTech VT 1920c digital cordless phone with caller ID - strangly...the same price as this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic fails","review":"I have purchased this phone twice now.

Look somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends on your luck.","review":"The first time I bought it the phone works terrible. The person who receive my call could barely hear me. I return the phone and got a new one as replacement, and it works great. The sound quality is very good and I always like the handy sleek design of Panasonic phones.

Hooker at the time was only known to bluesheads or ghetto dwellers.The Canned Heat, well what more to say. No frills, no wah wah's, just Gibson guitars playing mean mean ol blues. There was no SUPERSTAR \\"Hooker\\", just a bunch of guys that felt the music and laid it down as it was for them at the moment. Very little production or editing, just live blues in the studio.

The sexiness was similar (pretty hot)but the female character was very wishy washy. The setting was Americana/Western which was different than other settings from her. The general plot about a outlaw on the run was a well used one and it did not read as well as Devine's other books.If you want to start out on a better book by her try Desired(This one sizzles!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music by Great Jazz Musicians","review":"I love this CD.

Unfortunately, the author felt obligated at one point to couch the discussion in terms of men's supposed need to control women -- despite the fact that many of the abusive siblings were female. One gets the impression that the author was forced to do this by an feminist editor or as the result of pressure from academic colleagues. He even cites Straus, Gelles & Steinmetz, without mentioning that their research confirmed that wives are as violent as husbands. What's interesting about this is that anyone who's been around feminist academics can't possibly be blind to the fact that women can be incredibly controlling and are capable of all kinds of interesting revenge when thwarted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this book: misprint with pages missing","review":"The copy I received of this book is a misprint: pages 21-52 are missing, while pages 53-84 occur twice.

What makes this compilation interesting is that its producers chose to include the all-time classic hits (\\"Use Ta Be My Girl\\", \\"Cry Together\\", \\"Loving You\\", \\"Darlin' Darlin' Baby {Sweet Tender Love}\\", \\"Sing My Heart Out\\") and album-only tracks that are not really well-known but that in no way disappoint. Strangely enough, The O'Jays' 1979 and 1980 Top 10 hits \\"Forever Mine\\" and \\"Girl, Don't Let It Get You Down\\" were not included on this CD but it nonetheless offers a decent overview of The O'Jays as one of the finest exponents of the classic Soul ballad. Above-average sound quality, an informative essay in the booklet and nearly 70 minutes of music make this CD a worthwhile addition to your collection.

This particular phone has many convenient features. The battery life on such phone is short that is to be expected. The upside is that this phone does charge the battery fairly quick to the spec. The range varies, depends where you live and where you place the base. I would recommend to find a good central location for the base. The antenna is something that of a concern. It is rigid and potential breakage if not careful.

I don't know if that batch I got was old or what, but it did not have truffle flavor! I could see the truffle in the butter, but there was none of that intense earthy aroma. Undeterred, I proceeded to use it to season my Thanksgiving turkey. I was so disappointed. Because I was depending on the butter almost exclusively for flavor, the turkey was bland.I ended up using the truffle and salt mix I purchased from Williams-Sonoma at the table. This was not the stellar meal I had planned. For Christmas, I used the same technique on cornish hens. This time, I used shelf-stable truffle butter from Williams-Sonoma. The birds were outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"This product had zero truffle flavor, and basically was one pound of butter with black specs that cost $60 per pound.

People compared it to New Jack City. NJC wasn't great but it wins over Deep Cover hands down. This movie was a mess and there was no point to anything the characters did. Laurence Fishburne said his lines so slowly, as if he felt the director would butt in. God I wish he had! Jeff Goldblum was supposed to be tough but was nothing but a big wimp. Victoria Dillard couldn't act to save her life ( what was the reason she was there? ) the woman didn't do anything important! I guess this is good if you like violence with nothing to show for it.

Whereas that foray into storytelling allowed Carstens a respite from the overwhelming, personal intensity found elsewhere in his catalog, it didn't reek of the escapism found here. While there are hints of his poetic lyricism found in the nonfiction prose found here, it completely ignores the problems at hand, departing from the foundational appeal of Carstens' writing.I certainly hope that Ghost Wars does not return to this style of escapist writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"This is a compilation of the songs performed by Sinatra which were written by Sammy Cahn.

In the early 1940s Sinatra was signed by MGM to appear in the musical Anchors Aweigh; he refused to sing unless Cahn wrote the material. In 1954 Cahn and Styne wrote \\"Three Coins in the Fountain\\" for Sinatra to sing in the film Three Coins in the Fountain. The song garnered Cahn his first Oscar.

On the whole, this album is a huge disappointment. I went through once and never listened to it again. The guitars are noticeably weaker in timbre and in technicality, with Megadeth's familiar aggressive melodicism noticeably absent, sunken beneath a sea of awful mediocrity. The riffs are weak and the songs are tragically weaker. Vocally, Mustaine's characteristic sneering ferocity seems apathetic and distracted here, dragging the already ordinary, passionless songs into a miserable (un)musical muck. As much as I hate to say this about a band I revered for years, there's really not a memorable track on the album. For those Megadeth fans who swear by their previous albums, avoid this one like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megadeth closes the distance on Metallica","review":"This is a killer CD if your into \\"thinking mans metal\\". If you want noise..listen to KORN, if you want pure pulse driving, grandma rattling, Mark McGuire homerun smashing metal..you have found it. The CD blends intricate soloing to all out blitz. From the Maidenisque..She-wolf to Trust, Dave and Company have closed the distance on Metallica. These guys are alos killer live. If you can get a ticket..do, they are awesome.

The \\"original\\" version is MUCH better. I used to have the \\"original\\" vesion, I bought when the album first came out in a record store. I lost it so I decided to buy another, but I chose this \\"remastered\\" version and was terribly disappointed. The sound quality is so poor you can barely make out the high notes. It sounds like you turned the high settings on your stereo all the way down, and turned the midrange all the way up, while leaving the lows in the middle. It sounds terrible. BE WARNED!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Not To Like?","review":"Once you get over the fact that Megadeth wasn't going to release another \\"Peace Sells\\", \\"SFSGSW\\" or \\"Rust in Peace\\", you can take each subsequent release on its own merit.\\"Cryptic Writings\\" is one of the catchiest hard-rock albums I've ever heard. Who hasn't had the riff from \\"Almost Honest\\" looping in their head? Each song on here passes that test, the songwriting is tight, and the production fits what these songs are built for: Rock radio.As for the remaster, it's a bit edgier in the drums and guitar, not as noticeable a difference as the remasters from the earlier discs. I actually prefer the original production of \\"Cryptic Writings\\" because it has that smooth sheen layered over it that gives the CD its own timestamped late-90's personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight And Tuneful","review":"Dave Mustaine and his Megadeth cohorts definitely released this fine album of extremely well rounded metal a little too late('97). Too bad, because \\"Writings\\" contains probably their most mature and commercial work to date. Want proof that Mustaine can be adult and more than keep his integrity in the metal kingdom; then listen to the smokin' opening riffs of \\"Trust\\" and \\"Almost Honest,\\" where Dave sounds like he's tired of society in general. \\"Secret Place\\"'s Alice In Chains-like intro gives way to thundering power chords and drummer Nick Menza's backbone. As always, the musicianship here is near perfect, complementing the tighter arrangements and more personalized lyrics than the band is usually known for. Just because you're getting older doesn't mean you have to be boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up there with Rust and Countdown!","review":"A great album with several classic tracks.Trust is the best track on it and perhaps Megadeths best song musically and lyrically combined.It contains the best solo by Marty Friedman in a Megadeth song!Other greats are Almost Honest,She-wolf,Mastermind,and Use the Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megadeth is awesome...","review":"Megadeth is still a great metal band since they first startedout. i saw them live once, THEY ROCKED!

I have said for sometime that Mustaine and company have grown leaps and bounds ahead of Metallica in the last 15 yrs and that Megadeth has released better overall material than Hetfield and Ulrich have.

Awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Don't listen to the mullet headed naysayers, this is a fantastic album.Is it thrash?No.Does it make you want to punch someone in the face?Not really.What it does do is make you reach for the volume knob so you can crank it. What Mustaine & Co. have delivered here is a great hard rock album.This album never fails to put a smile on my face, it's tuneful and has some great melodies, as well as that testicular fortitude that is so lacking in today's music. Plus you gotta love when they throw you a bone, that bone being Vortex. Straight thrash with an awesome lead.Buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daves Singing Improved","review":"Not to say his singing is any good yet, but it is a little smoother on this album. the first song is good and that is it.

Once Megadeth became more commercial as Metallica had done,their music was still enjoyable. All of Cryptic Writings is good, but Secret Place, Almost Honest, Trust, and Use the Man are just a few of the highlights on Cryptic Writings. If you've enjoyed Megadeth in the past you are certain to enjoy Cryptic Writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"this album rocks. it has old shcool songs and modern metal songsit's great album for both new and old fans!if you're new this would be the best to pick from megadeth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight to Deth","review":"I've listened to Megadeth for over ten years now, and as far as I'm concerned, this is their last thrash album as of late. As usual, the music is top quality, and very catchy. My favorite songs on this album are Trust, She-Wolf, and Almost Honest. Megadeth is a band that continues to push the envelope both musically and technically, and refuses to be hemmed in by preconceived notions of what constitutes great rock (check out their new CD, Risk). Keep up the good work, guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm french, so this review is only based on melody","review":"I love this cd ! If you skip MASTERMIND and TRAVELS, it's really perfect !

I've been a fan since the early/mid-80's and am quite impressed with the way Dave Mustaine has grown and improved through the years. He doesn't just sing, he uses his voice like a fifth instrument. Great song writing, and, not unexpectedly, great musical transitions within the songs. The bass and drums are featured more than in the past, and Menza and Ellefson are up to the task. Mustaine/Megadeth's integrity remains intact - very refreshing these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tunes!","review":"I thought the songs were all unique and greatly composed.

Dave Mustain, the heart and soul of Megadeth,is one of our times great musical genuises and can always match anything James Hetfield comes out with.Not to disrespect Metallica but CRYPTIC WRITINGS blows Re-load(Metallicas newest)out of the water!

Really bad purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mat for serious yogi","review":"This mat has the perfect combination of firmness and give for a serious practitioner. I practice Ashtanga 5-6 days a week. This mat is sturdy enough to last a long time while taking a lot of abuse: Ashtanga brings on a good deal of sweat, and the vinyasa between each pose consists of jumping back, rolling over your toes to upward dog, and back over them to downward dog and hopping back to seated. I've tried this on cheap, thin mats and find that it hurts my toes, and the thinner mats slide around. This mat protects your toes and spine and knees and hands from the hardness of the floor underneath it. Plus, it will stay in place. It will last you years, so it is well worth the price. You can expect it to be a little slick at first, but that will go away within 5-10 classes as you break it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"BlackMatPro 71 inch","review":"Exactly what we were looking for. Works well on tile, wood and carpet floors. Primarily used for P90X workouts (jump training, core work and yoga/stretching). We have not experience slippage and the two we purchased store well rolled up behind the weight rack we have set up. Also...Happy with how quickly our order arrived. I think it would be heavy and awkward to consistently take to another location, but for our home workouts, it has worked very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful mat","review":"This mat has great quality. My only gripe is that it's a little slippery (I sweat a lot). Unlike previous yoga mats I've had where my sweat just kind of...I don't know...disappears once it hits the mat? The sweat on this mat doesn't go away it spreads everywhere and I find myself pausing my practice to wipe the mat down occasionally. That sounds gross. Anyway! I've been cleaning it/taking care of it, so this is probably just something that happens because it's new. Other than that, it feels great, smells fine, and is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iyengar never felt so good","review":"I have been practicing yoga for nearly 3 years.

Unfortunately we went through a few yoga mats each until we found the Manduka Black mat. All the other mats tore up with the Plyometrics workout - but this mat not only provides great cushion for leaping, but my husband (who sweats a LOT in yoga) doesn't slide around like on the others. It's VERY durable & Amazon has the best price around.

Then we got into the flowy part of class and I warmed up (I don't sweat much at all), and suddenly my legs were sliding apart and I was almost in the splits doing triangle. Not good.I'm really disappointed and I hope they take it back. It would be perfect if it weren't slippery.

It is heavy. Pick up a 7 lb weight & see what seven pounds feels like. I committed to an expensive mat on the recommendation of instructors. The inexpensive mat I was using was unsafely slippery, this one stays put. I gave it a vinegar bath and let it sit in the sun for 24 hours, it's good to go. As to smells, wash your mats. It's the same basic hygiene that makes one own, not share, an exercise mat. If you can afford it, do it. (what do you spend on a pair of trainer(sport)shoes that last six months?) Weight is the decision to focus on with this mat."},{"rating":"2","title":"So solid!","review":"This is such a solid piece of investment when it comes to practicing yoga at home.

However, she started to take yoga classes last year and really likes it! So, when Christmas came around I knew exactly what she would like- a yoga mat. I looked on Amazon and this mat seemed to have the best of everything- it's thick, long, and had great reviews. When I gave it to my mom, she was so excited. Her mood after yoga class was completely different however. She told me that she had the worst experience with this yoga mat. She couldn't hold her positions because she was slipping and sliding all over the place. We contacted the company to see why this was and they simply told us that the mat needed 6 months to be \\"broken in\\". In my opinion, you shouldn't have to put up with slipping and sliding for on a mat even if it is a new one. This was a definite disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO SWEAT!!!","review":"Slippery!!! Be careful!!!I'm a Asthanga Vidyasa Yoga practicer and I sweat a lot during every practice.

I'm so disappointed that I will return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"still getting used to my mat...","review":"I have used this mat for a couple months, 3-4 times a week. I have found it to be stickier then my previous mats but still slip some since my hands sweat a bit... The other issue that I'm still getting used to is that my feet get tired/cramp during long standing/balance on one foot poses. Because the mat is thicker and softer/more cushioned (tho not too squishy) my feet are \\"gripping\\" differently. Of course, this is a great feature for any kneeling/floor poses. I'll continue to see all of this opens/changes my practice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy as heck","review":"If you're looking for a good, stable, sticky, cushy yoga mat, this is your boy.

Yes, it is heavier than other mats but I see that as a positive as it is more substantial than regular mats. I suppose some folks may find it too heavy but it is still under ten pounds and have no problem with that. There is the perfect amount of grip and the stability is excellent. I know it isn't cheap, but I don't regret the purchase at all and highly recommend this mat. It's the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mat out there!","review":"This is an excellent mat for all purposes. I never need to double my mat, even with a knee injury. Some people have complained that it is too heavy to cart back and forth to class, but I think most yoga students are plenty strong enough to carry 6 pounds (especially if you get a shoulder strap or bag). When I go to class, I don't want to think about my mat.

It's a GREAT mat. The surface is slip proof and I am able to exercise in my bare feet, which I really enjoy. I also use a Swiss Ball on it and the mat grips the ball nicely so it isn't slipping and sliding all around. I don't understand some of the lower ratings complaining about the surface being slippery - I NEVER experienced that problem. My ONLY complaint is the price. It's a bit expensive, but I'm glad I got it anyway - that's the ONLY reason I give it four stars and not five, is due to the price. Also, this mat is a bit too heavy for travel, so if you go to a yoga class or some other exercise class, you may want a lighter and less cumbersome mat. But for home use - it's GREAT.

This CD is very well produced with tracks from fairly unknown producers Mr. Lee, Poppi, T-Mix, and Jim Jonsin, and widely known fellow Cincinnati native Hi-Tek. I describe his style as a midwest mixture of AZ and Cormega. This album is slick as hell... if he drops \\"Freaky Hoes\\" or \\"Angel\\" as the next single, it could blow up nationally. Great debut.Stand out tracks: \\"Down Da Way\\", \\"Ooh Wee\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"Barbershop\\", \\"Freaky Hoes\\", \\"Chic In Da Ghetto\\", \\"God's Been Talkin'\\" and \\"Long Time Coming\\"Skippable tracks: \\"Nigga's Don't Want No Money\\", \\"Nodd Factor\\"Overall Rating: 4.25 out of 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old time Guitar CD!","review":"This is one of James Alan Shelton's many solo CD's he's released in recent years, this was his first instrumental CD, and one of the best. It has some great old traditional tunes, including an old Carter Family tune, Old Gospel Ship. And James also shows his songwriting talents with Twilight Swamp. And another highlight of this CD is a special guest visit from Dr. Ralph Stanley himself on Old Time Pickin', a great old time clawhammer banjo style song. If you like tradional bluegrass instrumentals, and great crosspicking, this is the CD for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compassionate Physician","review":"Whereas modern medicine has become so technologically oriented, here is a book which emphasizes the humanity and the need to take the whole person into account.The author is an eminent gastroenterologist who has been practicing medicine for almost 50 years, and he still enjoys his work because he he enjoys people and helping them.It is a book which every practicing physician should read, and can also be most helpful for patients.A wonderful book by a wise and compassionate human being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the 12 Year Aged","review":"I ordered this from Amazon and it was fulfilled by Olio2go. The bottle that came wasn't the 12 year aged vinegar. It was some cheap substitute instead that was runny and no better than the balsamic I can get at a convenience store. I don't know if the item is simply incorrectly stocked or if Olio2go is truly trying to pass off this terrible imitation for the real stuff, but order with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is ordinary grocery store vinegar","review":"I purchased this Balsamic Vinegar hoping that it would be similar in taste to D.O.C. qualty, 12 year old vinegars. I knew by the price that it wasn't actually aged, otherwise it would have cost four times more. Unfortunately, there was no similarity between a good quality Balsamic Vinegar and this product. I even had a blind taste test to prove it.There is a chain of stores called Oliviers & Co. that sells a $35 bottle of Balsamic Vinegar that is ten times better than this product. I would also recommend Colavita's vinegar over this brand for 1/3 the price.Finally, it is customary for fine vinegars to have the number of years aged on the label or in the name. For these guys to call the Balsamic #12 is rude and misleading. For that reason alone I would add caution to your purchase.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible for the price.","review":"Be warned...this is NOT a nice aged balsamic. It tastes no different that Newman's Own or Safeway brand cheap balsamic - I was very disappointed and will not be purchasing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not the quality you might expect","review":"I enjoyed my Manicardi #8 vinegar I bought in Italy. I thought I was buying and even better quality with this product as it is advertised as #12. I was able compare them side by side and this #12 is not close to the same good flavor. I did some research and found that it is actually a lower quality cleverly described by the manufacturer as a 3 barrel formally #12 to confuse the buyer. The description is correct per the manufacturer's label so I can't say that olio2go has a deceptive advertisement. It points out that it is actually \\"grape must\\" and a condiment quality. But including the #12 designation does mislead. So I gave it one star based on the easily confused product. It was not what I was expecting so I am unhappy with the result. Others may enjoy the flavor but the real thing is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product in a bad package","review":"I like this lip balm for the moisturizing quality and that slightly minty taste and tingly sensation. However, my only problem is with the container.

I always have a tube in arms reach-one in my purse, one in my car, one on my desk. This lip balm is relatively inexpensive and is the best on the market. Because of the natural ingredients, it actually helps heal, not just moisturize, my chapped lips. I love the tingle I get when I first apply it, like I can feel it starting to work. The product is clear, which is great. Although it has some peppermint and coconut and rosemary, it is very subtle in aroma. Try it, you'll be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"This is the best stuff on Earth!

I love the tin packaging, but the tube is nice too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Unlike Carmex's containers, the lip balm inside Burt's tin container wasn't smooth or creamy. When I dipped my finger inside, chunks of the lip balm would come out, and I had to press it really hard against my lips to try to make it go on smoothly. Even then, I'd end up with chunks of it on my lips. It was just like they had gotten the chapstick out of the Burt's tube and pushed it into the tin. When it's in a tin you expect the balm to be softer so it can go on your fingers more smoothly and onto your lips. Maybe I just had bad luck and got a defected one, since I noticed all the other positive reviews this product has gotten. Overall, I was not at all satisfied with this product. It was a waste of the couple dollas I paid for it. I'd stick to the tube version of the Burt's, which I've been using and have been happy with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coconut Oil","review":"After years of trying numerous other brands, I found this lip product and fell madly in love. First, it tingles because it contains peppermint so it makes your lips feel alive and luscious. Then, it has beeswax and coconut oil to protect you from the elements.Burt's Beeswax Lip Balm contains soothing and refreshing ingredients, such as beeswax, coconut oil, sunflower oil, tocopheryl acetate & tocopherol (vitamin E), lanolin, peppermint oil, comfrey root extract, and rosemary extract.I have one tube in every main room of my house. One hidden in a kitchen drawer, one in my desk, two in my purse, etc. My husband also loves this lip balm.~The Rebecca Review"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it--but in the tube instead","review":"This is a wonderful product, but you should buy it in the plastic tube instead. The tin taints the scent and flavor of the lip gloss, and makes an otherwise wonderful product a little offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality but takes a bit to easily apply to lips","review":"I do animal rescue & am very anti cruelty. Luckily Burts Bees doesnt do animal testing & is a brand I can use.I love this kind because of the mint & because it (well every Burt's bees product really) keeps my lips moist & this one smells good to. My only complaint is that with every Burt's Bees Chapstick I get, I find myself pressing on my lips hard to apply it because the chapsticks do not warm up & melt off onto your lips very well. Its a mild annoyance & I still frequently buy Burt's Bees Chapstick products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I fully expected to love this product because I like mint-flavored balms and heard such good things about this one, but didn't find it all that moisturizing. It had a stiff texture and didn't glide onto my lips very well. Also, for some reason, this product actually made my lips drier than they were before. That kind of defeats the purpose of using chapstick in the first place. I have since found other chapsticks that are cheaper and more effective. I recommend Aquafina lip balm , which also contains beeswax but is a much softer chapstick with the added benefit of rich moisturizers like jojoba and almond oils."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats Expectations....BFS has produced a very consistent CD","review":"This is a really great CD from beginning to end.

They were drunker than any performer has a right to be, they blathered about urination for 20 minutes, and they only managed to play about 7 songs in 2 hours.

My favorite tracks are #1,#2,#4,#6,#7,#9,#12,#14,and #15. I like all the songs on the CD, but Girl All The Bad Guys Want gets kind of annoying after awhile and Surf Colorado is just a bad song.

They turned out to be absolutely indispensible! You lay them on top of the sheet in the crib or bassinette; when the baby does what babies do and you'd otherwise be changing sheets, fighting with crib bumpers and fitted elastic corners and getting hit in the head with the mobile, you just whip off the pad and throw it in the wash. The sheet is saved; your head is saved; your sanity is intact (more or less). When you get to be an old pro, and the stain is dried by the time you get to it, you just flip the pad over (depending what it was, of course) and use the other side--hey, it's waterproof! The other side is still clean. If you have two, layer them in the crib.I buy these for every baby shower I go to now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like","review":"They had white fuzz balls all over it the first time we washed them.

I am afraid of my water breaking, so everywhere I go I have a towel with me. For nighttime, I decided to use this pad to protect our mattress. I placed this pad on top of the mattress and then covered it with the two layers of cotton (mattress saver and bed sheet). I am pretty sure this pad is 100% waterproof, as it does not breeze at all. In the morning my husband and I both woke up sweaty in the areas that were on top of the pad. SO now I am not sure I want our child sleeping (and sweating) on top of this pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job but not very attractive","review":"These are great at containing spills but they do pill extremely fast.

I may feel differently once I use them, but the vinyl or plastic side is thin and looks like \\"leatherette.\\" The other side is some kind of polyester that shows significant stringy pilling on the first wash. Not my cup of tea. I'd never use these on top of the sheet. Way too ugly. I give it 2 stars only because it probably is waterproof, which is the main purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT what I thought they would be.","review":"Be aware that I was not using this pad in a crib. I believe if I were to use it in a crib the same problems would arise.1, The back of the pad is a VERY SLIPPERY (but waterproof!)plastic backing. Unless the weight (baby/child) placed on it is great, it will move ANYWHERE and everywhere it's placed.2. The 'soft' side is not soft. It is a very acrylic like 'fleece' which when you rub your hand over it, it catches on your skin! Remember rubbing chapped hands on silk or nylon? It's much like that only your hands don't need to be chapped to catch on this stuff. I would NOT want to be in direct contact with this material.On the bright side, if this pad were placed under a fitted sheet of a baby's crib, I think it would be fine and dandy. Just make sure the fitted sheet stays in place and the baby is very young."},{"rating":"2","title":"eminently practical","review":"These are so much more convenient than traditional waterproof crib mattress pads: they don't have to be tucked in, they cover the whole mattress just as well, they absorb just as much moisture, they take up less space in the washing machine, and in our house they double as couch protectors when my two sons nap there in the afternoons. Definitely a smart purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one.","review":"I bought this 2-pack thinking it would be of high quality materials and it is not! I washed them first and then put one in my son's crib. After ONE DAY of use, it is all pilled up, and terrible looking! Really below standard. Waterproof pads are indispensable for our family as our son's diapers usually don't hold everything throughout the night. I wish I had looked further before buying these. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!! Choose another, believe me you'll be much better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't last long!","review":"I bought these to help with night time potty training accidents and have had a horrible time with them.

His reflections and comments on mind-body connections are relaxing and not overdone - they serve their purpose, which is just to remind you to breathe, not tense your face, etc., but in an eloquent fashion. The music is subtle and appropriate - not distracting or cheesy. The level of challenge is great - I'm slightly sore after, but my muscles feel exhilarated, not fatigued.

Too make matters worse he courts Megan and she falls for him.The rest of the film finds Megan working with her fellow men in blue to figure out who the mysterious killer could be during the day while getting her swerve on with Eugene during the evenings.The cinematography is good including some appropriate scenes shot in blue light. However, the characterization is fairly poor, especially for Eugene where very little of his background is revealed and the plot is quite predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated horror/action film. but disappointing at times.","review":"Kathryn Bigelow's Follow up to her allways good NEAR DARK is some wath disappointing but good at the same time.

I wanted to see the emotional impact of that on her but all we get is one shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie that impacts all of us","review":"This movie depicts the life of Selena Quintilla-Perez from her rise to music as a child to her death at the tender age of 23. Director Gregory Nava couldn't have directed this movie better because he directed it perfectly. Jennifer Lopez did an A+ job portraying Selena and on top of that bares a striking resemblance to her. Edward James Olmos and Constance Marie were also great as Abraham and Marcella Quintilla. Edward James Olmos shows off his versatility and what a job they did with make-up and all that stuff for Constance Marie as her character got older on top of her top-notch performance. Jon Seda did a great as Selena's husband Chris along with Jacob Vargas playing A.B. and that actress who plays Suzie. The ending is sad but unforgetable and this is a top-tier movie that should have won some awards (Damn you Oscars!). This movie is jaw-dropping and heart-warming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the greatest musicals of all time","review":"i don't like too many musicals. i cried so hard at this brilliant touching heartwarming masterpiece of a musical drama about the slain singer selena. she was a great singer who lived a life too short for a stupid reason. jennifer lopez couldn't have done a better job in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Selena is the best movie I have seen","review":"I recently saw \\"Selena\\", and think it is the best movie I've seen.

I think that the movie wasn't a big sucess because most of us her fans felt a little be bad when we saw sombody else as SELENA , we will never forget about her ,we don't need a movie to make us remember who she was , what we need is one of her concerts on video at least this way we get to see her , the real SELENA happy , smiling and working with the people she loved the most.

It was more like a made-for-T.V. movie. It was a real blunder to have skipped the scene where Selena got shot. If she hadn't gotten shot, this movie would never have been made in the first place. And finally, they should not have shown pictures of the real Selena at the end of the biopic. It just makes it obvious that Jennifer Lopez doesn't really look like Selena.

Overlong, overacted, heavy-handed, and corn in the extremes. The musical score is absolutely intolerable.

I read all the reviews on all the different Brother sewing machines available. I even called Brother directly to ask them which sewing machine they would recommend for a beginner. This was their pick. I have to admit, at first I was ready to throw the thing threw the window. The instructions are not for a beginner...I agree with some of the other reviewers...alot of the instructions are very incomplete. I actually took my machine to a sewing machine shop and took an hour lesson on how to use it! They helped alot. I am no longer afraid of it. I think it will be a very useful machine once I master it. I have already taken 1 class and plan to take more. A very good buy for the money. Even the seamstress who gave me the lesson said she would absolutely recommend this machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bite the bullet and buy the Dyson","review":"I agree with the reviews written, however no one has mentioned how quite the cleaner is or how effortless it is to move around and use. It is lightweight, and rolls like a dream and has a super long power cord. The attachments work well and the pull out extension is fantastic. I couldn't believe the price, nor could I believe how much more dust and dirt it picked AFTER I had both used my old vacuum (commercial grade) and had cleaned the carpets with a commercial cleaner.After I had vacuumed the house with the Dyson I was so grossed by the amount of stuff it picked up,I cleaned the house again. Their are toys and tools, the Dyson is a tool and well worth the the extra dollars you pay. The DC14 is the one to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBEATABLE in my opinion","review":"This machine does the job without question and is a bargain to boot if you do not have animals. How so?? Because it comes with the Low-reach attachment but not the mini-brush which would basically be used with animals. Why pay for what you don't need.<br />The Telescopic Wand on this new model is a big improvement as it is easier and quicker to use than the reversible wand on the DC07.<br />Only negative might be the cord which is not retractable. Oh well nothings perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad he spent 20 years","review":"When I 1st saw the ad on TV I had 2 thoughts:bunch of hype, probly overpricedwhy in the world would someone spend 20 years developing a vacuum?Best vac I ever bought, including the $1000 Kirby which the ex still uses.Strong. Too strong a couple times. Tore some strands at carpet joints (berber).Pick up almost anything - scraps of paper, small pieces of foam, little rubber things.Extremely convenient once I learned how. Container emptying a breeze, 30 seconds. Easy to clean. Extremely easy to place/change attachments.Had it 2 years now and it is as good as the day I bought it. Last couple Eurekas or whatever were shot by then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Priced Plastic Piece of JUNK!","review":"This vacuum cleaner broke on me the first month I owned it, the lever where you change from carpet to hard floors. So I got a replacement . This vacuum cleaner is a plastic piece of junk! A sock got caught in the hose and when my husband went to take the hose off, part of the plastic connection broke. The top plastic thing on the attachment also broke..the bottom of the canister as well. Way over priced! I've certainly owned far better for less money! Go get a Hoover Wind Tunnel in stead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Problems","review":"I have had no problems with this vaccuum. I had a Fantom for 6 years that just burnt out. I also had no problems with that except that emptying the dirt was much messier. This vaccuum has no mess when emptying. Great new system. Chose because it was the only vacuum that has the hose in the handle just like my old Fantom did (the new Fantoms don't). This is such a \\"great\\" feature. For convenience and it is out of the way! Love the on board tools and extra long stretch hose which will stretch to the top of my drapes and to the ceiling. Only improvements I would make are: \\"Low Reach Vacuum\\" is misleading as it is only an attachment which is available with all the other models?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"I love this vacuum, it really SUCKS! I've never, ever seen a vacuum do what this one does. My mom has a rainbow sweeper that she paid over $1000 for and it has never cleaned like the Dyson does. I waited 3 years to buy it and love it so much. It's probably my most valued possession.Our carpet looks brand new and we have two little boys that wear their shoes on it constantly. It gets out all the teeny-tiny dust particles and the fuzzies that you wouldn't even know were there. This vacuum is a life saver! I could kiss the inventor!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great price but some basic flaws.","review":"A nice looking product, but form should follow function....and it doesn't perform that well.

Leon stole the show at that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"good music, bad sound","review":"I'm a huge Leon fan, but the sound of this album literally gives me a headache. The ceaseless shriek of the women background singers is way too high up in the mix. It overpowers everything else. After the third song I'm running for the stereo to just make it stop.

This concert recorded in August, 1972 is of similar sound quality to the Woodstock soundtrack or the Grateful Dead's self-titled live album from 1971. There is A LOT of energy here, incredible passion, great musicianship..in fact it's kind of a farewell to Leon Russell's most well known period in music..when he had a big band of musicians backing him.

I don't know that I completely agree with that but nonetheless it is filled with some classic recordings. Many of the songs he performed in concert until his retirement, many capital albums are better I think than some of his reprise or previous releases from say columbia. To think that the complete capital songs can fit on a 4 disc set yet the complete reprise recordings are on 20 cd's, it might have you thinking he did not work as hard, but then of course it covers a smaller time frame. Overall, a must for the serious Sinatra fan but for the casual listener the 1 disc best of capital should do the trick.Peter J.

Gory? Half the budget was spent on Cherry Kool-aid to simulate blood. Nothing in this movie--not one second of it--is the least bit entertaining, convincing, realistic or worthwhile. We are supposed to believe that because the female victims of a group of male prison escapees who invade their domestic abuse shelter inevitably turn the tables on their tormentors, the film somehow makes a \\"statement\\".

This is more experimental, (at times) ambient, and definitely less structured and edgy than the previous Naked City releases. It seems to be a lot of lick-based noise where you have drums, keyboards, other percussion coming in and out, keyboards, other percussion, nothing planned out or even, shall we say, MUSICAL. Not to say it's a bad record, though, because it's definitely worth having, but don't go buying it hoping to get another \\"Torture Garden\\" fix, you'll only be disapointed in that case.

It such a shame they can't make movies like this anymore. Members of rival fraternities show up at Palm Springs for Spring Break. They make a thousand dollar bet on who can make it with the 'dream girl'. One decides to play a suicidal love-stricken romantic, the other a fitness guru. Both strike out, but have 'proof'.Along for the ride is Wendyl. He's the astrology geek who ends up with the babe. But not before he gets involved with Amanda Bearse who's father is the town sheriff.This movie has all the things that make 80's movies so great, a light plot, sex, nudity, low-brow humor, and doing things that would get you arrested today, but back then seemed innocent enough. Movies like this never won any awards, but they live forever to remind us of how much fun the 80's were."},{"rating":"2","title":"First american teen comedy in USSR","review":"It was a first american teen comedy legally purchashed in USSR and even after 15 years it still stands amazing.

It is utterly amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to Nawleans","review":"Shainee Gabel, in her screenwriting and directorial debut no less, delivers a veritable tour de force of a film that envelops you into the slow, jazzy, laid back environs of The Big Easy. Plus, it doesn't hurt that Scarlett Johansson, John Travolta, and Gabriel Macht deliver resoundingly stellar acting performances. The paradox of the broken lives of Bobby Long and Lawson juxtaposed with the fresh potential of Pursy makes for a most compelling and thought-provoking storyline.A picture infused with despair, gloom, hope, humor, and ultimately redemption, A Love Song for Bobby Long will undoubtedly leave you impressed and possibly even moved. Travolta should have received more acclaim for his unflinchingly honest portrayal of the bizarrely endearing Bobby Long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding performances by both Travolta and Johansson","review":"I have been a Travolta fan since before the \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" days. I have seen him improve as an actor over the years to the point to where I would buy anything in which he stars. Every movie in which he stars gets better and better. \\"A Love Song for Bobby Long\\" with him playing a white-haired, nasty, old drunkard is amazing. The movie was worthy of an Oscar nomination in my opinion! Definitely worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorites of all time","review":"This is a fantastic movie. I imagine it flopped at the box office; I'm not sure, but, I think it is genius. Especially if you like love, New Orleans, music, you're all set! Add John Travolta and \\"what's her name\\" Johanson on the list; what more can you ask for? Great turn of events with a twist. My family does not like it, they think it is a sad story. I think it is a great story for any one you know who may drink toooooooo much!!!! Buy a copy today for only $5.00 you won't go wrong. Some of Scarlett's best acting is in this movie, as well as \\"Lost in Translation\\", with Bill Murray filmed in Japan. There you have it, two movies starring big time before she went big time ....... they're Golden. If you like Robert Redford, maybe you should also look up \\"The Horse Whisperer\\" also Starring S.

If you want action-packed-stuff-blowing-up, this is not the movie for you. The acting is just awesome, Travolta and Johansson are at their best and it was a stunning introduction for me to Gabriel Macht's ability.The storyline is good, but I felt that this was much more an examination of characters than development of a complex plot. Some have written reviews the movie is predictable but I'm not sure that unpredictability is really the point of a movie such as this.The movie is steeped in New Orleans and uses this location to its utmost potential.

At times, I thought I was watching regional theather, without the charm. This film is watchable, but in a Mystery Science Theater way. Travolta picks some of the worst scripts written which is a shame because there are moments when he is utterly brillant as Bobby. It's a shame he's delivering such predictable drivel. Scarlett Johanson goes over the top a few times too many and rarely seems real. It seems like she picked the script for the number of scenes she had lines in. Still, glad to see a movie that doesn't have a car chase, an explosion or Vin Diesel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puppy Bliss","review":"We've had the Mighty Pro for a few years and have always appreciated its industrial strength power and efficiency in routine carpet cleaning. We used to have a Hoover steam vac and the Rug Doctor beats it in all regards. Better water capacity, stronger motor, easier to use and clean. But we recently got a puppy who is having a bit of a hard time with the potty training and let me tell you, if you have a puppy and carpeting/rugs, you need the Rug Doctor. It gets down to the lowest fibers in carpeting and really pulls every bit of dirt and debris out. The upholstery attachment is an absolute godsend. I don't think you'll find a more rugged, capable all in one carpet cleaning system out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite 5 Stars.......","review":"First, I got the machine cheaper ($500) with free shipping directly from the manufacturer. I'm not sure whether or not this was a special. As for cleaning, this machine is about as good as it gets. The Infomercial is a bit of a stretch and a bit misleading, at the same time, it is still a great machine. The only problem is that the tank is too small, and I'm sorry I didn't get the wider machine. I cannot count the number of times I have to fill the tank. There are some good hints about using the machine submitted by others here, and I would like to add one more. I crank up my water heater to high before using the machine.

I made pass after pass going slower and slower each time but it simply would not come clean. So I certainly wasted my money on Rug Doctor.

Most St John's wort products have a concentration of 0.3%, and nearly all of the dosing guidelines I've found assume you're taking something standardized to 0.3%.Basically this means that if you take what should be an effective and safe dose of 900mg per day, you're getting less than half as much of the active ingredient as you might think. Except that I can't find any information on whether doubling the dose is safe, or if there are other factors to consider. Only Natural and Amazon are doing St John's wort users a major disservice by putting a non-standard product on the market with no warning or indication of the difference until the package arrives at your house."},{"rating":"2","title":"happy 4","review":"This book was a good book for my class on World Religion.

But I am left wondering, whether or not Tuttle has a peer review procedure for books claiming to be anthropologically valuable. They should, that way [stuff] like this wouldn't get published.

I realize that no matter how hard one tries, [to be all inclusive in such matters] there will be those who are overlooked, and those who do not like to share the limelight. However There are very few works of this genre available when it comes to the FMA, and as such this work stands on its own merit. If we take into consideration the scarcity of real information, and the proliferation of contradictory, and orally transmitted legends this work becomes more significant and important in its class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"Smoking Popes are a solid band, I do not think they will ever reach super stardom, but their romantic keep me entertained for the time being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for their earlier stuff!!!!!!!!","review":"The smoking popes is an A1 band. If you are in to the poppier side of punk definetly check them out. Destination Failure is the popes's worst release in my opinion, they even managed to ruin some of their classics on this one.

The chord progressions contain more than 4 chords a song, the instrumentation isn't always bashing you in the face, and the singer doesn't sound like some whiney Joey Ramone or Johnny Rotten sound-alike. Most of all, their songs are interesting and fun, but not just for the sake of being interesting and fun. They're just good songs.

Frank has some effective moments and there's about 20 minutes of good cat-and-mouse with the killer towards the end, but otherwise everything's pretty tame and dull. The labored and drawn-out scenes of Faye on her deathbed aren't bad enough to be camp, but they come pretty close. Additionally, the lame full-screen presentation on this DVD makes this look more like a TV movie than a feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"good relationship book","review":"I am really enjoying this new African American Christian fiction genre! I enjoyed reading this book. It's a story of a woman trying to put her life back together after divorcing her husband of 12 years. The authors illustrate the emotions and feelings not only of coping with divorce, single parenthood, but also focus on discovering one's destiny. There are alot of plot twists and turns that take the story in so many directions. All in all, God remains sovereign in everything that happens. For those that enjoy Christian fiction, this is a great addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Chances - Characters written as familiar friends","review":"The characters of Second Chances seem like familiar friends.

The colors are reasonable; the clarity of images are very good. The sound was also reasonable. The staging seems very traditional and fairly static. I thought that all of the performers sounded fine.

The story is so great and all the actors played the roles very well. Shirley Temple was good, but Noley Thornton is fantastic. Unlike the older version of Heidi this has a freshness to it.

The door broke off on the 6th day he had it. He loves playing with the door even though it's broken off, he puts it in the hole left by the door.I also wish the top hinged open so you could put the pieces away quickly, but it doesn't. My son isn't old enough to use the shape sorting aspect yet, I mainly bought this for the farm novelty and so he could put pieces in and take them out. Which he does do, but he turns the whole thing on its side so he can put pieces in and out via the door hole. I think he would like it even more if he could sit in front of it and open the top to put pieces in.Mine also doesn't have the upright handle as shown in the photo. Mine has a cutout in the back of the top, like a notch cut into the plastic where you're supposed to insert your fingers.

Chip Harrison plays his Archie Goodwin and narrator; at Haig's behest he throws in a couple of juicy sex scenes to entice the modern reader. Chip finds his girlfriend Melanie nude and dead, supposedly of an overdose. However when Chip finds that two of Melanie's five other sisters have died of possible homicides, Haig is intrigued, especially since the sisters are heiresses to a great fortune. Numerous other murders occur before Chip believes he has identified the murderer. Wolfe naturally rejects this finding and instead calls for the grand-standing finale at which the true murderer is unveiled. Lawrence Block (under a psuedynom) pulls off his usual sly humor making for a quick but fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"Love her singing.

In this novel, Michal does not think highly of David, and he certainly does not come across as admirable. Instead this legendary and highly effective king is potrayed as Machiavellian, manipulative, and cruelly pragmatic. He is careless of the love of those around him; Michal in particular loathes him as he uses his power over her to control her destiny and force her to make tragic choices. All this while presenting himself as the soul of kindness and (at least in public) as totally solicitous of her well-being. But what goes around comes around....as the reader who finishes this well-told story will see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"India Edghill is an insanely great writer - and the story she tells in this book is a wonderful insight into one of the greatest stories in history - the story of King Saul and King David. I think there might be some things that are a bit disturbing for someone reading it who is a Christian, as I am, but not overly so. Anything India Edghill puts in the story is completely believable and she seems to be merely filling in the blanks in the Biblical story with her theory and imagination. It is one of my favorite books and I've read it several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fair book","review":"This wasn't a favorite book of mine to read, though it was decent. I find myself questioning throughout the book if what we see in the book is how it really happened, or if it's just through Michal's mind, since she is the daughter of a king who went mad. I'm not sure if I would recommend it to others, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUEENMAKER--A Very Special Book","review":"QUEENMAKER came into my life as a gift from an enthusiastc friend. From the opening paragraph I shared her enthusiasm, for this is a rare thing--a story both beautifully written and compelling as well. India Edgehill has created a vivid, flesh-and-blood Biblical world, and seeing it through the eyes of historically obscure Queen Michal makes for a fascinating twist. We meet Michal as a naive child infatuated with David; against a vast backdrop of empire-building we experience her very personal disillusionments, triumphs and growth. Truly, a very special book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing. Loosely based on the Bible??","review":"I was quite disappointed in this book to say the least. I was hoping for historical fiction more grounded in the life of David. I was hoping for more of a picaresque view of Jerusalem and the time period. Nowhere in the book does the author say how much of her information is from the Bible, if indeed any of it is. I am assuming she must have done SOME research, as she credits the main characters of Michal as being daughter of the eventually mad King Saul. And David as rising to King of Jerusalem after many battles and the slaying of Goliath. But most of the story reads as pure imagination. David is portrayed as a one-dimensional, uncaring, misogynistic and ignorant man. I was so frustrated by the gall of this book, I threw it out after reading 160 pages. I also found it not exceptionally written and honestly was more than a little bit bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you are a Christian and you are looking for a book that closely follows the story of David and his family as related in the Old Testament, then this is not a book for you. I was very disturbed by the way this tale portrays King David (as an egomaniac) and by the drastic changes made in the biblical accounts of his family members. In the same way that I found _The Red Tent_ to be anti-Christian, I feel likewise about this book and wish I had never read it. It is not a book I will keep and I could ever pass it along to a fellow Christian woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable change from the actual story","review":"This book was entertaining and I wish the author had not tried to make it about Biblical characters. I am always interested in the life of women during different time periods, but the change from the Bible story is ubelievable.

Her novel is a satisfying debut in the tradition of Mary Renault's exemplary \\"The King Must Die.\\" Like Renault who looked beneath the surface of the legends about the Greek hero Theseus, Edghill offers an fresh interpretation of the life of the almost mythic David who rises from being merely the unknown youngest son to be a famous singer, lover and monarch. Edghill \\"goes one better\\" than Renault with her inspired decision to use the voice and perspective of a woman, specifically Michal, David's first and later queen who is reclaimed because of her political significance as King Saul's daughter and only heir. This Bible student was not appalled as some might be because the Old Testament again and again shows the weaknesses of mighty men, even those of outstanding patriarchs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding - Impulse Buy","review":"To Whom It May Concern:I just finished reading Queen Maker after purchasing while being marketed in the New York Times - it was an outstanding book and I can't wait for her next book.

The author did not stay true to any of the Biblical story- save for the basic plot line (and she even changed parts of that too!). Every new chapter I liked the book less, even though her writing is phenomenal. It definitely drew me into the story and was very vivid and interesting...but I think that had she used more facts in the novel it could have been much much better. Historical fiction needs to contain enough truth to make it believable, and this just wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Queen to remember.","review":"I wish I could give this book more than 5 stars. This author deserves high praise for this Biblical tale of King David's Queen Michal, daughter of King Saul.

David has a silver tongue and a beguiling way that soon has the people enthralled with him.Michal learns the hard way that men will have their way and power is the game they play. It is in David's court that she learns to manipulate, while using her wits and beauty to play a game that is just as intricate and winning.This is a captivating story that will have you eager for more conspiracy and intrigue.

We can appreciate a work of historical fiction if the basic facts are correct. However, this author took the character names from the Bible and drastically changed their stories to fit her whim. Yes, King David impregnated Bathsheba while she was married to another man. However, the baby died. He was not Solomon who later became King, nor is there any evidence that Michal and Bathsheba were friends and jointly raised Solomon. Again and again, there are major and disturbing discrepancies.

His description of peoples' budgets, the amount of time they sail each week, and general attitudes, have given me a great picture of the liveaboard life. I'm no Larry Pardy, but can really identify with the composite liveaboard picture he paints in his book.Thanks (again) Charlie, for writing another book that helped me steer the course of my life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for powerboaters","review":"While many of the statistics listed in this book are quite useful to SAILING it has very little to do with living aboard a motor yacht (large or small). It certainly should list in the description what it does and doesn't cover. VERY disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't you tell me?","review":"It would have been nice to know that this book had zero zip snot to do with power boats before I bought it. Also, I find the author's info a bit suspect when he says he talked to one owner of a 42 foot power boat who spent $13000.00 a month on maintenance alone and based his entire decision not to include anything but sail boats based on this one interview.What the author does have is a love for bar and pie charts with a few actual graphs thrown in to break up the (intense) monotony. The problem is that none of them are in color so in some cases you have to try to differentiate between two shades of black. Had I picked this book up in a store I would have politely put it back on the shelf.The information is way out of date. One referance states that people were waiting for GPS units to drop below $1000!!! And the same section talks about the growing number of people who were getting a VCR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than sleeping pills.","review":"Interesting, if you are an economist or if you operate like Bill Clinton and base each decision on an opinion poll.

House of Flying Daggers was a magnificent movie satisfying in every aspect. Use of colors and seasons symbolizing different stages of life and emotions, characters, nature, martial arts choreography, creative choice of weapons and in many other aspects, the director again did a wonderful job. The ending especially was extremely powerful.. hope to see more of these"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wildly Entertaining!","review":"I was disappointed by the film, \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" and was very cautiously pessimistic about viewing this film. I must say, this film surprised me with it's exciting martial arts choreography and intriging storyline. Zhang Ziyi, who stared in \\"Crouching...\\", is absolutely beautiful and gracefull with her martial arts skills as the blind daughter of the rebel leader. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous with it's color. The film's final fight scene will leave you breathless at the end. It's is a movie that will keep you guessing.

There are some fun scenes - the drum scene in the beginning, but ultimately the weak plot, weak motivation and somewhat banal action sequences undermine the pleasure from the few moments of creativity. My wife and I saw Hero the day after seeing this and both of us enjoyed that much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A feast for the eyes but.....","review":"a dull, predictable story with lame dialog.My wife and I were eagerly anticipating seeing this film since we loved Crouching Tiger and thought Hero was pretty good.It seemed upon watching the film, however, that the director is focused on beautiful imagery and imaginative use of color and action at the expense of story and dialog. The story was dull with many climaxes and much melodrama (a dead character rises from the snow....and we knew it was coming!). And how many references to \\"wind\\" can we hear before the point is made ad nauseum? We went from being amazed at the imagery to rolling our eyes and essentially predicting dialog and plot twists before they happened with about 90% accuracy.The worst thing though? That the movie, despite the action, etc., was boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"House of Flying Daggers-A wonder mythical love story","review":"Two Thumbs UP!

Don't purchase.","review":"This is listed on many sites as having among the poorest image quality of all Blu-ray disks (bottom tier). It's a real shame, too, because this movie is filled with stunningly gorgeous shots filled with color and life. It looked to me as if the transfer was done from a poor-quality copy of the master.

Too bad Sony, who did a poor job on the dvd pass 5 years ago on this film, just dumped off their badly xfered hdcam to the new bluray format a few years ago. Such a shame to see such an amazing film just go into the gutter. This film looked fantastic in the theaters - it could look just the same on Bluray!Hopefully, this will not occur on the film Hero, a similarly shot martial arts film, which is due for a bluray xfer as well. Sure, a lot of the first titles to go out on Bluray years ago were poorly mastered - let's just hope this changes for the better - because so far there is only one chance to do it right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't take it seriously","review":"This film confused me at first. There were what one might call subtle bloopers right from the start. However, as the film wore on, I realized that it had to be a comedy, and really liked it. I'm not sure if that was how it was intended, but if it was, it is a very ingenious, comedic use of cliche, subtle mistakes, and some simply bizarre elements. I only gave it four stars because if it was intended to be taken seriously, I think it would have to be considered sloppy and rather cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overcooked and burning","review":"When you've seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, you've seen them all. Although I can't speak for Hero. That I have yet to see but for this movie, eh. I'm not impressed.Why? Well, the story was good, I'll give it that but how the characters met and the fighting scenes make this movie and unbelievable and over-done romp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd fantasy!","review":"I must admit that I always enjoy the female actor who plays the leading female role but this time it was just not a believable story line and played in English the film appears quite robotic in the character interplay. A made-in-China movie and for the most part, it was a boring display of violent fantasy. The love interest wasn't believable and the sex scenes are totally juvenile. It was PG-13 which disturbed me very much. The ONLY thing that wasn't there was the usual cursing and blasphemy. Everything else was there, simulated sex, violence and intense melodrama which was way over the top for anyone under the age of 18. I advise anyone thinking of owning and watching this to reconsider and find something else. And even though it was only a penny that was even too much since the shipping was $3.00. Way too much $ for this foreign job. The Robin Hood theme is a total fantasy idea. Leads to class warfare and violence. Sound familiar anyone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very beautiful and well produced, but that's it","review":"Everything in this movie pales before its beauty, and I put the fight scenes in the beautiful category too, since they're the magical kind that aren't remotely possible. The plot, the characters and the reasons for most of the fight scenes are all flimsy pretexts to making a beautiful movie, and mere beauty, no matter how magnificent, doesn't make a complete or good movie for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon...","review":"As longtime fan of Hong Kong cinema, I really looked forward to seeing this in the theater. Unfortunately, while I like the stars of the film, I found the movie itself to be very tedious. The story was nothing new, the locations were uninteresting. I think the plot's problem is there are no good supporting players to make the stars shine. It's just the 3 of them.If you really want to see a good swordplay movie, check out the classics like Bride with White Hair, or the Swordsman trilogy. Other than CTHD, there are no good movies coming out of HK for a long time now. This movie was attempting to be pretty like CT,HD, but did not have the level of story telling at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic.","review":"This kind of movies, you either like them or hate them, so if you're reading this, i guess you've already seen it and like it. The quality of music and sound is really good, as it is in remastered blu ray movies. Dont be expecting the kind of hd that you gent in newest movies, of course. I think that action scenes, and specially the scenarios where this movie takes place are totally worth buyin it in blu ray. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I recently developed an interest is the film after seeing a video of Jackie Evancho singing \\"Lovers\\" from the movie. I was reluctant about getting it in Blu-ray after seeing the other reviews but I took a chance and I am not sorry. It seems just fine to me. I have a Samsung 58\\" Plasma 1080I and maybe that made a difference. It may not have been in 1080I but it was still great. I recommend this highly if you are into this kind of movie. Jackie Evancho's newest CD is coming out in June and hopefully \\"lovers\\" will be on it. If you have not experienced Jackie before I suggest you give her a listen. You will be amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful","review":"This is an very arty movie with kung fu. If you enjoy Crouching Tiger,you should enjoy this. The brothel scene just blows me away.

It's a beautifully filmed movie and a must own. I liked te extras,including a video sang by one of my favorite soprano's Kathleen Battle. Go to their cool website."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed","review":"I am a big fan of martial arts films -- having lived in Taiwan. However, this one was over-hyped in my opinion. The love affairs in the DVD were unbelievable at best and even absurd at times. I often enjoy the melodrama and over-acting of Chinese films, but I gagged a few times on this one. It was down-right goofy at times. I really wanted this one to grab me, but it did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE,JUST LIKE THE \\"HERO\\"","review":"I really liked this movie, just like \\"HERO\\" I saw and loved it, great seen, marshal art, and jaw dropping seens and action, I definitely BUY it on DVD, Just I did with \\"HERO\\" the movie was in this gender well made also. I guess both platinum movies to have in my DVD collection. & Yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Underrated","review":"It seems like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon will be the only Asian martial arts movie to get a big box office draw. Despite amazing reviews, beautiful sets and locations, incredible action and fantastic camera work, House of Flying Daggers wound up flying under everyone's radar. Come on people, it's even a love story. What more do you want? In terms of sheer visual beauty and entertaining fight scenes, there's really not much more you can ask of a movie. A must see for anyone who likes martial arts movies. Also, guys, if your girl doesn't like fighting movies, this is a great chance to get her to enjoy a movie that's involves people kicking each other in the face and throwing knives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony needs to remaster","review":"This was one of the first movies Sony did on Blu-ray.

In the end, it's as simple as saying if you would like to waste your money, then by all means buy the blu ray format HOFD. Otherwise and to the rest of us all that enjoy not wasting money, keep your DVD version and do not think twice on this format for this particular movie. All of my other blu ray movies have been amazing, this one however is a disgrace to the blu ray format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Blu-Ray Transfer","review":"I think Sony should remaster this film.

Inevitably they fall in love in between the government after them, and Leo, a friend and colegue of Jin, is right in between. There are a number of twist and turns and they all seem perfectly transitioned. More than anything it's an art piece of immense beauty and fantasy physics. The story doesn't mold as well as in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but in every other facet it's up to the standards of that Chinese masterpiece. It's one of the best foreign language films in recent years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality belows average","review":"It is a great movie. The disc's quality is really bad.

I couldn't wait.Eh.There are a couple of cool action sequences, but in the end you feel there should have been many more. Too much screen time is used to progress the love story, and the pace slackens then to a crawl. You feel as though the main body of the story is missing.There's a sequence at the beginning, the Echo Game, which is just terribly paced - minutes and minutes of slow-motion cloth-flinging. That was a really bad sign.The ending seems lazy in terms of choreography. A couple of nifty tricks, but a lot of rolling around in the snow.In the end, I preferred Crouching Tiger's amazing fights and its plot, leaving aside its overlong romantic excursions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pure enough.","review":"yep...too much of colors, too much of floating fight scenes, too much of illogical and often unneeded romance. basically ... too much of everything patched together at the same time!I want to love this movie, but I just cant. After going through this movie I could not help but wonder that the director BADLY wanted to cash in on the 'consumed in love' + 'color arts' + 'floating fighting' factor. It struck me instantly that this movie is a sellout manifestation straight from directors brain. Its just not pure enough for the kind of movie it strives to be.Net Effect: In totality HOFD exudes no magic. Break it into smaller pieces and observe -- why ppl are actually calling this movie 'good'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me laugh","review":"First of all, the scenery was breathtaking. The scene with the dancing and the gongs and everything was fantastic. Everything else kind of fell flat. This movie was supposed to be romantic and stuff but it was pretty comedic. I was laughing my head off in the last scene! And it was supposed to be sad! The plot was overly-gag-me cheesy and unrealistic (how could Mei still be alive after all that?!?). Fortunately the characters were overall likeable, except for Mei's psycho ex-boyfriend...please. And the fact that she should be a mondo-good martial artist but still almost gets raped, like, five times is so extraordinairly improbable (not to mention dumb)! By the way, the sex on the forest ground was totally unneeded. Overall this movie is sappy and overdramatic. I recommend you to pick it up at the library if you want a few laughs. Don't waste your money on this...film...if you want a good romantic/martial artsy movie buy 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' or 'Hero' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This movie is so slow i could barely finish it.

Their love blossoms as they fight their way threw enemies on the hills and bamboo forests. They soon get rescued by The Flying Daggers but Jin finds out that Mei, the blind girl he fell for is not blind and was playing him behind his back and she loves another man as well. The 2 men fight for Mei. Beautifully and astonishingly done with awesome fight scenes and Zhang Ziyi (Rush Hour 2, Hero) is simply gorgeous and great. The director knows how to make a movie and he tells it well with colors and locations and some of the imaginary situations (swords bending, guys flying on trees..etc).

It seems more a fable of old, a story meant to convey a moral lesson and it does and I found myself truly enjoying (and missing) this genre. I would highly recommend this movie. Just be aware that it is not an all-action tale but rather an very sweet love story with some very cool fight scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"Daggers definitely fly in this film, but colorful beauty lifts the plot to a fantastic level. Even the fight scenes are creative, even artistic. The bamboo forest fight scene was similar to a Cirque du Soleil performance. Clear use of color to set moods as the story moves is genius. It's like a painter who has one hand at the easel and the other sketching on paper. I agree with reviewer Chanteuse that the quick change in regional scenery is unrealistic. But the cinematic accomplishments made in each location are worth the unreal switch for me. This film is an ever-changing painting from which you can't look away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Mix of Martial Arts and Love","review":"I am not a martial arts movie fan by any means, but I really enjoyed this movie. The effects are dazzling and very well done. But the movie also has a human side in the love story between the two main characters complicated by a side story of unrequited love. The story weaves these many stories beautifully and intricately with even a few twists thrown in.Finally the score for this film is one of the most beautiful that I have ever heard. The Chinese instruments create a gorgeous and lush mood for the film. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was fascinated from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"From another Chinese viewer...","review":"I rented this movie over the weekend so I could decide if I was going to buy it.

I plan on adding it to my collection. You can't judge the movie by 'american eyes and sensibilities'. If you understand the genre and enjoyed 'Hero' -(much less visible wire work than Hero) - I recommend this film. Also look into a french film called, 'Brotherhood of the Wolf'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent photography and characters","review":"I enjoyed this film a lot! Not only because the choreography and costumes, because the image is visually stunning.From the beginning I noticed the story would be more interesting than the usual dramatic-martial arts Chinese movie, just because there was a duality of roles in the protagonist characters. And finally everything around those roles were linked to a love story, that was far from conventionalisms.The costume design and scenery is incredible. The director and his team managed everything to details, e.g. the green appearance of ambient also matched with dresses of daggers. The bamboo forest, which is a known resource of Asian movies, was more than welcome because the fight scenes with tree lances.And finally that would be incomplete without the surrealism of Chinese movies. Where human perfection of techniques is more close to fiction than reality. But at the end that fiction move myself forward to love more that culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome foreign film!","review":"I went to a Blockbuster and thumbed through the foreign films till I came across this one and it seemed to have good actors and plot so I rented it.

You really didn't know what was going on till about 1/2 way or longer through the film. When it's revealed, then they keep you guessing how it will end. Really good directing! so I had to buy it.

The scenery and cinematography is excellent, but the storyline is apalling. The dancing scene from ZiYi becomes boring. The fightings are overdone with special fx. The last scene with endless death of ZiYi is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just so-so","review":"This was below average for this type of money, because there wasn't much of a story. Also, why were there not any royals depicted in this movie?My biggest problem with this movie was WHERE THE HECK DID THESE HORSES APPEAR OUT OF NOWHERE? This happened more than once, where they walk for awhile, then all of a sudden horses are magically there. Thnik we wouldn't notice?Also, were we to believe that those 2 guys fought continously from fall through winter? And that the lady lasted for months lying there with a dagger in her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully composed trifle","review":"\\"House of Flying Daggers\\" is a truly beautiful film. The color palettes for different scenes, the locations, the costuming - every visual element of this film was carefully selected and then used to its best advantage. The cinematography is spectacular. Each frame could almost be a painting.But all of this painstaking art is in service of a predictable and overly-long story. If you've ever watched a movie, you know about 5 minutes into this one where it's going and how it's going to end. And man, does this movie take its time getting there. When you essentially have 3 characters, it's tough to round out 2 hours of viewing time with those three people - especially when the story is nothing new.It's worth a rent if you're into Chinese cinema and aren't expecting epic kung-fu battles. Otherwise, \\"Hero\\" or \\"Crouching Tiger\\" might be better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful But Stupid","review":"Beautiful scenery but a hopelessly bad film.The story could have been written by a group of teenaged boys all suffering from ADD who have an unhealthy obsession with Japanese manga and a rudimentary grasp of human relationships.The film is full of simplistic plot developments that serve only to move the action from one pretty place to another. Television ads for SUVs show more concern for telling a story than this film.And there are amazing lapses of continuity: Jin's bow appears when bad guys show up and disappears after the action is over. Leo and Jin battle as the general's troops descend from the hills. But, the troops never arrive. This is sloppy film making and sloppy editing.Zhang Yimou's films are pretty but empty of all else that makes for entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I'm a big fan of the genre; Crouching Tiger blew me away, and Hero had a place in my heart the first time I saw it. So it was with great anticipation and high hopes that I saw this movie.I was sorely dissapointed. The use of vivid colors complimented the story in Hero. In Flying Daggers, the colors were the story. The plot was backseat to visual effects. I literally got a headache from the swift and ridiculous twists that read more like a soap opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Melodramatic","review":"This movie is really boring. It almost made me laugh while I wasn't supposed to. Sometimes I just wanted to fast foward. The characters are underdeveloped and the story isn't touching as it is supposed to be. Cinemography and scenery are great, and that's why I gave the two stars. The fighting scenes are just so so. Too much CGI for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then HERO!!","review":"I thought this was better then HERO. I enjoyed the story more and like HERO, the effects were used only to enhance the mythical story not overwhelm it. At heart this is a love story, with bits a revenge and betrayal mixed in. The production value is outstanding. Great to see this on a good home theater setup as stated by another reviewer. I really look forward to seeing the next Yimou Zhang project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It's disappointing. What happens to the House of Flying Daggers? As the suspense builds up toward the end, I was expecting an explosion of the love triangle where the heroes take sides and a final battle between the daggers and the general's troops concludes the movie. This movie doesn't do justice for the heroes' skills and heroism. Instead, they end up killing each other nonsensically. There are also some inconsistencies. Non-stop fighting between the heroes from fall until winter is silly and probably taken from legend where they fight for 40 days and 40 nights. I know it's only a movie but it should be a little more believable. At the end, I have the feeling that this movie is incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"i loved cthd and hero.glorious love stories with incredible cinematography.to me this movie is its equal.the scene with the bow and arrow blew me away.i cannot praise this movie too much.i am awaiting another great movie like this.sorely miss chow yun fat who was great in cthd and anna and the king along with his earlier john woo movies-when will he be back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not large enough.","review":"Bettas should not be forced to live in such cramped living situations. It's like putting your cat in a box and leaving it there it's entire life. Or you being stuck in your room your entire life. Sure, you can survive with the bare essentials and food and water, but is it really humane? No. This tank is a horrible excuse for another 'desk accessory' at the price of quality life for a betta. Quite pathetic. If you want to show off your betta, show off that you actually care for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but very Cruel","review":"Who wouldn't enjoy having this sit on their desk? I know I would. But the fish inside wouldn't.No animal, big or small, should be subjected to a life like this. Need a little help? Imagine your dog being trapped inside your laundry room or smallest bathroom where she can hardly stretch out her legs, all day, every day. Or imagine yourself in that situation. No one should be put through this, and I strongly ask shoppers to leave this item on the shelf.Perhaps a manufacturer will tell you that the fish enjoy the enviroment. Could you find a fish cooped up in a space this small naturally? Fish belong in ponds and lakes and oceans, or at a minimum in a tank where they may roam. Please, for the sake of the fish, do not purchase this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruelty to Fish","review":"I am not worried about the fish getting too hot by the light or the bowl breaking. What concerns me is the room. It is a fallacy that they are happy in tiny spaces. If you look a rice paddy in the dry season it may be very narrow but it is miles long! I have actually seen pictures of this. Sometimes they end up in a puddle, yes, but that is not the BEST time in their lives, its the worst! Why put any pet in an environment that is typical of a bad time in its life? Our job as pet owners is to recreate the BEST time in our pets' lives. Please, PLEASE get them at least a ten gallon tank. At the very minimum get them five gallons to swim in. You will be surprised at how much happier your supposedly already happy fish is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea monkeys, not bettas","review":"I breed brine shrimp(sea monkeys) for my other fish to eat. They've always been kept in a 1 gallon tank, which was kind of unnattractive when kept near my other pretty fishies.This bowl is adorable for a few of the sea monkeys to frolic in and I don't really have to worry about there not being enough space.This being said, don't put any kind of fish in this bowl. There's just not room for it. Any fish, even a betta, would have a severely shortened life span from living in such cramped conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Good, Bad for Fish","review":"This is an amazing looking fish tank.. it is bright, easy to see into and the direct light provides viewing into it 24 hours a day..That being said, it is hard to clean, hard to feed and more importantly WAY to small for any fish. My betta fish stopped building bubble nests as soon as I place him into this tank, which meant that he was not happy.. and after a few weeks I placed him a bigger bowl, where he thrives and bubbles like crazy.Every single betta information I read talks about how this size bowl is extremely bad for the fish, and frankly I hate dead fish. If they were to make a bigger, easier to clean and feed version of this I might pick it up, but until then no way."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the right bowl for bob","review":"so I was very excited about this purchase I wanted a tank that did not look cheap like all of the others, it is for my professional office. the \\"light\\" on this lamp is the size of a pin head and not changeable so when the light goes you are done. the fish bowl is acrylic and mine came with some sizable scratches in the surface so there are only a few points where I can see through. because the light is very small it only lights up a small part of the bowl and I can only see the fish when he swims through that part. Oh well I tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Books to Choose","review":"My book club chose this book based on a short write-up in a recommended reading list for book clubs. A story from the perspective of four women who loved the same man. We had just finished a much more serious book and were looking for something a little saucier. This book is odd. The book is not evenly weighted among the women, who are not fully developed as characters, each of which you feel a lack of attachment to. The perspective of the book shifts and be a bit abrupt at time and includes bits of information that just don't seem to fit with the storyline. Consistent with the rest of the book it all just ends randomly. My roommate read it and immediately put it in the recyling bin because she wouldn't recommend it to anyone and wouldn't bother to resell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I just finished reading this book and would like to throw it out the window. I usually like to finish what I started so I forced myself to finish the book just to see how it ends. The begining was interesting but the rest of the story was confusing. The main idea of 4 different woman loving the same man was incredibly stupid. I thought the focus was on genevieve in the begining but suddenly switched to Gerard? The length of time for each character's story was so random it threw me off. Why was Gen's story so long and focused but the other women such as the governess or marie have such a short insignificant role when the idea was to make them major characters? I enjoyed how well the story is written but I hate what the story was about. It was demeaning to those women. There was no great lesson to be learned, just a bunch of women swooning over one man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Muppet Caper","review":"If Kermit the Frog was to do a solo album in 1978 This is what it would sound like \\" Brilliant\\" Jenny should have been named Piggy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the $$ for 'Devil Wind'..the rest is colorless rock","review":"Bob Welch did some very fine work with Fleetwood Mac, especially on their best non-Buckingham/Nicks album \\"Mystery to Me\\", but unfortunately on this follow-up disc to \\"French Kiss\\", Welch seems to have fallen into the sophomore slump. His superstar friends help out, and that provides some much-needed magic(Christine McVie adds her light, lively touch to \\"Come Softly\\" and Stevie Nicks is in full Gyspy spirit on \\"Devil Wind\\"), but the rest of the songs are heavy and hookless, drawn out and a little dull.

AGNES' STAND was a savage tale of survival, chock-full of adventure and character driven prose that is sure to please adventure fans.I only read this book because of the author's novel-turned-movie - The Missing - which I found highly entertaining. So, upon coming home from the movie, I looked up his books. Based solely upon Amazon.com reviewers, I got this novel and read it in 2 days.

I had a large collection of preschool storybooks, including this one. On those occasions when I would ask the children what story they wanted me to read to them, they would invariably choose Watch Out! A Giant.The story is similar to the books Where the Wild Things Are and There's a Nightmare in My Closet in that it shows children overcoming their fears. The design of the book, similar to Carle's The Very Hungry Caterpillar is full of twists and surprises.This book is very underrated, perhaps because it is not as appealing to adults as it is to preschool children.

This book warps your thinking about the geometric rules. Unfortunately, it is written in such a way that even if you are a very concentrated reader, you cannot read a paragraph withouth being distracted. The diction in this story is made to be boring. A teacher assigned freshmen students-in high school- to read this and everyone complained because it literally takes and hour to get through a couple of pages. You must also reread the text to find some sort of meaning. This book is not meant for anyone under 18 and is certainly not enjoyable for leisurely purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Taliban treat women better than this man","review":"If you want to make a young budding girl scientist feel really bad about herself and teach her not to trust men who teach math, this is the perfect book. This author describes women as one-dimensional. The Taliban treated women horrendously but they didn't kick them out of the human race. Flatland basically kicks women out of the human race.

It's also against the Muslim practice of female degradation and treatment of women in general.

They are one of the greatest bands I have ever heard...right up there with U2 and The Beatles, why were'nt they more well known?

My first reaction, however, was one of slight confusion... where's the backpack? It looks great but this claims to be a 2-in-1 harness / backpack \\"for growing travellers\\" but this isn't a backpack at all! It just has a tiny velcro pocket that you can't put anything in, except maybe a pacifier (which would drop out).

I tried other harnesses with my daughter and she hated them. She loves this one! The body is mostly padding with only a little velcro closure pocket on the back. I guess you could stick a little snack or ID cards in there, but if you are looking for a full backpack you'll be disappointed.

I had always been concerned about what seemed degrading to a child of being on a leash like an animal. However, my girls love these giraffes and are now no longer able to run away in public places, something that's a major safety issue. I do get plenty of looks from people in public when we're out, but I get way more compliments from people at how cute the giraffes are and what a good ldea it is than accusing glances. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the straps, even tightened all the way, are still pretty loose. They do provide enough security to keep the giraffes on and my children safe, but are floppy and fall off one shoulder or the other frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monkey harness","review":"This Monkey harness is very cute.

I liked that the video was split into two sections and had a lot of variety in the moves. I don't know how effective the aerobics in the first section were for me--I would have liked more intensity and a faster pace, but the second half got me into a sweat! The scenery was a nice change from a usual gym, but I wish the camera had stayed focused entirely on her rather than moving at strange angles. Overall, it was still a good workout and I think I will definitly try some more of her videos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense, Fun, and Truly One of Her Best!!!","review":"I have read a lot of bad reviews for this one, but I still wanted to try it. I'm so glad I did. I had fun with this one. The first part was heart-elevating, sort of dancey, and real fun. The second part was intense, but fun. I did the whole tape at once and when I was done I was dripping with sweat. The music was pretty good too, especially in the 2nd workout. A real winner in my workout collection. One of her best. Real fun and effective. My only wish would be that it would last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like poor dance instruction then aerobics","review":"This video is extremely hard to follow.

The flannel formed little pill-balls all over with the very FIRST washing, and it only got worse, even though I was following the manufacturer's cleaning instructions! I wouldn't even recommend these for use under a crib sheet, due to the poor washability. After only 3 weeks of light use (I rotated several brands), I bagged them up and returned them to the store.

Those familiar with KING LEAR will find plenty to enjoy here: the happy ending is a healing antidote to Shakespeare's heavy finale; the absence of the father-son subplot from this anonymous play has the advantage of a shorter and tighter script; the language, unlike Shakespeare's, is fairly easy. Like the other Globe Quartos titles, the published format of this NHB edition of KING LEIR is in every way superb: apart from a crystal-clear printed text, an introduction, textual notes, glossarial notes, and a synopsis of the plot are included. Not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great!","review":"If you are thinking of starting a team, or you have had one fail miserably, then you MUST read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing Everything","review":"To see everything and then have to choose what colors, flavors, feelings, sounds and ooops, the things forgotten -- after stirring through every choice, Geoffrey Brock takes the exact words he needs and puts them in the exact order and gives back a poem that will make you bring your fist to your heart, your mouth, your eyes and finally, fling it out into the air. Ah!!! I see it, too!If you read his poems deeply and see what he sees, you know you're in the proximity of something great and dear. There are poems you'll have to memorize, ones you'll have to call up a friend and read, and others you'll just read over and over again, for comfort.

The last movement will have you humming long after. I have never heard this played on local classical stations as Japanese music just isn't played.

Obviously written for a younger teen audience, adults who love the Star Wars universe could still find some enjoyment in reading these. 'The Only Witness' isn't a very good book. The story is cobbled together last minute and the plot is totally uninvolving. It may have something to do with Watson coming off a multi-book story arc that was very good, and this book comes off as a sad epilogue. The very fact that there was a birthday party in the SW universe just didn't seem right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Industrial earphones","review":"I use these head phones on a ship in a small space with lots of cooling fans. The decibel level of this small space has been deemed detrimental to my hearing. I use these headphones the minute I walk into the space and wear them throughout the day. They are comfortable to wear continuously and they diminish the sound level as well as the more bulky type.

You'll definitely enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary For Your Collection, If You Like Badfinger","review":"This low-quality rendition of a live performance was the only Badfinger CD easily available for several years, and it's worth owning in order to experience the live sound of the first post-Beatles Beatle-like band.

Coyote is most often seen as a trickster who makes a fool of himself so that child listeners may learn the lesson. This book contains an introduction and six coyote tales. The illustrations are black pen and the stories retain an authentic tone. The text is perfect for second graders and would be a great series of school skits, with dialog and narration already in the text.

Tudor Parfitt seems to be an unusual combination of intellectual and adventurer. Journey....is well written, entertaining and informative.

I finally got around to reading this book, while being delayed on a flight. I found the book to be one of those that is hard to put down. I like the fact that the book is told from the perspective if someone searching for the answer to a question and giving details of fortunes and misfortunes along the way. I normally am not good at reading books all the way through because of my hectic schedule.The information in this book is both enlightning and tragic in another. Of course the research points out that the Lemba have DNA that is of the Kohen Model type, and at the same time to see how much they have lost in terms of this heritage is the sad part. Yet, the book is truly a must and another one that I think should be a part of every Jewish library and Yeshivah."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an animated version!","review":"You'd never know it from the description you will find in the search of Amazon.com but this is an animated version of the feature film, and not a very good one at that.

I haven't found them to be uncomfortable as some other reviews have -- in fact, I kind of wish they would push a little deeper into my ears, as the noise suppression level is sufficient, but not fantastic. Honestly I think you get quieter results from the cheap, foam, roll-them-up earplugs, but these work fine for my purposes, with the added convenience of the band to aid taking them off and on.UPDATE: My band snapped after about two weeks of use. I replaced them with Howard Leight QB2s, which feel a lot more durable and also have a higher dB reduction rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 years later, they finally broke","review":"I have read the other reviews for these ear plugs and wanted to give my opinion. I use these for all power equipment usage, weed trimming, and have even used them at a Monster Jam event, in other words I have used them while moving and have had no issues (unlike the other reviewers who indicated they could only use them while staying in one spot). They effectively block out noise, sit in my ear properly and do not slip out. I do admist they are a little difficult to get into my ear, but the extra 10 seconds is worth it. After owning a pair for close to 10 years, they finally broke, probably due to having used them in both Houston and Minnesota and the extreme temperatures the plastic has had to deal with during its life.

If you touch this toy, the shorter slide falls off. Each time my son tried to roll the car down the slide, the slide fell off. The elevator is almost impossible to move as well. Very quickly he vacated this toy to find one that he could actually play with. It went back in the box 5 minutes after I finally assembled it. And speaking of assembling it, the directions are non-worded and confusing, making putting it together a frustrating chore. I purchased it online from Little Tikes and have asked for a refund.

The book helped me to understand the threading process, the tension knobs, and about what type of thread and needles to buy. At the beginning of the book, the author attempts to discuss different machines and then abandons the idea as the book progresses. However, the concepts and techniques are pretty much universal.

You get tips on threading, tension adjustments, troubleshooting, securing seams, needle selection, working with knits, and using elastics. You also get ideas for fun projects and much more.

Enigma manages to take Gregorian chant, synthesized music, keyboard, and poetry, and mix it all together in such a way as to just flow with a beauty I haven't found elsewhere -- even in their other albums. Of the four CDs and various other assorted tracks I've heard from them, this album shines through as their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return To Innocence Is The Only Thing I Liked!!","review":"My review will probably perplex and annoy the diehard Enigma fans, but sorry they are just not for everyone!

But don't expect great musicianship or composing skills, or even great sound. This is a CD that's made for playing in the background because it just doesn't stand up under scrutiny. The \\"lyrics\\" on pieces like \\"Second Chapter\\" are so inane as to almost be a Spinal Tap like parody of the new age music genre. The keyboard sounds are so cliche as to be unlistenable in some places. I mean, if you're not going to use a real Native American cedar flute then at least get a decent synth patch to mimic one.Great for a chill out room at a rave, or if you need something to listen to while shopping for incense and dolphin posters.

The reason why I bought it in the first place, was for Return to Innocence. This was the song that started my interest in Native American music. And I found I also love Dream of the Dolphin.

If some one gets this with out ToA, you will not have the fun that was once there in this game. Over all i will now give this a 1 star from a 5 from 1 year ago and the reason being that anyone that starts now will have a long time too go be compairable to some level 40's.

Mythic Entertainment will continue to bill you month after month which I discovered after-the-fact on my credit statement.

The problem is with the script: it falters about half way through and in the end dies completely. The film is not, as advertised, a comedy. It's a fantasy about Chicago mobsters and a shoe shine man (Don Ameche) who is little livelier and more interesting than a scarecrow. The story is so poorly done that at one point the main gangster character steals a car by hot wiring it to take him and the scarecrow from Lake Tahoe to Chicago. Along the way they stop at a gas station, and there are now keys in the car, which are taken by an attendant in lieu of payment. Apparently hours later, the two men are back in Chicago. This after the gangster had left his jacket behind with the airline tickets. The worst part is the utterly absurd ending. I can imagine even art theater audiences, devoted to Mamet and \\"fillum,\\" groaning if not booing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a Mamet fan, but this is probably his worst.","review":"I gave this movie every chance, but the story is slow,the acting is liveless (Ameche is the only one half-waydecent), and the story turns out pointless. The ending doesn'treally make any sense or have any impact, and the vaguenessand indirection that is usually explained at some later pointin Mamet's films is never clarified here.Only watch if you're a die-hard Mamet fan so you can say at a dinner party, \\"Yes, I saw that one, and I agree it was bad\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite David Mamet film of the 80's.","review":"Things Change (1988) During the late 1980's, actor Don Ameche continued his remarkable comeback in David Mamet's story of a naive shoeshiner who is roped by the mob into posing as one of their own. Joe Mantegna steals the film for me as Ameche's reluctant minder. Glengarry Glen Ross gets better reviews but this remains my favorite of Mamet's works. The chemistry between Ameche and Mantegna is terrific and you'll be rooting for both men as their journey leads them towards a tense, yet inevitable resolution. Robert Prosky appears in a pivotal role and the future husband & wife team of William H. Macy and Felicity Huffman have brief roles as well. Don't miss this gem of a film, it will stay in your heart once you watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for action fans","review":"Yes, this film does not \\"rock 'em, sock 'em along\\" like your usual action flick, written by 20 somethings for the prepubescent crowd. Your may have to go through more than one scene without a car chase, explosion, or gratiutious sex. This is a quiet comedy, written about the stranger than fiction turns life can take. If you're bored with the same cookie cutter plots and small rotation of leading men, give this a try. There's a reason why the price remains in the $20.00 range.

I'm an avid reader and this is the first book in a long time that made me want to contact the author (I wish authors listed their email adresses....hint.hint.) It was just a delight. I found the charactars very real, vulnerable, flawed and funny. Over and over I laughed out loud. THAT is a compliment. As a smoker, I have to love a book that warmly portrays a smoking fiend. How refreshing! I would recommend this to anyone that is in the mood for a book about love, life and the hilarity of everyday existance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing from McCauley","review":"I loved Object of my Affection to the point that I would come home and expect to find the characters in my apartment.

The unique Chess Adventure mode in this game caught my attention so I bought the product, and am very pleased with it! It has rekindled my interest in chess and made learning the game fun. The graphics are great (the best of any chess program I've seen, especially the 3D boards) and there are plenty of other features in the game including online play, an easy to use interface, and a strong chess engine that will challenge anyone. Of course its not as feature rich as a more advanced program like Chessmaster or Fritz, but for a beginner or intermediate player looking for something different, or someone who just wants to have fun and learn the game, its perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Graphics and Great for Kids Who Can Read","review":"I like this chess game for beginner to intermediate players, and my young kids love it because of the great graphics (even 3D shading on a 2D board) and especially the adventure mode.

The level of play in adventure mode seems a bit unpredictableInspite of the drawbacks, it's still very enjoyable and a great value at less than $10.

I ordered this as a gift. I thought I would receive a hard-cover book with nice type face, nice paper and a dust jacket. What I got was a cheaply printed paperback on cheap pulp with a stupid, cheap cover and no dust jacket. Just awful. I'm going down to Barnes and Noble and see what they sell and will probably return this trashy product.My guess is that the paperback edition would be more presentable as a gift than this sorry excuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"a mixed bag of wonderfully written stories...","review":"As with his trademark 'A Catcher in the Rye', 'Nine Stories' by J.D. Salinger is superbly written. The dialog and attention to detail are extraordinary. Little wonder these stories were first published in top tier magazines. Yet despite all this I found most of the stories to be forgettable. But there are a couple of superb stories, each one involving complexities of youth. As with his 'A Catcher in the Rye', the author shows that he is a keen observer of teenagers and their hormone-induced angst.Bottom line: well worth it for the couple of diamonds amongst the zirconium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above-Average","review":"Solid collection of stories that I appreciate more in retrospective of than during reading. The highlights are \\"The Laughing Man,\\" \\"For Esme, With Love and Squalor,\\" and \\"Teddy.\\" Should appeal to both Salinger and short story fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unmentioned Story","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was entertaining. I don't have much of a mind for analyzing things or even really just figuring out all the details or meanings, but I guess anyone can get something out of any of these stories.

It was lively and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two for Nine ain't bad","review":"You must read \\"A perfect Day for Bananafish\\" and \\"Teddy.\\" These stories are ridiculously good, but only for the modern reader who doesn't really care about happy endings. In fact, the stories are brilliant. The other seven are pretty good, but these two make the entire work worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Day for Salinger","review":"Even after decades, this is still appealing to people of all ages. I'm a teenager and I have always been more interested in reading more modern-day novels and short stories, but J.D. Salinger is among one of the few exceptions I have been willing to broaden my horizons for. \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\" is by far my favorite of all the nine stories. There is a part where this little girl is talking to Seymour and she is wearing a canary-yellow swimsuit. Seymour commented on it, saying, \\"I've always loved that color of blue on a bathing suit,\\" and the little girl responded with, \\"This is yellow!\\" and Seymour said, \\"So it is.\\" Eeek! The little things like that are what make me love Salinger and his writing so very much. Sorry that this was not much of a review with a plot summary or anything, but trust me, read this and you'll love it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"None of these stories were of interest to me","review":"I like a wide variety of authors and types of books.

Better than Catcher in the Rye, these stories have lost none of their punch, surprise or grace. The stories should be required reading for any American Literature Survey course and remain as good as the best short stories of Cheever, Gogol, Maugham and Updike (listed in alphabetical order)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seymore and Teddy one and the same.","review":"Aside from loving every story and all of the characters in them,I kind of wanted to point out that I don't think it was an accident that Perfect Day for Bananafish and Teddy bookend these stories.I personally believe (after many readings and one mystical experience)that Teddy and Seymore Glass are one and the same(Teddy being Seymore's last incarnation).I also believe there is some evidence of this in another Salinger book. That being said I would just like to add how beautiful all of these stories are and the undercurrent of spirituality that runs through them has at times been the only notion of God I could truly accept.Needless to say thumbs up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Collection","review":"\\"Nine Stories\\" is a collection of stories written by J.D. Salinger, that were published in other media before he made his mark in literature. Collected in this popular book, we see hints of what makes Salinger's writing an American treasure.Of the stories, \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\" is the most celebrated. The imagery used in the stories of using an over-gorging fish to compare to a womanizer is fascinating. Many of the other stories are unspectacular, though I also enjoyed the story of the child existentialist \\"Teddy\\" a great deal. Other stories I wondered what point the author was leading the reader to explore.One of the qualities I most amdire in Salinger is that he does not tell the reader what to think is happening. He allows an intelligent reader to fill in the blanks. For this reason, \\"Nine Stories\\" is worth a look to see Salinger polishing his craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"REQUIRED READING, EVERYONE!","review":"It pains me to see it unread. I reach for a rusty cleaver when unappreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're all entitled to our opinion.","review":"I actually feel that all of Salinger's work in thematically repetitious, but not lacking in talent. Is my opinion worth more because I spelled it right? There's this other word that I always have trouble with: pretentious. Is that spelled right? Used correctly in that sentence? All of that aside, I very much enjoy reading Salinger's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Good stories, but quite a let down overall","review":"I think that some of the stories in this book were very good, the best being A perfect Day for Banana Fish, but after the first 3 stories, it went down hill. After reading Catcher in the Rye, I was hooked on salinger, but these stories were not short stories, they just got longer and longer, and some of them I found hard to finish because they became either too complicated or they just lost my interest. An okay book, but I know that this definatly isnt Salinger's greatest works."},{"rating":"1","title":"High expectations - did not deliver","review":"I really enjoyed Salinger's more popular Catcher in the Rye and wanted even more of Salinger to get my hands on.

Of course, \\"Bananafish\\" - so sweet and off the wall - is my favorite, but the others are great. \\"The Laughing Man\\" will make you cry and \\"De-Daumier-Smith\\" is a hoot!

Far surpasses \\"Catcher\\" if you ask me.These are (you guessed it....nine) short stories. Most are quite dark and have an excellent ability to instill the reader with brooding/uneasy feelings.Take the opener....\\"A perfect day for bananafish\\". This is what lead me to J.D. Salinger, and particularly this work. As an aside, and a piece of factoid--take it for whatever its worth--this work inspired The Cure to record the song \\"Bananafishbones.\\" But, this story is kind of a creepy, weird little story with an ending that just blew me away. (No pun intended for those who have read it.)And so it goes, from that one forward. The mood has been set. One after the other, dark, rather cold, stories. But, it's all painfully good.All in all, a good collection of stories from one of the greatest American authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"gold and garbage","review":"The good stories (Laughing Man, Esme, Dinghy) are tens.The bad stories (Bananafish, Green My Eyes) get negatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer","review":"I'm about halfway through, but am loving the hell out of it.

I personally hated it!

The stories are just too complicated for me, and they seem to be pointless. You know nothing about anything when you start this book, so it's a complete waste of time, in my opinion. I guess maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to read such a complex piece of work, but nonetheless, I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Story and Parts of Eight Others","review":"After reading and loving A Catcher in the Rye, I was expecting this to be brilliant. What it wound up being was similar to a trip to the dentist.The first story, \\"A Perfect Day For Bananafish\\" was very entertaining, and got my hopes up. I expected that the rest of the stories would have some sort of entertainment value, some sort of plot twist, but it was all downhill after that. The one star I gave it was for that first story.The most striking thing about these stories is that while they have vivid descriptions and colorful character portraits, the stories have no plot whatsoever, and the characters dont *do* anything. I found that I was asking myself \\"what was the point?\\" after reading each of the latter eight stories. If you havent read Salinger before, do yourself a favor and read A Catcher in the Rye before you read this, because otherwise it will turn you off to Salinger entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's New?","review":"The book Nine Stories, is repetative in its theme's. There is no sense of digression, only confussion. Each of the stories has a main theme in commom which basically sums up to be around negativity; there is always something happeneing to make the story very dissappointing Or negative. Someone dies, someone gets hurt, something bad happens to affect someone else.If I was to really summarize these stories as a whole, i would say that it is a very long poem. I love to write poems and i get that feeling from each story."},{"rating":"2","title":"great reading","review":"I took this book on vacation with me and it was perfect. As I really have learned that so many books published today are underdeveloped and overmarketed, I wanted something that would satisfy my craving for a really good read and I went back to some older books. I won't review each story in the collection as so many other readers already have - but I must say that each story stands out in my memory and left me contemplating the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salinger is not just about teenage angst....","review":"Anyone, specifically teenagers, who read \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and were looking for more stories of Holden and teenage angst will be tremendously disappointed with this collection...because there really isn't a drop of it in here. What this collection of Nine stories DOES contain is everything else. Each story probes to the depths, in so few words,on some highly worthy subject, many times devastating, and somehow you always end of laughing inbetween your tears, as well as pondering each story long after the front cover has been shut. To me, reading Salinger is kind of like a Manic Depressive Wild Ride...full of profanity, then tenderness, horrifying discoveries and beautiful offerings.Buddy Glass once said, (in probably my misquoted words) \\"I can't keep jumping between high delight...and grief forever....\\" but please take an hour or two to do so and pick up this book....with an open mind and heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typo","review":"The board is labelled Abit Aw9D but the picture is that of a Aw8D.

I thought maybe AFOS would try to experiment with 90s grunge or do something else to try to \\"update\\" their sound. Well, much to my satisfaction, that didn't happen. They kept the synthesizers on! This is an 80s album circa 1995. Some of the songs on here are fantastic. The instrumentals seem out of place on the album, but they are very well done, so I won't complain. If you like \\"I Ran\\" or \\"Space Age Love Song\\" you won't be disappointed with this CD.What I want to know is, Why did AFOS stop recording? I guess there aren't enough of us left who still appreciate their style of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should of won a Grammy!","review":"This Album is like Wow!

I liked it, but I was disappointed that I wasn't as scared as I thought I would be. I saw the movie first and it didn't really affect me that much either, except it is one of my favorite movies. The book is very well written, exciting, and there are some parts that spooked me, but otherwise it didn't scare me too much. If there's any book out there scarier than this one tell me and I'll try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Dark and eerie as the movie (Spoilers)","review":"Although the book is slow at times, it's still as dark and eerie as the movie was. The reader actually feels claustrophobic when he describes the evil thats possessed Regan and struck fear in her mother and family within the townhouse in Washington D.C. The last 80 pages were truely gripping as you read the demons attempt to trick everyone in the room into stopping the exoricism. This wasn't in the movie. The extended conversations between Karras and the demon were supurb and I thought they should've been in the movie also. Also the book highlights the final confrontation between Merrin and The demon much better than the movie. You actually hear the demon make statements about their last confrontation.But overall it's the closest Book to movie transitions I have ever experienced. They are almost identical An excellent book and will definitely be in my top five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely one of the best books you will ever read","review":"Absolutely one of the best books you will ever read.

I was quite convinced that nothing could really top the movie, and that this would simply be one of those few times when the movie is better than the book. I was wrong. Though I cannot assuredly say that I enjoyed the book more than the movie, I certainly enjoyed it as much. The book contains a few things in it that clarify what the movie left out. The book also does a better job of transforming Reagan. There is (as there will be in books) more character depth for all of the characters... If you're new to the genre of horror, or if you've just missed out on this classic, I highly recommend your reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the Best Hooror Books Yet","review":"As well as being one of the best horror books ever written, this has an amazing plot that captures you until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent! One of the best books I've read!!","review":"\\"The Exorcist\\" is one of the best books in the Horror genre I've yet to read. It is about a 12 year old girl named Regan McNeil, who at the beginning of the book is normal, but soon becomes possessed by the devil himself. Why? That my friend, is never mentioned, but the result is quite chilling! The storyline is excellent, Blatty's writing is horrific in telling the tale of a mother who needs the help of two priests to save her daughter. Later, in 1973, this was made into a movie that was a box-office smash, and is also one of my favorites. This is a book that is not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Head Spinner","review":"To date, I still recall some of the nightmare-inspiring scenes from the movie from when I first came across \\"The Exorcist\\" as a child. I decided against watching the new release and instead, opted for the book. That was one of the best decisions I made to date.Removed from the visual impact of the movie, I was able to discover, to my surprise and delight, the sheer entertainment found in the verbal exchanges between the demon and the humans. Just the sarcasm, wit, humour and oftentimes, educational informaton derived from these banters, make the book a worthwhile read.This is defintely one book that is very difficult to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking","review":"I read this novel years after its original publication date and I must say that even with the horror novels of today, this book is still a page turner.Reagan, the daughter of a movie star Chris, suddenly begins acting strangely. As the book progresses, every scientific diagnosis and drug available has been tried. Reagan is diagnosed with some for of severe hysteria. With nothing else works to change Reagan increasing distasteful (to say the least) behavior -- and people start dying, Chris turns to a minister to perform an exorcism.You also learn that Reagan has been playing with a Ouija board and speaking with a spirit called Captain Howdy (ever see Strangeland with Dee Snider -- now I know where he got that screen name).All in all it's a great book. If it doesn't terrify you, you'll at least be shocked because Reagan does ALOT of shocking things."},{"rating":"2","title":"are you serious? im the first reviewer?","review":"this is sad.. such an amazing book and no reviews.. well this is an amazing book. well written and scary as hell. a little girl gets posessed by an evil spirit and her mothers only choice is to turn to an excorsist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I read it in only 2 days. This story is terrifying and I could read it over and over and not get tired of it. I was afraid that I would have nightmares when I went to sleep!

A horror masterpiece. But soomething in me always told me I wasn't sattisfied with the film, I wished to see more intense parts. Few weeks ago I came to know about the book, I dont know what came in my mind but I thought the book might have the whole story more in detail.. and I was right. The book unlike the film scared me even more... since its much more in detail, dont get me wrong.. the film is good, but the book is even better. It scared me a lot, and there were certain parts not mentioned in the film at all, just certain minor details. If you love horror novels, this is a book just for you. Dont miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is more fascinating than the movie.","review":"I saw the movie several times and became a fan of The Exorcist, but I discovered that reading the original novel is more fascinating, more deep and help you to understand deeper the story. I read it and will read it a thousand times more, is the most horrifying story I ever knew. The language, the context, everything fits too perfectly in an environment that will make you feel like you're part of the story. I strongly recommend this jewel of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"When I first heard about \\"The Exocist\\" it was from a friends mom. She told me that the movie she saw as a teenager was different then the one we were about to see. She was telling me all these gory parts that they had to cut out of the movie. When the movie first started I thought it would be cheesey or something. But I started to get really scared by the end I was just like shaken. Just seeing a 12 year old girls head spinning was horrific! My friend and I went to the libary the next weekend. While I was looking at some books, a book feel from they shelf behind me. It was \\"The Exorcist\\". I sat down and started to read it soon I couldn't stop. I took it out and read about a little more than half before my mother found it. She told me it wasn't meant for people my age (13). She took it back and I haven't really thought about the movie or the book since. But now I'm always scared the devil will come after me.

Most of it had nothing to do with Reagan and was concentrating on Detective Kinderman trying to solve the murder and Karls drugged up daughter. Nothing about it scared me and i appreciate that as i read it in just over 1 day some of it may have been lost on me but the ending was very rushed and left us with many questions. Nothing even made me think reagan was anything more than a disturbed child and i am perplexed at how it has been so popular over the years. If the book is better than the film then the film must be awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like an overlong screenplay.","review":"Well, I guess this will be an unpopular review, based on the opinions I see here praising the book, but here goes: The story is superb of course, and is absolutely a classic of horror, but the writing style STINKS. There is absolutely no detail in most of the \\"scenes,\\" and it reads like a movie screenplay, or even a short movie treatment. It's just too shallow in its narrative; too film-like. Knowing that Blatty writes primarily for the screen, this is not surprising. I can't even call it a novel - it's just not well written as a novel at all. There is no character development, and I feel like I'm looking at the characters through glass. You can't get to know them through the book at all. I love well-written literature, but with this classic story, I must advise that you do yourself a favor and just see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"an anti-Catholic fantasy trivializing actual Catholic Exorcism","review":"Peter Blatty in my opinion, sold his pretend-fantasy about Exorcism, describing such in ways that dont even come close to the reality of Exorcism, which is profound and real in the Church. He sells out Catholic Church teachings about exorcism by making trivial and shallow assertions about it all. The church doesnt revolve around a guy who didnt make his hash marks as a writer with his one effort... it was the film maker who put the fantasy of 'exorcist' into pop culture, and the film is different than the book and shows true genius in film making. Regarding Blatty's writings trivializing exorcism, his book cant be put ahead of the real Christ that the real Church revolves around solely. In that way, the Exorcist book is uninformed and inaccurate in its \\"facts\\" about exorcism. The book is entertainment, but not in any way a serious portrayal of what is."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book!","review":"This was the best book that I have ever read.Blatty made the whole thing seem so real.

I finally watched the movie, wich was unforgettable, and I just had to read the book after that. I normally don't read very much and if I do it has to be really good. Well, I had no problem reading this. I read the whole book in one day and I enjoyed it so much, during dinner, I even read.I really liked the author's style, it keeps you interested and the characters are great too.

Because the case was being contiunally backed up by less and less probable medical symtoms.I know it seems like I'm bashing the book, but I really enjoyed it. I just think it is a bit overrated Read it, but it doens't seem to live up to the hype the movie has brought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"This should be required reading in high school. Though horrifying, this book is one the most powerful testaments to faith, love and courage in the face of indomitable evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Psychological horror","review":"The Exorcist is an excellent book about Faith and religion. Whether man can keep his faith with God. This book has great scenes of suspense,that will keep your heart racing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terror for Thought","review":"As Blatty's novel has become an undisputed modern classic, there's no need for me to expound upon the greatness of this book. It is interesting, however, to note what you might get out of the story. I read it quickly in under three days, as I couldn't put it down, and I found myself thinking more about the possibilities of evil and the forms that it is able to take. While I am still a skeptic, the novel has made me consider other ideas; and isn't it for that kind of stimulation that we read?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was the best piece of literiture I have ever read.","review":"The Exorcsit was a very good book becuse I like how the author William Peter Blatty used other referces like a book written by K. Osked. My favorate part in the book is when Reagan spins her head around and when she first meets Damian Karras.If I had a credit card I would buy the new book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An learned, honest and compelling work","review":"An extraordinary novel, but not a work of horror at all. This is real theology dressed in the garb of a supernatural thriller. Blatty made clear for me exactly what the Catholic Church believes about the nature of evil and its place in a universe ruled by an all-powerful and benevolent God. I don't share those beliefs, but this compelling, eloquent presentation of them is highly recommended for anyone interested in the intellectual and spiritual issues involved. The author is obviously very learned and he fills his novel with wonderful discussions about psychiatry, medicine, science, and religion. It's an honest and subtle work that faces the difficult questions it raises head-on. I hardly expected so much intellectual depth from what I had ignorantly come to regard as a cheap shocker."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Better Movie then a Book","review":"I was looking forward to reading The Exorcist but I was let down. The book is boring it doesn't go into any real depth when it comes to characters. The movie surpasses the book, I feel asleep while reading this book.

Definately would order from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review with caution","review":"I have no problem with the service nor the product ordered. I would have given 5 stars but my fear of the subject matter and my opinion that Blatty, the publishers, etc. would write/publish a book that contains the most blasphemous words ever written by man prevents me from giving the ultimate praise the reader in me feels it deserves. I have to make sure this book lies next to the Holy Bible to keep (hopefully) its darkness in check. The book itself was in the condition advertised. It arrived in a timely fashion. That is about as much praise I can give to to all involved in the selling and shipping of the most horrifying, disturbing, fascinating horror novel of all time. It will always be the 'Elvis' of horror novels--The King. Now I'm going to say my prayers to the Lord and I hope I didn't get myself in trouble with God ( may he forgive me for reading and most of the time enjoying this book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heady Taste Delight","review":"Making scrambled eggs with white truffle butter is a fragrant, heady experience.

It certainly has its moments, but I would add the caveat, so long as you are sitting at your child's elbow. It's hard to imagine a child playing with it independently, while still young enough for it to be called \\"educational\\". Simple touches, like arranging the activities so that the easiest ones appear first, would have helped a lot. But they appear to be in semi-random order, and I am left wandering through a cumbersome interface searching for things that it's possible for her to play. If you have a child who will let you hang over their shoulder (which my daughter, strong-willed and independent, doesn't always tolerate), and are willing to burn about half of their playtime dealing with poor design instead of playing, then there's some educational benefit to be gleaned in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling action !","review":"This superb video captures the exciting history of the world's greatest steeplechase.

I miss the speed dialing option, but being able to have a 50 name phone book built in is a nice feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Use + Poor Sound Quality","review":"Bought this phone, charged it up and instantly noticed problems with the sound quality. Sound cut in and out frequently and it was hard to carry on a conversation. If the other end is another 2.4 system or a cell phone, the callee typically has a real hard time following the conversation. Also, this phone is hard to use which is apparently a typical problem with these new phones. I also really missed the 10 number speed dial. After fully charged I also found the handset very warm, almost too warm to handle. The keys are also very easy to accidently push which can cause problems if you are on the phone talking to someone. Yuck! Returned this one. I've experienced similar problems with other 2.4GHz phones, so this may be problematic for these new phones. I will probably go back to the less trendy but more reliable 900MHz phone line."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Incredible Duet","review":"No Crusaders CD can be rated less than 4 stars, but this album has an incredible duet entitled No Matter how high I Get with Bill Withers and Randy Crawford.

Within ten minutes, I realized my folly. \\"The Westing Game\\" by Ellen Raskin is a very clever whodunit, and this movie utterly fails to capture its spirit. It eliminated several key characters, added asinine subplots and twists, and featured extremely poor acting, with the exceptions of Shane West and the wonderful Diane Ladd. To the little girl who portrayed Turtle, the young heroine, I have three words of advice: Get acting lessons. The Turtle in the book is spunky and sarcastic; the movie one melodramatic and silly. Seeing this tripe spurred me to find the book and re-read it. For anyone who is considering seeing this movie, I suggest skipping it and reading the book.

The next problem, annoying clicking during calls, don't even have to be far away from the base for this to happen. Doesn't happen every call, but enough to now want me to get another phone. The latest problem, I place the phone back on the base, and it won't charge.

This is our 4th cordless phone, and by far the worst.The caller's voice is muffled and quiet. The microphone picks up background noise and seems to amplify it through the speaker, so even with the slightest amount of background noise it's very difficult to understand what is being said. The handset doesn't seem to conform to the face well, so it feels very uncomfortable as I'm trying straining to hear.With everyone else saying how clear reception is, I have to wonder if we have a dud on our hands.My other criticism of this phone is that there is no display on the handset, unlike all our previous phones. I'm not the most careful dialer, and quite often make mistakes. Without a display, I can't tell if I've entered the right number nor can I tell if Redial is recalling the number I expect.All in all, very very disappointed with this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"caller id phone","review":"i bought two of these phones a year ago and they both have ceased to function....when retrieving numbers from the caller id the screen will say \\"out of range\\" when I am right next to the base...worked great, but did not last long..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the KX-TG2570","review":"I am pleased with the phone---it has the caller ID and answering machine.

The reception was great, range good, caller ID good, solid feel and good looks. (note; had this phone but the model with the caller ID) After 9-10 months of use, however, the phone is useless. The reception is pathetic (can't understand the caller even when right beside the base), calls don't go through to the handset even when in the charger and I'm always getting the 'Out of Range' message (again, even when right beside the base). May have been a dud but I expect to get more than 1 year out of even the cheapest phone. Am shopping for a replacement right now and would not even consider this phone, even at a fraction of the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Phone","review":"I bought this phone after trying many other phones. I can honestly say that this one is one of the better ones. Although it is a good phone it also has some problems. Lets start with the positive aspects. First is the range; of all the phones I have used or tried, this one has the best range out of all of them. The clarity is also excellent, although at times when I get it to close to my computer it cam buzz a little. This is really not a big issue and happens very infrequently. The construction is sturdy and it has a really sleek design that makes it look good.For the not so positive aspects, there are a few. The biggest one that I found was with the headset heating up while in use. It heats up to the point that you have to change ear. Another is the weight. To me it seems a little heavy compared to some of the others from such companies as AT&T. Overall a great phone, that I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone","review":"This phone has excellent range, clarity and features... i bought the 2550 (the one with caller ID) and the keypad and display are backlit so it is really easy to see at night.

The talk button is a little small but it's only a minor problem. overall the phone is excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT!","review":"As with the other reviewers I have similiar \\"out of range\\" issues.

All of a sudden (like after 6 months of use) the phone buzzes and hisses when i am on a call, attempting to change channels results in an \\"out of range\\" message - i have a studio in nyc - 30' is the max ill ever be from the base! heavens forbid this is near ANY other electronic device - it goes mad! stick with the less picky 900mhz or do like im about to do and skip panasonic alltogether in the cordless market!"},{"rating":"1","title":"On My Third One...","review":"It's hit or miss with this phone. When it works it's great. My first one lasted less than one year with minimal use; just one of 8 phones in our home. Second phone came DOA, hard to get dial tone like many others describe. I keep buying them and returning them until I can shake this lemon (I refuse to get stuck with a lousy service situation of mailing it away for repair etc.). Hopefully three is a charm. I will never buy another Panasonic phone. They should simply replace bad phones instead of trying to stick people with garbage and losing customers forever. Bad business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine while it lasted","review":"I'm really unhappy with this phone. It worked great for a little under a year, and now it's totally unusable. Everything comes out very distorted and I can barely hear what anybody is saying. I really do expect a product like this to last more than a few months! Given how many of the reviews mention reliability problems, I'd recommend taking any review by somebody who has owned this phone for less than six months with a big grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious Copy of \\"Brave New World\\"/ \\"We\\"","review":"The themes of this book are obviously inspired (copied) from the 1946 novel \\"Brave New World\\" by Aldous Huxley, which itself is claimed to be inspired by the 1921 book \\"We\\" by Yevgeny Zamyatin.

Unfortunately, the Bluewater adaptation only collect issues 1-4 of their 6-issue mini-series! According to Bluewater, issues 5 & 6 are going to print soon, so why print this collection of the six issue mini-series before it's even complete? That's a shame, because I found this comic adaptation to be pretty faithful to the original novel, and not the cheesy-but-lovable 1976 MGM movie. If this book had all six issues reprinted, it'd probably get a four star rating from me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good movie, ok book","review":"The author was trying for fast-paced adventure here, I hope, and nothing else. Because that's what this book is. Actually, it moves so fast, it somehow gets a childish feel to it, as if a teenager wrote it. The lack of characterization is almost shocking considering how good the movie was. The book is just a rapid series of pointless and not very exciting adventures in which Logan meets a foe, defeats him, moves on, and so on and so on and so on. In all honesty, I have seldom been this disapponted in a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logan's Run...or most of it!","review":"An Awesome read, which is no surprise. I'm a huge Logan fan and have read all of the books and of course own the movie and the original comics. For some reason, apparently due to scheduling, the last 2 issues were not included in the graphic novel version which leaves the reader hanging if they are not familiar with the story. I can't wait to read the last 2 issues.This comic is much closer to the original novel than the movie and was very enjoyable. I loved the art and thought the story was conveyed very well! Worth buying for any Logan fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"I bought this to replace an earlier version of Hoyle Card Games because the CD was getting a little worn out. Ugh.

It does not have the beat or the feelings that he so carefully and whole heartedly put into his earlier albums.I am a long time fan Percy Sledge and can remember my Mother listening to his music back in the day, 30 some odd years ago.He's an artist that knows what to say when someone is suffering from a broken heart that nothing can heal but the warmth and tenderess of the person they are longing for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely informative work.","review":"I highly recommend this book to all practioners of the Martial Art of Karate. Exploring not only his personal lineage but that of all the original styles of karate founded and developed on Okinawa, Shoshin Nagamine provides a great work and a first hand account of many of the mentioned Masters.It is nice to know that historically correct information is starting to come out about the true origins of karate and of its' founders. It is also nice that a little bit of myth also surrounds those same founders. Shoshin Nagamine does well to dispell those myths.By knowing and understanding truth from the past we grow today and prepare for the future. This reviewer is glad that Patrick McCarthy translated this work for the world to read.Buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"70's Movie Not Bad","review":"Well for a British movie of the 1970's, this one is not bad, this Zombie movie has it all, nudity, gore, suspense, a graveyard, non beliving cops, but the best part of it all is how the zombies come to life, it will make you laugh. Still it has momements of edge of your seat suspense and ripping bloody moments. It even has an introduction by the director of the movie who lets you know this is a movie that should cause you fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid 1970's undead movie.","review":"This is a very interesting zombie flick, the zombies are not flesh eaters instead they are souless bodies that attack the living. This was one of the better uk horror flicks of the 1970's. It's got lots of atmosphere and it takes place in the english countryside. It looks alot better on blu ray than on dvd where it went under several names. But this is the name it was released under. this is not a action horror flick but a flick of two people trying to figure out what is happening near manchester and in it's morgue. Blue underground did there usual fine job on this one and it has some extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"no breast biter scene!","review":"i really think stars/anchor bay screwed up again. the breast biting scene referedto on the reverse of the sleeve card for this 2000 print is not on the dvd.in fact i think they are refering to the horror film burial ground. again shoddyresearch or unannounced editing/censorship because i didn't see any breast biting scene on this dvd and do believe it is in the above mentioned film.cannot trust anchor bay to tell the whole unwaivering truth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy Zombie Movie.","review":"First Of All I would like to say to those who compare this movie to Luci Fulci ,and George Romero. I respect some of your opinions but you cannot compare one movie to this director ,and one to the other because these directors all have there individual talent! This movies is not even inspired by night of the living dead. In My opinion it is more artistic, Creative, and completely diffrent than most zombie movies. I truly recommend this movie It Really creeped me out, The musie was Creepy and the zombies were very strange. Enjoy The Individual Talent Of This Director I Highly Recommend This Movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bad bad! movie","review":"I don't get it. I read the reviews and order the movie if it sounds interesting. This one sounded like a new/old classic (old movie, new to me) and I ordered it eagerly based on the reviews.People, this movie was awful. Even the gore wasn't good. The violence wasn't real. I felt like the entire movie was a prelude showing pre-credits except that it last 1.5 hours. Not good. Don't waste your money or time.Last, to Anchor Bay, quit buying bad horror movies and issuing them in tin boxes. Buy good horror movies and ship them any old way and you'll have me as a customer for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie started off ok but 50 mintutes into it your waiting for something to happen and when you do see the zombies you just dont care anymore it has some good atmosphere but moves at a turtles pace it was just an ok zombie movie buy it with the Fright pack mayb youll like it but I didnt.. To sum this up I dont think its a zombie classic just a boring movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cool film","review":"This film follows in the footsteps of NOLD thats for sure, however, it comes out like \\"children shouldn't play with dead things\\". Its truly a one of a kind zombie film that shouldn't be over looked and different way of making a zombie film and truly one of the best i've seen in awhile. Highly Recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Zombie Film","review":"If you've watched your Romero and Fulci Zombie films to death and you're wanting something just as good, but different, check this little nasty out. A Spanish film inspired by Night of the Living Dead that came out before Dawn of the Dead started the carnivorous Zombie craze. This is one of the few genuinely creepy Zombie films. Night of the Living Dead and Zombie were the only other two that I found creepy. Dawn and Day of the dead were superior films, but I would never say they were creepy. The story is ambiguous in a true European way, and the cinematography is gorgeous and nightmarish at the same time. Also the Zombies are truly chilling. The gore sequences are well done and the acting is top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anchor Bay Rocks with this Exceptional Zombie Shocker!","review":"I had the fortune of seeing it via bootleg video tape years ago and now Anchor Bay has released it in a GORGEOUS, pristine transfer - it sounds and looks just incredible!The film itself is a gem - one of the very best zombie films ever made. Eerie, atmospheric and well-acted. The zombies, though not as plentiful as in a Romero or Fulci film, are cool-they lumber around with a very creepy, distinct freshness about them. The suspense builds well and the attacks become icnreasingly gruesome so if you're a gorehound there should be enough to keep you seated and if you're not... well, you can just cover your eyes for a few hair-raising scenes of gut munching.This is an excellent disc, and along with the Argento releases and Fulci's \\"The Beyond\\", stands as the top horror title of the year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Last 10 minutes are great, but the whole movie is boring...","review":"This movie's only real high point is the last 10 minutes or so. For the most part, it \\"tries\\" to be a \\"real\\" movie by holding off the major zombie scenes until near the end and throwing in an investigation plot (whiich totally blow). While the make-up and gore are pretty good, I would say rent it first before buying it (mind you. I am a hardcore zombie movie fan, so I bought it anyway)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Routine zombie film","review":"This film starts out okay but quickly turns boring as a drug investigation starts unfolding, it is not until half of the movie has already gone by, that the zombies finally appear, the result is a tedious film that is completely predictable with mediocre acting, a silly script and not very much to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Drivel","review":"The only thing that distinguishes this mess of a movie from Ed Wood's amateurish flicks is the sporadically better cinematography... Story line is only marginally interesting with clumsy dialogue, inept pacing, and plot credibility holes you could drive a 13 Spd, 450 Hp, 17 ton Peterbilt flatbed through... with room to spare. Also lots of shameless steals from George Romero: ground camera angles and direction during first cemetery scene, the catatonic heroine almost a carbon copy of the girl in NOLD,.... etc etc etc.What really gets annoying is the incessant electronic music (?) score with quavery oh-so-scary one note 'flying saucer noises' which were already passe by the 1950s. Even Arthur Kennedy embarrassingly chews the scenery; but what else can he do with the high-school level script and dialogue here?This is ultimately the same old boring hack and slice bloody flick without any redeeming features whatsoever. Don't waste your time and money; stick to Romero."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"I LOVE zombie movies, and, I don't really expect a lot from them....really, to be fair, as generally, they go more for the gore, than any real plot/acting/etc..This one, however, was a BIG let-down.It starst out ok, you have the typical government/scientific experiment goes awry and brings back the dead thing going on.The acting, really isn't that bad either.The biggest problem that I had with this one, is that it drags on entirely too long!There is some gore, including a good hospital morgue scene...but, the movie could have been paced faster and over a good 30 minutes sooner.Not the worst I've seen, but, DEFINATELY not the best....save your money, rent this one if you can, instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of both worlds.","review":"Since I once had the \\"Church Of The Poison Mind\\" 45, I guess that means I've been a fan for awhile. This is pretty much what it says it is, half \\"Culture Club\\", and half \\"Boy George\\". And though it's split between the two, it's all great. This really has every \\"Culture Club\\" track that's essential, like \\"Do You Really Want To Hurt Me\\", \\"Karma Chameleon\\", and \\"I'll Tumble 4 Ya\\", among other's. But what shocked me the most is how good \\"Boy George's\\" solo stuff was. Obviously not as 80's as the old songs, but very good. His better songs here are \\"Love Is Love\\", \\"Everything I Own\\", and the excellent \\"Crying Game\\". Another catchy track is \\"Bow Down Mister (a small portion 2B polite mix)\\".

There is nothing wrong or lacking with his playing on this CD. It may not be the balls-to-the-wall performance that reviewer was looking for but Dennis's playing compliments the music. Some songs simply don't require an all out onslaught from Dennis. Anything wrong with that? This may not be a great CD but it's pretty damn good and worth a go.

If I hadn't known who was playing on it I could never have guessed by the playing. I am a huge Jeff Berlin fan and also like Chambers and Lavitz, but this is nothing like I have heard. I have an open mind to new music but this is just not good. The guitarist sounded like he went to study with John McLaughlin and forgot his way to the lessons. Dennis Chambers could very well been replaced by a drum machine. T Lavitz sounded like random noise, and Berlin had a great bass tone, but played with absolutely no feeling. This music CD will be relagated to the back of my collection never to be played again. It should have never been released commercially.

Big mistake. I ususally use a roller pen for graphing since the lines look bolder and dots look more detailed, and graphs look excellent. Not on this paper. First thing is that the roller pen tends to smear on the paper, making numbers and letters very uncomfortable to read, and become very blotty. The letters, especially on letters like e, m, k, and g, become blotted and look like different letters. Numbers are the same. Another thing noticeable is that the paper is not strong, and very weak. Roller pens leak through the paper and end up on the next page.This notebook was very dissappointing, and even more dissappointing is that it was made from Mead, the most popular and best paper company in the United States. Sadly, when it comes to grpahing paper, I will look elsewhere.

Some of the songs sound \\"muddy\\" and you have to concentrate on picking out the melodies or even vocals on a couple of the tracks. (This is a minor complaint, trust me) I highly recommend this CD. 85% of the tracks on this CD are HUGE gems. I do have one question though? The title of the album is directly from a bible verse that implys LOTS and LOTS of judgement, Yet the notes on the album sleeve and some of the lyrics imply \\"judge not\\". Is this a mixed message or what!!I'm not sure the artist understands the overall message he is sending, esp with the album title.Regarless of these elements, in which YES I have been rather picky, this IS an Excellent CD, A must have.

The game, although it has great graphics, is extrememly confusing and hard to follow on what you can and can't do. It is really different from the previous Lords of the Realms and thus makes it hard to play.

Although ther is more interactive options and a much better 3D engine to this game, I have apparently become bored with it quickly, after finishing the tutorial and beginning play, it is already sitting in it's jewel case collecting dust with the rest of my \\"average\\" games. I've found myself playing Realm 2 more than this game.The setup is there, and the competetive spirit is there, but there is little challenge except in combat. I prefer a game more based on Realm 2, where you have to battle not only human-to-human elements but elements more inclined with proper farming, mining, and such. The simplified task of assigning Nights or Peasants as one singular town gives no strategy outside the realm of battle. Strategy should be included in all aspects across the board, not just in combat.Something tells me with this mediocre follow-up, we won't be seeing Lords 4 anytime soon, if at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN AWAY RUN AWAY!!!","review":"Perhaps they should have built a rather large badger.

They took out the castle choices and the cool little videos. Even though the battle graphics were pretty basic in the prior games, it was unquestionably more engaging than the 3-D graphics but dull and incomprehensible battles in this game. In addition to the inability to control individual troops, I have had fighters attacking the air and other clipping issues.This game is simply not fun, and made me want to fire up Lords II to remember what this series used to be about.Get Stronghold or Lords II for a much better game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Newer not always is better","review":"I bought this game one month ago, together with \\"American Conquest Fight Back\\", if I liked the last one as top of the bunch, LOTR III is bottom.I'll try to sell my copy, and desperately look for an used copy of the first version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge dissapointment","review":"I just have to mirror the other recent posters here...I was very excited to get my hands on this game being a fan of the first 2 LOTR titles.

I even went out and got a new graphics card to be able to play it.My expectations were extremely high and LOR III failed me miserably. The battles were extemely buggy and the game play in general was not interesting. Furthermore, the tutorial was poor and UI in general was not very usable.This is a perfect example of ruining a great 2D game by trying to make it a 3D game.

You've also have to be concerned about the fact that its release date was constantly pushed back and that its price fell from $49.99 to $19.99. Finally, why is this game being released so quietly and with so little fanfare. The official webpage is eeriely silent and more omniously a patch was released even before the game shipped.These are troubling questions and lead to the ultimate question: what is wrong with this game? I am going to wait until I read some reviews by non-fanboy reviewers before I consider purchasing. (A fanboy is someone who spends his time on the official webpage, salivating at every nugget of info dropped to him by the developers, and is so blinded in his loyalty to the product that he ignores glaring problems.

Limited army creation, no manipulation of serfs to ensure the best allocations of production. You only need gold, which is constantly stolen, to create castles. To be honest I am finding this title very boring and if I had spent more than the $20.00 I would be very upset. \\"Lords of the Realm\\" should have never been in this title!

What made Lords 2 a great game were many little fun things to do such as choosing which weapons the blacksmith would produce, choosing what to put on which field, coming up with battle strategies and repairing damaged castles. Lords 3 has none of this. I say to Sierra shame on you, and I will think long and hard before buying a Sierra game again. You should save face and refund the fans money.

To make matters worse, you armies are produced automatically so you dont even get to choose your army types. The battles start automatically but you are not even taken to the battlefield automatically so you can ened up missing the battle if you dont go there right away.

Really, Sierra, how can you justify releasing a game in the Lords franchise that mocks everything that was good about its predecessor?I want my money back.

This is one of the worst games ever made. When I bought this game a few years ago, I was so excited seeing that I have played Lords of the Realm II since about 1997 and is such a super great game. When I first installed and ran this game, I could not believe how different of a game this was. I looked nothing like Lords of the realm, and was one of the worst games I have ever played. I played this game for about 3 hours, and then uninstalled it from my computer and threw it into an old storage room. And I have never touched it since.

Up until recently, it was December 2002, then March 2003, then September 2003, and now its been pushed back to November.Lords of the Realm II was released in 1996. Eight years between sequels. Assuming they stick with this newest pushed back release date. At this point, the unexplained, unreasonable 3 or 4 years of pre-announcements at this game's release makes me angry enough to forgoe buying this game at all.

I give it two stars because I like the battle scenes a lot more than in the first game. But that is it. It's true that the land management being gone makes this game a lot more boring. It just feels like the player places their vassals and occasionally fight some battles with armies moving slower than molasses and spends a lot of time just waiting.

Colorful and printed on heavy gloss, it's the perfect size to tuck into a computer bag or backpack.

First, the only place this opens is the lid in the center part. If your pet poops/pees in the outer tubes, there is no way to clean it, except to shake whatever you can out.

My only problem is my hard-drive is becoming full, and I would like to purchase the blu-ray so I don't have to keep them on my hard-drive. For everyone complaining about the half seasons, blame the writer strike. They wanted more time off, thus causing our shows to take a half a year before they come back on.

The characters have to figure out what has changed while at the same time trying to function in their new lives. It's obvious that the producers of the show used this time travel twist to re-envision the characters and breathe fresh life into the show. Instead, they ensured the show's demise. The time travel twist is just plain lazy, and week after week it is increasingly irritating to watch each character have to figure out what has changed from their original past. After the viewers invested three seasons in learning and loving the characters and the town, the show's producers give the fans the middle finger with a stupid time travel twist. The show easily gets 4-5 stars for the first three seasons.

Carter finally gets to kiss Allison, and in the rest of the show it looks like he is lucky & unlucky in love. (A love quadrangle develops?) Henry gets a new love interest, thanks to his alternate-universe self. And we get a new character to hate - Dr Trevor.I don't know whether to be happy or sad that releases are starting to come in half-seasons instead of full seasons. On the one hand, I can rewatch my favorite episodes without waiting as long; on the other hand, each set has fewer episodes. I am very satisfied with Amazon's pre-order policy - I think this was $25 or $30 when I pre-ordered it, but when it finally shipped, the price had dropped to $17.

But happily, season 4 was just the infusion of freshness this series needed. Taking our main characters back in time, then sending them back to the present but in an alternate reality was stroke of genius, allowing the writers to reinvent many of the characters and their relationships, giving us some fresh takes on what was getting oh so stale.

This is another up-chuck for the brainwashed christians, attempting to again absorb a different system that is not based on their biblical mythology.

The book was published in black and white (including illustrations) which limited the identification of Corvette models. For example, the corvette Anniversary model in the 1980's has body colored alloys and a different sort of pillar on the door.The book is very useful if you are wanting to purchase a corvette as it has engine numbers, colours and all details from that date so that you know all the real details of the car.Perhaps the next addition will have colored pictures, considering that most aspects of a car are viewed and it is important to identify the subtle details of a vehicle, especially special features (ie. anniversary cars)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illustrated Corvette Buyer's Guide","review":"Interesting book if you are looking for details - only goes to 1997 Vettes.

Instead, though the vocals are strong and the lyrics are intelligent, Karney sounds a bit like something I'd hear at a bar in a small coastal town during spring break. In fact, I mean that in the nicest way. I'm sure they'd be a hoot to see live, what with the horn section and multiple singers. \\"Love to Watch\\" is a fun, reggae-flavored number that I'm sure would get any crowd moving.

You choose where to start and you compete with the computer to survive. you can keep playing the game until 1. you get tired of it 2. you run out of resources or 3. your computer crashes.

It's fast-paced and simple: gather resources, build an army, conquer your foes. It comes with several excellent campaigns as well. The game spans all history, so it works for whatever type of player you happen to be. It even goes three epochs into the future. There's a large array of units, buildings, etc. The only cons with this game is that it doesn't have the cultural aspect of say Civilization III. This is a military game. That's why, in the event that all players are allied to one another, the game ends.

Because a lot of her tapes were recorded in Extended Play mode, not Standard Play. Also, especially in the segments where she is right on the beach, the camera is apparently not anchored very well, and moves a lot (like the weather cameras on the tops of buildings do), which is annoying.The 10-minute workouts are great--it would be nice if it were issued in a DVD format that allowed you to pick and choose which order you wanted do them in."},{"rating":"2","title":"WIFI Seeker exceeded my expectations","review":"When I first got a wireless network at home I purchased a Kensington WIFI Finder.

For example, the book suggests that letting a 15 month old roam around the living room is too overwhelming for him and instead suggests keeping him in a playpen. I don't know of any 15 year old that would be happy being confined to a playpen.

It did not provide any tips on this - it recommended the usual distraction, take them on a long walk, etc but didn't provide any information you could get from common sense or a quick internet search.In the section where people wrote letters explaining their issues with their children, I felt like the advice was light.

And far worse than that - he is seen here as a sociopath, a failure, a miserable little worm who couldn't lead a horse to water.It is wonderful that publishers are putting books back in print such as this one, or the Denali (Deception, etc.) triple reprint. In addition to this group we now have Washburn's brilliant images that say more in a few photos than Bryce did in 100 pages.A fascinating study of an expedition gone to [junk], by the man who taught everyone else how to \\"tell it like it is\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Humor from England","review":"I remember watching this on PBS with my Mom and it was flat out funny.

It was a plesant surprise to find a show that doesn't portray Catholic priests in a negative light.Fr. Duddleswell is a conservative priest that gets into trouble trying to do the right thing, but in the end always comes out on top..Each episode has a sort of lesson or moral explained in a funny way.Quite enjoyable and a little bit of nostalgia for those who long for the Church in its golden days of the 1950's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bless Us!","review":"Great tales of the church!

Based on the popular autobiographical novels of Peter de Rosa, Bless Me, Father is set in 1950's suburban London and includes a supporting cast of a sharp-tongued housekeeper (Gabrielle Daye) and a Mother Superior who acts similar to a queen (Sheila Keith). The DVD set presents all 21 hilarious episodes, including the final 3 episodes which have never before been released! Special features include bios of Arthur Lowe and Peter de Rosa, cast filmographies. Witty, sardonic, rip-roaring clean fun. 3 DVDs, 525 min, full screen, color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Marvelous!","review":"If you like clean, understated humor, this is for you.

This film is not...good. The director is ambitious and has some interesting ideas however he does not have any budget, actors or a decent script. Some of the character ideas and sets were pretty cool however they are drowned out by the wretched acting and ham-fisted dialog. I'm not sure what the plot was because 10 minutes into the film I didn't care what the plot was, every-time one of the cardboard cutout characters spoke it hurt my brain, I lasted 25 mins then I shut it off.

When a dark-robbed figure kidnaps the soul of a young girl, it is up to the Storytellers to awaken her father from his selfish stupor in order to free her from evil's grasp! INK is a mind-blowing visual masterpiece created on a micro-budget, which offers a unique fantasy world of found objects that rivals the ones found in MIRRORMASK or CITY OF LOST CHILDREN at only a fraction of the cost. Director Jamin Winans transforms the mundane into the imaginative through the use of creative camera work, practical effects, and a unique story structure as he weaves together his modern fairy tale. Winans enhances the emotional impact of the images on screen with his own original score. The combined results produce a touching character drama that will shatter all expectations and strike a deep emotional chord with the audience.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"},{"rating":"2","title":"best independent movie ever","review":"If you like movies that make you think this is the movie for you.

The acting doesn't seem particularly great, and it appears low budget. However, then everything starts to change. It consistently improves to the point that I was hooked by the middle of the movie, and suprised by the important plot twist 2/3 of the way through. This is such a great film, I found myself thinking about it long after it was over, and I've recommended it to everyone I know.

Thirty (30) minutes into this movie, I realized I didn't care what happened next. I wasn't drawn into the story or the characters.

It's nothing but overbearing artsy editing grafted onto a bad fantasy plot that takes itself way too seriously and that has the emotional range of a hallmark card. From the beginning of the movie it's clear that the whole world of \\"dream people\\" is suppose to be read symbolically, so any bit of pleasure or fascination with the admittedly bad fantasy element is sucked out of you. In short, it's an unwatchable mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing Movie of 2009","review":"After seeing all the rave reviews for this movie, I'm utterly shocked as to how so many people could praise such a film. I love almost every indie movie I see. But this movie gets two thumbs down. Bad story, horrible acting, awful directing, and bad editing all make for a terrible production.

Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Utter Waste of Time and Money...","review":"One of the worst science fiction/fantasy movies of recent memory.

I gave him a bit of an overview before he watched it just so he wouldn't be as confused as I was at the beginning. He enjoyed it as much as I did.I was glad to find a movie that is a little more cerebral than the standard scifi/fantasy fare that is offered these days.

This movie is very under-rated. It should have been a 2009 Best Picture nominee at least. The casting and soundtrack were perfect. I had my doubts about it, but the very first three minutes got me hooked. I highly recommend this movie.

All style and little content.There wasn't time to ponder anyone's character since the shot will not be on screen long enough for a total mental process to occur. So we only had a vague idea of character and purpose. It just moved to fast, and we stopped caring about it and lost interest besides becoming increasingly more irritated.There may have been a great, even profound idea in there somewhere, but we were to annoyed to care.My friends ask me, \\"isn't there something else you can put on instead of this\\"?I think that pretty much sums it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This movie made me realize how much amazing art is out there that probably never gets seen.I don't want to go into a long review of what the movie was about... only to say that despite it being a bit trippy, anyone that hates this movie is probably not deep enough to understand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indie film with fun plot twists, interesting effects","review":"Ink is not a slick hollywood production but well worth watching.

The way in which the scenes were cut together makes me think that had the acting been abysmal, the story would have still been(at least a bit) compelling. I really enjoyed the heroism of the Story Tellers. What better hero than a dream-warrior in your own dream world?I was creeped out by the businesslike nature of the Incubi. It's bad enuff they were evil,but were also dedicated to keeping the books balanced, just like John in the corporate world.This opinion is based on watching the movie about 1 hour ago. Surely if I watch it repeatedly,my understanding will evolve some; but it won't effect my enjoyment of this great film one bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique, well-done film that makes you think.","review":"I really enjoyed this movie for many reasons. First, it has a story that makes you think and ask questions about life and reality. I honestly did not notice that it was an independent film. The direction was amazing and the film techniques used are visually stunning. The actors did an impressive job as well. I rarely post reviews but I was horrified to see a couple people writing bad reviews. Anyone who appreciates art films and likes movies that make you think, you will love this film.

But if you are looking for more funny stuff and sexual materials, it is simply missing. It is all wicked, which is fine, but there is very little standout material. The beats are mostly forgettable and I hardly ever laugh. Maybe I am from the rock school more than the rap genre, but this CD lacks guitars (Piggy Pie), speed with aggression (We give no F@cks), humor (Please Don't Hate me)I hope they redeem themselves and cannot wait for live show, but frankly they either ran out of material or need Mike Clark back.

I recommend picking up other ICP CDs before this one, including The Wraith: Shangri=La and the Forgotten Freshness CDs. Which isn't saying much for this CD. You'd be much better off staying away from these Detroit clowns from here on out. That is until they release a greatest hits CD, which doesn't seem far away based on how well their CDs sell now.

I looked at the disc itself and found that the outermost area of the encoded side was marred by a light misty-looking defect. I listened to the previous cuts a few more times, decided that this was a CD well worth having, so I returned my copy to Amazon to exchange for another copy. Much to my dismay, the second copy arrived with the entire coded side of the CD covered with this cloudy defect. This copy would not play at all. Dang!At that point, I mailed it back and asked for a refund. My rating of 4 stars reflects the quality of the music I did hear, wheich was fresh and energetic. However, not having been able to obtain a nondefective copy, I feel constrained to issue a word of caution to prospective buyers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitarist Extraordinaire with some Vietnamese Distinction","review":"Nguyen Le is extremely versatile, from Funk to Rock, Jazz/Fusion to World.

Highly reccommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product issue (Music review to follow) with this CD","review":"Like a few of the other Reviewers, I found that my CD was coated with this cloudy, sticky like substance. The CD would not play or be read by my player or computer.What I did try was wash the cd with warm water and soap, gently rubbing the surface with my fingers until I completely cleaned of the the \\"stuff.\\" Then useda paper towel to absorb all water, not rub or wipe, just let it absorb the water. Then I air dried most of the moisture, finally drying off the CD with a soft cotton cloth.Re-inserted the CD into my computer and it was readable. I was able to import all the songs.I did a quick scroll through the song list after importing the music, checking beginning and ends and they all played.Saved me the hassle of a return...Somebody should contact the artist/artist rep so they can address this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the music, but...","review":"I had the same problems with this cd as Karl Nehring had in his review.

However, the skits are short so if one skit doesn't work for you it isn't long before another one. A lot of them are laugh out loud funny for me which is not easy for me to find. Be aware much of it is adult humor and not suitable for younger children. Skits include depictions of sex, gory deaths, swearing (mostly bleeped out but it is obvious they are saying 'F**K' or whatever). It is definitely the 'Adult Swim' material it is made for but I really enjoyed it. For those who have not seen the show, it is all done with dolls and stop frame animation so even 'explicit' stuff is not that explicit. I just mean the subject matter is often adult in nature. Some of it is 'bust a gut' funny. I wish the episodes were longer and more of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a smart choice...","review":"Let me see if I got this...this package contains seasons 1 and 2 for $54Season 1 individually costs $20.49 (New Ships from and sold by Amazon.com)Season 2 individually costs $17.99 (New Ships from and sold by Amazon.com)-----------------------------------TOTAL --------------------->$38.48You're not getting anything extra for buying this package, except but a higher price if you buy them individually... so what am I'm missing here and where's the advantage of buying this?

It comes from an extreme Calvanistic point of view and although there are many good lessons to be learned from the studied scriptures, they are primarily based from a wrong foundation and on OPINION. If you are one who practices calvanism, then this is the book for you but from a Christian foundational standpoint, it is misleading and false.

The stories include: \\"Camping In,\\" \\"Up Captain Peacock,\\" \\"Wedding Bells,\\" \\"His and Hers,\\" \\"Coffee Break,\\" \\"The Hand of Fate,\\" and \\"The Clock.\\" There is also two sets of full color photos from the episodes. Some of the screen shots are not even from the episodes in this book as a couple of the photos have Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Harman whereas the stories have Mr. Grainger and Mr. Mash.

I, however, would rather pop in the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"A re-run not worth the postage","review":"I'm a big fan of Are you Being Served, the long running British sit com set in a London Department store, so when I saw this title \\"Camping in and Other Fiascos\\" by the show's long time producer, I Thought it would be a behind the scenes peek at a show that in 12 seasons must have had some very interesting tales to tell.The forward, with comments by some of the surviving cast members seemed to support this. Then I got to the meat of the book. Each chapter is in fact a novelization of an episode, but with other, well known vignettes from other episodes worked in.While this might make funny reading if you've never seen the show, long time fans can almost repeat the scripts themselves. Without any bonus materials THIS is in effect, a re-run of well known episodes.I'm a fan of the show. I'd love a chance to tell the cast members how much I've enjoyed their work, but this tome? Not worth the price of postage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bali Women's Lacy Skamp","review":"Very disappointed with the fit, fabric, and overall quality of this panties.

Overall the unit is beautiful and has mounts for mounting on the wall. The remote is handy too. For the price I think it is well worth it!

It focused more on Ron, which was a big downer. It was missing all the \\"just friends\\" stuff between Ron and Kim and also, you didn't see any of Shego slamming Drakken's plans which is one really funny part of the show. Plus, Kim and Ron do not make a good couple. It didn't have as much pure butt kicking action as normal, this moview definetly focused much more on romance. Wade has a much lesser part in here, as does just about everyone. Rufus, Kim, Ron, Drakken and Eric were the only ones with decent sized parts. Shego was downsized to include more Drakken, which was a very bad move, she is the much more interesting character. Oh, and Kim's big weakness?

This in no way tastes like a peanut butter cookie, let alone peanut butter anything. The first ingredients should be peanut something or other but its towards the bottom. I knew that this was not going to be like a peanut butter cookie but I thought at least it would have a peanut butter taste. I guess the best way for me to describe the taste would be like a very sweet yogurt like coating on the bottom of a supper sweet saccahrin sweet rice crispy thing. The one that I really enjoyed was the Nuts Over Chocolate luna bar, that one has a nice peanut taste and delicious chocolate bottom to boot. So dont go in thinking that you are going to get any peanut butter taste at all, but if you like a mystery flavor thats really sweet then go for it.

They come in a variety of flavors. Plus, at 180 calories each, they shave a few calories off of the other bars of this type without sacrificing flavor or size.The texture tends to be granola/krispie crunch with a flavored thin layer of frosting. If you like a more creamy filling, these bars probably aren't for you. If you enjoy crunch and substance though, they're a great alternative to other meal replacement bars.My favorites are S'Mores and Lemon Zest flavors. I do like that Luna puts out some flavors besides pure chocolate bar or chocolate peanut butter. I've replaced my previous morning SlimFast Optima bar with a Luna bar, and the variety of delicious flavors keeps me much more satisfied than the SF bars did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healthy snack","review":"The Toasted Nuts & Cranberry Luna bars is a wonderful & healthy snack.

They taste absolutely NOTHING like the name or description says. The are hard and dry and have the consistency of chewing on chopped up twigs and sticks. The chocolate coating tastes nothing like chocolate and I have no clue how they chose the name Pecan Pie because it doesn't even remotely taste like a pecan pie...they even leave a bad taste in your mouth. They are sort of bitter and have no sweetness to them at all. Unfortunately I ordered an entire box of these. If they were a little bit darker I could use them for replacement roof shingles.

After taking the first bite I knew I didn't like the artificial taste, but I took another bite because I didn't want to waste the money I paid for it. After the second bite I just could not make myself eat anymore of it so I threw it away.

I expected just that.. the taste of rich chocolate, with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base. What I received was a bar with little taste, nothing at all similar to the name on the bar.In my opinion, the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it... the flavor is barely there. The bar is dry. It is never again be on my \\"purchase\\" list"},{"rating":"1","title":"YYYUUUCCCKKKK!!!","review":"This bar is so sweet you won't want sugar for a month if you eat one.

I am not a health nut but apparently these bars are made just for us women and they taste delicious. I can eat one for breakfast and it holds me over until lunch.

All of the flavors are pretty decent but Nuts Over Chocolate is definitely one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great snack","review":"These were a great snack and I did feel as if I had a bit more energy after eating them but I don't know if that was just because they have quite a bit of sugar in them, the caffeine from the chocolate or a combination of both.

This is so far the best Luna Bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious Belly-Filler","review":"Knowing that it might be difficult at times to get something to eat while in transit, I bought a box of these to take to Italy with me in April. The bars are very tasty and satisfied my appetite very well until I could get to a place to eat. Waiting for trains and planes....next time I travel overseas I plan to again take along another box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hexane","review":"Okay so I was loving Luna bars and eating them almost daily until I came across an article about the process of extracting soy protein isolate. Apparently, in this process a chemical called hexane is used which is a known neurotoxin. Unless the ingredients specifically state that it is organic then the soy protein isolate is most likely extracted using this chemical. I was eating these bars because I thought they were a great nutrition bar, but no longer. There is a list online entitled \\"Guide to hexane-extracted soy in nutrition bars\\" by the Cornucopia institute which rates these types of bars. Luna Bars are rated with a skull and crossbones. Lovely. I have written an inquiry to the company in order verify this information but they will not contact me back. I advise any eating Luna bars to consider this information and do some research. I personally do not want any extra chemicals in my body!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Luna Nutz Over Chocolate Bars","review":"The flavor of these nutrition bars is very good. My only complaint is that you must have milk, water or something else to drink as you are eating them. They have a grainy texture that can stick in your throat if there is nothing to drink with them.Otherwise, they are great. Very nutritious and satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemon Zest...Nasty","review":"The Lemon Zest ones are just plain nasty. I love lemon and lemon flavored treats but I do not suggest these. I only ate one and wish I could send them back, I'm going to give these away if someone will have them. Yuck! Now,the Chai Tea ones taste better but I would only eat in case of an emergency (car break down, nothing to eat). I should have stuck with the Chocolate Pecan ones of real food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of stock","review":"Wondering why these are still listed as 'in stock', when they are NOT in stock and, in fact, no longer being made by Clif/Luna??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like Innertube...","review":"Upon opening this bar inside our car, I thought our spare tire sprung a leak! Sadly, the smell was coming from from the newly opened Luna bar, this one optimistically called 'Peanut Butter Cookie'.The kids would not go near it, but I figured I'd give it a try, yet could not avoid the overwhelming smell of Car Tire. The (ahem) flavor did not resemble any Peanut Butter or Cookie that I've ever eaten before, at least not on purpose :-)Buy a single one before you buy the box. Amazingly, some people say they like these..."},{"rating":"1","title":"burnt flavor","review":"While I really liked the white chocolate macadamia nut flavor, the nuts over chocolate tasted nasty, with a burnt peanut taste.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and good for you","review":"These tasty bars have 100% of your RDA of 10 vitamins and minerals and at least 25% of 11 other vitamins and minerals. They are filling so make a great \\"breakfast bar\\" if you are in a hurry. They make a great snack for an adult or child who doesn't eat properly and/or forgets to take a daily vitamin.I have tried most of the flavors and have enjoyed them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you going!!","review":"The chai tea bars are my favorite. The coating on the top is a mix of creamy topping with cinnamon and ginger, but not overpowering. I used to be starving a couple hours after breakfast, hours before lunch....one of these at 10 o'clock sees me through even past my normal lunch time.It's packed with calcium and other goodness women (and men) need. If you're expecting some gooey mess you'll be disappointed, but if you're looking for some tasty nutrition, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Macaroon Substitute","review":"I do the order for a small grocery store. When I saw this flavor in the order guide, I ordered it without hesitation. Luna Bars always sell well, even though I personally am weary of Luna Bars with chocolate in them; the chocolate usually tastes funky, waxy. Once it arrived, I tried one. Soooo good! It's hard to believe that this treat offers health benefits, it's THAT good. It tastes like a macaroon. Heaven. It is now the top selling flavor at the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luna Bars are amazing!","review":"Chocolate Raspberry Luna Bars are so good, it's hard to believe they're good for you!

Yum! Who could want a candy bar with a health bar tasting like that! Not so with all flavors. Berry Almond tastes like grape jam mixed with half-cooked oatmeal. That is the texture and color of what it would look like as well. My hubby loves it but I can't stand the flavor, I literally gag. It's obviously a preference thing but I had to leave the box of bars sitting out where they'd be eaten up instead of keeping them in my \\"health-food stash\\" I use before I go running. Yuck. I do recommend Luna Bars, however, just buy one before buying an entire box so you can find your favorite flavor. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced","review":"This is a delicious bar. I literally eat one a day. But if they are priced above $15 that is crazy. A single bar is about a dollar. So you are not really saving anything by buying a whole box. And $15.09 per box.... I get a box $14.99 at the commissary. Not much of a difference but hey! It's a few extra cents in your pocket!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Infested with maggots!","review":"I just opened up a S'Mores bar and found that it was infested with maggots! A Google search reveals that others have had this problem as well. I would assume that this is a rare occurrence, since I found only two other people who have encountered the same problem, but that's still too many for me. Needless to say, I've cancelled my subscription to all Luna Bar products and won't buy them ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Luna Lemon Zest is my favorite! All the bars that they make taste wonderful! They fill you up, give you great energy and leaves no bad after-taste. These are a great and healthy alternative to \\"snacking\\" on junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"You wouldn't know it's good for you!","review":"I admit I have somewhat of a sweet tooth, but since I am lactose intolerant there aren't many candy bars I can eat. I am also into healthy food so the Luna Bars are a good compromise. Don't let the fact you're a guy stop you- these are marketed towards women (because of the soy craze), there's nothing here that can harm you.The Dulce flavor is among my favorite flavor (along with Nutz/Pecan and Dreams), having a sort of caramel/\\"rice crispy treat\\" taste. Only problem is that I like this flavor so much I tend to eat too many, and they have alot of calories. So don't eat too many unless you are a very active person.The Clif line are a great help to those of us with health issues, and I commend them for their wonderful products."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite","review":"I really like these because I feel I'm having a candy bar that's full of vitamins,and fiber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good nutrition, solid price, convenient delivery","review":"Check out the nutrition label -- 'nuf said. Plus, if you buy two boxes, they're shipped right to your door -- for FREE. I can't beat the price, even at Wal-Mart -- and I don't even have to spend the gas or the time to go get them. If you like Luna bars, Amazon is the way to get them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great pick up!","review":"The Chai Tea Luna bars are great for a quick breakfast or a healthy snack.

I am sure that other areas experience this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do It Your Way","review":"Not quite the same as the original album. I bought it for \\"Dreaming A Dream\\". However on this cd they mixed it with another song. Why not leave the original alone and then add the mixed version too ? Rest of cd just average stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Look at Belgians","review":"I am very pleased with the depth of the coverage. This book offers a wealth of knowledge for beginners but has enough details for those who have been in the breed for awhile. I was slightly disappointed that almost all of the photos depicted the author's line. Although rightfully proud of her lineage, other breeders offer different but also correct structure and types of the breeds and should be offered for comparison. Also, at times, the author uses terms without adequate definition (like \\"European\\" type).Overall, this is a wonderful book that will be kept for ready reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs editing","review":"Rodengen's facts are accurate and interesting, but I find the style of connected magazine articles to give too much redundancy. Background that was necessary for each magazine article is included over and over again in this book. The same point could be delivered with a book 60% to 70% the size. A lot of interesting information especially if you know little or nothing on this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"soul, funky, bluesy, jazz sax with pumping large band","review":"I really like Eddie Harris, particularly his use of what he calls vari-tone sax, which is sax with a harmonizer--he picks an interval, be it low octave,third or whatever, and adds a touch. It's wild. Some of his discs are a bit dated but the selection on this disc is funky and fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Very nice pendant not too big or heavy.

GOOD MEMORIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Justice indeed","review":"I enjoy action and crisp, clear writing. I liked the way the main character evolved from the unknowing child like boy in chapter one, to become a socially adapt and capable young man in the final chapter. I wish I could go out and buy a convertable, after reading about the corvette the main character bought I felt like I was riding around with the wind blowing through my hair. My son is a freshman at Duke University in North Carolina and I sent a copy to him. Jason sent me an email telling me he was inspired by the book. As a father, I could ask for nothing finer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blooded Prince","review":"I bought this book when I bought the 6th Harry Potter book..of course, I read the HP book 1st...but I was happier with Justice for All with its ending than I was for the 6th HP book. I liked them both and JKR is a better more cleverer writer but Justice was better ended. I dont think its in a series, but its a really good book if you need to be soothed after Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Plotting","review":"I like books with strong plots. When I read a book I expect to feel as if I am there and as if it could really happen as it happens in the book (no matter what 'it' is)This book is consistant throughout and completely believeable. I hate reading a book where some guy knows theres a killer loose who once lived in his house, then the power goes out and he hears a noise so he goes to the attic..oh please!This book has all the people in it acting like real people would act so I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Justice finds its way into Canadian Hearts","review":"First of all, let me say cheers to the USA for the incredible amount of aid given to disaster relief for the tsunami survivors.This book chronicles the life of Gary Barton, a college senior straped with a new roommate named Rocky Tompson. Gary under goes a triffle of pressures and twists via the mind control and mental subjections of Rocky whom attempts to distort Garys views on everything in his world. Gary mets up with luck and love and snowballs into danger and trouble head long and fast. By the grace of God he is pulled from the brink of distruction in the nick of time. What happens next I will say, but as a Canadian I really enjoyed the write sculpting of an inspiring American author. Several of my friends and I discussed the book with a warm drink and all agree; this book is a real treasure in literature greats. I believe everyone will enjoy this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Forgettable","review":"Driving from the tip of South America (Tierra del Fuego) to the top of North America (Prudhoe Bay, Alaska) in a race to make the Guinness Book of World records--sounds like an exciting road trip and enjoyable read, right? Not so much, as it turns out. The first 125 pgs of the book detail the drivers getting all the documentation in order and laying the groundwork for their trip and frankly are pretty boring. Once they actually begin the trip things get a bit more interesting, though only barely. I found myself constantly losing interest and trying to clearly figure out how far into the journey the author is at any given time, as strangely there are no maps included with the book. Overall, I'm glad I only paid a few bucks for this book, as I'm sure the only thing I'll remember about it after a while is how annoyed I was that a topic that could have been truly interesting was turned into a ho-hum travelogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be surprised if it starts something.","review":"I've always loved Tim Cahill, but I REALLY loved this book. I'm planning an epic road trip myself, and for a while was wondering what gave me the idea to do this -- then realized it was from reading about the moment Cahill's mind snapped and he and his partner \\"went roto\\" in Peru. Don't be surprised if you too also want to go \\"full-tilt roto\\" and hit the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Road Fever - Tim Cahill","review":"This is one of the most hilarious books I've ever read. I read it three times in Dutch (my mothertongue)over the last 5 years and now I'm almost done reading it in English, and it cracks me up every time again. Having travelled through South-America and the fact that I've lived in Latin America now for 5 years, helps to understand the typical anecdotes Cahill discribes. Everybody who's been in Latin America and loves travel, MUST read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear and Loathing In Latin America","review":"What Hunter S. Thompson did for Las Vegas, Tim Cahill hasdone for South and Central America...bring it into view froma perspective that's wonderfully warped and painfully clear.The main difference is that Thompson was fueled by booze andother non-glandular chemicals; Cahill runs on pure adrenaline(and spoiled chocolate milk).Cahill is a very funny guy indeed, and this book chronicleshis adventures in his quest to wrangle a camper-shelled 4x4 from Tierra delFuego to the Arctic Ocean in record time. This book willmake you want to stop your car on the nearest US interstate,get out, and kiss the pavement in gratitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Expect Too Much","review":"I am a big fan of non-fiction adventure stories, and bought this book based on the advice from this board. The book is basically a yawner. SPOILER COMING: Nothing happens. I kept waiting for either the adventure or the humor. Needless to say, I played the part of the jilted reader. If you read this book, your response will be: \\"what's the big deal, I could have done that.\\" I think Tim's motivation for this book was solely cash (nothing wrong with that - just warn me first).

I bought an earlier iteration of this watch in Japan in 1969 and wore it for 30 years. After that, no other watch I tried seemed right, so I bought this one. My best bet is that 30 years from now, Seiko will still be making a watch that looks just like this one -- it has that kind of timeless appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this along with her other two stretch videos as a four pack set for 29.99. I feel I overpaid at that price, let alone buying separate videos.

Of all the books on the subject, this was by far the worst. The \\"sources\\" of information (if you can even call the people sources) are questionable at best. He invents information and passed it on as fact. He will take 1 out of 25 studies -- the negative one and cite that as proof of his point, while ignoring the other 24 favorable or neutral ones.I disagree with the 1/2 of the reviewers in this topic, though some bring up good points.

I'm desperately waiting for its release in Hong Kong, although I have not played Homeworld 1. The graphics look great on the magazines, and the RTS Style fully 3 dimensional should be spectacular. Space is the setting of the game, and should catch your attention very well. If you are going to get only one game this coming month, get Home World 2. I promise that it is going to be a fun filled September for you. On the other hand, Sierra always churns out nice games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homeworld returns","review":"In 1977 Star Wars set the pace for science fiction films up to the present day. In 1999 Homeworld had a similar effect, carving a niche for itself and creating a dedicated following of fans. Still after 3 years, epic space battles are played by people of all ages, both new to the game and veterans.When I first sat down to play Homeworld in 1999 I was totally blown away, so much so I have not bought a new game since. The multiplayer element of the game means that there are almost limitless possibilites, I still get an adrenaline rush each time I play the game on line. This is why for me Homeworld 2 is so eagerly awaited. At 34 I am like that small boy waiting to see Star Wars again.Without doubt, this game is what computers were designed for."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE GAME!","review":"Awesome game.

Overall great game and it will work on windows 7 that is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good RTS, not for the ADHD gamers among you.","review":"First of all, this is an older game, so it should run pretty well on most laptops out there. This may not mean anything to you guys out there with your fancy-smancy desktop rigs (with discreet graphics!), but for those of you who are grad students with crappy workstations in basement laboratories or cheap HP laptops, this means hours of fun while you're supposed to be making science happen. This isn't a fast-paced RTS, by any means, the single-player campaign develops very slowly and seems to take hours upon hours. It's also very difficult, not at all recommended for those who are new to the RTS genre. For being an old game, it still looks fantastic IMHO, and there are plenty of third-party mods available. I recommend it for LAN games with your non-FPS inclined friends and for decent gaming when you're living off student loans and would rather spend money on a ticket home than a new computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Strategy Game","review":"I had lost my old copy of this title and was delighted to find that Amazon had it in Stock through this dealer. If you enjoy games where you're able to command whole fleets and engage in large scale space battles then please don't pass this one by. There are a couple of sticky missions that require split second decisions but once you're done with those the game is a blast. I realize that its an older game but don't let that fool you or stop you because it's far better than many of the strategy games they are producing nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs up !","review":"I really like this game. The price was great. I do wish i had did a little more research i might have sprung for the Sins of a Solar Empire which is made by the same people but even more game play.

With its new graphics and sounds and remade story, this game far bye stands out as one of a kind. All that are familiar with its predicesors will easily get back into the game play as not many features have changed. Ships and races seemed balanced enough as you go through the game trying to save your race once again. Overall, homeoworld two is just as good if not better then the previous 2, so as it stands its a great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically a game box rail game","review":"I'm a big fan of both HW1 and Cataclysm. Both are enjoyable, paced well, and actually beatable.With that said, after reading many reviews here I decided to download the demo and see how bad the latest release is.Well, if you like stunning graphics and atmosphere, then it's incredible. If you want enjoyable game play and strategy, forget it.See HW2 fell off the wagon when they decided to treat it like a \\"port to PC\\" game. It's more like a game box rail shooter, auto-save, rampant attacks, little time to explore, gain knowledge, build. It's just point and click, shoot to kill. It got so bad I expected to get secret codes to get to the next level like a Nintendo game boy title.Sorry Relic, you should have tweaked the engine and AI and improved the graphics and stopped there. If it ain't broke don't fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work on my system","review":"I have Homeworld I, and it rocks. I had hoped Homeworld II would have been cool. WRONG!

If you get this, you better be sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homeworld2 Demo does not live up to the past!","review":"After playing the demo I notice that Homeworld2 Sucks in comparison to Cataclysm or the original Homeworld. They changed the controls for the worst. The AI sucks it seems they removed what made the original so unique in the fact that Tactics were very important. This game has become a C&C; Copy. To win all you do is build up a massive fleet and in one big group you crush the other player the question is who builds and collects money the fastest. So unless Relic fixes the AI issue I would wait on this title till you see some real reviews. I could not believe how much they ruined the game! I was just Amazed at the incompetents of Relic or who ever actually created the game.They should have done more testing with actual gamers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I was looking forward to this game, then I read the system requirements.This game requires you to have or buy a specific video card, I just upgraded to a 64 meg evil kyro and it won't even play the demo.

Most people don't have the money or the knowhow to buy and install new hardware for the software they want to use. If these games keep tryint to push people to upgrade their computer then they are going to loose customers, like me. Until they put out a patch that allows this game to be played on the majority of the v-cards out there I will not be buying this game as it is worthless on my computer.

Very bad perspective. All the ships and everything are really small. Also, if you notice most ships just do their own thing, there is no real feeling of control of the game at all - it's like point ship at other ship, watch battle. Zzz .. boring. If you want a game where you can control your ship and how everything that occurs, I recommend Starscape (do a google search). The space genre just isn't fitting for an RTS - especially with a game like Homeworld 2 where everything looks like the size of an ant and is barely controllable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not \\"too difficult\\"","review":"I own both Homeworld 1 and Cataclysm and finished them both. With the same basic strategy employed to win those games, I finished HW2 in about 3 days.

I did try getting on the Forums for Homeworld 2 - I hate Forums - but the writers of the \\"walk through'\\" were people who have been playing earlier versions and their explanations assumed you knew all about the basics. Waste of time after a waste of money. I remember when game developers documented their games. Like Civilization 4, which had a Civipedia section that documented the workings of the game. If you want to play strategy games, which are by their nature complex, do not buy this title. There is no documentation. It is just half a game."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just tried the Homeworld 2 demo","review":"It looks and plays just like Homeworld only the atmosphere seems to be missing. The music is weak. The new captain is cold and boring. I don't see anything innovative. You can't go inside the ships. It doesn't meet the standards the original Homeworld set.

What have they been doing the last four years?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopefull","review":"Homeworld was \\"Amazing\\". Cataclysm was \\"Good\\". This trend better not continue or I would have to give Sierra the \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" award. I really loved Homeworld and what was done with that game....If you dont understand what Im saying here then I hope to God you dont work for Sierras dev. team. Your probably \\"management\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the series. Too Difficult.","review":"The first 2 Homeworld games are my favorite all time games. This was unplayable for me. Even on the Easy setting I could barely get past the first couple of missions. The other games were much more relaxing and enjoyable. I found this game a complete frustration because of its difficulty. There are many other features I did not like such as the way one is just taken from 1 mission to the next without the chance to regroup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too difficult to enjoy","review":"A game is supposed to be fun but this one is an absolute torture. Like everyone said that this game is such a frustration you will get more enjoyment from reading a phone book instead. Try an older sleeper game - Conquest: Frontier Wars. The graphics is just as good and a much more superior game."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Space, no one can hear you scream...","review":"I can't wait for this game to arrive, the first HomeWorld was incredible, truly a classic, with gameplay to match it's awesome graphics.I hear this version will include a skirmish mode for limitless replay value, plus improved graphics & interface, mmm...If you're into science fiction & like strategy games you should give this game a go, and if your not sure I believe Sierra's website has a demo available for download."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lameworld 2","review":"This game had so much potential but they blew it. Their idea of a smart A.I. is giving it overwelming force based on how much force you have at each senario start. Finish well they are huge, finish poorly they are smaller but still proportionally huge against you. This takes away any incentive to build your fleet which is usually one of the goals of a game.It means you are always about to die, your own skill does not gain you anything. It is sad that they could not afford a programer that could write a good A.I. It truely is Lameworld."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homeworld 2","review":"I loved this game and hope there is a Homeworld 3 or something verysimilar with more ships and a new storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret requirements prevent game from running","review":"My son bought this game because he enjoyed the previous Homeworld. Thanks to undisclosed -- or at least poorly documented -- system requirements we cannot run the game on our machine. Sending it back would cost more in shipping costs than it is worth, so he is stuck with the game hoping that our next computer meets the secret requirements. Vivendi support is not helpful. After this experience we won't be buying any more games for PCs. Only games for consoles and Macs, which have standardized hardware platforms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homeworld 2","review":"Very good game at a very good price. Despite its age, Homeworld 2 still holds up graphically. While complex, the tutorial missions do a good job of keeping the learning curve reasonable. You should be able to understand most of the game's features in only a few hours, which is quite good given the complexity of the game. There also are not many recent space strategy games as detailed as Homeworld 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game and it's successor","review":"This is a great game, especially since it was released 5 years ago. It still holds it's own as one of the best space games ever. (By the way, I noticed a few reviews mentioning technical difficulties. Be sure to download the game software update from the Homeworld 2 website on the support page.) If you want a game centered around space based combat and commanding fleets of ships without a bunch of cartoonish junk, this is your game.For those who already have this, or have been searching for a newer, more advanced and complex game of this type, check out EVE-Online. That game is so elaborate you could literally step into another life in a vast universe with everything from different professions, economies, wars, corporations, politics, commerce, governments, and a vast universe of over 5,000 systems, each with planets, space stations, and more to visit. It's the ultimate evolution of sci-fi space games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome","review":"I bought this game for the sole purpose of using the mod, pds(point defense systems), and it totally rocks! talk about eye-candy, watching tracer fire being shot out of every side of a ship. a must buy if you like watching spectacular fighting between capital ships and dogfighters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for church leaders and leadership training","review":"Church leaders need to be united in their view of the church's purpose and the principles and processes ordained by God. Gene Mims does a great job of explaining these principles and processes in a very readeable book. I encourage pastors, SS directors and others to read and encourage others to read and discuss the implications of God's principles for thier church body.

In surrealism, logic isn't always of importance. In fact, the weird, wacky, and impossible images/symbols/elements do a better job of explaining reality than...well, reality.An amazing flick.If you like David Lynch, check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about Dogma 95","review":"I believe I understood everything about the plot...I just don't think it's any good. Drama and psychology is hardly existant, but this is not a realistic movie;you could call it a post-modern pseudo-sf fairy tale melodrama...But I say - it's simple nonsense. Starting from flying Sean Penn as the symbol of alienation (or whatever), with East European clones, decrepit hit-man (Mr. Morrison), global freezing, flying Ugandans, suspicious and sneaky character of the heroin's brother Michael...You name it. It's all there and it's all equally unconvincing and uninteresting...I'm not saying that the director had to stick to his \\"Dogma 95\\" roots, I'm just saying this is a bad film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Totally confused & stupid script with mediocre acting. Overall a bad movie; but I've seen worse, so I gave it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of life","review":"I kept hoping it would get to the point. any point.waste of time. wasted evening. totally stupid movie.I love Joaquin Phoenix, and Claire Danes, that's why I got this DVD. sad sad sad disappointment. even the sexy Sean Penn was stupid to sign up for this one.watch something better - like the Fireplace Video.ss"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all about Joaquin","review":"Lousy story, lousy acting, lousy waste of time, but great Joaquin Phoenix eye candy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Oh Why Can't We Give Zero Stars??","review":"Reviewers have been puzzling about why these fine actors agreed to do this film. I'm sure I've figured it out.[spoiler ahead]It seems clear that they must have been in some way cloned, and that the evil studio executives used their clones to act the parts.On that note...one bit of hilarity re: the clones has to be small barcode thing on their arms. They are a miracle of modern science intended to dupe the world, yet there was no way to create them without plastering their arm with a relatively large metallic ID -- very nice.Uggh. What a horrible film. The worst I've seen with a great cast since foolishly renting The Bridge of San Luis Rey. Never, ever rent this film.StevenChicago"},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative 5","review":"What??? Could this be any more boring and/ or confusing? If this movie had a plot, it got lost somewhere between the multiple senseless subplots. What a waste of time! Not an ounce of suspense. BO-RING! Avoid at all costs--the most stupid commercial would be a treat in comparison. NEGATIVE five!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have NEVER laughed SOOO hard in my life!!!!","review":"OK, WOW, I JUST saw Walk The Line (i know I'm late), so I decided, I want to check out somemore Joaquin movies.I have a few now and so far their all pretty good including Quills, though it scared me a bit. LOLbut I have too say I wasn't expecting too laugh soo hard that I couldn't see from tears ROLLING out of my eyes.almost every review was like \\"I don't get..., this is the most bizarre thing I've ever...What the heck was going on... I had too watch it twice....Doesn't make any sense AT ALL....\\"Sorry, but this was JUST TOO funny, anyway I haven't seen it yet, BUT I'm going too take the guys word for it who says.\\"Most people have a short attention span\\" and check it out, I mean it's only selling for some change.I know this isn't really a review FOR the movie, but, I have too say thanks You all for the laugh.I'll check back in once I've watched the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"only one good thing about this movie,..","review":"In the end they show all the people that were floating, due to the strange selective loss of gravity, tied to the earth with ropes.Besides the hilarious floaters this movie makes all my most hated David Lynch films look top notch. I honestly think Danes, Phoenix and Penn were blackmailed into this film. Penn really had a pointless cameo. The movie was boring and bizarre in itself but Penn's presence has me puzzled above all. Either it's all blackmail or drugs or serious debt.I too wish I had read these reviews before renting. We really should be able to pick zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative 5 Stars","review":"This movie moves much too slowly. I could only last 40 minutes into the movie with absolutley nothing going on, no plot development whatsoever and really long shots that serve no purpose and should have been edited out. The scenes are much too ambiguous to make any sense out of them and feel too staged. You would think that if someone was running away from danger, one would tell the other person exactly what one was running away from, and not spend an afternoon in a hotel doing absolutley nothing. The Polish accents and forced speech patterns added to the annoyance factor. It's like \\"Polish Wedding\\" set in the future.Don't waste time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO STAR","review":"THIS MOVIE DOES NOT DESERVE ANY STAR, I WISH WE HAD A LAW THAT IF VIDEO STORES RENT A POINTLESS, STUPID AND NONSENSE MOVIE, CUSTOMERS COULD FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE STORE. I COULD BE A MILLIONER BY TOMMOROW IN THIS CASE MAYBEE BILLIONER. DEFINITLY JOKING ABOUT LAWSUIT BUT TO BE A POINTLESS ,NONSENSE AND STUPID I NEVER BEEN THIS SERIOUS ABOUT ANY MOVIE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, entertaining and thought provoking...","review":"What can I say? Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor. His ability to take any script (no matter, how bad) and create a memorable performance exceeds the abilities of most actors in his age range and beyond. I imagine some of the negative criticism of this film is based on the fact that the viewer has got to be engaged while watching this film. It's All About Love, is not a movie that you can watch while cleaning the house or building a model airplane. You have to 'watch' the movie or you will be lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all about smoking","review":"Incredible (as in unbelievable) that three such extraordinarily talented stars should find themselves trapped in a movie that is just one cigarette after another throughout the whole film. What little plot there is, is almost totally obscured by clouds of smoke and what little escapes the smoke has glaring inconsistencies that make the whole incomprehensible. It's also about global cooling - enough cooling to destroy humanity. I find myself wondering if big tobacco and the oil moguls funded this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"I wish I read these reviews before I rented this terrible movie. I kept watching thinking that about 40 minutes into the flick that it was starting to get better, but they just fooled me to keep me watching the rest of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the--?!!","review":"I don't get itttt!!!!!I liked the idea of a man falling in love again with the wife he was planning to divorce. I didn't mind a little intrigue in the plot, but this movie couldn't decide if it was a ballet or a thriller. It was poor at both.Why bother with Sean Penn's narration from an airplane? What was with all the people dying in the streets and no one taking notice? And worst of all, what was the point of the flying Ugandans?I think the screenwriter, in his vainest atttempt to be original, swung the pendulum so far to the other end it completely broke off. Back to basics, people. Back to basics.Forget thumbs down. Roger Ebert would probably sue the director for making this crud. Please don't waste your time on this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and real","review":"A disturbing film featuring some lost souls in Bucharest, a wealthy woman and a crippled orphan at the mercy of the streets. Truly a great film that features a surprisingly upbeat ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why pay for this .... ?","review":"Apparently nobody is buying this c---p and this is how it should be. Worthless fiction about a place that doesn't exist, even if the director I'm sure may feel it is documenting something. It's only a document about his sick mind. Only in Canada we are lucky enough to be shown such total aberation, even if nobody is interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"no title","review":"it's ok but sometime i can't turn on. wire isn't good sometime it has no sound but if i touch my wire it has sound"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and Moving Story","review":"Others have summed up the good points of this story very well. Sylvan is a strong, independant woman despite those other who say she is weak, I saw no weakness in her character and while the hero does say some horrible things to her, it is understandable. The glimpses of her life as a nurse are disturbing, but make this a more unique and moving story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst historical romance ever","review":"I'm pretty sure one of the central requirements for a romance novel is a male hero that is LOVEABLE.Rand is a petulant, immature little brat. All sympathy is lost for him after his first violent tantrum is described. A grown man that screams and breaks windows just for attention from his loving family is not hot. Not at all.Sylvan is a strange, contrary character. She believes herself to be a bad nurse because of all the men who died under her care during the war and yet is sure of her ability to help Rand. Why? Her bad dreams and seeing ghosts only adds to the eerie, depressing atmosphere to this book. I could hardly finish it. The mystery is so painfully obvious there is no point in it being part of the plot.I love historical romances but having read this I won't try another Christina Dodd.Very dissappointing. If your after a really good historical romance, read Lisa Kleypas. Devil in Winter is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Thanksgiving Story","review":"Great Book for teachers or parents to read to children to reinforce the true meaning of Thanksgiving! Worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is illegal immigration justified?","review":"Eve Bunting seems to hold the opinion that breaking the laws of this country can be justified. I would not read this book to my third graders. In the case of illegal immigration, the end does not justify the means. In her book, Ms. Bunting portrays a family fleeing a Cuba-like country for a Florida-like destination. After enduring a harrowing journey in a rickity, leaky boat, the family arrives in America and is greeted by their fellow countrymen in time to celebrate Thanksgiving. Sorry, but this book does not warm my heart. The problems and responsibilities thrust upon the United States by uncontrolled immigration is too serious an issue to gloss over."},{"rating":"2","title":"why isn't this available?!!!!","review":"I first heard him opening for Jethro Tull on the \\"A\\" tour, and then heard him, as most fans did, through the Max Webster collaboration with Rush on \\"Battlescar\\". A couple of years later I heard \\"Go for Soda\\" on the radio. Bought the thing on tape and immediately loved it. The songs run from the out and out rockers (\\"Go for Soda\\", \\"Lager and Ale\\" (he seems to have a thing for beverages), and \\"Rumour Has It\\") to the sweet power ballads (All We Are), and everywhere in between. Now I'm looking for it on CD and can't find the damned thing.His band smokes on this, the drummer in particular. Kim's guit playing is as good, if not better than most, but not overbearing, like some. The lyrics are wry, funny, and somewhat articulate.This is a fun disc for anyone who likes (Diamond Dave)Van Halen, Primus, Rush, Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, or anyone who just wants to play it LOUD and have some fun.PLEASE RELEASE THIS ON A DOMESTIC CD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Ambience From Two Masters","review":"Anyone looking for a definition of \\"musical synergy,\\" look no further than this first collaboration between Mathias Grassow & Alio Die (Stefano Musso.) These two masters of gentle ambience, abetted by Mathias' frequent musical partner Klaus Wiese, have created a sonic collage that contains wonderful melodies and luscious ear candy. Even the artwork is first rate. This is a double CD, so there is much to enjoy. Perfect accompaniment for a moonlit drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to put together and good value","review":"Very easy to put together. I only give it four stars because the wheels move around laterally on their axles. They need extra washers or collars to prevent this.I bolted a piece of plywood to mine that was pre-cut to 2' x 4' from Home Depot but Northern Tool has a version with a plywood platform already fixed to it with a protective edge strip. I would recommend just paying the extra $ and save yourself the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic waste","review":"The fumes from the tires was/is so bad and I had to store this outside.

There were hundreds of in-depth descriptions of \\"trances\\", but nothing the average person doesn't already understand. Further, though the book proposes the \\"trance zero\\" state, it's only hypothetical, offering no means to obtain or experiment with this state of consciousness.I admit the author's complete lack of moral character did not help this book any- as when he rather casually describes a woman being victimized by another psychologist over a period of YEARS while she is seeing the author professionally for help. By his own words, he never helped her at all or stoppped this monster from destroying a woman's life. So much for the effectiveness of his methods.I learned nothing of practical value. Period. If you must read it, try the library first."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sufi CD","review":"This is the best cd of sufi music in the world.It has everything the great lyrics, the sound of bosnian & islamic tradition good recording, and ilahis from the people like hazreti mevleana etc. And nesid ul huda are surely something that deserv 61:53 Miutes of your every day lives.THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like other reviewers said, wires too short","review":"The site said this was as good as OEM for my Dodge Grand Caravan. Everything about it was fine except the wires are definitely at least a foot too short.Don't buy unless you don't mind splicing the wires, which is what I did. Fortunately I had crimps so it only added twenty to thirty minutes to the project, otherwise it would've meant a trip to the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxation at it's best!","review":"Don't listen to this CD if you don't want to relax, because relax is what you do when you listen to this CD! At first I didn't think I'd relax, but then the tones of the human voice started and it filled me with such an energy, that it was impossible not to relax! The gentle ocean waves in the background... the tibetian bells... the flutes... the voice... it's all-incompasing! Takes all your senses and delights them into relaxation. I highly recommend this CD if relaxation is what you have in mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read MORE MOORE!","review":"I haven't been so glued to a book in a long time. I'd just finished Mary Gaitskill's latest which felt a little flat - disappointing because I love her. But Lorrie Moore has me saying, \\"Gaitskill WHO?!\\" I will read ANYTHING this woman writes, even if it's just some profanity and nonsense on a bathroom wall! So beautiful, sick, sad, and poetic. I was deflated by Gaitskill's recent loss of edge, but now I found my replacement. This is truly flawless writing and I'm still in awe."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful collection","review":"after reading lorrie moore's debut collection you don't wonder where her reputation comes from, you know. moore's stories are about love and loss. she uses a very interesting voice in this collection and parodies the self-help books that were over-abundant in the 80s. and she is very successful in her efforts. this collection shows why moore is considered one of the modern masters of the short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should try medication","review":"Maybe it was the mood I was in when I read this book, because I really loved \\"Birds of America,\\" but man, did this book depress me. Every single story with the exception of maybe two (\\"How to Have an Affair\\" and \\"How to be a Writer\\") were so, so dark and sad - unnecessarily so, in my opinion. I couldn't even finish the story about the dying woman saying goodbye to her daughter and husband. And the story it followed was about a woman losing her loving mother to mental illness. Oh, and did I mention that the story that proceeded it was about a woman burying her mother? At that point I was just begging for mercy, geez! I threw this book away after I read it, not because I hated it or thought it was poorly written, just because I didn't want to spread its bad juju around any further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I found this collection of stories to be very depressing. Lorrie More's collections of short stories are artistically done... always trying new ways of story-telling. I'm not much of a fan of her writing in general (and if you are, you will probably have a very differing opinion from mine), but I respect her boldness regarding methods of narration. Even so, I felt like I needed some serious self-help after reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A descent from her earlier greatness","review":"I used to go around buttonholing people, telling them what a great writer Lorrie Moore was...I still think her earlier story collections are terrific and would give them 5/5 stars. But this one is far from her best...beginning to sound like one endless story just chopped off in random lengths, like salami. And the one about the sick baby is disgusting and foul. If that happened to Ms. Moore in real life, I am sorry for her, but it is too intimate to write down for the public. If it is fiction, it goes too far. No mother of a seriously ill child would write cynical sentences about the other mothers in the hospital wearing sweatpants. So buy her earlier books, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out, Amy Tan","review":"After reading the many good reviews about nearly all of Lorrie Moore's books on amazon, I went to the library and checked out Birds of America, Self-Help, Frog motel whatnot, and Anagrams. I read the first stories from Birds of American and Self-Help and was reminded that there are some truly terrible writers out there; Lorrie Moore is the worst I have read lately. She writes like some graduate student doing a theses on The Joy Luck Club while weeping and staring into the distance. But...if you happened to like the Joy Luck Club, and perhaps loved the movie Steel Magnolias - man, rush out and by everything you can find by this genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical knock off quality - junk","review":"Sometimes you get what you pay for....The AC adapter was cheap in price and its cheap in quality.
