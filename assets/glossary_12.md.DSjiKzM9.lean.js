The phone suddenly will not turn off and has a blank white screen. It won't do anything. The man at the T-Mobile store said the battery stopped working properly and I needed a new phone. The battery was charging all night long and then this morning the battery died. It is extremely hard to get reception. I am in a major metropolitan area in Southern California and have to try at least twice to make any calls, to find a signal, which is a weak one at best. I am very disappointed with this phone and with the fact that I will be without a cell phone for 5 days while I wait for a new one to ship from the factory. Hopefully the newer one will work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great device - mediocre phone","review":"When it comes to owning gadgets, this baby is a must. It can do so much - the camera is fun, the organizer is pretty good, the color screen is excellent, bluetooth has show-off swagger and connectivity and the games are a lot of fun. The downside, this is certainly not a great phone. Its signal reception is mediocre and it suffers from a weird combination: the user of the phone comes through extremely loud on the other side, while the T610 user can barely hear what the other person is saying. This makes you talk even louder, thinking you are not heard and you get the picture. Being so small, the phone also requires you to either put it close to your ear or close to your mouth. In summary - in every non-phone activity this is a superb device, but as a phone it is middling."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd trade this for any nokia or samsung... ANY","review":"One of the worst.

It looks and feels great. However, the phone is extremely quiet. Try having a conversation outside where cars are whizzing passed you and you cannot hear a thing.

I'm in the market for a new phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS PHONE IS HORRIBLE! What a disappointment!!!!","review":"I should have known because of Ericsson's past that this phone would have issues. First of all let's start with the display... The display is so poor that it renders the phone useless in daylight. The screen is impossible to see even with the highest contrast theme enabled. Obviously, quality control was asleep behind the wheel with this one. Second, the reception is very poor. The phone drops calls all of the time.

If you can, get the Motorola V200."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge number of features","review":"Great features - except for the phone one. Seriously - Bluetooth, IR, good phone book features, nice color display (though it washes out if you are using polarized glasses). However, I get much weaker signals (and call quality) on this phone vs. my previous one. If everywhere you would use the phone has strong signals, you may be just fine - but if you are on the edge, this is not the phone for you, unless you value the non-phone features more than it working as a phone. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of phone activation","review":"T Mobile activates the phone the date in which it is ordered and therefore, you are billed for days in which you do not yet have the phone.

The thing is this phone has nice features but either t mobile service is bad or the phone sensors are weak as reception is bad.

I am thinking to file a lawsuit against t mobile to have such a bad reception and not living up to their word. The thing is the phone works well when i am outdoors but does not work well in indoors. So try other phones. I know ATT phone works well in my house since I had one before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reception","review":"Had this phone before switching to the Motorola V300.

You have to click the numbe rof the letter yiou want and then choose the lettrer and hten press ok for each letter instead of clicking or doubleclicking th emumber of the lette ryou want. Another thing was that it is perhaps too small... that i always would lose it in my purse.

Then I noticed a lot of problems. The phone's camera is not good at all. I wanted to take a picture and had to use a lot of lights so the picture would look kind of good. When the picture is taken it looks pixelated. I mean you can see it in little squares. The pictures also take a lot of time to be taken. You press the capture button and then on the screen appears the message: \\"PLEASE WAIT\\" and if you move the phone during that time, the picture will come out as a blur. The reception of this phone is really bad too. The service can come and be full and then suddenly disappear. I tried to listen to a message but I didn't hear anything clearly. The keyboard is also kind of difficult to use. To enter the menu you have to press the joystick right in the middle or it will go to another page. The phone is really slow and can get frozen sometimes.

Decent memory size5. really like the golf game on the phone6. Last but not least - calling card dialing feature is very good as i buy lots of calling cards for international callsSome small negatives1.

In comparison, the resolution on this screen is horrible, the screen is small, and the camera takes lousy pictures, and the battery isnt as long as expected, expecially when bluetooth is enabled. Overall, if you are looking for a toy, get something else. I highly recommend the nokia 3650. If you just need a phone to be a phone, get one of the freebies... I wouldnt recommend this phone though.

I read some of the other reviews where people said they had poor reception with this phone but I think it's cause of the service (T-Mobile) not because of this phone. I have AT&T wireless and so far I have never had a reception problem unlike my old Nokia phone (also with AT&T wireless). The really cool thing about this phone is that it is Bluetooth enabled. I can transfer ring tones and pictures to and from my laptop wirelessly and use a wireless Bluetooth earpiece to make calls when I am driving. Battery life could have been a little better but it's not that bad considering it has a big, bring color display. The camera also could have been a little better. Over all, this is not a bad phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real garbage","review":"This phone looks really slick on the surface, in reality it is a rare piece of garbage. I had two of these phones for the last year or so and I can't wait for my contract to be over to throw this thing away and far. My biggest problem is that the phone freezes constantly. The only way to bring it back to life is to remove the battery. Sometimes it happens when phone is ringing, so you have no way to answer the call, although you see who is calling. The screen is unusable in daylight. The camera feature is embarrassing (they might have as well not included it), the quality of pictures in extremely poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I have a T-mobile service in Miami, but I used it all over the east coast.

When I called customer service they say we cannot guarantee service in all the areas, even in those painted as covered in the national coverage map. In some places I had no signal whatsoever but my friend who has the same service with a Nokia phone had three bars. In addition to that the preloaded games are boring like the \\"colorbug\\" and T-mobile doesn't have downloadable games for this phone. The camera is really bad, low resolution, no zoom and useless with poor light. The internal memory is small and you have to erase pictures all the time. If you have big fingers just forget it, it will be a nightmare to dial. The screen is pretty clear and bright, but that's it ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Phone is Junk!","review":"I've been a T610 owner for about 4 months. The phone has a sleek design, decent camera functionality, and well, I'll skip all the details you could get from an ad. Let's cut to the chase. The T610 is a horrible phone. A common problem among many T610 owners, is that the phone freezes for no apparent reason. You cannot turn it off, half the buttons malfunction, and you are left with removing and reinserting the batter more than a couple of times. This has happened nearly 5 times in 4 months. My sister can attest to the same problem.Here are more annoyances. You cannot disable Increasing Ring. The phone will occasionally fail to charge. Loading themes are slow. My final gripe is that the power button might be too difficult to reach.I think the T610 is a mediocre phone. Oh, I forgot to mention bad reception.

The insides of the cylinder are basicly featureless except for a few niches that can be reached by a few ladders (these ladders are the only inanimate objects in the cylinder). Some of these niches are interconnected by tunnels. The cylinder is lit slightly by a dim yellow light that is everywhere. The temperature changes from 25 degrees to zero in four seconds and then back again. Some of the people are searchers and are looking for an exit. Others are the vanquished.

The content in many chapters overlap and the lack of solid themes in each chapter, combined with names, dates, and too many statistics make each chapter difficult to summarize and assimilate. The authors are both deceased, Dunbar died in 1970, and May in 2003, so it could further use to be updated, and given a more modern analysis of the material. This book should be about 2/3 shorter.

You can't help but rock out to the entire recording - play it loud on a good system and invite some friends over for a cold one.The sound quality is excellent and the recording captures the band in their absolute hard-driving best. If you consider yourself a lovero of American blues, rock and roll or just plain good music this is a must-have recording. A collection of ABB is certainly incomplete without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rock Revolution","review":"I just flat out have to tell you that this is one of the best and any ABB fan must have this to experience the original sounds of this group. The \\"early sounds\\" are so tight. Makes me remember being there in Byron. The sound quality of the recording is quite good and brings back the jammin' sounds that made the Allman Brothers one of the ushers of Southern Rock. I favor the first day recording over the second, but both are superb. After some 33 years, the sounds are still classic and fresh. How is that?

Welcome the Allman Brothers Band!\\" It took about two second of \\"Statesboro Blues\\" for 500,000 people to realize there was something special going on. I saw a lot of great acts including B.B. King, Hendrix, Ten Years After, but this was the only band whose album I bought when I got back to the University of Tennessee.

Oh, lemme guess, there'll be a #2 CD sometime next year. Gimme a break, man, this CD is pure marketing to sucker people's money, this is not about the music, but about JK's latest Ferrari.

What a rip-off!Jamiroquai may have done some of the arrangements, but who knows...it doesn't SOUND like them. Anyone could do those arrangements. Very basic, very boring, very played-out.Unless you just have to own everything with the Jamiroquai name on it, I'd stay away from this album.

Lots of color and illustrations with easy to comprehend text. I was a little disappointed in the photo references, which show an American made burning tool being used. This tool is not readily available worldwide and may deter a potential Pyrographer from pursuing the art any further. There are many other tools available for creating this art and it's a pity these options were not suggested in this book. The upside of the book is it's clear and precise layouts and (disregarding the obvious tool brand loyalty) the demonstration photos and sketches are first rate. I would have liked to see a bit more information on Pyrographing paper and gourds....Maybe Mr Chapman will honour us with a Vol.2?

These guys sound great together and have written, not one, but 13 unforgettable songs. Amazing. I do hope there is more to come from The Thorns."},{"rating":"2","title":"These roses don't have any Thorns","review":"They may have nicked their three part harmony approach from Crosby, Stills and Nash, but these three alt rockers do their own thing on their debut as a group. There's only one song that sounds as if it could have been taken off a CSN album (\\"Think it Over\\")everything else though has elements of the the three artist's sound involved in this group.The real gem here, though, is the bonus disc which is an acoustic version of the album recorded in August of 2003. It's sequenced to mimic the original electric version. The sweet harmonies and well written songs make this a great little album to listen to. I'd suggest going for the two disc edition or the SACD edition (which, sadly, doesn't have the second disc but is priced roughly the same)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better with the bonus disc!","review":"I had originally bought this Thorns CD without the bonus disc, since I didn't know the bonus disc existed.

Granted, I would like to read the first book and the third book, and I probably will (actually, I know I will), but I just want to let anyone and everyone know that Williams has made it possible for anyone to pick up Stone of Farewell and jump right into it.

It is much faster paced than Williams first book and I found it much more enjoyable. I especially enjoy the way he brings the church into the politics and struggles of Osten Ard. The Hero Simon is much more mature and not the annoying character he was in the first book. The plot unfolds as foreshadowed in the first book, without too many unexpected twists. The Cadrach character is very intriguing and Prince Josua reminds one of Hamlet. You can almost predict tragic ending for him in the future.

Her books indeed did involve drugs and sex, but they show the DARK sides of drugs and sex; nothing glamorous about it. The language she uses is very straightfoward and \\"in-your-face\\", and above all, very real. A lot of people use the fact that the \\"f\\" word is used often as an excuse to call it trash, when, in reality, the \\"f\\" word is a word that is used often among the types of people in the book.

I wear a size 9 shoe, and these were actually slightly floppy on me. Additionally, the beads in the bottom do not lay flat across your entire foot when you have them on, which kind of defeats the purpose of keeping your feet warm. I took them off and shook them around until the beads were spread out uniformly, but the only way they stay like that is if you then just place your feet on the floor. If you want to prop your feet up, the beads then all shift down again and refuse to stay in place. I love their other products, but the design of this one is off.

But I've used both products myself for several years, and they're still as good as new. Next, as others have stated, they are not slippers (or gloves), but 'cozys', thus the name. Don't expect to walk around in them. They're perfect for sitting on the sofa to read a book or watch TV. Even if the heated grains aren't touching you, the cozys create a chamber of warmth that takes care of cold fingers and toes quickly. Just pop them into the microwave (according to instructions) and you're all set. By the way, I put the whole thing in the microwave oven rather than separating the cloth from the grains - no issues - and it has worked just fine so far. There's always someone in the house who is just a bit chilled when everyone else is comfortable, and these are a perfect solution on the sofa."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"Unfortunately these are a great idea for cold feet but they don't work. The warming beads are in the sole and they move around and are very lumpy so you can't walk in the boots and in bed they shift around and the boot doesn't stay in place and if you have to get out of bed you have to take them off you can't walk in them.

It is my understanding that these capsules are intended to break down in the presence of moisture; but I heeded the recommendations and store the container in a cool and dry place. I cannot explain the spontaneous wearing out other than by the lack of quality in the consideration of the capsule's integrity. It is almost humorous to believe that exposure to the air initiated this breakdown. The pitfall of this design?

However, he is a geographer, not a sociolinguist, and thus many of his conclusions are frankly question-begging. He seems to be pre-convinced that the language is dead, and writes accordingly. Although exaggerated optimism about the future of the language is definitely not justified either, Hindley's is no objective approach either. There are direct lies, such as the reference to the disintegration of the Ráth Cairn Irish-speaking colony, which is still going strong, having even a web page in Irish.

While they will never get the praise they deserve by mainstream America who will always label them a White Stripes rip-off (since we all know Jack White is a guitar god and invented Guitar and Drum blues) I don't see that as a bad thing.

Taking their cue from the classic story of St. Francis of Assisi and the Wolf of Gubbio, the book's short stories (mostly short enough to be bedtime stories for young children) focus more on the saints' love for, and personal relationships with, individual animals, who all have names and personalities. This is a book that may be enjoyed by an adult, looking back to a long-gone era when children's books were not yet edgy or slapstick, but sweet and with a gentle moral... in this case, be kind to animals (which hardly seems oppressively 'teachy'!), but may equally be a a collection of fine bedtime stories to read to the two to three year old.

The Faberware lasted for years. They were so impressive that I gave them to friends and family. I can't find this brand anymore so I guess they are no longer available. I hoped this would be an adequate substite. Not even close!This oven is not usable unless you want to smoke up your whole house and set off smoke alarms. I thought this was just a problem because of the newness of the oven but not so. The problem has presisted, causing me to stop using and look for another oven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla","review":"We never even plugged this sucker in. I wanted a countertop convection oven that would accomodate a pizza or 9 x 13 pan, and this unit was supposed to do that. What none of the product decscriptions mentioned is that this \\"countertop\\" unit should NOT be used underneath a cupboard. Don't most kitchen countertops have a cupboard over them? Also not mentioned is that the unit required a 4\\" clearance on the sides: so whatever the dimensions of the unit are, you need to add 8\\".

It arrived with one of the oven racks not properly soldered but no biggie. However, third use (less than a month later) in mid-baking, the door seal broke. Ended up throwing the Bundt cake out - a waste of ingredients and time, not to mention energy.I called Waring and they sent replacement seals for me to install - after 1/2 an hour I gave up. I called the catalog company I'd purchased the unit from and they did swap it out which meant I was without use of the unit for more than a week.Just got the replacement in tonight. Hopefully, this unit will live up to my expectations of a Waring product.Update - 2 years later, no issues.

Hilarious. Never mean.","review":"I've read almost every book P.G. Wodehouse has written. Never a dull moment, and this one is no exception. Bertie, though perhaps mentally slower than others, is continually gotten into situations by those he loves and wants to help. It is their fault, not his, that he's continually in the soup! Bertie is blameless, and wonderful! Wish Wodehouse could have written another 100!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written and funny","review":"Wodehouse paints a comedic picture with lively characters and plot that is hard to compare with any other written humor. One has to be aware of dialoge and setting to glean all the gems from this writer. His style is fast paced and extremly funny challenging one to keep from laughing out loud. A must read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeeves & Bertie #2","review":"Previous: The Inimitable JeevesWhile some of the stories in this collection pre-date The Inimitable Jeeves, it was published as a collection two years later, and so I'm calling it the second book in the series. The stories in this set are all stand-alone and unrelated. While many of them are charming, there is one that stands out far and away more noticeably than the others - the ingenious Bertie Changes His Mind. I will not give away the wonderful twist of this story, except to say that Wodehouse pulls it off with flying colors, and it is surprisingly hilarious. If the first couple paragraphs throw you a little, keep reading - you'll catch on, and you will be utterly charmed. Another notable story in this collection is The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy, in which Bertie looks like a genius in comparison.Next: Very Good, Jeeves"},{"rating":"2","title":"wodehouse forever!","review":"Wodehouse is perhaps the best antidote I know for depression. His novels are literally unreal, for Bertie inhabits a world of leisure, servants, and privilege, an Edenic world where even the threat of pain, suffering, and mortality have no place, and Jeeves is always there as a deus ex machina.

Wodehouse???Carry On, Jeeves is a great starter book for those who are intimidated with the amount of J&W; books available (or rather, don't know where to begin). The first story in this book is about the first day Bertie Wooster met his personal gentleman (or valet, if you prefer), Jeeves. The stories easily stand on their own; with the exception of characters being mentioned or being part of the plot, the book is not a novel you have to read front to back. Consider it a literary sitcom, where new scenarios and conflicts arise with each story you read.My favourite bit about reading Carry On, Jeeves was the last story of the book, where it takes a refreshing twist and is narrated by Mr. Jeeves rather than Bertie Wooster. It was great reading from Jeeves's perspective.Lots of chuckles throughout and a few hardy laughs. Overall a perfect read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Topping stories for a whole lot of escapist fun!","review":"This is the first Wodehouse book I read and it will not be my last. The anthology of adventures that Jeeves is involved in are not only funny, they are wildly entertaining.

The book is a pure escapist fun, frivolous read for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see","review":"I was wonderfully surprised at the quality and composition of this story. Wedding Wars takes a light hearted comedic approach to an all too controversial but relevant issue in today's society, the right for gay people to marry. Very engaging and entertaining, the producers explain in the brief extras feature that the story is basically a fable, a true to life story with some implausible elements meant to carry a message of importance. I never found the movie preachy and I loved the way all the main characters were presented, no major villains here, just real humans with some differences in their beliefs. Though some may object to the lack of resolution of the issues at stake, the story does resolve the wedding at hand, kindly and gently, and leaves the audience with perhaps some new insights to reflect upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"No support!","review":"I like to wear a sports tank especially in the summer to eliminate multiple layers, but I was so disappointed with this tank, there was no support and I'm an average build!

Very soft, well made, launder well, and knee high -- just what I wanted. Can't find any other seller of slouch socks online.

My only complaint is that the Seller doesn't provide more colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do better than the original","review":"While as entertaining as any \\"Romance\\" novel, Sarah becomes a \\"modern woman\\" in this fictionalized account of the story of Sarah and Abraham. If you like Romance Novels, you will like this adventure packed, sexually broad novel. In this version, however, the story of Sarah is pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author has a Very Limited Vocabulary","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Maybe because I finished reading Dorothy Dunnett's Lymond Chronicles just before reading \\"Sarah\\". The comparison between these two historical fiction writers is night and day. Dunnett is truly a historical writer. Halter is not. Halter has a finite list of words he (she?) employs, whilst Dunnett's is limitless and far more entertaining.I feel the author didn't develop the characters well (I couldn't ever really like Sarah and the author never adequately explained to my why Abraham loved her), paint a vivid historical picture for me or accomplish much with this story.Halter does not give the reader a good time frame. He uses phrases like \\"some time later\\". But does that mean some years, seasons, months, weeks, days, or hours? It bothered me that I could not tell what kind of time lapse was occuring.Don't bother spending your money on this book. It's not worth it. Check it out at the library if you feel you must read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I swear, i expected a lot more from this book. The blurb on the inside cover intrigued me, so i checked it out from the library.I'm not even going to get into the biblicial inaccuracies here. I'm more concerned with the fact that the store seems to center around Sarah's continued beauty despite the passage of time, almost like God takes her fertility, but lets her keep her beauty. Apparently it's so stunning that even her adopted son tries to force himself on her.The story was just flat. There was just not enough insight into Abraham and his belief in God, and Sarah's lack of faith in him(as the bible would have it). I did not feel for the character's. The character i did feel for was Hagar, being forced out after Isaac is born.Just not interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Struggle with the book","review":"I really enjoyed Sarah for the majority of the book, but I am surprised at the people who call her a heroine or a \\"partner\\" to Abraham. In this story, the character of Abraham continually uses his wife to serve himself and his own purposes. Toward the end, he never acknowledges her agony or struggle as being brought on by her love for him in the first place. I felt the story was incomplete and didn't do justice to her struggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy to reach the end...","review":"I am normally a fan of the Biblical Fiction books such as The Red Tent and The Queenmaker but Sarah did not live up to my expectations. Unlike the two books I previously mentioned, Marek Halters writing in Sarah was very choppy which made the story hard to follow. He would skip years at a time between major events in her life, which left me confused and wondering what happened to get us from point A to point B. There are so many good Biblical Fiction books out there, don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly bad!","review":"I don't think Marek Halter ever looked at the Bible. (See below for truly great novels on Bible Characters.) He certainly is confused about Sarah. The book starts out with Sarah finding out she is bleeding for the first time and disgusted. Later in the book, Lot (Abraham's nephew ) makes a pass at her (when she is 60 years old)! What a disgrace this book is. It was disgusting and portrays porn scenes almost from the beginning. Recommendation: Read \\"Sarah\\" \\"Rebekah\\" & \\"Rachael & Leah\\" in the \\"Women of Genesis\\" series written by Orson Scott Card. Also read \\"Gods & Kings\\" by Lynn. N. Austin. This is the first book in her series called 'Chronicles of the Kings\\" - You will be so blessed by these 5 books. All Lynn Austin's books are truly a blessing and deeply engrossing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate, clouds over true story","review":"I find books like \\"Sarah\\" to be disappointing. When you finish it, you put it down thinking, \\"That did not enlighten me at all about the true story.\\" The story of Sarah and Abraham is very true yet Halter's version left much to be desired. The author took way too much liberty with the story. For example, until she meets Abram, Sarai is a priestess of a pagan nation. While the possibility of this is present, it's a story-line plot that is highly unbelievable. I hope no one reading this takes it for fact.Quite adult nature in content. In some places its a page turner, but I wouldn't recommend anyone read this book. It's truely fiction and overall probably a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Following Thumper's father's admonition","review":"The cover is attractive.

Sarah was NOT Abraham's half-sister. He pretended that she was when they went into Egypt to fool Pharaoh. And that is indeed the way it is written in the Bible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Were the characters in the Bible crazy?","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. As soon as Abram found 'religion,' he and Sarai were characterized as completely mentally unstable. To me it made Abram someone who hears voices in his head and Sarah's fate witchery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just was not interesting","review":"I was so disappointed by this book. I read a review somewhere that said if you liked the Red Tent you will love Sarah. I cannot disagree more. The book was just flat. The characters were not well developed and the plot dragged. There was so much made of Sarah's beauty it was daunting to get through the chapters. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just O.K.","review":"While I do agree with the fellow reviewer who found this book hard to finish, I feel as though I should point out one thing. It is fiction written for fictions sake. I highly enjoyed The Red Tent but found The Gilded Chamber boring. With Sarah I just didn't enjoy the writing style. Fiction should be for story telling, if you want fact go for a biblical studies book. Personaly I just want a well told tale, but did not find it in this book. Seemed choppy and hard to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical","review":"This was a great woman perspective. I was amazed to find out that the author was a man. I really enjoyed Sarah's version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, read The Red Tent if you want a biblical tale about women.","review":"The beginning of this story was very choppy and had no flow. Finally, there was some fluidity of plot but then it stopped being interesting. Having read the story of Sarah before, I'm surprised by the author's choice to omit certain parts.Don't bother. You aren't missing anything and you'll feel like you wasted your money. I couldn't even finish the last 50 pages, I was so bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarah","review":"I read this book as a book club selection, and that's the only reason I bothered to finish it. This seems to be a \\"woman's book\\" written by a male author, and though that doesn't make it unique, in this book, I thought the author included many unnecessary, gratuitous details. The book was supposed to have been based on an Old Testament Bible story, and I have my doubts that the author stayed true to the Bible, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy Variants","review":"There isn't much to say about variants. When it comes to comics, you'll either buy them or you won't. Generally, they are more expensive because fewer of them were produced than say the original cover.That said, these Buffy covers aka the variants, usually only cost $1-2 more than the regular cover (if that) depending of course how old the variants is and when it first came out. So this one, the #2 variant can go as high as $10 (ungraded by the CGC that is) yet the newer ones cost the same as the regular cover ($3).What I don't yet understand is this, if Buffy season 8 is doing better sales than Angel season 6 (After the Fall) why do the Angel variant covers cost so much more? Huh? Anyone...Anyone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose another hockey game instead","review":"As much as I wanted to really like this game, I just can't. Although we own NHL Hitz and NHL 2004, the primary reason we bought this game is because it allows you to create a player and, with the Eye Toy camera for PlayStation 2, put your very own face on it. That's the idea, anyway. In reality the player looked no more like my son or me than did any of the actual HNL players built into the game. So, in the end it is a feature with no actual benefit. Maybe that's because of poor product design or maybe it's the result of the limitations of the camera, but either way the game is not worth buying because the hockey action is so far behind the competing games. The graphics pale in comparison to either of the other games I mentioned, and the gameplay itself just isn't as fun or as realistic. Gretzky 2005 sounds great, but unfortunately isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally 989 sports comes out with awsome game!!","review":"This game rules! This game is a combanation of NHL Hitz Pro, and ESPN NHL 2k5. The intense hitting is like NHL Hitz Pro, and the gamplay is like ESPN NHL 2k5. They didn't copy of them but combained their features into one awsome game! See i have both Gretzky NHL 2005, and ESPN NHL 2k5, they are both good, but i think that i like Gretzky NHL 2005. It might be more money then the ESPN games, but still, for $35, it is worth it!

Why I didn¡t like this book is because I was not into the book. Because every time I read it I would do something else, but not read this book in class. What I got out of this book was that if you are young and you take care of your family, that means that you work at a young age under a lot of stress and the last thing you need to do is take drugs. WhyI recommend this book to people is if they want to read something sad. It was a bad book too me. Why did the author write this book? I think because at that time drugs were every were.

Instead of one narrator, each chapter had a different one. Some spoke more than once, and some only once. This book gave the perspective of many different people, but all about one topic: heroin. A 15 year old boy, Benjie, has a heroin problem and this shows how it affected his mother, \\"step-father,\\" grandmother, teachers, friends, and even the dealers. This book deals with death, addiction, and overcoming addiction. I think it is a great read for someone in early high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sade's Review","review":"The novel \\"A Hero Ain't Nothin But A Sandwich\\" is a great novel.I enjoyed reading it. This novel is about a young boy name Benjie who is growing up in a gang bang niegborhood. Benjie has been introduced to alot of bad things like drugs(herion). Benjie is trying to deal with school related activites and the temptations of doing drugs. Beening the age that Benjie is, he has alot of people influencing him to do things he knows that he should not do. This novel is so interesting in many differnet ways because it tells the book from different points of views, like his mom, grandma, best friend, and other people. You get to find out their thoughts on life and on Benjie. To find out if Benjie gets hooked on drugs of does the right thing ,you should read this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban Idioms","review":"I read this book because my son had to read it and I wanted to be able to discuss it with him. Due to the urban idioms, at first I found it difficult to understand the dialogue. Once I figured it out I found the book rather interesting. A 13 year old boy, Benjie, from Harlem is faced with several disturbing choices. Eventually he puts himself in a situation that he is not mature enough to handle and makes a bad choice, which is to try heroin. Once he makes that choice he struggles with the acceptance of being a heroin addict and repeatedly denies it. Yet, all the signs of an addict exist. Ms. Childress uses other characters to explain the ripple effect that occurs in the boy's life and how it has affected the other lives. I recommend the book, however, it is a tough read for young people."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible.","review":"What's with the above reviews? Doesn't writing or story matter anymore? Details? Yes, this book's got details. No piece of information is too trivial for Finder. How can anyone slog through this tripe? Reading this book is like banging your head against the wall.

The author's constant attempts to show how much factual information he has about \\"secret information\\" is distracting from the plot and appears only as a cheap sellout to make money.The plot was pedantic and the characters were cardboard.

But the love interest was silly, the sex too graphic, the stupidity of the police/FBI unbelievable, and ultimately the story itself is disappointing. It was as if he created a great bad guy but didn't have a real reason for him to do what he did. Finder should have worked on the plot more, and left out a lot of the See How Much I Know? and See Where I've Been? information. He overdescribes almost everything. He's a good writer who needs more discipline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Information","review":"This book started off great with an intriquing prison break and a demented vengeful James Bond type villian but veered off course quickly. The characters were uninteresting except for the ex-spy. The dialogue had the same voice. The prose was bland and the flow of the book was halted by arcane details. It seemed like a poor imitation of a Michael Critchon or Ludlum book - they were the masters at intreweaving facts and details with the story. The story was totally predictable and the major twist with the lead FBI character was hacky and unoriginal. The only fun part was that the book was written in 1996 and technology has changed so much since then. People talking about pagers, CD-Roms and Walkmans and a computer being so advanced because it has one whole gigabyte of memory was kind of funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Don't be fooled by Kindle publishing date.

It is also very interesting to read a novel about blowing up a building in New York that was written pre 9/11. At one point he writes that the only thing that could bring down the towers would be a nuke. Would that were only true. He creates a wonderful villian in Henrik Baumann, and keeps this novel a page turner. Not as good as the best Follett or DeMille, so I did not award this strong tome 5 stars. Nevertheless it is a highly recommended read."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUSPENSE in the spirit of Day of the Jackel","review":"The Zero Hour combines incredible suspense with an intriging use of current technologies.In some ways, this book reads like a combination of Ken Follett and Tom Clancey, except that the technology adds interest rather than makes the plot confusing..The Zero Hour couldn't be more timely.

However, what is disappointing about this book is that Price didn't seek out to interview more of the people who knew these anthropologists, as well as people in government who actually wrote such reports.

I am not the type to say burn books, but this would make great kindling for the fires of truth.

Granted, I was an impressionable 17 year old when this album first came out, but it blew me away. And this was 3 albums before Framptom Comes Alive changed him from an unknown into a star! Since I haven't owned a turntable for almost 2 decades, it's been that long since hearing it. The good news is, it's still the definitive Frampton. Even the original version of Do You Feel Like I Do puts the more famous live version to shame. Peter's talent and career has taken nothing but hard knocks since the live album. But his early albums, this one in particular, showcased a great singer, guitarist, songwriter, and the perfect band to make it all complete. As proof, the live album was more or less a collection of the best of his earlier albums. It was obscure then, and even more so now, but this is surely one of the great rockers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I should clarify that yo-zuri lures in my opinion are the best, but this time I got 3 good lures that meet the characteristics of the brand and 4 lures that look like a bad copy, are thinner, the tongue is smaller, the lure is painted has a sticker and the hooks are small and thin.I have the doubt if the seller did it deliberately or is a manufacturer's quality problem.

My wife is the queen of frosty drinks. With this blender the ingredients don't separate half-way through your drinking pleasure. Our old mixer, also touted as a professional blender, caused the ingedients to separate in the glass after about 3 minutes. Have not seen that happening after this blender get's through doing its job. Crushes ice without cringing and is esstially oblivious to anything thrown in, just blends everyting into a great pulp. Highly recommended for the serious frosty drinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Powerful, Easy to clean!","review":"This is a monster Blender. I just started a whole-food diet and I am blending my life into shape. When I unpacked it I could feel the quality in the weight of the machine. This is serious business. The one drawback is that it's loud, but most blenders are simply not quiet enough to blend in the a.m. and wake up an entire family. So, I just blend at night. If you want a Vitamix and don't want to spend the insane money, your vegetables won't know whether a $699 Vitamix pulverized it, or if it was a the Xtreme. Best thing is all you do is rinse it with water and you're good to go. No blade removal for cleaning. The blade sits up high off the base so food never gets stuck under it. There are only two switches, which I prefer over the LED-based touch panels. When those break you're done. It sits firmly on your counter.It's made for commercial use. This is the best price I've seen. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best blender EVER","review":"I have burned out so many blenders making smoothies over the years so I thought I would try this big daddy one and hope for the best. This guy is loud, large, and built to last. I can fill it up with ice and the motor hardly even pauses. Best of all it has a very large capacity so I can make a full glass of smoothie for all 5 of us in one go! The clean up is fun too. All you do is blend some soap and water in it. You never have to stick your hand down in it or fiddle with getting the bottom on or off because it is one solid piece that cleans itself. I don't think I will ever have to buy another blender again. Much to my kids delight I use this every day for snacks after school. Besides the juicer (Omega j8004) I have this is the only other kitchen countertop appliance I use every single day.

This may be a great blender; I haven't used it enough to tell, but I feel that Waring should have replaced it.

Yes, it is loud on high speed (low speed is actually quieter than my KitchenAid blender). Yes, it is heavy, but this is a heavy duty blender, it is powerful and as such is heavy and big and loud. You can't ask for a muscle car and buy a Prius. If you want to do green smoothies or Starbucks or Jamba Juice quality smoothies get a heavy duty blender.

Well its powerful enough but just 2 weeks into using this thing not excessively mind you...it randomly decided to turn itself on!!!! The only way to shut it off was to unplug it. Then after letting it sit it didn't turn on at all!!!! It started making a clicking sound like the electrical contacts were loose. Long story short....I'm returning it hoping to get one that works.

However, what really makes this book shine is the detailed descriptions of each and every trap. The perfect cure for everyone who's tired of the standard: \\"Trap: CR 2, poison darts, trip wire trigger, Search DC 12, Disable DC 15.\\" I highly recommend this book to all D&D players; whether or not you use the traps in the book, they're simply fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slight issue with heel but otherwise great","review":"These shoes are great, and surprisingly comfortable.

It is very roomy, has six pockets, three interior three exterior, one middle large compartment that can hold a large U-lock or other assortment of tools and spare parts. The interior is relatively large, though I believe a real bike messenger would want something a little larger due to the hauling of large packages would not be completely feasible with this bag.

I think it appeals to some moms out there because they've truly lost their intellectual capabilities and identities by focusing all their attention on their children and spending most of their time in coffee klatches with other like-minded moms."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was awful","review":"I bought this book thinking I would be reading another Nanny Diaries (which I loved). This book doesn't even deserve to be in the same room with the Nanny Diaries! It was fake, forced, and completely unenjoyable. The dialogue was overdone. It was inconsistent and contradicted itself many times. Most of the characters were completely one-dimensional and/or not credible. Doesn't Faith Lord have better things to do than focus entirely on Ivy's life and cater to her every whim? And Ivy is such a pushover, it made me sick when she couldn't confront a single person of the many who have wronged her.I couldn't do it! I forced myself to read about half-way in hopes it would get better, and then I had to give up. And I never quit books! I can't rememeber the last time I didn't finish a book, I love reading so much.As Italians say, there is no worse thief than a bad book. I feel robbed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This will be a fun beach read for the summer...","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book! I thought I'd read a couple chapters on my quick beach trip, and ended up finishing it the next day. Ivy Isn't a perfect person, but I ended up rooting for her. Her internal dialog was a hoot, the characters were fun, and the ending is satisfying. Being from Cleveland, reading about obsessed New York parents was a bit like reading about a foreign culture, with laughs. Give it a try on your next beach trip...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Trite Tale Not Worth Your Time","review":"If you liked books likeThe Devil Wears Prada,The Nanny Diaries: A NovelorThe Right Address: A Novel, don't bother to read this book; you'll be disappointed. The Ivy Chronicles book is filled with Manhattan cliches and stereotypes. While I am well aware that the business of getting one's child into a private school can be cut-throat, Ivy Ames of The Ivy Chronicles is a terrible advisor thrust into the business of admissions counselor by a string of improbable events. I found none of the characters particularly interesting or compelling and the story was often wooden and forced. Watch a reality television show or something on the Lifetime channel rather than read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look In the Dictionary Under the Word \\"Junk\\"","review":"How does a book like this get published? Several people i respect said it was the funniest thing they read all summer. It makes me question the people I work with. No smiles :-) No nothing. A perfect Lifetime made for TV movie for morons. Nobody lives like this!!!!! Ivy ames life is like active fantasy life-- all fluff, no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"This was a book that I tried to give the benefit of the doubt and really wanted to finish (against my better judgment). It was hard to care about these characters, though, especially Ivy and this made it hard for this reader to get through it. The book was not very well written either (please tell me she didn't actually use the sentence \\"It was extremely cool.\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"It's been a long time since I've disliked a protagonist as much as I hated Ivy Ames. While the premise of the book was intriguing (an insider's view into the cut-throat world of the Manhattan elite), my antipathy for Ivy overroad any hopes of my giving this book a good review.She continually baffled me with her amoral stance and her ability to turn everything into a one-woman whine-fest. There was almost no one to cheer for, save some of the stereotypical \\"underclass\\" children. I almost quit reading several times, but somehow convinced myself to carry on.It's unfortunate, because Quinn is a talented writer. She just needs to work on creating some likable characters -- maybe some with morals."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish it....","review":"I usually \\"have\\" to finish even books I don't like - but I got about two thirds through this one and just couldn't take any more. The premise was amusing and the beginning of the book held a lot of promise. But it just got dumber and dumber until I finally bailed out and couldn't slog through the last 100 pages. I can see why it is compared to \\"Nanny Diaries\\" but it doesn't even come close in quality. Don't waste your time - there are way too many great books out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody in this book is likeable","review":"I read this book for my book club because it was supposed to be funny. It isn't. The author couldn't get me to care about anybody in the story. I'd never read another book by this author, and I read a lot. For a really funny book with a much better plot and sympathetic characters, read The Undomesticated Goddess by Sophie Kinsella."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Maybe the most poorly written book I've read in a long time.

Try to avoid this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reasons I stopped reading this book.","review":"I could tell you things about unrealistic plot and characters, and they would be true, but here are the things that really made me stop reading.1. Page two, main character explaining why she doesn't make her unemployed husband get the kids ready for school: \\"Plus, let's face it, wha man takes charge of the morning marathon?\\" This is a GREAT formula for ensuring that men will continue to not do their share of the child-rearing. Not to mention perpetuating 1950s gender roles generally.2. There is a character named Sassy. Who is sleeping with Cadmon but married to Drayton, who works for Konrad. I could go on.3. Page 36, final straw: A former boss is referred to as a \\"she-boss.\\" Book was published in 2005, not 1955.If you like this kind of book, I suggest that you buy something by Jennifer Weiner or Marian Keyes instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stupid Plot","review":"I had some hopes for The Ivy Chronicles, and for the first 150 or so pages, I liked it enough to continue reading.

I stopped short of finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!!!","review":"Love, Love, Love this book!!!

She's selfish and superficial but of course learns lessons along the way. Ok if you're after a weekend fluffy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"I, too, expected this to be like The Nanny Diaries. Boy, was I in for a surprise. For starters, the authors of The Nanny Diaries actually had talent.If you can even get past the fact that most of this story is utterly unbelievable, you will quickly grow to dislike the \\"heroine\\" of the story, a shallow, mewling, spoiled woman named Ivy (wow... the subtlety is amazing). I put the book down after one too many fat jokes.When I pick up chick-lit, I'm not expecting Pulitzer Prize quality, but the character was NOT likeable, the plot was completely unbelievable, and the writing was so childish. If you're looking for good chick lit, do not pick up this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed Out Loud","review":"I enjoyed the book. The charcters were compelling, the story was lively, and I even found myself laughing out loud. Ivy's not a heavy story, but a great \\"weekend\\" read. It's an interesting peak into the lives of New York's elite, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable escape. If you're remotely curious about the lives of the rich and famous, and the things they'll do for their kids (or for themselves, for that matter), pick it up. You'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read more reviews first.","review":"Boring, unfunny and a waste of time.

What's more, I have no interest in reading such self-centered whining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful masterpiece.","review":"A book translated by Thomas Cleary is worth its weight in gold... and then some. The Avatamsaka Sutra is a powerful and profound piece of work worth the investment of time to ponder, and meditate upon.

In my opinion: this is the apex of ALL Buddhist text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful. A remarkable translation.","review":"For anyone interested in the highest, most lucid and profound written teachings of the Mahayana, Cleary's translation of the Avatamsaka-sutra is essential reading. Every line is beautifully rendered, and the only problem I have with it is the translation of \\"bodhisattva\\" to \\"enlightening being,\\" which is accurate but not usually done. Aside from that petty qualm, however, this book is perfect. Even the physical design is very well crafted and aesthetically pleasing. This is surely Shambhala's and Tom Cleary's masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak effort by a solid author","review":"This is probably Dalene Matthee's worst effort, and should not be read as an introduction to her otherwise solid body of work. The central character is a weak, irritating creation and her motives for getting involved in diamond smuggling are implausible and downright stupid. I only finished this book because I don't like not finishing books.If you do want to try a book by Matthee, do start with the vastly better Circles in a Forest (Kringe in 'n Bos in the original Afrikaans) or Fiela's Child (Fiela se Kind) instead, and avoid Brug van die Esels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wilton tilting turntable wobbles, not good for smoothing sides","review":"Transaction went great; received right away.

We opened it up and several of the children worked together to assemble it. They were not successful, so we tried again the next day. They were still unable to assemble it so the other teacher in the classroom sat with the children and she was unable to figure it out, too.

HE loves it. Although he cannot put it together by himself and the directions aren't great, if you have patience it is worth it. Only downfall is that it is not very sturdy. My almost 2 year old has nocked it over a few times and I worry every time my almost 4 year old playes with it that it is going to topple over. I would have bought a set with more pieces though. This is adequate, but it could be even better with more pieces. Definately recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor design, flimmsy at best","review":"This marble run, and similar varieties by Quercetti sold by Amazon, Target, and other stores, is terrible. The plastic pieces do not stay together. An ADULT will spend almost all of their time constantly re-assembling falling down sections they attempt to put together. Assembly for a child of 4+ (age recommendation by the manufacturer) is impossible. I've used marble runs from other manufacturers and have not experienced this level of poor design. However, I've never seen a marble run that is made so that the pieces connect solid and certainly not one that can be assembled by the recommended age. I believe in general they are not worth the effort and time trying to get them together and to stay together. Do something else that's much more interactive and satisfying with your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE !!!","review":"Bought it at Target for $16, money would've been better spent on the needed toilet paper instead. Instruction shows 3 or 4 designs, I chose the one using 4 legs, after wasting 30+ minutes to put it together, at first, marble will keep rolling thru, when it gets to the roller coaster like tracks section. Once I moved the whole thing to a different location, it now always gets stuck at the mid section of the roller coaster tracks. The tracks sits slightly tilted, where the marble does not have enough force to roll thru it, even the pictures within the instructions for that track looks slightly tilted. I test it by lifting it to make it level, then the marble rolls thru it without problems. But, how do I keep it permanently leveled? I used floss to tie it to pull it up slightly. Besides that really disappointing issue, it's really not that fun after 10 minutes of play, it now it's sits in the corner of the garage, waiting for the next garbage day.[...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed!!!","review":"The Pictures of the producst show Crystal Glass balls, but it came with cheap plastic balls. No assembly instruction included. It so poorly design that bottom level ball holder does not have the space to hold all balls comming from top level holder. The bases are unstable, so at the minimum intent to move the toy, it will be necessary to assemble it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"There are a few issues with this set that make others more worthwhile (for reference, my kids are 6 and 7):1. When you add a shoot/funnel/anything other than the one-piece cylinder building pieces, you have to add 2 more clear pieces. Other sets would have a single piece that can be built upon. This doesn't, and you have a lot more work building as a result.2. The structure tends to be less than sturdy (not quite flimsy, but not as solid as other similar toys).3. The yellow spirals have a poor design. You have to add in small support pieces that don't snap into place. I believe this is so the spirals would take less space when in a box (they flatten out), but there are extra pieces you have to keep track of as a result. Not a fan.Overall, I'd suggest buying a different set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and frustrating","review":"What a disappointment. Everything about this marble run is cheap. We've assembled three of the tracks on the box so far, and none of them work like they're supposed to. The inclines aren't right, so the marbles end up getting stuck. The yellow corkscrew pieces in particular are an issue - they've got connector pieces that are supposed to hold them together, but they're so cheap that they just keep snapping apart. The quality of the plastic feels worse than a toy you'd get at McDonald's. Buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun!","review":"My kids (ages 5 and 8) have had a great time playing with this. I like that the box has a handle and is good enough quality to store the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marble Disappointment","review":"I see our problems with this set are pretty standard. The structure falls apart and the spiral pieces don't properly function. I had a great marble run set as a child and we have a good one for our older daughter already.Here are our issues:--It says 80 pieces--the majority are small connector pieces. Actual marble run pieces are less than ten.--The connector pieces don't stay together well. Some require a second piece put over them to connect, which doesn't have 360 degree connect ability, so you are limited in how you construct your set.--The set falls apart easily.--The most interesting looking pieces are the flimsiest--they connect poorly, sag unevenly, and the marbles just fall off.--We bought this to add to the existing marble run system we owned. It is not compatible.I cannot believe how badly this set performs. Maybe the folks giving it decent reviews have never experienced a well-constructed set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sturdy enough for kids","review":"This is very hard to build -- like, multiple adults squinting at the picture on the box and cursing under their breath hard. You seem to have to build what is on the box -- we have not succeeded in varying from the picture much at all -- and even then it tends to lean, tilt, fall over... The whole thing is extremely light weight and unstable (even the \\"marbles\\" are tiny, lightweight plastic balls). I would definitely recommend against this marble run. We are back in the market for another one this year, because my kids still want to be able to play with one! We will be looking for one with more flexibility (i.e. it's easy for kids to be creative in how they build it) and sturdier/heavier-weight parts and bases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Galt Marble Run instead","review":"We have this brand as well as the Galt brand marble run. We hardly ever use this set and the two are incompatible - I'm about the throw this one away and get more of the Galt brand. This marble run set is flimsy (our 2 year old can do the Galt by himself but needs our help for this one). This one also requires special smaller marbles - which we can never find! And the marbles sometimes need \\"help\\" getting all the way through the course (due to the flimsy construction). Don't waste your money - get the Galt brand instead:Galt Marble Run. LEAD FREE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this version of Marble Run and get a better one.","review":"Skip this Marble Run and get the one made by Discovery Toys - I wish I had! We have spent hours playing with Discovery Toy's version at Grandma's house - it is so much better. I'm so surprised because I thought Quercetti was such a good quality brand. This marble run is terrible. It is flimsy beyond belief. No matter how long I spend to get it upright and working (admonishing my excited children to STAY BACK! Don't touch it til I get it ready!!), it only takes a few seconds of play time for it to get knocked over again. The supports are too light.Thumbs down. Big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marble Run","review":"This works just how its supposed to, definitely for older kids, unless the parents decide to build it for the younger kids, otherwise, they can't get it to do much.

Very difficult to assemble and keep assembled unless done exactly like the picture. I had to set it up for my 6 year old because she was unalble to keep the pieces straight and level.

This started off with the wrong directions in the box so there was no map for the kids to follow. We got over the missing instrucions and found the pieces to be sharp and poorly made. The pieces fit together poorly making playing with a finished design very difficult for fear of total collapse. The spirals are not designed with enough \\"drop\\" to keep the marbles rolling so they always stop or fall off there. We have never left such a poor review and it is hard to do.

When you listened to a Nuclear Assault album, all of the songs sounded different. All of the songs on CONDEMNED TO SUFFER sound pretty much the same.Musically, All Out War are similar to Slayer. Their vocalist - if you want to call him that - just screams at the top of his lungs on every songs. There's nothing dynamic in his approach. I was worn out after listening to six or seven songs.True Crossover is C.O.C., D.R.I., the Crumbsuckers, the Cro-Mags, early Suicidal Tendencies, Sacrilege B.C., and S.O.D. All Out War doesn't come close to being anything like those bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent metal/hardcore crossover","review":"This band sounds like Slayer mixed with the New York hardcore sound. The music is excellent, it's fast with plenty of breakdowns and the vocals are intense and tough guy sounding. My major problem with this band is the generic christian lyrics.

If you can ignore the stupid lyrics then I suggest you pick this up if you like Lamb of God, Hatebreed, Sworn Enemy, Shadows Fall, Sick of it All, Slayer, Chimaira, Merauder or any other metal and hardcore bands.

From the opening riffs of Live Wire to the live recording of Merry-Go-Round, and everything in between, this does NOT stop rocking. Motley were at their raunchiest and sleaziest here, and helped define 1980's hair metal. More important then their well known image as bad boys is their ability to write catchy and memorable songs. If you like any kind of pop-glam-hair metal, or any of Motley's newer recordings, you'll love this.

The unforseen disadvantage is that you must manually fill the unit with water every couple of days. The advantage, however, is that if you use filtered or bottle water the ice cubes are tasteless. In fact, as the ice cubes melt in water, they remain pure and tasteless because they do not share the air of refrigerator the way an automatic ice maker that is built in does. So the ice melts, but you can just add more cubes without tasting all the flavors within your refrigerator.Sits on the counter top and purrs away making plenty of ice for a family of four.Terrific product."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than satisfied for convenience and price!","review":"I've never written a review before after being a satisfied Amazon customer since it's inception.

Because I am limited with my walking, I always have the machine close at hand by my side. The ice does gradually melt over time in the basket, but the water is recycled into more ice as the compressor switches on and off as needed. Most people may use this only occasionally on a boat or a wet bar, but I use it for soft drinks when in the entertainment room in my basement. Because I am disabled, I do not have to climb the stairs every time I'd like a cold drink. I have a small fridge in the immediate area as well, but ice trays are for the birds.

Brust really took his time on the descriptions and Vlad's thoughtshots, esp. in the segment when he is on Greeanare and hides in the tree. Many parts in the island scenes make you want to read on and on until the unexpected happens. You will be surprised at some of this stuff.

The band handles their instruments just okay - no interesting chops anywhere- the lyrics are mundane, and the vocals are sugary sweet harmonies just one step removed from 'boy band' stuff. It's aimed at a VERY young and unsophisticated audience. IF you like them, rush to the net and find an album by 'Three' (planet noise records). They do the boy band sound, but with lively music and full of punk/gansta attitude in their lyrics. OR take a break and try a band with real, adult lyrics and harmonies like Aztec Two-Step.

Its well designed as far as being able to access the Ipod controls and ports. There are two major flaws however that make this product pretty much useless.1) The armband doesn't stretch. Once you tighten the armband to where it will stay on comfortably there is no way for the band to stretch if your muscles expand during a workout. This might not be an issue for someone jogging but if you are lifting weights it makes things really uncomfortable as it constricts you arm. It also puts a lot of stress on the band causing it to rip.2) The material it is made out of tears easily. I bought this band a month ago or so and it is absolutely shredded.

The customer support at Samsung, once I found the right phone number, was very polite and helpful and with the 1 year warranty we're able to send the unit in for repair... although labor and shipping is not covered under the warranty and will end up costing us over 1/3 the product price to get it repaired. Aside from the premature failure the unit did perform acceptably and remote control was easy to program and use with our television from a different manufacturer. However, considering the failure and the cost of repair I don't see us purchasing anything from Samsung in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Samsung DOES NOT CARE.","review":"This unit was a piece of junk. The DVD player quit reading DVDs only a couple months after purchase. I contacted Samsung and they said all you have to do is pay for shipping of the unit to SASCOA, E. Providence R.I. (my nearest repair center)and they will repair the unit and ship it back. There the unit sits. They don't pay for return shipping - you do (they didn't even tell me it was repaired - but they did tell me when I called that \\"Wow, I'm surprised they haven't sold it on you, they're authorized to do that if it sits for more than two weeks\\". Samsung didn't care who told me that I only had to pay for one way shipping, SASCOA is very unprofessional and they pretty much told me they don't care about the consumer, they work for Samsung. I will never buy a Samsung product again, no matter what the reviews. Customer service is poor at best.

The third unit has stopped recognizing many major studio released DVDs that the other two units play. With the third unit, I have to load & reload, jiggle the DVD in the holder, & turn the power off & on, to get it to sometimes work. After 15 minutes of fiddling with it, I usually give up & move on to something else. I'll soon be getting rid of the third unit because it's aggravating & wasting my time. The two units that work get a rating of 3* from me, & the other one gets a 1* rating.

All 3 are wonderful period pieces illustrating English life with terrific characterizations, dialog, psychological discussions, & moral dilemmas.

Tey also provides some pithy comments: From Miss Pym Disposes: p. 122: As a psychologist she began to suspect she was a very good teacher of French.From The Franchise Affair: p. 213: The Governor; to whom a tear in the eye was just a drop of H2O.p. 295: If you see a giraffe once a year it remains a spectacle; if you see it daily it becomes part of the scenery.p. 298: The less he knows about a thing the more strongly he feels about it.From Brat Farrar: p. 414: If you thought about the unthinkable long enough it became quite reasonable.While each novel is probably a 4.5 star (or close), IMHO the collection rates higher.

This is a tough book to review without giving away how the seemingly disparate characters interrelate, but suffice it to say the way in which they do is both clever and clearly well designed. Though there is clearly a rich history to the main character (and his family) which is alluded to often, it never truly gets developed, and the actual action sequences take place over a 36 hour or so span.Nevertheless, the pace, dialog, and conflict are all realistic, and artfully enough crafted so as not to seem rushed, and there are some interesting spices added to the mix which seem incongruous, including marathon running, dentistry, and Nazism. Lastly, there is a chilling torture scene and enough revenge exacted to reward you for rooting for the good guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh ... so so book.","review":"I bought this because of a sudden fascination with the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, on this the 80th anniversary of Hitler's rise to power.

His best probably remains the thriller Marathon Man. With a nicely complex but hardly difficult plot and amazingly strong characterization from the major players to the minor placeholders, this is a thrilling, at times harrowing book that also manages to provide a great deal of humor and a strong subtext of lost dreams. With his villians, Goldman truly manages to capture the outright banality of some of the world's greatest evil. And as for his hero -- I would defy anyone not to root for poor, awkward Babe Levy from the first minute they meet him. In recent years, its become strangely unfasionable to run the risk of injecting anything resembling humor or humanity into thrillers and instead, those qualities have too often been replaced with meaningless violence and a smirking sadism.

This was not up to her standards. While I did like the change of scenery (this novel is set in idyliic Greece) I felt that the characters were not fleshed out. I could not belive some of the romances (especially towards the end of the novcel) or the one-dimensional character of Shane, who is cast as a moronic villain.I think what was the most disappointing aspect was that certain characters (especially David) were left w/o any closure at all.This novel didn't ring true and wasn't especially well-written either."},{"rating":"2","title":"It wasn't all Greek to me.","review":"Was this novel typically Binchy - no! Was it enjoyable nevertheless - yes. The only thing I really missed was the Irish Binchy humor so prevalent in her other books all of whichI've read and loved. The lives of the four main characters, all from \\"other places\\" were interesting and involving. The descriptions of Aghia Anna and Kalatriades were detailed, perhaps, too much since they were very small with not much to them.

It never took off. I probably read chapter 1 about 5 times hoping I missed something. It seemed like the writer was under the gun to produce a book and that it was thrown together.

Her books are typically the kind of book that you fall into and can't put down. I keep reading one last chapter before bed, until I realize that it is 2 a.m. So I picked up a copy of Nights of Rain And Stars. What a disappointment! The characters are flat, I had little interest in what happened to them, the outcomes were wrapped up too easily for some characters, and the writing was not very good. I had to force myself to keep picking it up and finish it, which took several weeks, because it simply was not that enjoyable or interesting.

It was a waste of time.It started off well enough, and I initially liked Ms. Binchy's writing style, so I kept going. There were several flaws, however:1. The characters (save Vonni) seemed to be cardboard cutouts. If they were any more one-dimensional, they'd be a dot.2. The end result was too predictable. If about a third of the way through you couldn't figure out exactly where each character was going to end up, you weren't trying.3. The dialogue. Who talks like that? Specifically, the American man and the German woman's dialogue sounded like they were speaking two centuries ago. I haven't read dialogue that bad since I tried reading a Left Behind book.I'm tempted to give Ms. Binchy another shot. She seems to have many devoted readers, and they too have expressed their disappointment with this novel. I sincerely hope that this book was not representative of the rest of her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"a let-down from Maeve","review":"Having read all of Maeve's books, this one was truly disappointing, one-dimensional and shallow. The characters were neither believable nor particularly likeable. Very contrived story.

A dozen or so, no kidding. My biggest complaint is her insistance on describing what her charactor's dialogue has already established. If they are having a friendly conversation then you don't have to tell me that they walked/sat companionably or any of the other odd words she was compelled to use. Speaking of dialogue - I found almost every conversation unbelievable and therefore her charactors pretty boring and unlikable. Don't writers have editors any more? I am tempted to take a red pen to it and send it back to her publisher.Maybe if I was 13 I would have liked this book. I will never be able to read another one of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depth of Characters, and Unveiling Backstories","review":"The alchoholic character is true to many I have know through AA associations - it does miss out on there being a sponsor-type or stand-in, although Andreas might have been. Other bits of lives are verities, and the heartbroken Andreas is the catalyst to the strangers' lives becoming intertwined. Having an all-wise Vonni is the one oh-too-convenient character, yet her flaws are also nearly fatal to her.This is a book for those who enjoyed \\"Enchanted April\\", and deserving of a movie, itself.Of course, a yahoo from Alabama will be disappointed there are no priests and leprechauns from Blarney, but the characters speak appropriately for their varied origins, although I don't think my cargo shorts are so laughable, nor would I ask a woman I had kissed in a bedroom if it were \\"gross\\", especially if she spoke German. Oh, well, this is an Irish writer - the rest was true to my years living among the \\"Continental natives\\" and the ex-pats."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Don't Understand the Negative Reviews","review":"\\"Nights of Rain and Stars\\" is one of my favorite books by Maeve Binchy.I read many of her books and loved them all, this was no different. I enjoyed every page, was never bored. I loved the setting in Greece, enjoyed all of the characters.I truly don't understand the negative reviews. It appears to me that readers get so disappointed when an author takes a different turn, writes about a different place. I found it a refreshing change. I think if I was an author, I would get tired of writing about the same country, the same kind of people and the same kinds of problems, like an actor gets tired of playing the same role, I imagine an author gets tired of writing the same kind of books...so, I say, thanks Maeve, for a refreshing change from your routine.I love stories about Ireland and Scotland, but loved reading about Greece too, loved the water, the sun, the story line, the food, the characters, their lives - loved it all!KCNew Jersey"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money....","review":"I usually LOVE Maeve Binchy's books, but this one missed the mark !! Short sentences, no flow of storyline....choppy, and not believable......didn't even finish it ..... there are lots better books out there....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all impressed","review":"This is my first Binchy book and had I not read rave reviews about some of her other books, this would have to be my last. The setting was wonderful, but the story line weak and frankly not too realistic. In my opinion the dialogue between the characters was stilted and didn't \\"flow\\" and they (the characters) were never fleshed out...no depth at all; also the book kept jumping back and forth to what was happening in each of their lives so much that it was almost like watching a slide show. The lessons learned by each of the characters was noteworthy and I'll probably try to read one of Ms. Binchy's older books that I've heard good things about, but this one truly wasn't worth it and I finished it only because I don't like leaving things undone. This must have been published only because it was a \\"Binchy\\" because otherwise I can't imagine an editor/publisher bothering with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad disappointment","review":"Although I had briefly scanned some bad reviews of this novel by one of my favorite authors, Maeve Binchy, I decided to ignore them, and checked it out of my local library. I really tried to stick with it, but was sadly disappointed. I was hoping that some of the other reviewers had overstated the decline in the quality of Binchy's writing, but they did not exaggerate. It's hard for me to believe that, given the wonderful character development and plots of her earlier novels, this one was so poorly drawn. Is she simply fulfilling an obligation for a certain number of novels, perhaps?The 'heart' of Binchy is missing from this one. I couldn't even finish the book, giving up at not quite the halfway point. It's a huge disappointment, because I've always savored Maeve Binchy's books, especially her earlier works which took place in Ireland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Binchy's best","review":"I did not enjoy this book. I loved Tara Road and The Scarlet Feather, but found no such affinity for this one. I, like other reviewers here, found the characters to be stilted and unbelievable. In the first few pages I was thinking to myself, who reveals this much of themselves to a complete stranger? I just did not believe in the people. For me that is the crucial part of a story.I have another Maeve Binchy book on my shelf, The Quentins, and I hope it doesn't disappoint me as this one did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw It All Coming!","review":"I laughed when, near the end of this book, a character says, \\"I didn't see that coming!\\" A reader paying even half attention would see everything coming in this simplistic, predictable, formulaic tale. My views echo those of previous reviewer Barbara, in that I could see Binchy with her character scenario spread out, lazily matching happy and improbable endings to her flatly-rendered and unbelievable characters. Much of the book is dialogue, and it, too, is unreal. I am hugely disappopinted, having been charmed by Tara Road, an excellent read. The best part of this book is its lovely dust jacket!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed User","review":"I bought a EX-Z750 a year ago, and I was quite satisfied with the performance. However, an unfortunate drop (it wasn't even a very hard fall) rendered the camera non-functional. Being a satisfied Casio customer, I went out and bought the latest model: EX-Z1000. Boy, was I disappointed! Where do I begin? Most importantly, the pictures completely lack detail. I asked my wife to take the same shots of me with a Nikon Coolpix 3MP I bought several years ago. The Casio lacks a lot of details of my skin texture and hair. In addition, with reasonable room lighting, the Casio pictures can't see the books on my shelf in the background, while the Nikon shows them clearly. Also, the LCD screen of the Casio was very noisy and grainy.Casio was so desperate to roll out the first 10MP consumer camera when its technology wasn't ready, and it has definitely lost me as a loyal user.I promptly returned the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent camera for the price and WOW factor","review":"I previously had the Casio EX-Z750 7.1MP digital camera and thought it was a decent camera so i went with the EX-Z1000. Even though it's in the same line-up as the EX-Z750, it's a completely different camera. I consider myself a power user - so far, the EX-Z1000 has accomodated my needs fairly well. You can't set as many manual settings as in the EX-Z750 but the increase in ISO sensitivity makes up for it. The only downside that I have seen is in the LCD: photos look a little blurry and distored even though they aren't. I would definately recommend this camera to someone looking to get an ultra-compact camera with good image quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good camera!","review":"It is a very good camera. Would have given it a 5 except for the limited optical zoom. Extremely easy to use and thakes great pictures. I use it allot for macro mode pictures and they come out super. The battery life is amazing. I have a fuji 4700 digital that requies a battery change after only a few macro photos.....this sucker takes hundreds on one charge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works GREAT .. wish the flash would reload faster.","review":"All cameras I've bought (started at 2MP, 5MP, 7MP, 8MP now 10MP) ... have a similar flaw to them from all manufacturers: Sony, Konica, HP, Canon and Casio ... they all recharge the flash too slowly. This one is actually the fastest, but can't get it faster than 1.3 seconds...well, that's life.Picture and video quality is fantastic. Audio recording is pretty good too.Get at least the 2GB (150x) or higher memory...especially for short videos.** Tip on any camera you buy: Try to get the extra warranty that covers accidents (drops, spills, etc) from Day-1 because you can and probably WILL drop a camera at some point...and finding someone to repair it is a pain (not to mention minimum $100)...just pay $50 up front and don't sweat it for a few years. **Casio has impressed me with its newer cameras...nice job !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the 7.2 Exilim","review":"I purchased this camera after my son broke my Casio Exilim 7.2. Unfortunately, most of the stores don't carry the 7.2 models anymore. I bought the latest model EX-Z1000 instead assuming that it'll be just as good, if not, better.I was disappointed to find out that when I took pictures, it had these vertical lines on the LCD screens. Looks defective, but I'm not sure if that is normal with this model. I just returned it anyways. Another thing was that the fact that it's higher in resolution, it fills up my memory card so much quicker. But I don't notice it being any more clearer than my older one. The more I use this, the more my I miss my old camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"external battery not convenient","review":"I had the old 3.2 mpeg Exilim for years and recently upgraded to this one.It was not obvious when I did the research to buy this, but the external battery charger turned out to not be a good idea. Unless you have 2 batteries to switch around.The problem1. you take battery out to recharge2. say you leave the battery in the charger for a few days3. put battery back into camera, everything resets and the camera asks you to enter date/time again. urgh... annoying...I still like the Exilim, but just wished I didn't get one with external battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"LCD cracked for no apparent reason","review":"I have had the camera since Febuary and while it does take great pictures, I opened the case yesterday to find the LCD cracked. To replace this would be $150.00 minimum which is half the price I paid. I did not drop it, it was in the case in my purse. Apparently after speaking with Casio you are not supposed to put it in a purse or in a suitcase. Well this will not work for me and I have never heard of such. I have to have something more durable. I am basically out 276.00 which is what I paid in Febuary. Its too bad because it did take great pictures and was very compact, just too fragile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Camera I've ever owned","review":"This camera takes blurry pictures straight out of the box. One mistake I made was to not take my own SD card to the camera shop and look at the output. I thought the blurry image I was seeing at the camera store was because of the low resolution screen but it really is the camera. I've missed too many pictures of my kids and am in the process of buying a new camera a short 2 months after buying this.Casio support was responsive and tried to help but nothing appears to work. And point and shoot is definately not an option. I thought it would be nice to take quick pictures of the kids but none of them are worth keeping. I've taken over 200 pictures and I will not print any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars, but terrible customer support for problems","review":"like previous EXILIM cameras, this one is rich with features and excellent performance. The problem arises when there is a problem, like a stuck lens cover. The repair / support process is as bad as I have ever seen. The repair facility has no quality, is not customer responsive, and basically will charge for items under warranty.Although I have purchased several Casio's, including the EX-Z1000 and am happy when the camera works, the repair process is bad enough for me to no longer purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Digital Pictures Ever","review":"I have an Exilim 1000 for about a week now, I started without reading the manual, got many incredible prints, the best I have ever seen out of any digital camera, the difference between those and the rest is the 10 megapixs, make a huge difference, even printing on a 4 x 6 the difference is so obvious, the manual is on the cd, it must be run on the Adobe Reader, ok, so no big deal.I few things I did,nt know were easy to fine and learn, I have had many digal cameras, unfortunately, most were not up to what I expect,the Casio is u there all by itself, battery life is excellent, just to many nice features go into here. Notice on the reviews that many people had negatives about it, well,maybe they got early ones or whatever, all I can say is the Casio is outstanding, I am sure that in the months to come especially before Christmas, all the manufacturers will come out with pocket sized 10 megapix or more cameras."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"At first when I got the camera in the mail I was dissapointed when i first started using it, because the shutter speed is slower than my old camera when it is on the basic setting.

However now I have gotten used to the camera and take the most amazing pictures with it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera!","review":"There is a reason why this camera is rated number 1 on Amazon. I highly suggest buying it; it is easy to use and the quality is wonderful. Get the 2gb memory card, it's worth the extra few bucks, and you never need to delete pics again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best /Easiest Camera EVER!!","review":"This camera is amazing. Best point-and-shoot camera I have ever owned. The anti-shake works flawlessly for crystal clear shots. My whole family owns Canon and when they saw the quality of my pictures, they all wanted new cameras. The only critism I would have is that I didn't realize the memory card was not included and I had to order it after the camera arrived. If I had known, I would have ordered the card at the same time... did get a great deal on Amazon for a Kensington 1g card and reader for $25."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Exilim","review":"This is my 4th Casio Exilim camera that I have purchased. Again, I have not been disappointed. The quality of the pictures are better than ever. I have not experienced any blurry pictures. Each model keeps getting better and better and the viewing screen keeps getting larger. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor facial images","review":"I've just returned this camera for poor facial image quality after using it extensively for months. My regular camera is a Fuji Finepix S602z which is large and bulky, but, takes superb facial shots. I tried the Casio due to needing something small to carry in my purse for special events and I'm heartbroken at the incredible photo opps I've had that resulted in poor facial quality. Don't buy this camera if you care about what everyone looks like.I've just ordered the PowerShot SD1000 because of the facial detection feature on it. Hopefully, it is better since I don't want to have to carry my bulky Fuji to get great facial photos. I'll review the Cannon once I've had it for a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAD DIGITAL ZOOM & NO MANUAL AVAILABLE (not even a pdf)","review":"As a long time Casio digital camera user, I was looking forward to using my new EX-Z1000. Unfortunately, it arrived with a non-functional digital zoom. No, not user error, I assure you. It's just plain not working. (The Casio Tech Services rep I spoke to, while helpful, appeared to know less about the operation of this camera than I did.)While I didn't expect a full printed manual in the box, I was surprised that even a pdf version is currently (July '06) not available anywhere, here or the U.K. web sites.Here's the U.S. number to get a printed manual for this camera, when Casio finally gets its act together: 1-609-395-0154Feels to me like this launch has been rushed for some reason - to take advantage of the summer vacation selling season, perhaps?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Casio quality and customer service","review":"I bought a Casio Exilim 3 years ago. Since that time, the viewer cracked and the cost of the repair was 90% of the camera's price. Then the software began to malfunction, intermittently, by that time out of warranty. I find Casio has great features on paper but after the sale service not at all satisfactory. So, what to do? I bought a very simple 5MP Kodak Easyshare. It is interesting in the end, after weeks of research, I would choose Kodak. My brother in law had one, it was very reliable, everyone in the house could use it, and it was reasonably priced. And judging from user reviews, Kodak will turn around a broken camera in 48 hours. I'll take that over a bunch of bells and whistles anyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"you are better than ever girl!","review":"Listening to Verena's latest musical creations touches the heart and refreshes the soul.She makes your Cuban essence smile amid the tears . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comforting Thoughts","review":"Perfect book for those moments when the tragic events of September 11 overwhelm me.

Harold Bloom is undoubtedly one of the great literary critics of recent times--what would his own fiction read like?Ugh. This book is cast in the mythological prose of a Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast. This is low quality fantasy. The real star of the book is Bloom's eccentric philosophy of Gnosticism and no thought at all is given to characterization or euphony of language. I think Bloom is trying to write a new testament here, not a novel. He fails. This is an embarrassing piece of work.Do try his criticism, though. When Bloom is on his home court, he's engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Birth of Modern Geology","review":"Part geology, part biography, part history of Scotland, this excellent book is a tribute to James Hutton, the originator of modern geology. Starting with the status of geology in the eighteenth century and the use of the Bible as the basis for estimating the age of the earth, the author weaves the intriguing story of James Hutton and how he came about discovering signs of the earth's true antiquity. The political situation in eighteenth century Scotland is well described and illustrates the times in which Hutton lived. But the book goes further in that the evolution of geology after Hutton's death is also discussed, ending with modern estimates of the age of the earth and a brief description of the methods used to produce them. This is a very well-written and exciting book that should appeal to a wide audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldnt put it down","review":"I have a stack of five books on the nightstand, like many I dont find myself reading one book all the way through without interruption. But The Man Who Found Time kept me engaged and turning pages from beginning to end. The unique blend of history of science, obviously well researched, and social and intellectual history makes this book stand out. But it is a kind of intrigue that draws you into the book.You follow along as Hutton formulates and argues his theories and then are startled by the varying reactions to them by the greatest thinkers of the time. Any John McPhee fan will appreciate the way Repchek so skillfully puts the people at the center of the science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Hogwash","review":"It might be a nice little book if any of it were actually based in reality. Yes, the author is right that if Hutton had challenged the dominant mode of thought to create a new science and been the first person to challenge the biblical time-scale and the story of the flood, that he should be mentioned in the same breath as Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and the other greats...BUT HE DIDN'T!All of this had been already covered to varying degrees by many different scientists for only about oh, the last 100 years by the time Hutton showed up on the scene. He is in no way a founder of geology, he is only an important and early contributor.So regardless of whether the book is well written or not, the entire foundation for what it has to say is completely false, and thus completely worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, it really is bad...","review":"I was so impressed with \\"I'm Wrong About Everything\\" (and still am) as used in the movie \\"High Fidelity\\" that I couldn't even imagine that the rest of the album would actually be bad. Maybe the title of the only likeable song was an omen. I was wrong, and it's bad. The lyrics for every other song are corny.

Her voice is so pure and uplifting, and the melodies of her songs stay in my head for days (in a good way!). I especially love \\"Lodestar\\" and \\"Uniform Grey.\\" Now I'm off to buy her latest release... let's hope she keeps them coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I cannot stop listening to this CD. Sarah Harmer is poised to become a huge success -- walking in the steps of Sheryl Crow, Shawn Colvin and Sarah MacLachlan. What do I like best? Brilliant writing, great tunes, solid musicality, songs with meaning. I bought this CD because a very groovy friend recommended it after catching Sarah Harmer at a show in Baltimore. In my groovy friend's absence, let me direct you. Listen to this CD -- you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great find!","review":"I was lucky to have seen the video for Basement Apt. and became trapped by Sarah Harmer's voice. Although the rest of the CD is a bit different from the single it is refreshing, especially with all of the pre-packaged talent out there, I am personally pleased with it. My personal favorite is Lodestar with it's smooth transition and melody. I personally recomend this CD to those that like early Sarah McLaghlan and similar music. It is my listening rotation often."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like . . .","review":"To convince the skeptical listener to buy this CD, I will pull in some heavy-weight comparisons to illustrate my point (a cheap and easy move, but hopefully persuasive!). If you like the songwriting grit and candor or Lucinda Williams, the hook power of Aimee Mann, and the pastoral, folksy feel with an edge found in of many songs by Joni Mitchell, you'll love this CD. It's the winter's best musical surprise. Do yourself a favor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like...","review":"...Brandi Carlile listened to Sarah Harmer when she was growing up. I like Brandi, too, but Sarah's use of certain vocal stylistics is more subtle. If you are familiar with Brandi, you will know what I mean. Both write excellent lyrics. Give Sarah a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Canadian folk.","review":"As I was turned away at the door from a sold-out Sarah Harmer show in DC a few months ago, I overheard a fellow outside the club saying to his companions, \\"How could this show possibly sell out! Who knows about Sarah Harmer besides me and my friends??\\" I guess I felt the same way, or I would've purchased tickets ahead of time.In short, Sarah Harmer is not Canada's little secret any more -- her sweet, heartbroken folk songs are getting wider and wider exposure in the US. Her beautiful voice and her heartfelt lyrics rival another Canadian Sarah (Ms. McLachlan to you) and this debut album shows what a phenomenal songwriter she is. You will not be disappointed by this album.However, if you'd like to see Sarah Harmer perform live, learn from my mistakes: by your tickets in advance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I think Sarah Harmer's You Were Here is the type of album that takes numerous listens until you can really appreciate it. The single Basement Apartment is addictive and fun to listen to, but the real gem here is Lodestar.

This women is a wonderful songwriter and she's blessed with a beautiful voice. I heard \\"Basement Apartment\\" on some college radio station or other and fell in love with it, bought the album on the strength of that cut and wondered why Sarah wasn't already a huge star. Standout cuts: \\"Basement Apartment\\", \\"Coffee Stain\\", \\"Capsized\\" and my favorite song that whole year \\"Don't Get Your Back Up\\". The entire album is a joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a more earthy Sarah McLaughlin","review":"Sarah Harmer is more down-to-earth, and some would say, less self-centered, than fellow Cannuck femme singer Sarah McLaughlin. Her authenticity and musical sensibility is evident throughout this fine CD.

Highly recommended to lover's of folk music, poetry and lighter rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This CD","review":"I was formally one of the only girls I knew not jumping on the folk girls with guitar bus.

And I absolutely wish I was DEAD every time I hear the opening chords of that first song, for I know I'm in for a long and irritating ride. Sarah Harmer's boring, monotonous, emotionless voice makes me want to wretch. Her songs are bland and unoriginal. \\"Everything was going so gooooooood I thought something baaaaaaad might happen, and then it diiiiiiiiiid.\\" If one is going to stretch out a line of a song so sloooooooowly, one had better make sure it's a line that exhibits a whisper of writing quality. Don't waste your time. If you want to hear a woman who makes some good music, go out and buy some Patti Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Work","review":"Despite the overheated push, this is only a so-so album.

Sarah Harmer has never been afraid to explore different types of music or instrumentation from album to album or even song to song...that is evident on this well-crafted CD.The lead off song \\"Around this Corner\\" is my favorite track on the CD. It will having you singing along after just a play or two. What other pop song can you think of off the top of your head that has a clarinet solo in it?Other highlights include \\"Basemant Apartment,\\" \\"Uniform Gray\\" and Coffee Stain.\\" This is a wonderfull listen from start to finish crafted by a great artist.

Because of the warpage it's difficult to fix without risk of breaking it (don't have a small/gentle enough clamp to use trying to glue it down).

Unlike the numerous herbal teas that I frequently indulge in, the flavour of this brew is more akin to the traditional teas in that the flavour and aroma is heady and tends more toward bitterness. Due to this aspect, I found that cream was conducive to this brew and that for those who prefer a more mild tea, brewing is best at three minutes. Although I usually do not indulge in such strong tea, I found this to be the quintessential compliment to the breakfast atmosphere in that its invigorating taste and potent tinge helped to bring me more fully awake. Each element of the tea interwove to create a complimentary and elegant taste that no true tea connoisseur should miss.

The aroma is a fine grassy floral tea blend. The leading flavor is Keemun, a malty, slightly smoky flavor. This is a smooth subtle cup of tea, without some of the more characteristic robustness of most Breakfast blends. However, it is still a very stimulating blend--fairly high in caffeine I would guess from its effect! Unfortunately, Numi does not list caffeine count on the box.Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging. The boxes containing their tea is made from 100% recycled paperboard from 100% post-consumer waste--they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2,040 trees, reduce landfill by 131,200, and prevent 184,000 greenhouse emissions.

But there is one flaw. I don't know whether the balance engineer went to sleep for the first few tracks, but the entire string section is huddled over to the left. Things improve later, matching in well with the remainder of the orchestra which is (positionally) well balanced. Balance in the sense of relative volume of the instruments is good throughout. And as for the actual performance, I think it is one of the best I have heard, and I have decided to put up with the mis-placed strings in the early tracks and buy the release: you don't get such a combination of quality in both music and sound (with the one caveat) often enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I have a number of other versions of Romeo and Juliet and bought this one for the novelty of the DSD direct recording.

Just a tad too bulky but it looks like it will last forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, comfortable strap","review":"When I made the switch to digital I let my old leather strap go with my 35mm. Huge mistake! It was a natural brown, very soft and supple strap that served me well for many years. So after using the stock straps with 4 digital cameras and hating them, I started looking for a leather strap.The Canon PowerShot leather strap is the one I chose. It's styling and finish go very well with my Canon and while it's not as soft and supple as my old one, it is 100 times better than the stock nylon straps. The thick, wide leather supports the camera securely while NOT eating into or rubbing you neck raw. Although it's a little stiff I'm sure a little mink oil and use will have it nearly perfect in no time.I got a great deal through Amazon, of course, and am super happy with it. It is very well made and head and shoulders above the quality of almost all the other straps I looked at. It's classy, functional and comfortable to wear. I don't know how it could be any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This book is beyond worthless. Some of the selected readings are good, but the book itself is riddled with typos and misspellings. Further, whoever wrote the questions, comments and definitions in this book simply didn't take their job seriously. For example, in one of the essays (\\"Extremely Cool\\" by A.J. Jacobs [not a good essay]), the author refers to \\"street lugers\\". The editor felt that the word \\"luger\\" needed to be defined for students, so if you follow up on it, you'll find a definition that reads: \\"Luger: a semi-automatic German pistol.\\" Honestly, that's just the tip of the iceberg. It should be considered a crime to force students to pay money for this worthless piece of trash.

There is definitely something missing. I am a fan of big band, swing, and R&B/Blues with horns. This music may have a quick beat but it doesn't get my toes tapping.The music isn't cohesive and Kid Creole doesn't grab my attention.

It stopped working completely, so we replaced the batteries, but when we powered it back on it had a series of lines running through the text, almost like an invisible bar-code, making it virtually unreadable.

Really, I bought first one and after a year the LCD was not functioning good and I hardly read the text, then I bought another one it lasted only for a year and half for the same problem - the problem is that lines appear on the display where you can't read text!! I checked reviews on the internet and some people facing same problem.Although I loved it, but it is so stupid to buy the product for the 3rd time.In brief, if there is a warranty for 3 years for this product, then go for it, otherwise forget it and try 2nd best dictionaries - in my opinion - \\"Franklin SCD-2100\\" which in some site rated number 1.

For example, it does not have the ability to create favorite word lists. This would allow repetitive review of words one has difficulty with. Another needed utility is the ability to search by word root, e.g. find all the words with \\"rogare\\" (to ask) as the root. Grouping words by common root is very helpful in building a large vocabulary. So, as a vocabulary builder the device falls short. However, it performs well in terms of ease of use and rapid word look up.

The dictionary is quite complete -- I haven't had to go to my OED but maybe once or twice since getting it. The definitions tend to be on the terse side, but not ridiculously so.The thesaurus is just okay, but I've been spoiled by my vintage 1957 Roget's, which is SO much better than what they slap that name on these days.So why the negative review? After a year and a half of being my trusty writing desk sidekick it just quit. Wouldn't turn on, wouldn't do anything. New battery and jabbing the reset doohickey do nothing. Naturally the warranty is only for a year. If this was a $15 item I'd grumble and get another one, but at $80 I shudder to think what my cost per lookup came out to!Now I can't live without one of these little gadgets, but I'll be trying a different brand.

In working with Sharp's customer service they admitted the E550 can only be used for the easiest of puzzles. I would agreeThe dictionary lookups were quite good. However, there were some strange quirks no only in definitions but displaying similar words.To me the E550 is outdated both in function as well as the display.

I changed the battery but that didn't correct it. The bottom line is that this dictionary cost me about $30 an hour to use before it bit the dust.

Yeah, I get it, Harry completely sheds his past and moves into the future. Could you use something less than a 20-pound sledgehammer to drive the point home? Tellingly, Carney's performance in the unnecessary goodbye scene is the only time he's unconvincing in the whole movie.Yeah, I know, \\"bittersweet\\" endings get you noticed by the Oscars.

The re-issue CD is on my to get list, mainly because I'm a collector.

I couldn't find it on the manufacturers' web site either. It took me several tries to get the right drill bit, which meant that I put several unneeded holes in my bathroom wall. When I did find the right size drill bit and lightly tapped the anchors into the wall, they cracked and bent back. The mirror is on my wall now and I managed to cover the extra holes with the mounting plate, but every time I use the mirror, I have to be careful not to pull it off the wall. It's only a matter of time before I have to get new anchors and rehang it, as well as patch the holes and repaint. The mirror itself is fine.

The 1993 Dallas Cowboys(one of the top three teams of all time) lost their first two games of the season. Equally as great, the 1981 San Francisco 49ers lost their opener.

Horrible foul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, if you have a wide door","review":"I'm lucky to have a wide closet door to hang this on, so it works perfectly for me. I can see the other reviewer's point of view - I'm sure it would get a bit crumpled if you were rolling it up and stowing it somewhere. But for those of you with a big closet door (be sure to measure before purchase!!) this is great -- no wrinkles ever. It holds so much tissue, ribbon, bows, tape, and scissors, I am now totally organized. My only gripes are that I wish it held at least one or two more rolls of wrappping paper. Also, the ribbon bar isn't really strong, so if you load it up, the bar will bend and then dips over the tissue paper row. So it's a bit of a pain to get the tissue paper in and out, but not a major issue. Just the fact that I have multiple pockets to store my tissue by colors make me so happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected","review":"I was looking for something to keep my wrapping paper organized, and thought this would work well for the half-dozen rolls I usually have around. While it did work fine for some of the rolls, many were either too short, too long or too thick. The metal prongs that hold each roll into place don't allow for much size adjustment. I've found that the rolls which didn't fit are the ones bought through those mail-order fundraisers (you know the ones - kids' parents are always selling these), and the ones from Costco (the wide, short ones). I do love the hanging feature, but agree with other reviewers that once all the rolls are in place, you can't roll up the organizer and use the buckles without smashing all the paper. If I had room to keep this hanging all the time, it would be perfect. But I bought it because I thought it could be rolled up nicely and unfortunately, it just doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Organization","review":"I really liked this product. It can hang behind a door and be fully loaded with birthday wrapping paper (or whatever you like) so when you're ready to wrap presents, you're not struggling to find the paper, bows, tape, etc. Although the pockets are made of plastic, as long as you are not too rough with it (i.e.: place scissors in too forcefully), they should hold up through time for storage of smaller items. Good product and excellent price at less than 5 bucks. In fact, at such a great price, it would be worth purchasing several to have seperate organizers for wedding paper, birthday paper, graduation paper, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful - NOT a space saver!","review":"While this is a nice organizational product it is NOT a spacesaver. I bought this hoping to be able to hang it in my closet. It is actually wider than a standard closet space and is not designed to be hung on a closet bar. It is designed to be hung either on a rack of some sort, the back of a door (perhaps) or a hook on a wall. None of those solutions are good if you live in a small space. I can see how this might be a good way to organize a few wrapping supplies, but as far as an efficient storage solution, this really doesn't cut it.

Despite the characters, main events, and the ending of this much told myth being known to the reader, the tension is maintained to the last page. Greece of over three thousand years ago comes alive, with characters fully developed and scenes described in such realistic color and detail that one feels personally involved in this mythological drama. \\"Jocasta\\" is quite a page-turner and a splendid read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great telling of old tale","review":"Really a very pleasant surprize, engaging and colorfully written.

But Iokaste (not Jocasta!) is a really good read, snaring me with the first words of the prologue. Grossack and Underwood take a bit character and give her a voice, and I was impressed with the variety and the arcs of the other characters: Kreon, Laius, the different forms of the Tiresias, Niobe, Menoeceus and Antigone. I had a little trouble relating to Oedipus and the Sphinx; on the other hand, the riddle contest with Oedipus and the Sphinx was compelling, so maybe my judgment is somehow skewed. I can't hope for the continuing adventures of Iokaste - the poor woman is dead! - but I hope the authors will bring us back to Thebes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demystifies the myth","review":"Even if you don't know the story of Oedipus in ancient Greek mythology, this take on \\"how it may have unfolded\\" rewards greatly. Jocasta, queen of Thebes is given a human side. Jocasta and her brother Creon are embroiled in political intrigue. She wants both love and the best for Thebes, struggling with the conflict the two bring. The authors take the Greek myth and demystify it. Tension and suspense drive the plot. The period detail is impressive. What appears to be a heavy subject is remarkably illuminating and accessible.There will be two sequels highlighting other figures from ancient Greece.Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of Crestmont"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated but still good","review":"**** HAS SPOILERS**** The follow-up to Biggle's \\"All the Colors of Darkness\\".

If women had appeared scantily clad in more than two panels, it would have been an HM archetype.This appears to be the start of a long-lived adventure series. As such, it lays out the fantasy's ground rules and setting (a world of after-the-collapse technology), and introduces the Quest: a trek to the semi-mythical Maser. And, as an introductory chapter should, it leaves much to be revealed in the installments to come.

In the book Woodward and Bernstein give their separate accounts of what they did in their days talking to people inside the White House, and others who might know anything about the break in. In the book Woodward also describes his meetings with Deep Throat in the parking garage, and their methods of telling each other of where and when to meet.I would recommend this book to anyone in high school or older.

There is no suspense, and the book is written in a rather haughty style, glorifying the abilities and righteousness of McGee. I was nauseated by the final third, just trying to finish it up, shaking my head at the lack of suspense and the wooden tone. I think one has to have a simplistic devotion to the series and/or character to see this installment as among the best of the series, because it comes off as sort of a love letter from MacDonald to McGee.

Plus there are two or three sexually suggestive scenes - one is a very heavily suggestive scene.If you could cut those scenes out, this would be a great film. You just have to love the mastiff playing Hooch, and the scenes where the dog is destroying things is just plain funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Movie","review":"I couldn't believe my wife had never seen this movie.

A true tear jerker in the end, it is appealing to animal lovers and has plenty of lightheartedness throughout. In spite of the overshadowing premise that this is a \\"cop movie\\", it goes well beyond that. Hanks is his usual funny yet at times poingnat self and the personality of his new \\"partner\\" Hooch, a fine Dogue de Bordeaux present a wonderful contrast."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good family comedy/tearjerker","review":"This is a good example of one of actor Tom Hanks earlier works. He is terrific in the role of a somewhat nuerotic police detective who finds himself straddled with the loveable, slobbery Hooch, a gigantic messy dog turned witness in a small-town murder. This is not a \\"great\\" film in the artistic sense, but it's terrific fun film to watch with the whole family for a bunch of wholesome fun and laughs. Though it is mostly a comedy, the movie has an ending that leaves me in tears every time I watch it.

The wording is indeed repatitive, but any early childhood expert can tell you that for a young child that is what draws them into the story. Remember, it is not written for an adult. The fact that \\"Willa\\" and \\"Willoughby\\" are repeated on every page makes the story instantly familiar to a young child. The story is sweet and the illustrations are georgeous.

It encourages young ones to think of something positive and happy before they go to bed. It encourages them to look around their surroundings and nature to find joyful thoughts. The idea that \\"the morning likes waking you up. That's what makes the morning happy\\" is so unique. Going to sleep becomes something purposeful and fun because that is the only way the morning could \\"wake you up.\\" In another word, going to sleep becomes a positive act instead of a passive one. What especially makes me love this book is that the one who is soothing the little bunny (who is afraid of nightmare) is her big brother instead of her mother. This very positive book is an excellent bedtime story as well as a good choice to deal with sibling relationship.

The overall morale is good (a story about finding things to be happy about in your life... counting your blessings... an older brother helping out his little sister) but it's not very well written in my opinion.The use of repitition of the character's names is very cumbersom to read aloud.

That is, the base cannot be extended to the grinding wheels (look at the picture).

In spite of the fact that I have been otherwise happy with the product, I will not spend $25 to replace the probe, since it is clearly an inferior piece of equipment and is likely to break again.

It takes a little while to get the technique down for opening and closing the door, but its great not to have to climb over it (although you can if your hands are full).

The gate opening and closing is simple and secure. Even my 5 year old was easily taught how to open and close it properly. It's also easy on the eyes, it does not have that jailhouse feel the others I looked at have. What I love most is that even with covering a large area the gate stays put and is sturdy.

You'll really need to try to find a wood stud to secure the gate. Sheet rock just doesn't take the abuse of adults climbing over (to prevent the kids from seeing how the gate opens) and kids hanging or leaning on the gate.The gate was easy to adjust and install. We had to take a panel out and that was relatively easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Folding the Gate","review":"Well, the gate is fine if you never take it down, I guess. However, we use it to keep our dogs out of our living room, and when we have company we like to fold it up and put it away. Even though we loosen them before closing, the plastic tensioning knobs at the swivel joints have bound up and cracked in half, rendering the gate useless. For $100, I expected more. This is a poor design, compounded by cheap materials.

In a few short months each of the 4 connections to the walk-thru portion in the middle had cracked. Now the hinge covers on the 4 corners are all broken. We had to literally tie the pieces together to hold it up until we could install a homemade gate. My toddler was able to pull on the gate and break each of the components with his minimal strength. Because it is made to accomodate awkward spaces, it is flexible and won't lock stiffly into place. The flexing motion was more than the plastic could handle, so every time he pulled on the gate it gave a little more. We installed it exactly the way the instructions described. I'm still trying to get my money back.

Much happier now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gate, flexible","review":"The gate works very well. We are using ours at the top of our steps inside the house. The gate also is covering the railing at the top of the steps, keeping my son from putting his head or hands through the railing and throwing things down stairs. It is pretty rigid and we have only used the tie downs (velcro type strap) on the railings.

Or the next call they say they are sending them, and send the wrong thing. Then they send only one piece of what I need! I called back today after waiting another week for the parts and they said that they would be mailing them today. It is never ending and I am so tired of them promising results but not following through. I would seriously consider buying from another company because this one does not back up their products when push comes to shove!

My only complaint, and it is very small, is that the gate isn't quite as easy to close as I expected. It usually takes two hands or a push with the toe to get it to line up just right to latch. Otherwise zero complaints. Well worth the money.Also, they must have changed the design of this gate since the velcro complaints were generated, because my husband and I both tugged on the velcro as hard as could and nothing would come loose.

This was the most durable and heavy gate that I could find to build a large play yard that actually looked decent. I did not want a plastic gate that would slide or be easily pushed (I have tile floors). I purchased two and a gymnastics mat that my daughter will be able to use when she is older. I spent $325 all together; however, most people spend around $200 or so on a pack and play that they can only use for a year and this I can use for a lifetime... It wasn't as easy to put together as I thought it would be, but worth getting if you are looking for something long-term."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic hinges break","review":"We bought this gate to enclose a playroom for my kids. At first it did ok. It was a bit difficult to set up and some tools are needed. The gate lasted maybe two months and it started breaking apart. My son, 18 months, ended up breaking the plastic hinges by pushing on the gate from the inside. Then the hinge to the gate also broke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Infant Gate review by DesignZone.com","review":"I have tried many gates out. I have sent many back. I have another one sitting in my hallway (too late to send that one back). I have spent time going to pet stores, and doing online research to find a gate. They were always a disappointment; either the installation was difficult, the gate didn't take things like wall trim into account, or the design was just bad. Finally I found the Summer Infant Gate. Not only is it super easy to install, but it is of superior quality. My only complaint is that I wish that they made these for a smaller span. I needed to fit a smaller span and I was so frustrated with other gates, that I actually bought a second Summer Gate and made it work in a smaller span by extending it to a wall that was farther away. I'm tired of taking chances on other inferior products. The Summer Gate is pretty durable too. I would buy this product again, and I just might buy a third one for the upstairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst gate EVER!!!","review":"I bought this gate to put at the bottom of stairs. The mesh and nylon part is held on by velcro. The 1st day is was up my daughter was running towards it and fell onto the mesh part, the velcro gave way and my daughter fell face first onto the bottom step. She got a cut on her forehead and a black eye!!!! My little girl is very tiny (about 22 pounds), if she can fall right through this thing I'd hate to see what a bigger huskier toddler could do to it. I called the company minutes after this happened, it was after hours so I left a message....no response.If you love your child DO NOT buy this gate. Velco is not what I would call safe and secure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Made Comes Apart And Breaks","review":"Hi, I bought this gate about two months ago. First of all the knobs that you use to loosen and adjust the position of the gate can be loosened by a young child. Second of all, the top hinges that adjust the shape of the gate broke. The gate is now in three pieces. And third, the way the gate closes allows for fingers and toes to be pinched. I have put the gate out in my garage. It has no more use in my house since it is now broken and has very sharp edges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate but buy your own screws","review":"We converted our unused dining room into a play area for our 9 month old with this gate. It is easy to open and close one handed. Since it is not fully extended the mesh is not stretched taught so our little guy grabs it in his fists and uses it to pull himself up. He is a very active 22lbs and we have had no problems with the durability of this gate. He also loves to pull himself up and stand at the gate opening. We can still open and close the gate with him standing there without worrying that we will pinch his fingers. We are very happy with this purchase. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING YOUR OWN SCREWS TO MOUNT THIS GATE. My Dad is a contractor and installed it for us. He didn't even attempt using the screws that came with it since he knew they would strip and never hold. FYI - he used #8 2\\" stainless steel screws. This is the only reason I deducted a star from this review. Otherwise we are very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing gate ............","review":"We bought this gate to block off the expensive computer table and the IMac it carries. Works great. Best part is that the width of the panels can be easily adjusted. Also this is probably the only reasonably priced and sturdy panels with gate that we found on the internet. Great ease of use as well. A++++++++++++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon purchase - May 2010","review":"We used two of the panels to fit an opening 80\\" wide. The installation was easy and quick. We are using it to keep our dogs in the kitchen and away from the new furniture. The mesh siding does a great job of keeping the dog hair contained. The gate is a little inconvenient to close because you have to line up the top and bottom, but not difficult. My husband often steps or trips on the bottom of the gate opening, but it's held up just fine so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate!","review":"I love how this gate is very customizable and fits into any living space. I got this to help contain my puppy but unfortunately, he was tiny enough to run right through the gaps between the walls in this gate. I still give it 5 stars because it is a good sturdy gate, is versatile in size/shape and would be great for its intended use as a child gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"If it is installed on wall studs - no problems should occur. I can see though how easy it might be for older toddlers of 2,5-3 y.o. to open it. My child tries to open it even now and he is much younger than that. He can't open it because he can't reach it very well yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with gate!","review":"We needed someway to partition our 12 foot wide living room/dining room. This was perfect. The hardware is included and the product works very well.One problem: The gate does not latch well when the whole thing is pushed out (you'll see what I mean). This is not a huge issue.Keep in mind: Your cat will have to find a way OVER not through. Make sure you sink the wall hardware into wooden studs in the wall NOT JUST DRYWALL (despite what the instructions say) - the force your child will impart on the gate will exceed the integrity of your drywall!Overall we are very happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping issues....","review":"I will never order an item like this again as it came destroyed! They need to repackage items like this for shipping. It it the second and the last item of this type I will order online. The other was a bassinet and it also arrived broken with the box destroyed.

We have three of the old model, but this new model is cheap. The parts and bars are all smaller in diameter and bend and rattle and shake.They no longer fit with the old models. We are returning the 2 that we bought and looking for something else. I will never buy from this greedy company, Summer, again. Once again greed is overpowering the safety of our children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional and sturdy!","review":"I used this gate to close off the stairs for my sunken living room. I didn't think I would find a product that would fit my 12' wide stairs, but the gate fit perfecttly. It was easy to install and the best part is the fabric that makes up the fence part is soft, but sturdy. When my baby scales the gate and falls I don't have to worry about his face hitting metal bars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A short term item...","review":"We had this gate for almost a year before it broke beyond repair. The hardware that comes with the gate is not sturdy enough to mount it securely; my son has ripped it out of the wall a number of times. Luckily, he never caught on to the velcro panel, but he did realize it was easy to move. If you've got the gate on a wood floor the feet next to the door will slide very easily and the plastic joints will break. Today he finally managed to shake it enough to break the joints on both sides of the door, so we're off to look for another gate. On the plus side, the material panels are durable and never ripped despite repeated climbing attempts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product, does the job! Looks nice.","review":"A bit difficult to install, the guide for marking the placement of the screws was slightly off so we couldn't fit the feet on, but that's okay because we didn't actually need them. Looks nice, better than the white barred gates.I find it easy to open. I can do it one handed once you figure out how to do it. EASY TO CLEAN! We have the gate up to keep kids in our out of the kitchen. When eating lunch they tend to touch the gate with sticky messy hands but wipes off easily with a wet cloth.People often comment how nice the gate is. I love the neutral color. Happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits Large Opening but Cheaply Made","review":"This was the only gate on the market that I could find that would fit the 12 foot doorway between my livingroom and dining area. It stated easy to install but when the screws kept breaking off inside my new woodwork and I kept having to redrill holes I was a bit angry!!!! I suggest predrilling your holes!!! The hinges also won't stay on and the swinging gate doesn't line up. You need 2 hands to close the gate which as a busy mom of 5 children you don't always have 2 hands free! By the end of installing this gate it was about to be throw out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with the old version!","review":"We purchased a gate by Summer Infant about 3 years ago and liked it. So when we decided to buy another one to extend the old one we found out, that the new one is totally incompatible with the old one. Now we have to return it and lose a lot of money on the shipping since it's not sold ny Amazon and not qualifies for free returns. The new one is made of thinner tubes and looks like has a poorer quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby safety gate","review":"Baby gate is very nice quality.

I have them attached to walls at both ends right now but like that I can change that up as needed later on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold a 9mth old here....another velcro complaint!","review":"As many other people have complained, the Velcro design on the gate is ridiculous. Our 9 month old has it totally figured out and the gate is now worthless. We have only had the gate a month. We bought two and combined them to make a play area. The design for that was great....just the Velcro is inferior. I am going to try to hand sew the door on to see if we can save ourselves the $200 I wasted. It also doesn't matter which side the Velcro in on, the inside or outside...she just pushes on the mesh and the Velcro pops open. Don't buy this one!Edited: I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement with the Velcro sewn shut. It now works great. I would give it a 5 star now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello....Removable Velcro Door?","review":"This is junk!My 20 month old grabbed the top corner, pulled & ripped the whole cloth door OFF!

I'm so happy I did! We are using it to corner off a spot and it worked out great, we put the square puzzle foam floor under it to pad his falls. He loves it too! I would recommend this to everyone. Oh we did need to use longer screws to keep it in the wall..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Extended Gate System","review":"This gate works great to keep my 10 month old daughter in her play area. You need to get use to operating the door, especially when you only have one hand to do it with and need to get use to stepping over the bottom piece on the door because I tripped over it a couple of times. Otherwise, it really does the trick. We tried the gate that uses the compression but it did not hold very well and my daughter was actually able to push it over a couple of times. Needless to say it went back. I saw this extra wide gate on line and purchased it. We need the gate to extend an area of 10 feet. This fit very well and was easy for my husband to install. We are very grateful to have it. I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gate Ever!","review":"This gate is very sturdy and very easy to install. Longest gate I could find for under $100. Swinging door hinges at the top and bottom so there is no where for little fingers to get pinched. I've opened the door many times with my daughter hanging on it with no problems. I love this gate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent gate!","review":"We have been looking for a versatile gate for a long time, there are many products out there, but only this one was wide enough to fit across our living room. I have a 10 month old baby who crawl and fell alot. this gate uses a soft screen and does not hurt her when fell onto. The only issue is the door latch, which is a little hard to use. But it does not bother us. Each joint can be disconnected and or re-connected with another piece and be locked together."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best antidepressant!

I've never read such a load of garbage about Tibet in my life. I doubt if the guy has ever even been there. It is full of pseudo-esoteric mysticism of the worst kind and gives no valuavle information on what Tibet was like before the Chinese occupation. It is an insult to Tibet and the intelligence of anyone interested in Tibetan history and the plight of the Tibetan people today. Avoid like the plague and put the money towards buying something more worthwhile and informative on the subject. I had it one star because there was no way of indicating how bad this book really is. Amazon should come up for a symbol that denotes 'crap', or some other negative colloquialism."},{"rating":"2","title":"om records cranks out another one","review":"Om Lounge 4 is a giant step up from the 3rd in this series. Although not as complete as the 2nd, #4 is brings out more upbeat and worldly tempos. Where I found Om lounge 3 to be extremely mello and even boring, #4 keeps your attention consistantly throughout.J Boogie, People Under the Stairs, Jazmin and Face and many others contribute for a more authentic electro-lounge sound which was lacking on the 3rd. Deep bass loops, rhythmic drums and smoothed vocals make for a tight lounge aura on #4.For customers new to the Om Lounge series, I would recommend starting with #2 then move directly to #4, it's definitely worth a listen. This album is the perfect sound piece to sit back, chill, melt off the stress, and watch the autumn leaves change colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing compared to the other 3","review":"this is still loungey and all but it way too sappy to be as dope as the first three (especially 3). it still has it's moments but overall it's not what i was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"One lounge too many ..","review":"I'm sure alot of people like me have bought this CD because they've bought the other three in the series, after all it was a safe bet was'nt it ?

The Beats alone on this joint are so NICE!! I WISH I COULD BOOST(borrow,steal,etc.) THEM!! They would make some wicked hip-hop beats!! You see i dont only buy the artists, when i buy music i buy the production team and the label. If it's Om (buy it!!) if it's Compost (boost that #$@#) I love imports but they cost too much , but they can super hot or super \\"doo do\\" though.

At that time, I thought it was a good book but quite a tough read. Then when my personal circumstances changed, I began to question hospital birth. This book was invaluable in helping me switch to a birth center, ultimately experiencing a beautiful, gentle birth in water."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read","review":"I did find this book very informative. I feel like it made me think or ask questions about why we tend to trust doctors more than our own bodies. Don't get me wrong I think doctors know very much what they are talking about most the time. But it did make sence to me how the book talked about how a normal healthy pregnancy many times is rushed or sent in for a c-section all for the sake of time. There were a few biased oppinions in the book. And some sections seemed repetative ( this is the reason for the 4 ) But I think over all it was not a waist of time. And as I do with all information I recieve it was taken with a grain of salt. Additional advice: try checking it out at the library before you decide to buy it or not. Depending on your beliefs this may or may not be the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent information on natural options, beautiful photos.","review":"Gentle Birth Choices is a wonderful book to read whether you have already decided to birth naturally, or you are considering it. Even if you have decided to use medication, the material is so informative, it may be an educational experience for you. The information provided on birthing \\"myths\\" is extremely helpful to women given that all too often we are provided only one side of the story when dealing with the medical profession. The photographs are also so gorgeous. They show women birthing in all different settings. The photos show how birth can look when women trust nature and their bodies. I would recommend this book to all pregnant women so they can see that there are options to hospitals and medical procedures."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good choice","review":"This book is definitely biased toward natural, vaginal birthing. If that is fine for you than this is a great choice. I found it very informative. The author gave a history of childbirth and how it got to be so medicalized. Medical myths were also addressed. The succint pro's and con's of typical hospital interventions I found especially helpful. The differences between midwifes and other providers came in handy for me because I was contemplating ditching my OB for a midwife. Finally, they had in depth info on waterbirths, creating birth plans, choosing a provider and birthplace. Definitely worth reading. I did watch the video also. Besides it being a bit dated, it did show the gentle births that this book is all about. I think the video would have been more helpful if it showed more 1st stage labor. I was hoping to see more of how the women coped with labor pains then to just see second stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and Opinionated","review":"This book is very outdated and the opinion in it is very slanted.

The information provided throughout the book really empowered me as a woman. Its startling how much information this book holds. Our nation has successfully hid much of this under the rug, but for those who are willing to take an unbiased look, you may also be stunned. The facts that the author presents are thoroughly backed-up with statistics and numerous references. I encourage any woman to read this and then pass the book around to all your friends. This is what birth should be, was meant to be like- compared to what it has turned into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will appeal to many parents-to-be","review":"One of the best birth books available, with options ranging from hospital birth to waterbirth.

I highly recommend it for anyone planning a gentle and natural birth, but also for those who are not sure what they think about epidurals, induction, interventions, et cetera.

Ellie continues to be a protagonist of real dimensions beset by very real personal problems.

That's what the police want to know and so does Ellie. Since Ellie has a history of getting involved in things that she shouldn't, she is warned by the police to stay out of it. She of course doesn't listen, and this the book unfolds.

Hellmann does a great job with the Eastern European aspect of the story, where she touches on human trafficking and forced prostitution. The one problem I had was that Ellie Foreman, the main character, kept referring to some sort of nameless danger she got into in the past that, from what I gathered, had to do with her video editing career and the police. However, that was never clarified. Consequently, the character and aspects of the story felt incomplete."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mystery!!!","review":"Another disappointment... It's no fun reading a book when you know the outcome right away. A plot twist once in awhile would have helped. The characterization of Ellie was difficult to believe.

I know it's a joke, but is anybody laughing? Sonically, this album is similar to Stewart's previous releases, but the songs don't fit together well. There's no common thread. \\"Murmansk Run/Ellis Island,\\" one of Stewart's best historical narratives, is the highlight, but the rest is lacking. The goofy \\"Mondo Sinistro\\" still makes me wince. \\"Midnight Rocks\\" is pleasant enough, but unlike most of Stewart's other hits, it lacks depth. It's extremely repetitive and the lyrics have nothing to offer beyond vague cliches about romance. The first song, \\"Running Man,\\" is the perfect indicator of what's to come. The man in the song is running, but he has nowhere to go--the perfect metaphor for Stewart's songwriting here. If you're interested in Al Stewart, \\"24 Carrots\\" is not the place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's only death, why worry?","review":"A friend loaned me a copy of this book when I was doing some serious soul searching. It took me almost 6 months to work up the courage to read Mr. Palmer's book because I did not want to confront 'death' even by opening a book about the subject. When I finally did start reading it I found it hard to put down. Greg Palmer is alternately funny and somber, dealing deftly with each situation as he tries to understand what 'death' means. From his first experience with death, through the many people he encounters along the way, Mr. Palmer provides a much wider view of the world than we are used to. The book is a difficult journey, undertaken both with humor and great love. I recommend this book to anyone seeking an understanding of death and how it affects those left behind.Do not fear death, come to understand it, we only fear the things we do not know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and funny","review":"I'm a cultural anthropologist, and was compelled to pick this up when I saw it.

I have used Sandra's restaurant and hotel books for Paris, London and Italy. I was extremely happy with each and everyone of the books. Sandra provides detailed descriptions of the restaurants and hotels including the best rooms to stay in and exactly what to order. I am going to Paris for the 5th time and I am purchasing the revised Great Eats book (formally titled cheap eats). I would not go without the book. The book has helped us find restaurants that very few toursits frequent.

Too bad - it was perfect for my son's superhero room."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Definitions","review":"The editors' introductory essay does everything but define visual rhetorics. They define some major semiotic concepts from Roland Barthes and C.S. Peirce and, for some reason, the concept of intertextuality. But nowhere in the introduction, or in their own chapters, do they provide a definition for visual rhetorics.For that, the reader must skip to Chapter 3,\\"The Rhetoric of Visual Arguments\\" by J Anthony Blair. However, Blair has a very specific focus--argument--so his definition comes with its own limitations. The rest of the essays offer a decent sense of how to apply visual rhetoric, and Sonya K Foss in the final chapter also attempts a definition. Four stars for these essays.Two stars for the book as a whole. The editors ruined the chapters with their odd subheadings, and I just cannot get over their confusing writing in the introduction and their complete failure to fulfill the promise made in the title of the book. As a student with a limited budget, I feel totally misled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"This book made me want to take scissors and gouge my own eyes out for every reason imaginable.

Although these tires are relatively soft and light providing a good feel and roll on the road, they also have a built in tractor beam for debris. The soft tread picks up sharp objects which then progress through the tire during use. The lack of casing to the tire provides little resistance to punctures. What started as a small cut from a chard of glass, ended up as a gaping hole that allowed the tube to bubble out and deflate instantly. Averaging 1-2 punctures a week is not acceptable, so it's in the recycling bin for these.If your a weekend warrior and want a good feeling cheap tire - these are a good choice.

From their actions, to stupidity, to the annoying way that they talk, its all you can do to keep from gouging your eyes out.

The only other highly rated series i hate more is The Sword of Truth (books 2 to 4) because TG copies Robert Jordan, but back to Tad Williams. I though that for an epic fantasy series this book was lacking. 1600+ pages in 1 book that didn't have the proper ending that an epic should have - he didnt do anything cateclysmic (no doubt spelt wrong). Over all the series could have been better if it didnt die after 200 pages in The Dragonbone Chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so series (supposedly a trilogy)","review":"One thing that kind of irks me about this trilogy is it is really a four part book series. The first two books are fine; then you come to this one. If you notice at the bottom of the title, it says Part 1. Yes, there is a part two, and it is actually longer than this book. Talk about contrived, this book series is a beautiful example of people running off to various places with much ado about nothing (with apologies to Shakespeare). The author has a number of characters running around chasing down various things, much of which is useless in the context of the main plot. Simon, the main character, shares a lot of time with other characters, the princess, and Prince Joshua, amongst others. I'm afraid shallow is the main word that comes to my mind when I think of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green angel","review":"Was received in good shape. Was shipped wothin expected time.

I'm only a kid (With an advanced reading leval) and I loved it. It is a good book from kids of 12, to adult of 40. It is the best book someone can read if they want a fantisy, action book, but you must read the books in order, first; The Dragon Bone Chair, then, Stone Of Fairewell, and finaly To Green Angle Tower.

Staggering to carry, at a hefty 1083 pages in its hardcover edition. Staggering proportions: so many characters, so little characterization. So much \\"plot\\", so little origionality. So many pages, so little worth reading!!The trouble with this series is that Williams has overreached himself. This tries to take on too grand a scale, leaving us frustrated as we skip from subplot to subplot. The characters are like cardboard, with institutionalized reactions and unispired speech. The author is a good one, proved by his well-written TAILCHASER'S SONG, but he has bitten off more than he can chew here. Well I hope for more product from this worthwhile author, perhaps he can take to heart his words \\"The Bloated Epic\\" and \\"The Story That Ate My Life\\". Guess what? It ate ours, too!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flows as slow as frozen molasses","review":"I read it a while back.Book 2 was well written and built up the conflict. The names were as inspiring as those employed by Tolkein.To Green Angel Tower felt ponderous, meandering, and poorly paced. The chapters where Simon were tortured were more painful for the reader.

I would urge readers to read the first two works prior to the final volume. The simple actions and dialogue that appear in To Green Angel Tower are augmented by nearly 2000 pages of prior development; each page is a revelation to the reader, a progression that crackles with tension. To begin with this book would be overwhelming indeed. Start where the story starts--The Dragon Bone Chair, which you can buy right now at this site. Do not, however, begin here and ruin one the greatest potential literary experiences a reader could hope to encounter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best fantasy of all time","review":"Yes, I have read LOTR, but i consider this better than that overall, though nothing can compete with LOTR history. Memory Soorw and Thorn by Tad Williams is a masterpiece. It's world and the charecters that call it home are totally believable. Everything about the story speaks at so many levels that I know that I will reread this series many times. There is no way that I can explain the book in under a thousand words. He takes many stereotypes and completly breaks them. Without ruining the story, all i can say is that by the end, I felt sorry for the storm king. Also, there is a twist that occurs at the end of this book, that puts the previous pages in a new light. if you are a fan of epic fantasy, or personal conflict, this series covers both and so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ending of a great trilogy","review":"A Great ending to an important series by Tad Williams.

To this point, book two has been the better paced book, but I still enjoyed the story and look forward to getting in to part two.The part that irked me, and keep in mind it has no bearing on the rating I gave the book:I bought the Kindle version, and when I did I saw that book three was in two parts. In the gloom of an early morning I downloaded both at $9 a shot (which is overpriced as far as I'm concerned). Then I read the intro to part one and find out the book was split in two because of PRINTING restrictions. Um, hello, this is the electronic version. Shame on me for my inattentive purchase, and shame on the publisher for this scam.On top of getting stiffed by the publisher over the price, the Kindle version is chocked full of poor formatting that at times took me out of the book.Use the money on coffee and find the book at your local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good series","review":"My husband has read this whole series and really enjoyed them.

He writes in a beautiful, poetic style. As a narrator, he notices even the minute details and brings them to life with his writing. The problem for me is that with all this attention to detail and poetry, the story seems to get lost. I would have liked the plot to move more quickly. Mr. Fuentes does not seem to be in any hurry to tell the story or stay on track with the plot. A scene my divert into a long, lovely description of nothing much, and the reader and characters are left waiting for Mr. Fuentes to return to the narration of the plot. It is, as I stated, beautifully written, it is just not a style for which I care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Constitution Review","review":"We used this book in our homeschooling class to learn about the Constitution.

It explained the how's, why's, and who's of everything involved in the development of our Constitution. The book explained the Bill of Rights and listed the first 10 Amendments and what they mean to us. I think for a brief overview of our Constitution, for grades 4th to 7th, this book is ideal.

What I found most interesting about this book was the variety. You have (as is common in PKD's works)a man who is struggling with his (in this case)ex-wife. There are lots of psychological and thought-provoking passages, as well. Then there's humor, like the fact that the main character's ex-wife was a marriage counselor! And who can forget the Ganymedean slime mold? But what this book mostly concentrates on (in my opinion) are the Pares (Paranoids), Ob-Coms (Obsessive Compulsives), Skitzes (Schizophrenics), Polys (Polymorphic Schizophrenics), Heebs (Hebephrenics), Manses (Manics), and Deps (Depressed).

While it is refreshing to read a critique of American education that doesn't blame everything on the teachers, one must read this book as critically as Berliner and Biddle read the Bush administration report. Certainly, as an education grad. student, I found the idea that our government, by publishing A NATION AT RISK, falsified statistics, and, basically, made a flawed educational system seem disasterous. However, I feel it necessary to consider B & B's agenda--very liberal, and as another reviewer pointed out in discussing exchange rates and the per student expenditure of foreign countries, the pair may be as guilty of \\"shady statistics\\" as they accuse the authors of A NATION AT RISK.

The reader is bogged down with supposed statistics when no source for them is clearly listed, and meaningless graphs. The authors chose to rely on these statistics and their own rhetoric to present their argument. There were no direct personal observations that were in contrast to my direct observations with government schools at work, nor did I come across any interviews of teachers and school administrators. I have had candid conversations with both. My observations and conversations are a direct contradiction of this book's position. One does not need to be a right-wing conservative to be concerned about what is going on in our government schools.

Unfortunately, although this book is well researched, you get the uneasy feeling that Mr. McFeely is examining Ulysses Grant like a bug under a microscope. This is the classic example of an academic who lacks understanding of real life and as a result cannot grasp the dynamics of a man of action, as Ulysses Grant certainly was.Mr. McFeely also unquestioningly adopts the prejudices of prior historians without thinking for himself. As a result, an historian who DID think for himself, Frank Scaturro in President Grant Reconsidered, has rendered Mr. McFeely's book obsolete.

Like others, I went on to read Bruce Catton's books. Those, I can heartily recommend, as they provide the facts that make sense, given what Grant accomplished.

After straightening, I usually have flyaways and kinks. But after using Alterna, my hair was as smooth as baby hair. I've been using Alterna Caviar for several months now and I highly recommend this.

Probably the second edition of this book is just a replacement of the cover , and the content stays exactly as it was in 1960 when it was written, with some adjustments in the preface.Personally I find very interesting this book for the richness of the vocabulary it provides, however it doesn t correspond to the actual language, and so it doesn t meet the purpose for which one buys it. It is mostly for very advanced learners who want to understand and see in depth how this languages has changed in a couple of decades.

It gives very clear explanations about most of the points of Turkish Grammar without being too theoritical. It gives also some insights about the evolution of Turkish language in the 20th century.

I have found his work to be most helpful in my own quest to become (and much trickier, remain) present. Because Eckhart is completely present as he speaks one is drawn deep into the moment simply by paying attention. The content is simple and straightforward, there is not much fact or idea to get lost in. This is what makes Tolle a top-notch teacher. He is a rare gift as he is completely authentic.Why then only four stars? Well, I put the first cd into my computer (the only way I listen to them) and it sounded like he was talking in an echo chamber. I have the same lecture on videotape and the audio portion of that is fine. I suspect this has something to do with copy protection.

On the return portion of the 2nd trip the top strap broke (handling by US Airways). Because of the hard top, this trap is riveted whereas straps attached to the other part of the bag are sewn. The riveted area is a weak point since the rivet actually cuts portions of the strap, and in just 2 trips it has broken. Since this top strap is the one used to pull the bag while rolling it along on the wheels, having a torn strap effectively eliminate use of the wheels and you are left with a heavy bag full of heavy golf equipment to carry...not a good solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad purchase","review":"I completely agree with the comment regarding durability. Same thing happened to my T-10: the rivets attaching the top strap to the plastic top pulled out, after only one or two uses.

Milla learns compassion while Tal learns to call upon inner strengths that he never knew he had. Both Tal and Milla learn that all people are people regardless of where they were born and they learn that the only way to judge a person is as an individual rather than what group they are from. Garth Nix has written a great series that breaks the mold in several ways. Perhaps the most profound way is that he tears down traditional gender roles by having a compassionate male hero and an aggressive female hero. Today, boys have to learn that they are not weak just because they are not aggressive. Boys also have to learn that girls can be just as physically aggressive as boys. Girls have to learn that boys can be strong in many ways, not just physically and that girls can also be strong.Hats off to Mr. Nix for a very well done story.

Five other UK published books preceded this one. It's clear to say she followed Jackie Collins' roman à clef style to pen (yet again) a wonderful wicked page-turner herslef. PALM BEACH chronicles the ups and downs of two misfits yearning to find one another despite the odds. Typical stuff you might say, but what sets the novel apart from the many paint-by-the-numbers releases out there is in its unique approach of style. Booth uses a lyrical undertone while building a richer and craftier plot. Indeed, she works hard to create a variation on the same theme. Make no mistake, PALM BEACH is a beach read: you get all the stereotypical fluff expected, but with an added edge to it that makes the reading experience all the more worthwhile. No wonder it became an international bestseller.-----Martin Boucher"},{"rating":"2","title":"CONTROL MACHETE: EXCELENTE CD!!!!!!","review":"EN ESTA NUEVA PRODUCCION LOS MACHETES VIENEN A RETOMAR EL LUGAR QUE, PARECIA HABIAN PERDIDO, CON UNO DOS:BANDERA, CONTROL MACHETE NOS ENTREGA 13 TEMAS+ UN VCD, DE PRIMER NIVEL, NO SOLO INCUYE EXCELENTES PARTICIPACIONES MUSICALES, SINO UNA SERIE DE VIDEOS U JUEGO DE IMAGENES, QUE VIENE ACOMPANANDO CADA CANCION.

In one place it says that the aspect ratio is 1.77:1 and in another place it says it's 1.66:1. WHICH IS IT? As a projectionist I ran Marriage Italian Style when it came out in 1964 and my own recollection was that it was flat and hardmatted at 1.85:1. Since it was a long time ago I'll give them the benefit of the doubt (for ONE of the aspect ratios, however, WE ALL KNOW THAT IF IT'S BLU-RAY IT WON'T BE ANAMORPHIC.

While she is there, she gets caught up in an underground network of people out to destroy the world forever.Interesting imagery and descriptions of Baghdad, the Tigris, and Basrah which are kind of sad when you look at all the violence that has happened in that region since then (Iran/Iraq war, first gulf war, second gulf war).I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaky plotting, terrific atmosphere","review":"I first read this book several years ago and have subsequently revisited it many times, not so much for the story which is inconsistent at best, but for the great atmosphere. In her real life, Christie had traveled extensively in the Middle East with her archeologist husband Sir Max Mallowan and her knowledge of this region enables her to paint a fascinating portrait of Baghdad. She also successfully captures a real sense of evil that has to be defeated at all costs that makes the story gripping. But the actual plot is pretty implausible - world domination from some remote area of the world? I looked up my atlas and still couldn't identify which part of the world she meant! Also, isn't it a little unrealistic that an untrained Englishwoman could just blunder her way to success when skilled spies failed? Still, I would recommend the book just for its amazing ambience and not focus so much on the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your run-of-the-mill Agatha Christie...","review":"\\"They Came To Baghdad\\" is, to me, very different from the many Agatha Christie books that I've read. Different - yes, but bad? No! I'm not about to spoil the terrific, tension-mounting plot, but the mystery (all of her books are mysteries; this one is no different in that respect) involves spies, both good and bad, leakage, intrigue...no shocking murders in quiet English towns here, folks.Our leading lady is Victoria Jones, shorthand typist and incorrigible liar, her \\"fertile brain\\" is ever-ready for cooking up believable stories and she can twist \\"little indiarubber face\\" into a remarkable imitation of any person. It's refreshing that she's not pretty; so many heroines have that as well as wit and kindness! Her habit of telling lies draws her into an incredible web of adventure, romance (well, not really...) and danger. A worthy read for anyone that likes a good mystery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"For more than half of the book I wanted to throw it out the window. Sure it was good at the end, but the only reason I kept reading was because I had to read it for summer reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"...And who in the WORLD is Anna Scheele?!","review":"I thought this book was extremely entertaining (although I had a bit of trouble keeping up with all the twists and turns)and somewhat in the style of \\"Passenger to Frankfurt,\\" albeit not quite. Whereas \\"Passenger to Frankfurt\\" had the same basic theme of a someone with an oversize ego trying to rule the world, I'd say that Sir Stafford Nye is just a little more...stable than Victoria Jones, in whom I see just a hint of young Tuppence. \\"They came to Baghdad\\" also manages to be more lighthearted for just this reason. It also gives us a glimpse of the Middle East, and especially Iraq, before Saddam and friends. Anyway, read the book, and if you disagree with anything I said please don't tell anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read if you like light mysteries.","review":"This is an interesting story, entertaining to read. It is mildly exciting. I enjoyed the somewhat flawed heroine and the setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant spy yarn","review":"Most of the Agatha Christie stories I've read are murder mysteries. Someone gets killed early in the story and then the race is on to see if our heroes can gather the clues and unmask the villain.\\"They Came to Baghdad\\" is more like a James Bond spy thriller. Great events are happening. The reader knows a little but we're larger in the dark at first. Very few people are exactly as they seem. It is about a third of the way through the book before someone dies.This is a fun book. As always Agatha Christie does a great job building characters, providing enough clues that the reader knows some of what is going on, but we don't have the whole story so there is suspense on just what is going on and will the villains be unmasked.If you enjoy Agatha Christie and are willing to try something other than the typical murder mystery, give this book a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite","review":"Absolutely the most enjoyable AC novel I've ever read (and I've read almost all of them). It's got all the elements of an over-the-top spy novel, but with the flair for psychology and setting of Agatha Christie. It's great escapist entertainment, and the description of Baghdad as it once was (and probably never will be again) is not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and a Delight!","review":"While many Agatha Christie stalwarts would prefer Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot better, I found \\"They Came to Baghdad\\" to be entertaining and a delight! Combining murder mystery with all the unexpected twists of a spy novel, the story is remains grounded in the every-day character of Victoria Jones. Also, don't miss out on the mid-20th century depiction of the Arab lands. I highly recommend this novel to fans of Agatha Christie, or even fans of the TV show Alias (correlations between Victoria and Sydney abound)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Superficial","review":"This DVD is just an ABC news report.

This is true for the wealthy as well as the poor, however, the pleasures found differ greatly. This book is not about the poor, and readers with a socialist orientation may find it offensive.Amidst hiding from bombs and fleeing from peril, people celebrated, attended lavish festivities, sought comforts whenever possible. This is about a circle of wealthy and recognized families, European, not just German, from whose midst the would-be assassinator of Hitler sprang. Many of them were hunted by the Nazi regime. This diary of a Russian princess is interesting and spellbinding. It is a very different testimony of a war that left no one untouched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living History","review":"This is the best history book I have ever read. Exciting and almost too real, you are, indeed, there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Book","review":"Of many books I've read on this period, this one is the worst. It could be subtitled, \\"How I ate and partied my way thru WWII\\". Shallow reminiscences of a shallow aristocrat. I've never seen so much name dropping in one place. Only valid historical narrative is in the included editorial comments. The inferrence that the writer was involved in the July 44 plot to kill Hitler is a bunch of bull, she just casually met a few of those involved, having met them at one of her many many eating and partying affairs. Total waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for these Times","review":"With the events of the past few weeks fresh in our minds and the American military mobilizing as we speak, I wish more people would read this book. Although the book does deal with some larger themes, the most poignant part for me was the description of day to day life in a world at war. It's too easy to romanticize the hunger, struggle and fear from a distance. We need records such as these so that we don't forget about the indignity and squalor that war rains down on humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"bright","review":"A crisp and bright narrative about what WWII was like from the perspective of a young Russian lady living in Berlin.

This collection showcases Steve's more country oriented side, which really sells him short. \\"Why Goodbye\\" should be at the top of everyone's list of all-time favorite Steve Wariner songs, and I just don't understand why is has been virtually forgotten.

The clunky, tasteless, and hollow arrangements hide Cher's mediocre vocals. The concept of singing standards would have stood the test of time, if its handling just didn't sound so bad. The digital age has done nothing for this material. The collection contains a bunch of bonus tracks, some on CD for the first time. These alone, however, do not make this album worth the money or consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"The songs that got away.","review":"Cher is one of the great pop voices of the past four decades, but there were many career lows along the way, and this was one of them. She struggles valiantly through some of the most overblown arrangements of standards ever put down on vinyl, as if a great voice simply singing great songs wouldn't have been enough. The splendid \\"Way of Love\\" is tacked on to the end, but it's too little too late.

She hit on a few that worked back on her TV show, and there are hints of the right sound in some songs like \\"The Way of Love.\\" But to really sing the standards, you either have to invest your life in them, like a Rosemary Clooney, or -- like Linda Ronstadt -- study like a monk and train like a triathlete. Cher did none of the above in putting most of these disasterous recordings together. Add the tricked-up arrangements and you've got the worst collection of standards I've ever heard.

I listened to the tapes!!! I had a difficult time trying to determine whether Bellow was pulling our legs or whether he meant this work to be taken seriously. He mentions every person who wrote something that would fit into the \\"great books,\\" but never clarifies any meaningful concept that would be found in any of those works. Bellow had to be kidding us when he describes his sexual fantasies. These are the fantasies of a 50+ character who is supposed to be a great intellectual?? No wonder they have come up with Viagra!!! And what is all that stuff about communicating with spirits??? Is that supposed to be serious, as well. No -- Bellow was trying to do for novels what Stravinsky and Picasso did for music and painting.... One big put on!!! It must be!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but irritating in places!","review":"Based on his encounters with the brilliant but doomed poet Delmore Schwartz, Humbold's Gift is like much of Saul Bellow's novels in that it's well-written and flows nicely. However, what makes it different from earlier works like \\"The Adventures of Augie March\\" is that the narrator is such a drip - a man who squanders his good fortune on bad gambling tips and dubious concubines. Bellow's characterization of the narrator Charlie Citrine is almost too convincing. Citrine becomes absolutely insufferable at times, and this makes sometimes it difficult to continue reading without wanting to slam the book down in disgust instead of reading on.However, for those with a penchant for flawed personalities - and for fans of Delmore Schwartz, there is much here to entertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"holding the mirror, as 'twere, up to Nature...","review":"This is my first attempt at reading Bellow and I was distinctly underwhelmed at his writing style. It would be nice to round up all our contemporary novelists, sit them in a lecture hall, and explain to them in no uncertain terms that it takes more than Realism and Stream of Consciousness to make a good novel. In Bellow's case, he overdid both techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"cries out to be taught in a classroom","review":"I loved Bellow's two short novels, Dangling Man and Seize the Day; tightly packed, concentrated thrilling accounts of alienation. But while Humboldt's Gift begins as well, it quickly tapers off into a diffuse mass of self-indulgent, theory- dropping nonsense. I think Jame's Atlas's comment in the brand new bio of Bellow is very apt here, that Bellows, like many people from an impoverished, immigrant background, is trying too hard here to make up for the deficiencies of his youth. Detached readers have a legitimate complaint about Bellow's penchant for self-indulgence, which repeatedly pads a potentially excellent 200-pager into 300-plus page behemoth of tedium and name-dropping. A real shame, because Dangling Man and Seize the Day are American classics. The uncommitted reader may wish to start with those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Nonsense","review":"Charlie Citrine was such an incredibly tedious character that about three quarters of the way through the novel I just started skipping over his pseudo-philosophical detours. Like another reviewer mentioned, I often times would be unable to determine whether such deviations were written in a sardonic or serious tone. I came to really dislike Citrine's character by the end of the novel; sure, the guy has read a lot, but it doesn't seem like he's actually digested any of it. His thoughts and dialogue are nothing more than pretentious, name-dropping and theory-dropping gobbledygook. This man approaches problems both philosophical and practical without an ounce of logic or any attempt at coherence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Themes - A One of a Kind.","review":"Humbolt's Gift is a wonderful story about themes of individuality and creativity, American society in the 1940's and 50's, and about alienation. The characters are wild and eccentric. Charlie, Humbolt's hero, escapes the dominations of society through personal transcedence, but can he really? I ask. HG also brings up questions about how we are influenced by our mentors, and that sometimes we must go beyond their influence to become ourselves. I think the ending is a trick. You get the impression that Bellow wants us to think transcedence is the way, but also he puts some doubt in our minds about Charlie, can Charlie really transcend when he's filled with so much love for his fellow man. An interesting, thought provoking read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humboldt's Gift is a riot!","review":"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read. Charlie Citrine's many troubles involving friends hoodlums women and the meaning of life will appeal to readers who have realized that they were more or less idiots until about the age of 40. Even if you're still something of an idiot you'll like, and laugh at, this book. Humboldt's Gift proves that Great Literature can be fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef?","review":"Having read Mr. Sammler's Planet, I had high hopes for this novel.I pictured something loaded with insight and jewels of descriptions on every page. This book has scant few of these things and lots of name dropping, rambling unconvincing philosophy, and boring characters...(Where are all the wonderful characters in Sammler's Planet?).In short it is a dud and long. I especially liked the commentator who said realism and stream of thought do not automatically produce a good novel.Where's the beef?"},{"rating":"2","title":"no title","review":"What a read! and listen. I simultaneously read and listened to this book on tape. And that was a good way to get through it and appreciate it. Fabulous combination of James Joyce and Woody Allen. This book won the Pulitzer (1976) and that same year Bellow won the Nobel Prize. Surely Cantabile is one of the most marvelous characters in all literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addresses my own thoughts of death.","review":"This novel is a well-fitting companion to those who often nurture thoughts of the meaning of death, e.g., how our knowledge of its certainty affects our daily lives. Charles Citrine is displaced from normalcy at this point in his life and suffers greatly for it. His only excuse is that he spends his time musing over more \\"important\\" things than his personal life and finances. He is Humboldt's protege, but he never realizes the same greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the biggest over-rated bores in 20th c. American lit","review":"A warning to anyone thinking of buying this book: stiftle the urge, borrow it from a library, if you must. I agree with three out of seven reviewers here who have panned the book. This deserves the word \\"bloviated,\\" if it exists. Having spent some time this year reading some \\"classics\\" of 20th c. American lit, I can say this is the worst. A huge bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A brainy moron","review":"Charles Citrine is an author. The man isn't stupid. Yet, like other leading characters in Saul Bellow's books, he lives his life in a foolish way. He has the kind of friends who eliminate the need for enemies. If he had a dog it would bite him daily, and he'd feed it.The title character, Humboldt, is another writer, suffering from manic depression at a time when lithium wasn't widely prescribed. His gift to Citrine is a manuscript, and is left to Citrine after Humboldt's death. The manuscript turns out to be valuable, but I doubt that it will straighten out Citrine's life. He can be counted on to insure himself a complicated and unsatisfying life. It's frustrating to read about this intelligent dope."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great novels. I've read it 8 times. My favorite","review":"A novel as rich as this does not come around every year, or every century, for that matter. Do not deprive yourself of this great treat.Yes, there are many references, but Bellow is child of culture, and what can a writer write about except about his experience, the time he lives in, and the people and books that influenced him along the way? Bellow has great experiences to write about, and knows a great deal about the culture in which he grew up. Phenomenal amount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift Idea","review":"I bought this for my brother, and I can't wait to see the look on his face when he opens it up.

The best part of this VA1930wm ViewSonic monitor is the speaker at the bottom of the monitor. My kids love to play games and the speaker works great. best of all, my desktop computer is hidden under the desk, and the top of the desk is clutter free with no speakers sitting on the desk. Also, the monitor telescopes up and down very easily depending who's using it.

See the other reviews.2) Within less than a year it started to randomly stop during the brew process, almost as if it thought it was done. The unit almost became completely useless.3) The coffee maker tainted the coffee with the great taste of plastic. As a person that really likes a good cup of coffee, this might have been the worst offense. Of course a coffeemaker should at least work.4) The amount of steam that escaped seemed unusual.

This television proved the perfect solution. It presents a clear, clean picture (although the default settings are a bit on the dark side) and surprisingly-good sound from the speakers. The back of the TV features RCA, coaxial, S-video, and component connections, and while it is a bigger set (as direct-view flats are), it fit easily on the smaller stand I had for my previous television.

It is for those who socratize on the deep meaning of the mysterious. Maldonado's masterpiece is reminiscent of the themes expressed in the poetry of Pablo Neruda, Octavio Paz and Federico Garcia Lorca.

The book has a lot of information and the author definitely has a grasp on the subject but the way the book is written is very \\"meh\\". Most chapters simply consist of the author recounting or summarizing plots from various tv episodes with little else in the way of info. If you are looking for a book that is more history and behind the scenes oriented about sci-fi then pass on this. If you want a book that quickly spoils the plot of every sci-fi series but accurately summarizes entire seasons in a few chapters then this is your best bet.Also whatever typeface they used for the body copy of this book is horrendous.

MOON is perhaps a bit \\"older\\" than WEIRDSTONE, my Clare admitted to being scared by some of the things that happen to the children around whom the book spins, and there is a feeling that Garner is perhaps aiming more at early teens, but Clare was enthralled with the book at six and wanted to hear it again at eight & I suspect I will catch her reading it when she is twelve, and we will still be talking about it when we are both much much older."},{"rating":"1","title":"The moon of boring.","review":"The moon of gomrath was very boring to read and made us fall asleep.

There are two major drawbacks in my opinion -- first, as I said, the book is out of date since the many years of warfare in the region have had a profound effects on the peoples in this region. Second, the author devotes only one chapter to the numerous hill tribes. The book is geared toward state-level societies in the lowlands. At any rate, the reader will come away with a good general understanding of state-level societies in mainland Southeast Asia. It's a good starting point for further study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service, and timely delivery.","review":"The book was anxiously awaited and delivered even BEFORE the projected date!

As I said, I guess three years might be a reasonable lifespan for something like this, since it lives in an extremely humid environment (tiny bathroom with shower) and gets pushed and pulled on just about daily.

I ended up using a brass rivet to replace it, but it didn't match the others. Not long after, two more rivets failed. The brass frame around the mirrorbegan to discolor.

BUT the first night we put the cover on, it rained. the rain puddled in the middle of the cover, and the weight of the water warped the pool on one side. after we drained the pool, the pool went back to normal. but the whole reason we bought the pool cover was so that we wouldn't have to keep draining and filling the pool. so anyway, i don't think there's anything wrong with this particular pool cover. i'm just not sure a pool cover for an inflatable pool makes sense. i guess it could work if you found something to prop it up in the middle so that the water didn't puddle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassle!","review":"Purchased this pool cover for my oversized kiddie pool. This cover is such a hassle for 1 person, I find myself circling the pool constantly adjusting each corner over and over again. If it's a windy day it will take longer to put on properly. The string that you tie around the bottom of the cover loosens after a while and the cover sags and pulls away from the sides. For some reason I was expecting a cover that is similar to a shower cap, something with elastic on the bottom that I could easily pull over the pool and it would stay.

The new GameCom H2 Xbox Headset by Plantronics is a great step up from the original X-Box Live headset. First of all, it's more comfortable for the long hours spent playing your favorite X-Box Live games. Second, it eliminates outside noise which was a problem with the original Live headset.One thing you need to know about this headset is that it doesn't come with an adapter. The original adapter that came with X-Box Live works with this headset, so if you've used the older headset, you're ready to play.Overall, it's more comfortable and the sound is more clear, but you'll need the adapter to plug in and play.I hope this review helped the uncertain buyers out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Headset Presently Available","review":"This thing is comfortable for long periods of time and the sound is superb. I once upon a time had a Plantronics headset at the office that was virtually identical to this--same high quality. Since these are on sale relative to their original MSRP, they are a steal.For 360 players, you will want to track down a \\"converter\\" for the 360 controller. It's about a $10 item and is made by a company called Datel (I believe). Basically, it's an exact copy of the plug (with volume and mute controls) at the end of the factory 360 headset. Instead of the permanently attached cable, there is a jack into which you can plug the Halo2 headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great buy","review":"It's got it's good and bad's defintly jacked up in price though.

All the musicians can be picked-out in these songs, but there is no hot-dogging at all which makes for a very continuously airy atmosphere that's great for any activity;entertaining guests,on headphones at the fair,on the boombox at low sound while fishing on the lake,or most any other low-key personal event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a delicate neck, or a child...","review":"I bought this during the 70% off sale, and am NOT disappointed.

He was sent away to boarding school, but was kicked out, because he never turned any work in. I really enjoyed this book, because it showed what it would be like to have a VERY annoying brother, who is always making you angry. This book also showed what it's liek to be a \\"normal\\" teenager today, becasue it tells about her crushes, school problems, adn her friendships.

Whether it is family problems, such as your parents splitting up or your brother being a pain in the butt, or problems with your friends, such as worrying that they don't like you anymore. The three main characters, Rachel, Stephanie, and Allison all have one or more of these problems. Rachel, (the main character) is having problems with her brother, Charles. Stephanie's parents just split up and her mother is dating again. And Allison's mother has re-married and is pregnant with a second child. As you read this story you will laugh, and you may cry.

It's true -- it is not as good sounding as some others, such as Blonde or Bringing It All Back Home. Sometimes instruments aren't high up enough or are too high. Harmonica does sound shrill at times -- but we also must remember that his harp playing on this record is VERY high. He doesn't play shrill, but sometimes, especially if its a bit too high in the mix like this is, it will sound shrill at times. It's not horrendous, it just comes with the territory when you have an instrument playing notes this high.In summary, this is still a good buy. We must remember that the people who have the STRONGEST opinions against this album are more likely to pen a review than those who are on the fence about it. That's why these reviews may not be a fair representation of everyone's opinions. Still very enjoyable, I say go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing.......","review":"Props to Sony. After waiting 15+ years for a nicely (or even acceptable) remastered version of this exceptional album, we are treated to a John Wesley Harding with buried guitars & piano, an EXTREMELY shrill-sounding harmonica (NOT Bob's fault), and a truly inconsistent mix. I understand that this may have been a rushjob, that they had a deadline to meet for these SACDs, but then one has to realize that the've had YEARS to work on this title. Obviously Bob is a low priority. If there is no recall on this cd, I will never buy a Sony product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of a great album!","review":"Yes, the remastering is awful! On Dear Landlord the piano is way down and the drums much too in the foreground. Almost every song is the opposite of what it should be. This is really sad because this is my favorite Dylan album. The drums are often too loud, and the guitar (some of Dylan's finest playing) are dwarfed. Wicked Messenger is in shambles. The harmonica is still not sounding the way it should. The original cd release is also awful but better than this failed attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Sounding SACD Remaster","review":"I don't think this has been remixed at all.

You can find the picture of the actual GameCom X10 buy going to the amazon search engine and putting in \\"Xbox 360 Over Ear Headset\\". It's not bad at first however there are two main problems. One is the part that sits on your head is square. I don't know why they thought it would be a good idea to go with square instead of round like the shape of the human head. Two is that it won't last more than 6 months after you purchase it.

Sad to say, this is one of the worst albums I have heard in a long time. Pretentious and elitist, Murphy sings in a voice that is pure affectation -- he sounds like someone's parody of a lounge singer doing folk songs. He tries to hide his sophomoric, awkward songwriting behind cheap references to Ives, Foster, and Poe, but it all sounds like so much namedropping. Willoughby is smug and charmless, it's singer a smarmy, self-proclaimed genius. Avoid this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Circle of Stones","review":"It was not the book I wanted, but I read and enjoyed it anyway. I wanted another book of the same title.

I wanted Circle of Stones, A Sacred Journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well researched historical account","review":"Readers may or may not like this book depending on their interest in Welsh history. I personally found it an interesting account, from a woman's point of view, of the society of that time period with emphasis on the Welsh princes. It was the way things were, when people in power took what they wanted, and women did not have a lot to say about running things. It branches off at the end, with the main character escaping from Wales (to lead into another book). As my descent comes down via the people who stayed behind, it is doubtful I would be interested in the sequel. I found this book to be a good, well researched account, but it might be slow going for someone just interested in reading a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it","review":"I had such high hopes for this book-well researched? I think not. Not that I paid much attention, since the story was so choppy, it left me wondering where the editor was, and the characters so typical and unimaginative-I didn't care what happened to them. I couldn't finish it, and just scanned the end to see how he discovered America. The quotes at the beginning of the chapters were the best part-just read those and you've got a better story.

I was appalled at some of the reviews given by other people. They must not have grasped the concept of the novel. Steinbeck's purpose was not to criticize or complain, but to inform by creating a fictional family in a real-life scenario from the past. He uses detailed diction, colloquialism, and an extended syntax full of methaphors to add vivacity and keep the reader interested! This is a great novel and an important lesson about the past for people in society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan Baker Brings Grapes of Wrath to Life","review":"I can't say enough about Dylan Baker's reading of this extraordinary book.

Its depiction of suffering and the (sometimes losing) battle against adversity is something which should always be remembered in a country which likes to highlight that its \\"American Dream\\" is open to all. It is important not to forget what happened to real people in the past - how can we improve the present if we don't learn our lessons from the past?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that will change your attitude towards life","review":"I was assigned this book in English to write an essay on, and I saw the length and was a bit dismayed to see the least. But, as I read through it the plot developed into something a reader can appreciate and understand. Steinbeck's small 'metaphorical' chapters (that occur seemingly in every other chapter) enhance the message of the book. When I finished this novel 600 or so pages later, I realized my attitude towards life had changed. You come out for better or worse, a little different after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"summer reading","review":"The only thing I can say about the purchase that was somewhat negative, was not realizing that the year of print was different from the copy we had taken out from the library.

But just when I thought I had reached rock bottom, the ending gave meaning and even satisfaction like no other book has ever done.Truly a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I enjoyed this book, but I read East of Eden right after and found it to be the better of the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comments from an illustrious dumbass.","review":"When you reach page 300 of a book and it's still boring, STOP.

The plot is switched around so many times it is confusing, the some of the characters were given way too many names, and I couldn't tell what character was being talked about half the time. Most of the book is entirely pointless and the important part of the story is about ten pages long. The plot of the story is boring, and the story its self is ended in a very confusing manner. If you don't believe me, you can read the book, which you probably won't finish anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're in for a long read.","review":"Since I am seriously considering becoming an English teacher, I decided that I should get a head start on things and read as many classics as I possibly could last summer. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" happened to be the most difficult one to get through. The story line is quite boring and seems very pointless at times. The book does, however, redeem itself slightly when it is not focusing on the main story line. John Steinbeck writes about the Great Depression from other character's points of view other than the main family the story is focused upon, and he gives some profound insights of his own on this time period every third chapter as well. I would seriously suggest skipping the chapters which contains the main story line, and read the others instead. It would be much more worth your time and sanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest piece of propaganda ever","review":"I wouldn't even give this book 1 star. IT was horrible. IT was boring.

I am eighteen years old, and I read THE GRAPES OF WRATH \\"for fun\\" (in other words, it was not a school assignment) in high school. I did not like it. Does that make me an \\"immature\\" reader? I don't think so! Contrary to what you seem to think about those who hate TGoW, I do enjoy \\"serious\\" books (The Good Earth; The Butcher Boy; Animal Farm; 1984; those not serious enough for you?) You would do better to stop making such outrageous presumptuous remarks based on a teenager's taste in books. Obviously, you cannot be much more mature than the readers you criticize, if you cannot handle a difference in taste. I personally love Lord of the Flies, for instance, but I understand that there are those who do not.

I won't be doing this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The American Epic","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is one of those intimidating \\"great books\\" that everyone knows about and no one reads. The irony is that it is a book about ordinary people, and the language and plot are hardly difficult at all. The Joads, driven off their Oklahoma farm by the encroachment of industrialization, seek a better life in California - with thousands of others in the same position. The migrants are forced to compete for survival, but only by leveraging their power as a group can they ever truly triumph. The theme of individual vs. group is further emphasized by the form of the novel. Steinbeck uses alternating chapters about the Joads and \\"interchapters\\" about the migrants as a whole. Thus the book, besides being the great American epic about the Joads, is also a social and political novel that caused an enormous uproar upon its publication. This is a book that is part of the collective American conscious and should be read by everyone who wants to feel thoroughly educated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, thought -provoking book","review":"Before I read this book, I was told that it is a slow and boring read due to not having much action. Well, the action part may be true (depends on what you consider to be \\"action\\"), but the boring part is definitely not the case. I literally couldn't put this book down. In a nutshell, it tells the story of a depression era family that is driven from their family farm and describes the hopefullnes and heartache that entails their journey across the country to California in search for work. I realized the degree of struggle of which we today do not, and could not, understand, yet it was so real to those living just a couple of generations earlier. If you stick with this book and give it a chance it will definitely prove to make you think. If you're pondering whether or not to buy it...I say what are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of all time!","review":"Wonderfully written...powerfully gripping...100% the best of Steinbeck. I have only recently started reading the \\"classics\\" and this was the best by far. After finishing \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and now reading \\"East of Eden,\\" I have to say that Steinbeck is arguably the best American lit writer ever published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are the Grapes of Wrath Still Edible?","review":"This classic still gets it done.

It truly sits equal with Twain. The praise of the government camps seems a little erky now, but just remember it's a symbol for government action. The inner chapters have an almost Jazz like quality. So innovative."},{"rating":"2","title":"High School Freshman enjoys a Steinbeck Classic","review":"When asked to find a book for a book project for freshman reading, I took the advice of my friend to choose the Grapes of Wrath. Because the only Steinbeck background I had was The Pearl, I did not understand the intercallary chapters and its allegorical themes. I eventually crammed the last 200 pages of the Joads' journey the night before our books had to be finished. After I recieved a C- on my book write-up, I was deeply saddened because I had worked very hard to understand the themes of struggle, love, and hope. Even though I recieved that C-, I feel I have learned a lot about human life and struggle from the simple plot of The Grapes of Wrath. This book is full of everything that makes a book a classic. I recommended to everyone of all ages even a person is too young to understand the symbolism and the allegorical themes. But in the end after a long struggle, my C- can be linked to the end of The Grapes of Wrath. Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"this book is the best book ive ever read in my life.. it deals with the family the joads who are kicked off their land and are looking for a better life for themselves.. let me tell you this book will keep you reading page after page and might even make you shed a tear every once in a while"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just a book, a death trap!!!!","review":"Pee, u.

John Steinbeck was a well-known leftist. So what? So was Victor Hugo, but Hugo was a bonafide romantic writer. Steinbeck couldn't even devise a plot, aside from the weary, disconnected journey of a destitute family.Aside from its nauseating politics, the entire novel is filled with filthy characters doing nothing in particular save a near-constant whining about their sorry \\"fate.\\" And the end is so unspeakably stomach-turning that any virtues _Grapes_ might have had are dashed for a cheap gross-out.Save your minds and stomachs. Read Hugo instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh... barf","review":"This book was 600 pages written purly about a bunch of hicks from Oklahoma starving.

The Grapes of Wrath might of had a powerful message but there were many things about it I didn't like. I have often heard The Grapes of Wrath called an analogy with Christ's life and the preacher portrayed as Christ. I think this is a ludacris analogy because the preacher was an immoral hypocrite. The sexual content and such took away the power of the message that Steinbeck was attempting to convey to his readers. So while The Grapes of Wrath is considered a classic I would personally choose to never pick it up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Great Depression","review":"A brilliant look at the Great Depression and how it effected people. Steinbeck was one of the great American writers and this was likely his most important work. The book will educate you and also make you feel for the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This book is the story of the Joad family, a family that has been forced off of their land in Oklahoma during the 1930's. Like hundreds of thousands of others, they decide to migrate to California where work supposedly is. Throughout their tale they face prejudice, hatred, and injustice. But, through these trials, they learn the imporatnce of family and strength in unity. The structure of the story is amazing and a sure bet for a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"the voice of the common man","review":"I have to admit that I probably never would have read this book if it hadn't been a reading assignment from one of my first American Literature classes. But since taking that class I have always been very grateful that I was assigned this reading assignment as it has been life altering. Steinbeck is probably my favorite of all of the classical american literature writers. He speaks the voice of the common man and ultimately shows that humanity and dignity are not limited by social class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical novel","review":"I finally got around to reading this classic tale of migrant workers during the Great Depression and I am so glad I made the effort. Lots of history here and a good explanation of the rise of the collective labor movement. I did study some of this in my school days and I would have enjoyed having the benefit of reading this relevant work back then. Steinbeck's portrait of the Joad family brings all of this much closer to home and some of the stories (most notably the chapter describing the roadside diner)are really terrific. It is not a quick read but it does stay with you. A great investment of your time to better understand major issues still confronting our country today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The People You CAN Always Trust","review":"While Steinbeck's masterwork fit more perfectly into the era of recovery from the Great Depression, it addresses human interrelations in a most timeless fashion. Those of us who have discovered what it means to lose all (or nearly all) of our tangible possessions, as the Joads did, grasp a deeper meaner of life. The Joads demonstrate greater respect for fellow humans than for the clothes on their backs.Steinbeck also provides an eloquent look at those who clawed their way to retain tangible wealth. These people wanted no part of sharing with folks in desperate need and Steinbeck demonstrates this through both the path of the Joads from Oklahoma to California as well as more general looks at the circumstances of the dustbowl's victims."},{"rating":"2","title":"the recipe for an american dream","review":"Take one recently released criminal, an old man who dreams of bathing in grape juice, a nave and pregnant young newlywed, and add them to a bowl of thousands of recently misplaced workers, and you have the award-winning recipe for the greatest American classic, The Grapes of Wrath. With alternating chapters stuffed full of symbolism and spice, Steinbeck captures the picture perfect photo of Americans struggling through the Dustbowl. Not only does the dialogue fill your hunger for personality, it creates a bond between the reader and the characters. Closing the pages of this book is like turning away from a family member. If you're looking for a novel with inspiration hidden between the lines, pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have a short attention span: Forget it.....","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is unquestionably one of the greatest novels ever written, however, from reading some of the negatives reviews of this book I have come to the following conclusion: ANyone with a short-attention span, or who has grown up in front of the television, or who thinks that John Grisham is a masterful writer should avoid this book. This is a novel for mature readers who enjoy books which don't have excessive violence, or mindless action on every page. Many high school kids are clearly not mature enough to appreciate a book such as The Grapes of Wrath. Perhaps their teachers should let them stick with works that are better suited to their maturity level, such as comic books...."},{"rating":"2","title":"So excellent, deserves 6 stars","review":"I think the reason why I love this book is because 60 years after it was written, it still has a place in our society. While some books come and go, this one remains. Replace the \\"Okies\\" with Mexican immigrants, and you have todays society. This book is excellent and shows us a side of America we may not like, but need to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle price is unbelievable!","review":"I would like to get this book for the kindle but I cannot bring myself to pay 50% more for the Kindle edition versus the physical book.Hopefully these publishers will wake up and realize that they can sell an E-book at a lower sticker price than the dead tree version and still make plenty of profit. If they are not careful these publishers are going to price themselves out of business!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but disappointing ending","review":"I enjoyed this book up until the last few chapters. The death of the baby and nursing of the sick man was just too much for me. It was too melodramatic and overdone. Up until the disappointing and forced ending I relished in the descriptions of the drive across the country to California during the Depression and life in the migrant farms."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever written","review":"In 9th grade, they made us read \\"The Pearl,\\" by Steinbeck and I swore I'd never read another book by him. I had to read this one for a college history class and came away with a whole new attitude for Steinbeck. Since then I've read several of his other books and he has turned out to be one of my favorite authors.The story follows the Joad family from Oklahoma to California during the Great Depression. They lost their farm to dust storms and greedy bankers and were forced to go somewhere else to try to earn a living.This book has been banned by school boards for years, and I recently read that the reason for this is that the bankers who serve on the boards don't like the way bankers are portrayed in the book.It's a great book and an accurate look at one of the worst eras in American history. If you like the book, the movie is also worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book comes alive","review":"Dylan Baker's extraordinary reading of Grapes of Wrath is amazing!

This is one of Steinbeck's worst books, and i hope no more high school classes will be forced to read this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Student's view","review":"I thought that this book moved very slowly. It was also very hard to get in to. After I figured out how the Steinbeck was writing the novel, it became a bit easier. I thought that the Joad chapters were too long and could have been broken down to read easier. As a lover of historical/fiction, I thought this was a bad book because, although it portrayed an accurate storyline, it was just not written well. I would not suggest this book to anyone who does not have to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put...extremely awful","review":"I am a Junior in High School and am instinctually drawn to literature. This novel was a required reading, but that didn't spoil the story for me. The story did that itself. I have never been so bored in my life. Honestly, I'm astounded to find that so many people \\"loved\\" this book. While the story did have a great moral to go along with it, it was about dirt! Dirt and migrating. Dirt and migrating and more dirt. I couldn't even sit down to read it for more than 15 minutes before dozing off. What an awful summer read. I even think I chucked it out the balcony once. But please, decide for yourself. Opinions on literature are very diverse, so make your own, and make sure not to operate heavy machinery while reading this one.

A school can only torture you once."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked-literaly","review":"Steinbeck's descrptions are good, but after seeing them in every other chapter, they get really old. He must be stupid to think that we don't know about what's going on during the trip to Oklahoma.

It's just totally unreal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree, but...","review":"I was forced to read this novel for freshman English, and although in general I think it had an important message and theme, but, man, was it ever boring! I really liked certain passages and the theme, but much of it was told in such an obtuse way and focused on such minute details that I could hardly stand it. I've read books on genetics, i.e. no plot, no characters, that held my attention far better and used words more economically than The Grapes of Wrath. Perhaps if the novel had ended 400 pages or so before it actually did, I could have stomached it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I believe that The Grapes of Wrath way over rated.","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is 619 pages of complete boredom. I am reading this over the summer for my 10th grade English class that I soon will be attending on an everyday basis once school starts. In my opinion this book is too wordy and boring. They could take this 619 page book and cut it down to about 150 pages if they wanted to. I believe that no high school student should suffer the extreme pain and boredom of reading this book. My advice to any high school student who has to read this book is get it on audio tape and fast forward through most of it you wont miss much, only a bunch of useless dialogue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Condition rating not accurate","review":"No problems with the book - great story.My issue is with the description of the condition of my copy which was purchased as a used book - this was listed as \\"Very Good\\" condition - which to me means some minor creasing on the spine and maybe a couple of minor marks on the pages.

There were so many typos that I had to quit after slogging through five chapters. I'm usually a fast reader, but this was miserable! Amazon was understanding and refunded my purchase price, so I plan to reorder the book in the larger file size. Steinbeck is a great writer and I really love the convenience of my Kindle. I only post a critical review to spare other newbies the bother of downloading the \\"bargain\\" edition.

It's interesting to see how the people of the Great Depresion lived through things. John Steinbeck is a great author and I think he deserved the nobel prize. After reading this book of his, I'm also going to read 'Of Mice and Men' and 'East of Eden'. I'm sure they'll be as wonderful as 'The Grapes of Wrath'. This is probably my favorite Pulitzer, read it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"American classic","review":"This story truly captures the Depression Era. My grandparents grew up during the Depression and I heard many stories about that time in their life. Ironically, my grandmother read this book and did not like it because of the language. Steinbeck's writing could be a little gritty, but I thought that it gave the story some character. The end is truly a shocker and I will never forget it for the rest of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mighty Piece of Literature","review":"Quite simply, The Grapes of Wrath is THE Great American Novel.This is the powerful story of the Joad family, \\"Okies\\" who are forced from their bank-foreclosed farm during the depression.John Steinbeck's writing is sheer literary art. There is beautiful description, incredibly realistic dialogue, and a compelling story that captures the heart and seeks out the very core of one's conscious. And the beauty of it is that it's thoroughly understandable. The eloquent writing and flawless story can be savored by anyone from a junior high school student to a PhD.The book is also innovative, intertwining short chapters that capture the plight of the dispossessed with longer chapters that follow the long road traveled by the Joad family to California. This is accomplished without at all disrupting the flow of the story.No wonder that this book won the Pulitzer Prize and was the key work cited for Mr. Steinbeck's Nobel Prize.It's a mighty piece of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best","review":"Some books are better read, and some are better heard. The poetry of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath takes on even greater depth with the Okie dialect of Dylan Baker. This is probably the greatest American novel of the last century. Despite the condescending attitude of academics, this book lets us all in on our own history. Steinbeck doesn't tell us who we are, he shows us who we are by showing us what we have been. As Samuel Clemens dug up our essence in the disease of slavery, Steinbeck confronts us with the violence of our economic system. Also like Clemens, he shows how religion tends to compound injustices. But what makes this a truly great novel is that all this understanding of the world and how it works is communicated by the lives of characters so real and complex that they have become part of our personal history. We experience the depths of our own emotions and capacity to love. The final scene is perhaps the most powerful depiction of human love in all of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"After the first few chapters...","review":"The first 16 pages of this novel really knows how to put a person to sleep. If you are in to analyzing characters in text to Biblical figures (aka Jesus Christ) then you'll like the preacher J. Casey. From their journey until they arrive in California is fairly accurate in giving you a description of what the life was like for these displaced farmers. You can see the developement of Ma Joad as she takes center stage in the family. As for the ending, it was rather odd how Rose of Sharon gave of herself after showing such selfishness and wistful dreaming. Overall, a very good piece of American Literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks","review":"Fine quality. This book is part of my required reading for my class. The book came on time.

This is an edited version for ages 9-12","review":"Re This edition onlyThe Grapes of Wrath (Pacemaker Classics)I ordered this copy of the Grapes of Wrath thinking that it was the paperback edition with full text and criticism with a different binding. Should I have paid more attention to the note I discovered after the fact that the \\"Search Inside\\" referred to another edition of the novel? Yes. Should Amazon have marked the photo of the book cover with something akin to a scarlet letter like \\"A\\" for abridged? Yes. The words \\"Abridged\\" and \\"For ages 9-12\\" appearing prominently in the first line of the description would have stopped me in my tracks. The reviews and \\"Search Inside\\" for abridged books should not link to unabridged editions of the same work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Lessons","review":"I read this book when I was a Junior in High School. I didn't liek the book at first, and it was hard to get into, but once I really started reading it, I found myself wanting to read more and more. This book has some great underlying lessons. The family in this book had a really hard time with life during the depression. But even during the hardest of times, they stuck together as a family and worked out what they were going through. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a perfect blend of drama, history, and emotions","review":"This book is an amazing piece of literature which has made millions of people both think about and discuss this book, as you can see on this webpage. All those who gave this book under a four-star rating do not truly understand good literature and should stick to \\"The Baby-Sitter's Club\\" series."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best book I've read up to now","review":"Steinbeck made a living description of the live of Joad. I like some characters he created such as Tom Joad, Ma, and Casy(the preacher). I love some coversation concerning religion like Casy's self-confession. Also, when uncle John asked Casy if he was sinful or not, Casy said that a man had no right to tell another man what should do and what should not do. He also mentioned that one should not tell his sin to others so that he himself could feel better. Since I myself was in similar situation, I know better what I should do now.Now when I saw beggers and immigrants in my city, I start wondering if they led a similar life as the Joad did. I start sympathizing them. While before, I didn't like them, thinking them rude and civilisation-distroying people. Now I think everyone is equal to have a right to live better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"although I am a student, I was not required to read this book over the summer. It was very long, but I couldn't put it down.

Was satisfied with purchase and would use Amazon/Mass Market Books again in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must Read of All Time","review":"I can not praise this book enough. It is excellent through and through. I know this is a book that is commonly read in high school. Since I did not read when I was young I deprived my self of some great reading. The begining I thought was slow, until the story hits the road, then I start to really feel their plight. My father had worked in real life in a apple cannery in California for a short time, he always said the \\"Okies\\" were some of the nicest most generous people you would ever want to meet. It is certainly ironic to read a book about oppression and discrimination by white people and to see that it is the same race of people who treat them as animals. That tells me that racism is much deeper than the color of your skin. If everybody read this, perhaps people would be more tolerent and compasionate, I know this is how the book made me feel. The end is tragic but so were the lives of many of these real Americans who were displaced by the Dustbowl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I enjoyed reading this book but was disappointed in the ending. It had to end at some point I guess. After watching the documentary aired on PBS that this novel was based on, I was just hungry for more of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 92 year old mother rated this!","review":"My mother is 92 years young.

It involves the main character of the story, Tom Joad, leaving prison and going back home to his family's house in Oklahoma, when he finds out they've left because of the dust bowl. When he catches up with them, they're packing up to go to California. A lot of the book is about them going to California, and them trying to settle down. Some of the chapters in the book are symbolic, and represent Steinbeck's leftist ideals. A lot of the people here seem to give the book a 1 star review because they can't appreciate the symbolic meaning of the turtle, and of other things.If you're intelligent enough to grasp the concept of symbols, you will definitely like this book.And yes, there is a lot of cussing in here. And know what? They're just words. Calm down.One last thing. The ending of the book is really, really shocking. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Writing","review":"While I do not share John Steinbeck's view of the world (politics), I do think he is an excellent writer. I don't see how anyone can not be drawn to the characters in this book. The ability of Steinbeck to paint a picture with words is almost unmatched. I think this book is a must-read, a must-read indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book, but Tedious read!!","review":"I have to disagree with most of the reviews on this page. The book is no great American novel but it is not piece of sh*t either. I had to read this book for my 11th grade AP English class and in general I like the book. It has strong themes, great characters and lots of symbolism. The Grapes of Wrath is more important as a political work that gives an overview of the Great Depression than as a literary one. The details do get very tedious. I had to read some chapters twice because I kept forgeting who the characters were. Once the Joads start their journey all the characters tend to blend together, especially the male characters. Steinbeck also tried to throw a few to many symbols in. It got so bad that I got a headache trying to find the deeper meaning in Tom using his own urine to heal a cut. In the end though all you can do is get through it. I doubt very much theres an American highschool student who hasn't read this book>"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enthralling masterpiece of epic scope, truly American!","review":"The Grapes of Wrath may be too cumbersome for some readers who demand more action and suspense, but if carefully read, you can't help soaking in the concatinations of themes. Steinbeck exploits the journey and growth themes to their full potential in the story of the Joads' trip to the promised land and the tribulations they face. Life and Death have never been painted so blatantly and thoroughly in modern literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not about literature, it's about life...","review":"This book should not be required reading for anyone. It should be sought out by those ready to enrich themselves, and those who want to 'feel' what it is like to be out of society's main stream. I would also recommend Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" for those wishing to understand how people on the other side of life's river view the world. We, the people, are the heros in both these novels, and my life has been enriched by having heard these stories. I highly recommend these books as valuable assets to our collective compassion and the individual spirit. There is plenty of room for both, and we can afford to lose neither... BTW - both are available on Audio for those who commute."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"There are authors who cojure wonderful plots, but lack the writing skills to tell it well, and there are authors who can grab you with their writing and need pay very little attention to plot. Steinbeck has created a vivid portrait combining both breath-taking and rough lyricism and a wonderful plot to create a master-piece of American fiction. With this book, Steinbeck has single handedly described what life was for \\"Okies\\" and has left no detail left out. For a seventeen year-old to be saying this about THE GRAPES OF WRATH, you know it must be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'll stick with michael crichton","review":"Unfortunately i had to read this book for my american literature class. it went on and on and on about absolutely nothing!yes mr. steinbeck is very descriptive, by he goes completely overboard in almost every chapter. i mean, does it really take a whole chapter to describe a turtle! as for the characters i thought that they were all dumb and unsympathetic. and he wrote them with such a strong dialect that i had to re-read most of it just to understand what they were saying. there was nothing that kept me interested in it or even made me want to finish it. i could have cared less if they bought their \\"littl' white house\\" in California. my advice to other people in my situation: buy the cliff notes. the only people i would recommend this book to is insomniacs, it is better than any sleeping pill on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"Simply put: I didn't like this book. There was too much description and too little plot. The characters were not appealing to me at all and I couldn't get into the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"I read this book for a report and found it really dull. I felt like it dragged on forever and ever. Yet, this is only my opinoin NOW. I'll probably reread it in a couple of years and like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grapes of Wrath, a great masterpiece?","review":"This book was rather long and boring then adventerous and fun. I have read many books written by John Steinbeck such as: The Red Pony, Of Mice and Men and etc. If you want to read this book then go ahead but I would rather recommend Of Mice and Men or The Red Pony."},{"rating":"2","title":"History critic","review":"The historical part of this book is very disturbing. Things like the bulldozer going across the open plains plowing everything under was very difficult to understand from the point of view of the individual families, but from the banks view it was the only way to turn a profit or break even in the hard financial times of the Great Depression. The author also puts in the small things that add a sense of verisimilitude to the story, examples like the prices of the fruit and cotton, and the wages the pickers got for their work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot, but not entirely developed","review":"I am also a teen who had to read this book for high school summer reading, and I entirely disagree with the statement of teens not being able to read \\"mature\\" books. I think George Orwell was a great writer (1984 especially), To Kill a Mockingbird was excellent, and I absolutely loved Les Mis, just to name a few. This book definetley has an interesting background plot, and the writing style is very good, but like another reviewer commented, it seems half-finished. Almost like Steinbeck got the idea in his head and then half-way through developed writer's block. It was a pretty good story, but it just didn't have that deeper kick to pull me in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you love to swear, too?","review":"So, I'm only on page 478 of 619, but I've been disgusted at the amount of profanity. So far I've found more than 500 uses of profanity! On average every page (with relatively big writing, even) has more than one swear. Yikes!I'm never going to read Grapes of Wrath again, and won't be recommending it to anyone.If you don't like profanity, be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story, never ending.","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a tremendous story, set in the depression of the 1930's. Whilst a great book, it is not an easy read by any means. The dialogue of the characters is embedded in local accented English, where words are shortened and abbreviated with apostrophes.The Joad family's struggles as they are cast out from their home and search for a better future in California is heartbreaking, as they are just a small, insignificant dot amongst the hundreds of thousands of other souls trying to do the same thing. Be prepared to suffer with them, as you are drawn inexorably into their world.If I have one complaint about the book, is that it is never fully resolved. Then again, it never can be, as to do so would take many books. So, as a result, the book concludes at the end of an episode in their lives, so it is left, in my opinion, incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sour Grapes","review":"I've never understood why Grapes of Wrath is so highly acclaimed among the Steinbeck works. I was forced to read it the first time in a high school English course. I believed, then, that I hated the writing of John Steinbeck. Later, after I'd come to know his other works I went back for a re-read, thinking I'd been jaundiced by an HS English teacher presentation. I still didn't care for it. Of the Steinbeck works it's the only one I've never read repeatedly as I aged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted","review":"I ordered this beautiful book, and received a blue hard cover from Reader's Digest.

The sample consists of the introduction, written within the last 10 years. It is not the beginning of the book. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I read maybe two books a year, and it's sometimes hard to keep up with this characters and details of a book as a result. However, I found very few dull spots in this book. This is a hard book to put down and once you do...you won't be able to forget about the story. I enjoy reading fiction with a strong historical backdrop. This book offers itself as a good historical reference, as well as a wonderful story of personal and societal struggles. This is an adult reading and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for all Americans","review":"This last week I finished reading The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. If you have not found your way to this book yet, you need too. Spawning from the Great Depression era, this intriguing piece follows the downfall of the Joad family on their cross country trip to California. The age of industry and of the machine forces the Joad's off their farm, and having few options, they pile into their broken down truck towards California in hopes of big jobs and big dreams. The Grapes of Wrath is a wonderful historical piece of fiction that is a must read for every American. It brings to life every American issue; the American Dream, family, capitalism, religion, and sexuality, as well as numerous others. I recommend reading this book in the Spring or Summer as it is very dark, but it has to be. It is a long book, with a controversial ending that still has people talking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unparalleled writing","review":"Steinbeck's writing is unparalleded in this description of the Family Joad and their quest to make it to California and the drama that ensues.

Step back in time with Steinbeck's novel about early American life and the way people fled to California for greener pastures.The way of life before the Joad's packed up all their belongings and left, to the long hard trip out west and what they encountered once there, will keep you turning page after page.One of the top 100 novels of all time. Don't miss out on a excellent story about our American past that Steinbeck portrays in one of his finest works. A work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love & Freedom","review":"The production on LOVE & FREEDOM is contemporary gospel, there's a depth and resonance far beyond that of much cookie-cutter generic neo-R&B.

Winans soulful singing, simultaneously understated, appealing and captivating sound weaves through these tunes on this CD. I think on of the best contemporary soul gospel CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Gets Better with Each Listening!","review":"Some may find Winans' blend of the religious and the secular to be a little profane. However, this is a really well crafted musical journey that should garner Winans a wider audience.

If you've ever broken a heart...BeBe offers you some help to right your wrong. If yours has been broken give this CD to the offending party when they ask how to get back. The collaborations are phenomenal - Luther, Stevie,Marvin Winans, Brian McKnight, Joe, CeCe and much missed Stephanie Mills.

However, this album is very disappointing....the songs have nothing to do with Jesus Christ...in MY opinion. Seems like artists Joe, Brian McKnight, Stevie Wonder, etc. were just thrown in there for what....to sound good? Love & Freedom did not reach my heart. This is just another R&B album, not gospel/christian.

It feels heavy and strong, and the bike I've had locked up with it hasn't been stolen so far.Their anti-theft guarantee is terrible.

To register for the anti-theft guarantee, you have to pay - $1 for a year, $10 for 2 years, and $15 for 3 years. So, after paying for a lock that boasts an anti-theft guarantee, you have to pay for the insurance. It's not far from a protection racket.Say what you will about the lock - the company relies on deceptive practices.

The 3 main characters are linked either by blood common passion, and this should make for a more interesting story, but alas, it is entirely predictible.What is of interest is that in my copy, Dot's father has a mistress called Edie, and thus she is called for at least two thirds of the book, when she is suddenly referred to as Blanche. I had to re-read a few pages to ensure that she was indeed one and the same character. Poor editing perhaps? Either way, it doesn't make the book any more interesting.It is certainly an entertaining enough read for lovers of the genre, but if you're looking for a far more spectacular book on the life and times of the hardy and brave men who worked the mines, and the women who loved them, try \\"How Green Was My Valley\\" by Richard Llewellyn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cerda Mierda","review":"Disgusting paranoia we find in this terrorific gang of headless weirdos who destry every furniture in the room and attack every sense of art into the earthly globe.

I liked her previous stuff but not enough to listen to it much. Granted, I love Rancid and think Indestructible is perhaps the greatest punk album since London Calling, and when I found out he worked on this one I scooped it up.Tim Armstrong's influence rattles and holds together many of these songs all right, but man can Pink sing. On several songs she has that rich, throaty delivery that is more than vaguely reminiscent of Joan Osborne. This CD shows a range of vocals not found on her previous stuff.Slam in Armstrong's arrangements and guitars, and this is a great one. Nice to see an artist progressing instead of, say, ending up like Jewel(let's see, spend some time with Rancid, or hang out with a tobacco-chewing Rodeo dude and crank out lukewarm early-eighties techno-rot...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her transformation to rock.","review":"Well, Pink is ever the changing butterfly isn't she? She went from hip-hop/r&b to soft rock/pop to full out rock on her last three releases. This album is definitely a decent rock record worth your money. There are some tracks that leave a little to be desired but overall, it's all good. Tracks such as \\"God Is A DJ\\", \\"Waiting For Love\\", \\"Hooker\\"(hidden track), \\"Last To Know\\" and \\"Oh My God\\" are songs that will be stuck in your head for days. They are catchy, risque, and rock and roll. It's a shame that this record didn't fly like her last record because this one is real, 100% real. Looking forward to Pink's next release"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink is Super!","review":"With every CD she releases, her music gets better and more personal.

To me, Pink is the talent that is going to outlast them all and this is the album that everyone should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"This is an awesome albu-definitely my favorite in my collection right now.1.

I immediately went to the store on the day TRY THIS was released to buy it. And it's just ok. I admire Pink for trying something new, and it's not bad. I just don't ever have a desire to put it on. It usually sits on my shelf and collects dust. Unlike Missundaztood which I played out. Like I said, it's not bad. It's rock-ish. But it's boring and the songs all blend into one. I was disappointed and unimpressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T Try This","review":"This has to be one of the worst efforts from one of the most promising stars ever to have been released! I'm not sure what Pink is trying to do with this album -- although clearly she is gunning for some kind of Punkish persona having watched other pop-Punks (aka sheep in wolf's clothes) cash in -- whatever it is, it translates into extremely poor production, repetitive and boring music, and self-aggrandizing lyrics that would make Narcissus him/herself blush. I don't generally write bad reviews -- Momma said if you ain't got nothin nice to say.... -- but in this case I feel like I'm doing a public service by warning you: THIS ALBUM WILL BORE YOU TO TEARS and make you wish that pop stars read a bit more and tried to develop, instead of only admire, themselves. Not for Pink fans..... for those with a Pink fetish only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else!","review":"P!NK changes her persona as much as she changes her genre of music. Her debut album \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" is an r&b wonder. Her second \\"Mizzundastood\\" had a more pop-rock sound. This third disc \\"Try This\\" is plain ol' rock. She trys to be so-called punk-rock but fails ultimately.Not only that but her new look is as worst as this new album. Boring, sappy, songs that doesn't stay in anyone's attention span for more than a minute. \\"I am trouble yo', I am trouble now...\\" right, the only thing that is troubling is your fake image. Trailer park trash Avril Lavigne can pull off the whole fake image thing. But Ms. Alicia Moore you can't. Don't try this, try something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pink Should Learn to Sing!","review":"Damn I hate this CD. Pink should grow up and sing like a real woman. Everybody knows she tries to imitate Cyndi Lauper in her early years in her look. The only difference Cyndi can sing but PINK sreams and do it in a terrible way.

Don't buy this CD because you will hate it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"Theres not a single Good song on this CD. Theres a few that are \\"okay\\" but, overall, I was completely dissapointed in this CD. Pink went from her original style which included great party songs like \\"You Make Me Sick\\" \\"Get This Party Started\\" and even went emotional with \\"Family Portrait\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" Now, however, her songs feature horrible lyrics, boring songs, and extremely explict profanity. Yes, you can buy it in a \\"clean\\" version, but even still the songs are horrible. If you liked Pink before, stay away from this CD.

She's now about to release her 5 album and i love the new single.....so since i can't wait for it to be released..i thought i'd try this to satisfy my pink craving...Boy was i wrong.there are two good songs on this cd. i have already named them. The rest of the songs are poorly sung, poorly written and sometimes strangely/poorly produced. i want my money back but you can't return open cds. she's not a rocker chick, and besides, she hardly has any hooks on here to prove she is one in the first place. truly dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievable","review":"Well, for Pink with me it's like that: I can't believe her.

I can't stand Pink's views about animal rights, and I am sick of celebrities jumping on bandwagons for some extra publicity. Pink is a loud mouth, and this album reflects her annoying, trashy self being annoying and trashy. Even though I didn't like \\"Trouble\\" I thought I'd give it a chance anyways, based on past efforts. \\"Try This\\" is a bad follow-up, and a shame to the recording industry. This horrible effort is drippy, meaningless, and eye-rolling. Trust me: don't \\"try this\\", it will give you hives. It is the worst album I've ever heard from a promising face in the music industry. I wish I never wasted my money on this garbage. I'd give it 0 if I could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"P!NK is back and better than before","review":"The continuing evolution of P!NK is great to hear. Her first CD sounded like everyone else's; her second marked her as an individual apart from her contemporaries, with a terrific voice and impressive range of styles in one CD.With this third CD, P!NK rocks. Those hoping for pop or r&b will be disappointed: P!NK has now defined a coherent rock image which suits her well. Nearly every track is worth hearing again and again. There are so many good songs that I have yet to figure out which I like best.The only f___ing disappointing song is the f___ing 'extra' which is an empty f___ing shard of shouting featuring the f___ing f-word. P!NK, P!NK, P!NK, what were you thinking? You are worth so much more. This song is beneath you. Overuse of the f-word conveys nothing more than empty adolescent anger. It does not belong on this CD.

In reality, I'm comparing this album to Pink's Mizundastood album, which was an amazing album. Maybe she outdid herself on that album. Who knows?What I do know, is Try This is a weak attempt, and upon hearing it, I began to do research if this was actually a collection of B-Sides rather than a full length studio album. Could be. I'm not sure. If this is not a B-Side album, I think Pink needs to reconsider what made her famous in the first place and stick to that. She curses in almost every song on this album, her poppy sound is totally gone, and it's a flat out struggle to stay zoned into these poor quality songs.Sorry, Alisha.. this album just isn't your best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have it","review":"Well got this CD like two days ago and havn't stopped listing to it! i liked her first one better but i still really enjoy this one i could tell she wanted it to be good"},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"I bought her missunderstood album that was a kicker this one is not anything never really realizes itself - its not a strong album and there are parts where it could have had great songs but they mess it up....not worth the money.

First of all, PINK can sing anything!!! She grew up listening to R&B and rock (she was a singer in a band). I really like her voice and versitility (those people who did not like this album did not understand it and are used to her older material). I enjoyed this album, and my favorites are Humble Neighborhoods, Catch Me While I'm Sleeping, Hooker, and Unwind (where she parallels her life to Janis Joplin, who was one of her influences). GO PINK GO!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"less whiny with a much harder edge","review":"She's given up the clean pop image for a more adult image with music to go along with this image.

Just shy of perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"TRY THIS\\" don't even!","review":"I have liked Pink before when her image at the \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" album is still being patronized. The songs are good as well... \\"You Make Me Sick\\" and \\"Most Girls\\". Now she has matured and certainly went away from being dirty to FAR MORE DIRTY! In her \\"Trouble\\" video, the whole point of the clip was to make chaos in which Pink would enter a western bar and beat everyone up, then she ends up truimphant. She just wants to show that she's tough! a tomboy I must say! Almost the same attempt was done for the video of \\"God Is A DJ\\". First of all, Pink can't sing and that's a fact. I'll give her a star for she's a good dancer and that's basically about it! YUCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thank God that I didn't buy this CD!!!!!","review":"I don't need to type a 1,000-word review to describe this so-called album. I've never liked P!nk's voice. She just shouldn't have ever been a singer at all! Whoever made her a singer or hired her should be fired from his or her job. Of all of the P!nk songs I heard, I only liked \\"There you go,\\" and \\"You make me sick\\"... and those are from the first album! I listened to this CD @ the leak @ mtv.com and I hated it. It's just a waste of money. Buy Michelle Branch's Hotel Paper instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there was a lower ranking","review":"Pink sucks. This is a horrible CD and horrible albunm art work. They gave her too much freedom on this CD since Mizzunderstood was a big hit. That is probably why her new song Stupid Girls is so catchy and sing-songy it makes me want to puke as well. But I guarantee they didnt let this wanna be riot grrrl go all hard core again. If they did, this new disc is bound to wind up in the .99 bin along with Try This."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Would make her Idol \\"Janis Joplin\\" Proud","review":"I was so excited, and worried at the same time about this new Album. How could Pink make another Record that could stand up to her Previous one? Well, she has!!!!!!

She is totally into doing what no one expects her to do, and she ends up doing it well. She Worked with Rancid's Tim Armstrong for a good majority of the songs, and the punk edge that he brings to the new songs is undeniable, and awesome. It totally fits Pinks nicotene coated voice, and her acidic lyrics. Missundaztood was an exploration of her brain, while this album is more of an exploration of her sense of humor. Its more of the surface, which is ok, because she already bared her whole soul. The best song on this whole record, in my opinion is \\"God is a DJ\\" It talks about how you just have to do what you can do with what youve been given. Its uplifting and breaking at the same time. The rest of the album looks at different sides of rock, and her first love song, \\"Love Song\\" closes the album, and also, wait for the hidden track \\"Hooker\\", which is a hilarious closer to a good album from Pink"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better That Then Last","review":"I was really scared for Pink thinking that she had changed her style and would not be able to top songs like Dont Let Me Get Me, Like A Pill, and Get The Party Started. She definately has. I was suprisingly pleased with this CD. She went with a more Happy and not so Mad self. Her songs have more energy and fun. She has quite a few songs in different genres. R&B, Punk Rock, Soft Rock, and Dance. I really did not like the entire Mizunderstood album but I heard this Cd once in my car and it was great, and the songs were catchy. Usually When I hear a cd for the first time I hear a few songs and then go back to the beginning of the disk. In this case I did not have the chance, becasue all the songs were so good. I am very happy and proud of her, and although her methods and images might be a little unorthodox, well thats what makes her Pink. The Dvd has the video and behind the scenes clips, pic and lyrics. It really is not a big deal but for the same price get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ALBUM IS HEADING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM NON-STOP FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS.

BUT YOU'LL GET BORED WITHIN A MONTH'S TIME IF YOU JUST KEEP IT ROLLING. P!NK'S VOCAL IS GETTING PRETTY 'UNNATURAL'. HER FORCED CROAKY VOICE IS SOUNDING MORE LIKE A 'SULKY'. THESE ARE OLD FORMULAS.

She has Janis Joplin quality in this record, not being afraid to rasp words and phrases; curse and be blunt. If you are looking for dancy and more mild material like \\"Mizunderstoodz\\", look elsewhere.The track that really did it for me was \\"God Is A DJ\\". I listend to this song for an hour straight and still wasn't tired of it. Superb lyrics, great chord structure and progressions; and pleasing background vocals made this the STAR on the disc.

I like Pink so I had high expectations of this cd but I was very disappointed. Unless you're a hard core Pink fan, I'd recommend giving this album a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too much","review":"OMG I expected better material from PINK since her last album, but this just sux! She got all her anger out on the last album and this one I guess she is trying to make people dance but the words that she is saying is stupid and boring. I hope she comes up with better, angrier material next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"First off, I like Pink. But this CD doesnt give me much. \\"Trouble\\" is great. \\"God is a DJ\\" is good. But thats about it. Its one of those CD's we all have where only one or two songs are likeable, and the rest are just bad. It now spends most of its time collecting dust in the CD holder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD--You really should \\"TRY THIS\\"!","review":"First thing I have to say is WOW! I was really skeptical about Pink pulling off this style of music, but she did it--and much better than I thought she would!Pink just proved with this CD that she can sing anything! Yes this is a punk-like album, but it's not over-the-top and it's just right for Pink's vocal talent.And for those of you not crazy about her first single \\"Trouble\\", I have to admit it took me some time to like it, but there are much better songs on this CD.This is a MUST PURCHASE! You will not be disapponted!Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Try \\"TRY THIS\\"","review":"This album is awsome. Although It's not as good as Missundaztood, it's still better than Can't Take Me Home. She did a great job. The best songs on the album would have had to have been, Trouble, God is a DJ, Catch Me While I'm Sleeping, and Save My Life. They were the greatest. The only song I didn't like was Hooker. There was just no reason for that song to be on there. She used the F word too much. But I highly recommend this CD! The only thig is, get the edited verion if you are younger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible follow-up","review":"I loved \\"Mizzaunderstood\\". Fantastic album. This album is a terrible, shameful follow-up. It is nothing more than a jamble of terrible song-writing and loud guitars. No emotion. The only decent song is \\"Trouble\\". Even that sounds terrible in comparison to Mizzaunderstod. It's like she walked into the studio, said \\"i don't give a ****, let's just record some *** so i can get out of here and get wasted.\\" I would have given the album no stars if that was an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Perfection","review":"I like that Pink can change her style. She does have range (she proved that on the AMA's last night). This new CD is a little harder, more punk than Missunderztood. Let's just hope that she doesn't try \\"country\\" next!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It may not be what you expect....BUT...its Awesome!!","review":"Pink has done it AGAIN!!....she has shown she is a recording artist of deep roots and talent. This CD is a departure from her last album, but make no mistake....it is VERY LISTENABLE. Tim Armstrong of Rancid (Punk Band) worked with Pink here and there are some very rock oriented songs....but there is enough funk and soul to keep any Pink fan satistied. GOD IS A DJ....is just off the hook GREAT! And to any of her detractors, what would you be saying if you got another version of Get This Party Started ?? You would be saying she just re-treaded the past....that's not the case and if anything she has shown she can do it all now....soul,rap, dance and rock....Go Pink!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PINK IS ON FIRE!","review":"I liked her first cd, but in my opinion... it doesn't compare to this one~~~!!!!!!!!!Try This is very Janis Joplin...

Can't take this home and Misundaztood were great. So I've been waiting a while for this CD and yes I am very disappointed. The only tracks I liked are those ones with Linda Perry. I liked \\"trouble\\" but it got old quick. I love Pink, her attitude and her voice. But I simply did not like this album very much. Let's try for the fourth one. I'll be waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointing CD.","review":"What happend to Pink? After Misunderstood I thought Pink was going to take over the world.

I wanted to throw up after hearing Try This and I'll be throwing this cd in the garbage. Hint: Stick to what made you popular with that mediocre voice/good beats and quit the Joan Jett/Joplin impersonation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmm.....no.","review":"CAN'T TAKE ME HOME was really good....M!SSUNDAZSTOOD was fair....but TRY THIS is absolutely horrible! I am an avid music collector/listener, and I tend to buy all of an artist's albums once I discover them...but this time I just can't do it. I decided to listen to the sound snippets before I bought this one, and I am glad I did! This is terrible. Pink was really good in the beginning....a nice deep voice which went well with the r&b style of music she was promoting. GET THE PARTY STARTED was a really good club anthem...but where do you put TROUBLE? In the trash! I feel very alienated by Pink's 360 degree change in image. Granted, I like rock music....but I do have a problem with an artist who does a complete turnaround. Obviously, I am not the only one....just look at the rank of the album on the Amazon list...and look at all of those CDs still sitting in the stores. Pink has made a grave mistake with this CD. She had better get it right soon....or her star just might be fading."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a no talent","review":"this just goes to show that just because you have a catchy name like PINK you can get a recording contract even if you cant sing.

I cant believe people fall for this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALMOST PUT ME TO SLEEP!!!","review":"Yet another bad album by pink.The songs had no life or substance to them and had very weak production.I cant find one good song on the entire album.She really needs to get her act together if she wants to remain in the music industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"how dumb!","review":"why do people listen o people like this? she sounds just as constipated as avril lavrigne. for some real music, try stacie orrico, jessica simpsons first cd-sweet kisses-, racheal lampa, jump5, and zoegirl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Famous critic is B-O-R-I-N-G.","review":"Although it was entertaining to read about resturants I will never get to eat at, I found the dialogue,style, and story boring.I don't know what I was expecting, but my book club wanted to do this book & I did not enjoy it. Maybe newspaper articles are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I've loved all of Ruth Reichl's books, although this one is not quite as compelling as her previous autobiographies. Nevertheless, for fans of her writing, this should not be missed. What I found fascinating was the behind-the-scenes look into the world of the restaurant critic - who knew that this was really the way it worked? It makes you think hard about critics across the board - how can they be objective if they are pandered to this way? (Unless they go out of their way to disguise their identity, like Reichl did.)Her passion for food and her work is another reason to buy this book - the way she lives her life with vigor and purpose is truly inspirational. I am a fan. (But I will still give it 4 out of 5 stars because I didn't quite love this effort as much as prior ones.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruth can do better","review":"Still a great read, but not as good as Tender at the Bone and Comfort Me with Apples. Foodies will love the continued insight into restaurant review protocol, but the author really shines when she remembers early food experiences with her mom, dad and other relatives and friends. The highs are not as high, nor the lows as low in Garlic and Sapphires. Reichl has a long way to go to lose me as a reader; that said, I hope she has a few more early memories to incorporate in her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-appreciated tosh","review":"Annoying, trite, and painfully over-exaggerated.That is all. This short review is about the perfect length the book should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I thought the book was funny. It grabbed me from the first chapter and I laughed through the whole thing. This is a great read and I am up for reading any other books from this writer. Another great one is the glass castle and also Whispers of the wicked saitns. Great reads !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth transaction.","review":"The book was in the condition specified. It came on time--actually a little faster. I had no problems at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true foodies delight","review":"I loved the characters that Ruth created and how she learned from each character. Not to mention the incredible food talk. Being the foodie that I am I truly love her writing descriptions of food. The overall experiences she had shedded a new light on a food critics life. Not all snob and 5 stars. Good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful read and instructive","review":"this book is an absolute must-read for anyone who enjoys food. altho' i've been passionate about food and cooking for over 40 years, Reichl taught me some new things about the experience of tasting and eating. as a former born-and-bread ny'er, i have the utmost respect for how she transformed the critic's mission at the NYT during her tenure. brava!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yum yum","review":"Reading this book is almost as good as dining out. If you never have the opportunity of dining in the kind of establiments Reichl describes, then this is the next best thing. Ruth Reichl can paint word pictures with such clarity that even some of the most disgusting sounding dishes make your mouth water. One thing I like is the inclusion of a few recipes so it is a \\"twofer.\\" \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Ham\\" is a great companion book to \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\" and it is quite by accident that I read one right after the other. The last several chapters of Reichl's book were very poignant, given the history of what has happened in NYC after the time period in the book. Her enthusiasm is infectious, and her writing leaves you still hungry for more. She and Dominique Browning should collaborate on a food/garden book. That would be most delicious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"If you are interested in food and food critics, this is a awesome book for you. Ruth Reichl is a great author that should get some honor. Her book is filled with hilarious moments and the plot is just incredible. I will advise everyone to purchase this book because it will give you some incredible knowledge in food and critiques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I always liked Ruth and believed her to be a very down to earth person. This book in no way changed my opinion of her. Garlic and Sapphires has a good balance of food and non-food writing. I am a foodie and sometimes am disappointed when there isn't enough about the food. She accounts her experiences dealing with editors, and I found that interesting as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving Ruth Reichl","review":"This book is my favorite by Ruth Reichl. She knows food, she loves food, she loves excellent food, and she likes a jelly donut with coffee from the corner stand every morning. She's a real person writing about restaurants.Ruth knew when she left LA for the coveted New York Times food critic assignment that she would get great food and great service is she appeared as herself, so she dresses in a variety of disguises and gets treated like all the rest of the patrons. Sometimes that means the same courteous service and sometimes that means being treated with disdain.Her in depth discussion about the food and wine and the atmosphere is reminiscent of Julia Child's My Life in France, which I loved. Adding to that are Ruth Reichl's great disguises and any foodie will thoroughly enjoy reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun!","review":"Oh to go undercover with Ruth to various restaurants in New York City in the 90s wearing wigs and costumes, what a perfect delight! It is quite obvious how profound an impact she had on the food revolution, daring to give legitimacy to Asian noodle restaurants when no one else would dare. This book is so entertaining to read, I loved every second of shadowing her on her food adventures. I will be attempting to make her recipe for Sort-of Thai Noodles very soon. For a foodie, this book is fantastic escapism to one of the food capitals of the world. To see the life of the most powerful woman in that industry in action? Pure bliss."},{"rating":"2","title":"NYC Restaurants","review":"If you live in NYC or just enjoy eating in its restaurants, you'll enjoy this book.... so much so that I bought a second copy to give to my niece who knows NYC restaurants well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret should mean intrigue","review":"For a book without much of a plot, intrigue, or even character development, it was OK.There are hints that she feels guilty about spending so much time away from her son but that goes nowhere.The food descriptions are luscious but get old after a few hundred pages.I even tried one of the recipes - the roast chicken. It was as dull as the book.Ms. Reichl must have gotten as bored writing it as I did reading it because it ends with the thud of a meal with no dessert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great restaurant review biography.","review":"Ruth Reichl creatively describes her life as a restaurant critic for the New York times.I loved hearing about these restaurants, and her exploits to review them There are alsogood recipes. If you like to cook and try new restaurants, this is a great book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Need for Reservations.......","review":"I was so disappointed in this latest book. Loved \\"Tender to the bone\\", loved \\"Comfort Me with Apples\\", love your magazine, HATED \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\".I just kept thinking that it was going to get better and more interesting and it just didn't. And the recipes just happened out of the blue and were not very interesting.Don't bother buying. Wait until it hits your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is the Kindle Version More Costly Than Paperback","review":"I cannot understand how a publisher can justify charging more for the Kindle version than paperback. It leads me to believe that as e-readers dominate the market place publishers are opting to gouge us with higher prices. It makes no sense when you consider they do not need to print or transport the books. So why the higher rate? Pure greed that ultimately hurts the authors because readers like myself refuse to buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garlic and Sapphires","review":"Book was listed as being in good condition; I would have said fair since it has quite a bit of water damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bunch of old food reviews","review":"I LOVE RR in general and have read all of her books, but this one was a big disappointment. A huge part of the book is old food reviews and the rest is the stories of the disguises she wore to restaurants and how she came up with them. This wouldn't have been a bad book if there had been less of the (now very old) restaurant reviews and more of the story telling surrounding them. This just felt like filler between publishing a greatest hits of old articles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfaction Guarantee'd!","review":"I have read many books over the years written by Ruth Reichl, spanning her satisfying and intriguing life. She is able to combine her personal life experience, her desire for professional culinary satisfaction, yearning for husband and family and never ending quest for the perfect meal and wine pairings. Best of all, her idea of a perfect meal includes her husband and child. How lovely. After listening to her meal descriptions, it makes me make me want to pull up a chair and invite myself for dinner!Elaine Thomasbingthom@gci.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical undercover foray into upper crust elitism","review":"This is Ruth Reichl's third book in her witty autobiographical series chronicling life from food poisoned youth to New York's most esteemed food critic. This book describes in hilarious detail the many disguises she assumed to turn the world of food critiquing into a reality show of epic proportions! Laugh out loud good. One should really start with her first book, \\"Tender to the Bone\\", to get the full effect of this writer's charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garlic and Sapphires","review":"This was the first book written by Ruth Reichl that I had read although I was familiar with her through Gourmet Magazine. Her style is lighthearted and humorous which moves the story along well. At first glance it seems like a foodie book about her crazy tenure as a Food Critic for the times. The book wraps up with a deeper, introspective look at life and finding what really matters. It was an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"why so pricy?","review":"I prefer to read on my Kindle but I can't see the justification for a higher price for the digital edition for this 6 year old book than for hardback or softcover. It's ridiculous and I won't support the publisher in ripping off Kindle users this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Democratize Fine Dining Now!!","review":"Ruth Reichl is passionate about both food and humankind. She puts herself in the shoes of different common folk, through clever disguises, to see how snooty service staff in highly rated restaurants react to these group of customers.Only if both food and service meet her standards in her various disguises, then she would feel that she had a celestial dining experience & the restaurant would deserve its highest rating in her New York Times reviews.She has raised the bar for fine dining and totally humanized it. Way to go, girl!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - Kindle edition full of mistakes and typos","review":"The book and authorship was quite fun, but the poor editing of the Kindle edition make reading this a disaster - there are numerous places where words have unintentionally been split into two (e.g., \\"Mor ton's\\" instead of \\"Morton's\\") and a few where a whole paragraph has been repeated. I love my Kindle, but it's immensely frustrating to actually pay two dollars *more* for an eBook that is so poorly edited and put together. Don't buy this as a Kindle edition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Could Eat Her Up!","review":"Ruth is a wonderful writer who holds nothing back. She is down to earth, honest, and very funny. We've read every one of her books and highly recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I decided to buy this book after hearing an interview with Ruth Reichl on CBC. It was the first book I've read by her and definitely the last. Yes, it was interesting to read about the different treatments she received based on perceived social status; however, I found it rather too much when she was \\"becoming\\" a different person, timid or obnoxious, as soon as she put different clothes on and a wig. Also, after a few chapters, I started getting a little annoyed with her constant \\"I found myself saying\\". There are also remarks in the book of how Mrs. Reichl finds New York people rude; ironically I found her character (her real character) rather pompous as she rarely had anything good to say about others but plenty of criticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspicuous Consumption","review":"This book left me feeling like I consumed too much, uncomfortable and wondering why I spent so much time doing it. It's a little interesting in the way that it's a little interesting to know what Paris Hilton is saying and doing. In fact it may be exactly the same as reading this book. The author is good at describing food but not that wonderful at making the stories involving. Her fascination with herself bleeds into bizarre as she dons disguises at various times. I found her reviews and the peek at the underbelly of the New York Times fairly intriguing. However, the uncomfortable feeling comes from my understanding of how the privileged in this country have taken conspicuous consumption to obscene levels and we all become participants by glorify them. I don't want to know any more about Paris Hilton or read any more food orgies thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get through the Audio Version","review":"Maybe it's not such a good idea to have the author read her own book aloud. Ms. Reichl is a much more talented writer than reader. I found her delivery so nasal and monotone and gasp--Boring! that I didn't even finish the first disk. Now I shall go in search of the book to read myself as it does promise to be interesting. Just not read aloud by the author please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I expected to read more about the inner workings of NY restaurants, not recycled reviews from the New York Times. I thought it would be interesting to read about how she fooled restaurants with her various disguises. I did not expect to read page after page of where she bought the wigs, how she found the clothes, etc. etc. You can only read \\"the tastes exploded in my mouth like hundreds of little fireworks\\" (not a true quote from the book) so many times before you start skipping over the reviews. Save yourself some money and read the actual restaurant reviews from the Times' archives. I wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars","review":"good insight into the world of a food critic, fun read for foodies. somewhat repetitive towards the end, and the whole episode with the lawyer who was also a food connoisseur seemed a little made up (she randomly starts talking to him at a bar, and he immediately starts talking about the new york times food critic, and also invites her to the very same restaurant she was meaning to go to, without being prodded? too much coincidence). but she does seem to love food a great deal and writes well about it. i was surprised, but shouldn't have been, by the various underhanded ploys used by upscale restaurants to make their patrons spend more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Flash From The Past","review":"This book is a little dated, but I very much enjoyed her description of New York's \\"old line\\" restaurants. Her disguises were part of the fun. I read her columns when she was at the LA Times and we still miss her. I agree with some reviewers that got a little bored with the detailed description of Japanese buckwheat noodles, but after all, she's a food critic. What else would she do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN FACTS 'BOUT OUR FAVORITE SUBJECT!","review":"There are lots of fun facts in this book. Although I found it short, I thought it was a nice book for yep, you've guessed it: QUICKIES! For those who are interested in the little facts 'bout sex, and you've read \\"Sex: A User's Guide\\" by Stephen Arnott (which I highly recommend BTW), this is a great book to add on to what you've learned. There are definitely things you haven't known before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curiously Addicting","review":"This book is full of interesting facts and details about the \\"facts of life.\\" Just when you think you've heard it all, you'll find yourself saying \\"I didn't know that.\\" There were plenty of things in here I didn't want to know ever, things I didn't want anyone else to know I had read, and other things I just had to read out loud to my wife. Overall...Great trivia and great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my (writing and reading) life","review":"Since reading (and forcing many boyfriends to read it to me) the Crying Heart Tattoo, I have looked at my writing and that of many authors all in the shadow of David Martin's unique storytelling style and imagery. His wonderful technique of alternating narrative and storytelling between every other chapter and keeping all of it in harmony is impressive; the details and photographic memory akin to no one. I especially love the honest dialog between Sonny and Felicity as well as their crazy, sexual and forbidden adventures. I never seem to go a year without pulling out my hardback copy of \\"the Crying Heart Tattoo\\" to revist such colorful characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A TALE OF LOST LOVE","review":"A haunting, beautiful love story, with one of the most heart-wrenching last paragraphs I've ever read in a book. there is a genuine magic in this tale. sonny has much to learn from felicity, but he's stubborn, clueless, and thinks he has all the answers, like many of us when we're young, and the lessons he learns from her take years to absorb. and in any tale of love and regret he really learns them too late. felicity's parable is a delight, but lost on sonny. sometimes we don't realize how good we have it, until it's gone. sentimental, but not overly so. this is a book to be treasured, and read again and again. I can hear \\"as time goes by\\" playing as I read this book. it seems so appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to the hype","review":"I read The Crying Heart Tattoo with the highest expectations. I had heard rave reviews and was prepared to read a compelling love story. I was sorely disappointed. The author sets up the female character to appear confident, worldly and strong, yet he has her act weak and pathetic. Her so-called backround was unbelievable when compared to her actions. I never felt an unbreakable bond between the two characters. The writing was obvious in some instances with too many cutsey lines repeated a bit too often. The ending felt tacked on, as if Mr. Martin just ran out of story. The book lacked depth and all in all was just not a compelling read."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too many","review":"Outdated methods, sophomoric approaches and ... tricks comprise the bulk of this text that represents what the security community has come to expect of Ms. Meinel.

In this book we find out about another aspect of Victorian England - smuggling and other nefarious schemes. There are actually two storylines in this book, and the authors deal with both of them very well. They certainly keep their readers interested. I like the obvious research that goes into each one of these books, and the totally different view that we are given about life in England just before the turn of the last century.

I did that and it took a lot of water, was still very stiff and lumpy. It was very hard to trowel and set up in about 15 minutes. The instructions say it sets up in 20 to 30 minutes. I wasted about half the bag because it set up too fast. The material has to be screeded and regularly checked with a level in addition to troweling, all in less than 15 minutes.For leveling floors, a self leveling material such as Henry's self-leveling underlayment, is much easier to use and does not require any expensive additive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiderman (Backrest) Pillow","review":"My 5 year old son absolutely LOVES this pillow.

Hayley Mills plays 2 early teen girls, and these are great realistic performances of girls of the early 60's, not cutesy movie kids. There is also some adult humor that went right over my head when I saw this movie as a 6 year old - the look on Brian Keith's face when he sees Maureen O'Hara's bra and assumes it's the property of his 13 year old daughter is great.As for the sequel, it was good but it had a little too much \\"cutesy kid\\" and not enough Hayley Mills for my taste.The features are very good.

More than a journey into the discovery of Bluegrass it is the journal of a Bluegrass insider who can easily list the who's who rather than explain what's what. If you passion is music, this is not your book.The historical part is interesting, but fails to captivate the audience. Similar recanting of the early days on the Web are free and a lot more captivating. Naturally, as the books become more and more dated, a lot of the references provided become outdated and so, it does not even serve as a reference book.I hope not to offend the author, but I would recommend you save you money and perhaps check if your local library can get you a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like reading an encyclopedia article","review":"Two of the three reviews are obvious plants put in by friends of the author. I'm an experienced guitar player, a budding mandolin player, and wanted to dig a little deeper into bluegrass. This, unfortunately, was not the book to read. There are no interesting stories here.

So I decided to listen to it, and well..the rest is just pure enjoyment. This song destroys dancefloors everywhere I go. Well produced, hypnotic, and very emotive. when placed after a non-melodic song in a dj set, it totally brings the crowd from the bar to the dancefloor..the hands go up in the air, and the crowd loses themself in the melody and beautiful vocals.

Upon return, when I realized pills were no longer good, I sent email requesting to SPEAK with customer service rep. After MANY back and forth emails, they finally agreed to send me package slip to pay for return postage. What they should have done was immediately sent out another box of pills (overnight!). They refused to give me any phone numbers to contact customer service, despite many, many specific requests. I would give ZERO stars if I could.

Finally a thousand dollars later my dog dies and he states there was nothing he could do.

I also had to file a formal complaint with American Express. Finally I wrote a letter to the president of Medi-Vet.As a consumer, I would not recommend purchasing through this vendor.

The product itself can be life-saving. Medivet needs to check their delivery dates before shipping. By the time they shipped (3-4 days after ordering), it landed in the postal services hands just in time for the weekend. Needless to say, the ice pack had long melted and product was useless.

I am very pleased with this vendor.Regarding the medication itself: do not expect miracles; my cat had recently-diagnosed polycystic kidney disease and only lived for a few weeks after starting the Azodyl. My vet told me not to expect miracles but I did anyway. If I had known about the kidney disease earlier, the Azodyl might have made a difference. I'm also not sure of the efficacy if your pet happens to be on antibiotics at the time, as the product is a probiotic. In that case, definitely consult your vet. It's possible taking the medications a couple of hours apart could help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy Azodyl from Medi-Vet","review":"Medi-Vet authorized my credit card and confirmed the order. Three days later I received an e-mail telling me the product would probably not stay cold, please let them know how I wanted to proceed. They sent this e-mail to me hrs before they were to ship it when this notice should have come to me IMMEDIATELY when they received my order.I called immediately, but they claim to have already shipped it out. Thank God I'd only ordered one bottle to see whether Med-Vet was a reputable retailer.

I didn't have any expectations and was skeptical it would work since the package arrived in a heat wave so the medicine was not kept cold as it should be, despite their inclusion of a couple ice packs. I pulled out the pill gun and gave my cat her first dose that evening, and the next morning I awoke to a much brighter cat, it was pretty amazing. She gets two pills per day and is much more alert and into what is going on, and doesn't seem to be sitting there in pain or not feeling well as often. It hasn't helped get her to eat more, or have any noticeable effect on her actual kidney function, but I'm sold on it since it really made a contrast in her condition within about 12hrs. I would recommend trying it if you have a pet in kidney failure, being able to order online made it a pretty reasonable price and easy option to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Azodyl must be kept refrigerated","review":"I called the manufacturer to find out what happens if azodyl is not kept refrigerated.

The story reminded me of the light comedy movies from the same era, (mid to late 1940's) ah la, Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn.

There is no indicator light to tell you when it's on and the short cord makes it difficult to pour the coffee. The huge basket probably holds enough coffee to brew 24 cups, but is unmarked, so you have to measure what you need before you add it. Plus when you make 12 cups, the bottom of the basket sits in the water, something I've never seen before.The old GE cost half as much, had a cover that was notched for easy insertion and removal, and had a glass tube on the outside to indicate how much coffee was left in the pot.

I am so disappointed with my 12 cup coffee pot that I recently purchased! The top of the pot is so difficult to take off, every time I open it to remove the grinds it is a terrible struggle. I have been splashed with hot coffee several times. Another problem is the stainless steel is not the quality of the older models and no longer percolates a great cup of coffee as the older models. Another problem is that inside the pot where the pour spout is the opening is a small hole and when you pour the coffee it comes out slow and if you tilt the pot more the coffee splatters out all over the place. Be cautious that no one is near as you pour because they can get burned.

The best they could offer was a refurbished unit at half price. Shipping would be on me both directions as well, I told them I would not pay any price for another one of their products, based on our experience and their lack of any desire to acknowledge the widespread problem or help to fix it.

Black burning bits of plastic flew across the room. My husband saw the flames from the other room - ran in, unplugged it and threw it in the sink.

I noticed last week that it had what looks to be a spot on the bottom that appears to be a hole burning thru. I decided to get the larger pot...and while the cord is now more heavy duty...pouring the coffee is a total nightmare. It trickles out so slow that it takes forever to get a cup. What the heck happened? The basket seems SO large. I don't recall the previous basket being this large in my last 12 cup maker. Also...upon comparing the holes to the 4-8 cup....this one sits up further...which makes for a plop plop kind of pour. If that makes sense.

OMG! Hot rich coffee! Plus its not some cheap plastic machine that is going to have to be replaced ever couple of years and it takes up so little counter space. I love it, get one!Update, after about 8 months the perc is still going strong. Since I make 8 cups every day (leftovers go into an iced coffee pitcher) the unit tends to need cleaning often. I use Brew-Rite about every two weeks. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it is kind of hard to see the cup markers on the inside of the pot. The lid is hard to remove but I think that might be so it doesn't fly off while perking! Whether this lasts 2 years or 20 I do know it will last longer than the last five drip makers I have had with all their plastic parts and tubes. Since this is a one piece unit I take it with me when I travel and don't have to deal with the crappy drip makers at hotels or family."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best..","review":"We have used Farberware for years...and very happy to be able to get this one at Amazon...it is the best, and fastest coffeemaker every home should have..thank you, Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke after 3 1/2 months and it can't be returned.","review":"Our previous Farberware coffeemaker lasted over 4 years.

Yes, this percolator tries to brew coffee WAY too fast and the result is like weak tea.I suppose you could use excessive amounts of grounds to try and get a cup of coffee that could be considered good but why should you have to do that?This maker is some sort of compromise aimed at impatient people.

Not sure if that helped immensely, but it made me feel better.The second was that the base with the heating element became somewhat warped and was not meeting the body of the pot cleanly. This was leading to water getting into the element despite my best effort during cleaning.Then last night, it up and died after just short of 2 years. Last night was December 23rd.

Is it a coincidence that this occurred after the company changed ownership and out-sourced production to China? You decide.I am looking for an American made coffeemaker and have yet to find one.8/04/2011 REVIEW UPDATE: Fortunately I rescued this from the trash for a yard sale \\"just in case\\", and someone suggested I use a 50/50 vineger and water solution, which I did five times, and can now brew perfect coffee at a hot temperature.

Seems Farberware's quality has taken a dive. I read the review where the lady got shocked from her Farberware 12 cup peculator. Same thing happened to us. Our GFI outlet began to trip intermittently when we would make coffee. At first I thought some water had gotten inside the unit but I disassembled it and found it dry. So I temporally disconnected the ground from the unit and found that the pot was 50 volts AC above ground but only when the unit got hot. Obviously power through the thermostat or heating element is contacting the metal pot. Unfortunately I can't figure out which one is at fault, so I plan to replace the thermostat and see if that fixes the problem.

That company bought the name Farberware and uses it to sell products. The old Farberware you remember built products in the Bronx. They were built to last. After finding this out, I decided to find a used Farberware percolator from the old company. I found one on a leading online auction web site and purchased it for $20 (shipping included).

Enjoyed the coffee for awhile, but after a year we've been experiencing periodic short brew times producing nearly clear coffee.

I attempted contacting Faberware customer service, but the email address for the electrical department is not valid. In addition, when I called, I was placed on hold for a very long time and then told I was 24th in line. Frankly, I don't have time to stay on hold all day and consider such a wait time unacceptable. Finally, Faberware does not sell replacement electrical parts for this product, so I can't even fix it myself, which is my only option since the warranty expired after three months - this alone should have been a tip-off that the product was substandard.

Excellent perked coffee in small pots - we have used the 4 cup pots for years. Then Black & Decker seemed to take over carrying the Farberware name and they lost some quality and only lasted a year or so, but reasonable performance for the money. Now, we have purchased 2 in the past few months and both have quit. One with a cracked base about 4 months after purchase and then the last one lasted only about 30 days before the handle fell off.

I tried the perkie for 1 month and the gave up, went back and bought another drip coffeemaker. I'm a bit dissapointed with the coffee it made, although very hot, the coffee was practically flavorless. I used the same ammount of coffee that I would use for 8 cup drip, yet to get flavor out of the percolator, I needed to use another scoop. It wasted coffee and still didn't have that \\"bite\\" of flavor I love. Also, percolators are messier to clean.I read online in a coffee blog to never use a percolator, they make the coffee too hot and kill the flavor.

If you get the chance, don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't own it, but know all the songs - great overview of APP","review":"This looks like a great collection of some of the best Parsons tunes from his best albums, and thankfully leaves off anything from later albums that, while they have their moments, just aren't nearly as good as the albums featured on this compilation.One comment on the versions of Dream Within A Dream and The Raven - they were available on CD in their original versions, on the Mobile Fidelity series of excellent discs. Regrettably this version has been out of print for some time, so in that respect it is correct that this collection is now the only way to hear these as originally recorded - which is good because the remasters with the Orson Welles bits and the heavy-handed guitar solos and drum remixes were awful. Good to know the original versions were used here. For the uninitiated, this looks like a great low-cost way to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"ein Muss","review":"Ich finde, dass dieses Buch ein Muss für jeden historisch Interessierten sein sollte - und für jeden Fechter sowieso.

Turning on the radio took a good 1-2 minutes and if you were not careful, it would turn off. After one week, it would not turn on at all. I know the batteries are good, because the clock works. When, and I use that word very sparingly, it worked the reception was so poor I could hardly hear with the volumn up high. I was extremely dissapointed in the product. I'm happy I didn't purchase the product. Having said that, I'm sure the group that put together the relay will not request that paticuliar product again. One would think a manufacture would donate a product that is workable because, what better \\"free\\" advertisment could one get? This advertisment for \\"Wet Tunes\\", went south.

What a disaster!I have multiple accounts at many of the financial institutions I deal with and Money gave me fits trying to get the information downloaded into each account. My mortgage setup was mess as Money kept calculating different values then my bank (and Quicken). I do not believe the user interface is intuitive or as easy to use as Quicken and the help files were not always accurate.After less then a month I have gone back to Quicken 2003 and I plan to never invest my time with Money again.

This version adds a few things that you don't need and call it an upgrade. I downloaded the trial version and will not pay for this upgrade. The interface is exactly the same. There are no usability improvements and no improvements in the look of the product. Sure the Gainskeeper is useful but requires extra money for full use.

I was very happy with my old Money 99 but I thought I'd try it. I'm so sorry I upgraded! You can also download an 60 day trial but you'll run into the same problems. Once you upgrade you can never go back. If you're using Quicken or an Older version of Money, Money 2004 makes it extremely difficult for exporting data back to Quicken and there's no way back to older versions of money. On the Money 2004 FAQ, it leads you to believe you can, but you can't and then you find yourself 60 days in and find out you'll either have to buy or spend time reentering all your transactions for the last 60 into your older version. Don't Do it! Also 2004 is a subscription service so expect some features to expire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn't this amazing","review":"So you're wondering whether to buy MS Money or Quicken. So you look at this page and read the reviews that say this is the worst piece of software ever written and how they wished they'd bought Quicken. The you go to the Quicken reviews, and surprise surprise, you read essentially the same nonsense from people wishing they'd bought Money. Now, I'm willing to accept there may be some preference, but both pieces of software were given 5-stars by PC Magazine. They said there's little difference between the two, and that both do an good job. I think what we're seeing here is a battle between the software Talaban, not real reviews, similar to the fight between those who swear by PC vs. those who swear by Macs. I've used both Quicken and Money 2004. Both work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this if you're a Quicken user","review":"I downloaded the trial version from Microsoft's Web site, and imported all my Quicken data. I started using the program, but soon noticed that numbers were subtly wrong. Some odd transactions (ones that were in Quicken, simple check payments) were missed; and the loans were so screwed up that some of the payments were showing negative principal payment.I can't trust the data I imported or anything I've done since then, which means that I wasted a half dozen hours on this. Save yourself the time, and don't do the same. If you want to use this (and it seems okay, except for its insane handling of \\"matching\\" transactions that are months apart to different payees for different amounts), start from scratch and don't import your Quicken data."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lunatic","review":"What kind of lunatic would charge a thousand do11ars for any VHS?

The book was an excellent resource, and it often provided interesting theories about the development of Christian Fundamentalism in America. I found the history parts to be fascinating, and the interpretation of the history to be not as fascinating. Marsden's opinions about the facts were helpful at times, but confusing at other times.

Each essay was different, of course, with each essayist going his/her own way to interpret, question, and praise the show. I particularly loved it because it focused more on plot and characters than it did on technical stuff. If you loved this show, then this is a book that you'll want on your shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. There were no great insights into the show or the characters. In some places it was a scene by scene narrative of almost entire episodes. I much prefered the philisophical musings in \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Philosphy\\" edited by James B. South. At least it got me thinking. I was hoping this book (Seven Seasons) would show me aspects of the characters or plots that I hadn't seen - instead I got to read the very superficial musings of people with very little to share.I actually found the final essay in the book, \\"Slayers of the Last Arc\\" to be the most enjoyable and not just because of it's insight into the show but also as a great \\"how to\\" guide for writers. I also really enjoyed Sarah Zettel's \\"When did the Scoobies become Insiders?\\" and Jennifer Crusie's \\"Dating Death\\".This book is not a total write-off and I did finish it but I would look elsewhere if you're looking for something other than a basic episode guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody hell","review":"This series of essays may be of interest to the most serious and cerebral Buffy fans. But Buffy was not a serious and cerebral exercise. It was the best of campy cheeky fun. The writers of these essays did not seem to get it.Granted there were life lessons and moral issues. Indeed, \\"The Body\\" may be argueably the finest 60-minutes ever broadcast on American TV. However the \\"musical\\", \\"Thanksgiving\\", and \\"Xander's wedding\\" were meant to be a hoot.Obviously, I was dissappointed by this book.

That said...This book just wasn't interesting. It lacked depth, nuance, even a sense of humor. I read nothing new, radical or intelligent. I expected more and got even less. Don't waste your money!!!

It showed the truth of Hitlers operation to get rid of the Jews. It tells about how Hitlers army could not kill women and children, so they had a backup army which were trained to kill women and children. This books get very specific when they tell about how some infants were killed. One would throw the baby in the air, and the other would try to catch it the end of the knife.

Any guy willing to sit through An Unmarried Woman, and telling another guy the movie was good, probably needs to wear the used dresses he sells.

A work which is literally unique in rose-literature past or present, it is a valuable reference book which will give readers new insights into the world of old roses, and will in particular assist researchers in coming to grips with the contribution made by each breeder/introducer. The book is arranged alphabetically by breeder/introducer, with additional entries clarifying the geographic affiliations of the breeders. Nearly twenty years of constant use in writing my other books on old roses has honed this ocean of data into an efficient and accurate collection of information unavailable in this form anywhere else.

I'm not criticizing You Mr. Whitfield as an overall writer, but Beeperless Remote was awful! The characters were so unreal or were just overwritten.

I agree with one or two of the critics who said how it started off strongly, but then it just kinda died. I've also noticed a number of comparisons between this book and Michael Baisden's \\"Men Cry in the Dark,\\" which I loved. A good book will allow you to relate to the characters or at least remind you of someone you know. None of the bros I know or have ever hung out with have EVER acted with such naivete like the Shawn Wayne character. I mean, true, there's nothing wrong with being a shy bro, but come on, let's not be clueless. I did \\"get\\" what Van Whitfield set out to do, which was make an entertaining, light-hearted look at the dating scene from a bro's point of view.

The notion that there are only 6 types of women, ruffled my feathers, but since I identified with the \\"4s\\", I let it slide. However, how can a man spend an entire book JUST looking for a 6? Isn't that a bit crazy? Plus the idea that Shawn was 10 years out of the loop was far-fetching. Who says \\"Hey Bleed\\" instead of \\"Wassup Blood\\" or \\"yes Cousin\\" instead of \\"Ok Cuz?\\" It's incredible all of the slang terms he's not familiar with. The book starts well, but unfortunately ends on a disappointing note. We know from the first 2 pages that Shawn has a very large problem and on the last page - we know what that problem is. But we never know what happens with Troi and her good news or Dawn with her good news. Whitfield's \\"Something's Wrong with Your Scale\\" is a much better purchase than \\"Beeperless Remote\\" in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"HatedIt","review":"I hated this book. Once I finished it, I threw it across the room. We read it as a part of a book club, and no one liked the book. The characters were dull, and the story was uninteresting. The premise was unbelievable. I am sure there are men that judge women on whether or not they have cable, but those are the pathetic losers, like the main character, who are dateless. The dialogue was poor. The connections between the characters begged the questions why and how did these people end up together. When you don't have much time, and you enjoy reading, spending time on a book like this is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"This book had a slow start but towards the end it held my attention. It was hard for me to get past the first half of the book because of all of the outdated cliches and references to sports. However, the middle held my attention even though I found the main character, Shawn, to be unbelieveably naive/stupid when it came to most matters. It seemed that he was stuck in a time warp and never grew up and maybe that was the point. The ending was less than desirable because it leaves the reader with a lot of unanswered questions. I was hoping that there would be a part 2 just to find out what happens with Shawn.For those looking for a good book to read I would not recommend this one. It is slow in the beginning and has an unfinshed ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my taste","review":"Don't get me wrong, this book was somewhat funny, nonetheless, but I guess I don't read novels in place of the Sunday's newspaper comic section.

What a refreshing account of dating from an African-American male's perspective without the typical stereotypes involved. \\"Beeperless Remote\\" is so unexpectantly humorous, because if your single and dating, you've run in to (or bearly escaped with your life) some of the same situations no matter if you're male or female. After having read the book I also found myself pondering where I lined up on \\"Shawn Wayne's rating system\\" (and I also found myself catagorizing my friends)!

I too am an avid reader, like another reviewer I do try my level best to finish what I start. It was a 1998 Book Group choice and I just thought all the derogatory stuff was over the top.

I belong to 2 book groups and I had said that I was going to read this at the last meeting of one of them, but I plan to let them know that it's just not worth it. It offended my sensibilities. I guess I just don't get the black mentality or something, but I would not ever want to be spoken to the way the women are spoken to and referred to in this \\"book\\".

I don't think so. I agree w/the person who submitted the review below and asked if Shawn Wayne (the book's main character) was supposed to be a brotha of the '90's. As I read this, I thought the same thing. I never thought anyone on this earth could be so stupid as Shawn was. True, there were some scenes that were funny, but shouldn't I be laughing WITH the characters and not AT them? I can just hear people reading my personal review and saying, 'don't take it that seriously, it's just a book.' But to them I say that when I lay money out on the table to purchase something, I want the product to be worth my while, and this book simply was not. I took a friend's recommendation and checked out another book on relationships from the man's viewpoint, called \\"Men Cry in the Dark.\\" It's written by Michael Baisden and has characters I related to alot better.

Perhaps people not looking for something too \\"deep\\" might enjoy it, but as a reader who likes to be challenged, I was sorely disappointed. The only good thing about the book was my realization that in all my years of dating, I've yet to meet someone as patently stupid as the main character Shawn Wayne. Thank goodness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Feeling It","review":"I surrendered to the hype surrounding this book, and wish I had not. I would not recommend this book.

Shawn Wayne was a complete idiot. I sat there thinking to myself that there CAN NOT be brothas out there this stupid. True, \\"Men Cry\\" had some grammatical errors---but so did \\"Beeperless.\\" I was so disappointed, because the leader of the book club had hyped it up so much, comparing it to Terry McMillan's \\"Waiting to Exhale.\\" The ending to \\"Beeperless\\" is really what got me.

He's beyond clueless. He just ain't for real, and I don't mean ficticious. On the one hand he's astute enough to devise an intricate rating system for women. On the flip side, he's 99% dense on all matters excluding sports. He can recognize a Glock and its specifications, but to him Jesse Jackson is just some guy he saw on cable sports TV.

Please save your money, and don't buy this book. I like books that are funny, but Van Whitfield is not capable of making a book funny and realistic.

It wasn't even funny. THe main character, Shawn, was ignorant instead of funny. THe book jumped from scene to scene with no leadway. Dialouge was ridiculous and this rating system of women is dirogatory (but sometimes true). THen the ending leaves you hanging like a leaf in the wind.

However, I draw the line at referring to his work as anything but mindless minutia. Whitfield's novel is trite and shallow, which is also reflective of the main character, Shaun.

There are probably 100 good stories out there telling about the antics of a man, his beeper, and meeting women. The character Shawn was so naive that I ( honestly ) thougt maybe he was developmentally disabled. His funniest (and most believeable ) character flaw was his stingyness and how he got by in life. The funniest ( although still unbelievable )part of the book was when he couldn't dress for the black tie occassion, and when the lady at the same gala event flipped her wig ( so to speak ). If you are recovering from surgery( like I was) then this book is good enough to get you through the ordeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's get real!","review":"This book is filled with many holes. For starters how is it that a person, an African American, living in D.C., would not know Jesse Jackson. Secondly, Mr. Wane's entire basketball career is quite questionable. I mean this is suppose to be fiction, not FANTASY!!! There were just too many distractions in this book that kept me from focusing in on the plot, which once when I found wasn't worth discovering anyway. I think that the idea was a good one, but somewhere between Mr. Wane chasing after Troi and his fairy tales of \\"smoking\\" the Greatest Player to set foot on a basketball court in the NBA the story totally flopped! Sorry Mr. Wane but your story just doesn't wash. Lets just hope there isn't a sequel to this literary mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TOTAL WASTE!!!!!!!!!11","review":"This book was a total waste of money, time and effort.

Some people referred to this book as hilarious and I was anxious to laugh. Ha! That is such an exaggeration. This book was terrible. It was difficult to read because the main character was so annoying. The author thought by making his character dense that would get a laugh, but he went over board and made him brainless. Which made me as the reader angry."},{"rating":"2","title":"No believable but funny","review":"Ok this character is totally naive. There is no way any man on earth can be this stupid.

However, I was a little lost towards the end because I felt Troi should have stayed where she was, but what is a life about a man if he does not get caught out there.

My favorite tale from this book would have to be \\"The Little Mermaid\\", and it will be the first tale I read my children when they are born. Mr. Anderson was a firm believer in drama mixed with the hard knocks of real life.Here he has just transformed them into a fantastical story that every child needs to be told. The elements of the story are very powerful, from the loss of innocence to the loss of love,and sometimes we need a good dose of something that isn't wholesome.

Uh, I'd have to disagree.- The stories are so predictable (as in it follows the exact plot of the story that we've heard since we alittle listened to our parents) a.k.a. It doesn't bring anything new to the story.....or- It's based on a folklore I've never heard of and in effect the message of the tales fall flat.The only reason I'm keeping the book is for when I have kids a long way down the road I can pick a few of the stories out to read to them.

I was expecting details where St. Teresa gives almost none. One realizes why in the long run, simply that to give the details of HER experience would limit your thoughts on how God would interact with you. Yet, it is frustrating to read this and realize that she could be telling us so much more in regards to what she has been shown by God. I rate it 5 stars though because in the end one realizes that to find out what she knows, YOU are going to have to tread a likewise path...no freebies here. Therefore St. Teresa (really the Holy Spirit) is telling you no more than you need to know to become interested in following the path, and subsequently trodding that path. For those of us who are so used to getting on the Net and finding the easy way to solve a puzzle...well, God doesn't publish the Cheat Codes...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mirabai Starr not qualified to translate this wonderful work","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed in Mirabai Starr's translation.

She is quoted by many of my favorite authors. However, after 100 pages, I can go no further in this book. The translator clearly views things differently than the author and she changes words and phrases to fit her own viewpoint. In her introduction she describes these changes so the reader is warned. I've decided that I'd rather read a more accurate interpretation. For starters, it would help if the Christian references to God and Satan were kept.

She has so much insight to offer us. This book compares the soul to a castle with different rooms, which she calls mansions. Each mansion is a different stage of the soul on it's journey toward God. St. Theresa talks about seven mansions. As the soul passes from one mansion to the next the soul progresses toward God more completely.

It removes concepts that are central to St. Theresa's spirituality - the teachings of the Church, obedience to one's superior, struggles with Satan, sin and evil.DO read a faithful version.

The last mansion is the Interior Castle in which God dwells. In each succeeding mansion the soul reaches a higher level of sanctity and the attachment to the world decreases as the soul comes closer to God.Although some portions of the book describe experiences beyond the expectations of modern readers, this work still provides us all with an insight into a way to draw closer to God.

O'Bierne, however, shares with her husband Joe \\"Screw Iraq, it's about the Repubbies\\" O'Bierne one key scruple: loyalty to one's own, rather than to anything that might be loosely called accuracy. The book is cribbed from conservative souces, half quotes, and sheer fantasy, much the way the husband in the partnership tossed aside concerns about reality and hired instead exclusively Republican candidates for key positions in Coalition Provisional Authority.

She is right on when she says that the radical feminist agenda is severely damaging our education system, corporate America, sports and our family structure as we know it. I will definitely pass this book along to friends and family who, I hope, will enjoy it as much as I did. Keep up the good work, Kate!!

In both of my careers I have met a few women who, like Ms O'Beirne, say that they aren't feminists, but who, like Ms O'Beirne, take advantage of all of the choices that feminism has made possible for them. If Ms O'Beirne were true to her beliefs she would not have made a career as editor and writer, but would have remained at home caring for her house and family.

It's not a stylish book; it's written like a columnist for an opinion magazine writes. It's over the top on occasion, as insider writing tends to be. It's not deeply academic; I would have preferred more substance. But she is still largely right on the money about feminism's flaws.

You will learn a great deal about Kate O'Beirne. The portrait of her emerging from this book is not pretty. This woman has a truly ugly soul. She is filled with fear and loathing.Another thing; her obsession with Sex and the City as well as lesbianism is telling. Kate O'Beirne has some serious \\"issues\\".It is not feminists who are destroying the US military. It is the Bush administration. He has weakened our military to the point of putting troops in harms way without body armour. What is the point of mentioning facts though? O'Beirne is not interested in facts.

Three cheers for irony.What I find disturbing is that this is a woman arguing that women should be subservient to men, and that every advancement that's come about to further sexual equality is somehow an atrocity. This unnamed cousin to Stockholm Syndrome seems to run rampant among the women of the current brand of conservatives in the Republican party. Imagine a slave in the 1800s begging for heavier shackles.I guess the most repugnant thing about this book, though, is that she attacks feminism while at the same time benefiting from it at, what, [...]?

As recently as the 1970s, women in professional schools were a tiny minority, and had to fight against sexism every day. Now, Kate O'Beirne thinks that the women who helped make things better for women are, in fact, making the world worse. As many have pointed out, Ms. O'Beirne likely would not hold the position she does, or be able to have such a dreadful book published, without all the hard work of the feminists she decries. I guess now that Ms. O'Beirne has hers, the women following her can just step back into the 19th century.This book is utter crap.

In a word, ruining it. There are no hateful diatribes or attacks on the feminist leaders in this country, there is just example after example of how feminism is malevolently affecting our schools, our military, our sports, and our marriages. Feminism has eroded and overcome the facts of biology. Men and women are different, biologically, emotionally, physically, and those differences should be celebrated not exterminated. Ms. O'Beirne herself is a testament to what a modern day woman should be; she is confident, intelligent and ambitious but also is family-oriented and proud of her role as a woman and all that may entail.

Her position in this book reminds me of the legion of closeted gay GOP politicans who constantly pass repressed, hate filled judgements on homosexuals (and spiteful laws), while secretly being what they most despise in life.Ms O'Beirne's self-loathing of herself and strong thoughtful women leaps from the pages like someone who has lit her hair on fire and then trys to put it out with a hammer.The Lace Curtain Lady sounds as if she is dispensing missives and imagined wisdom to the pitiful Shanty Towne Chattel of the delicate sex who should be grateful for her Pious Prattle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focussed on trivialities","review":"This book isn't much different in content from her TV appearances.

Somewhere after the first half of the movie, Purim is changed to Thanksgiving. One of the actresses is told that there is a rumor on the Internet that the film will be nominated for an Oscar.

The interface is absolutely nothing like Quicken. Figure on spending hours to acheive a basic familiarity.2. It's a typical Microsoft product. That means the software tries to outsmart you rather than letting you work the way you want to.3. The interface is way too cluttered. At every turn Microsoft is trying to sell you something - insurance, mortgages, baked apples, whatever. It's like working on a billboard.4. To use Money you have to sign up for various external services, like Net Passport or whatever it's called - a real pain.5.

The magnetic bread is a nice touch, but it only holds together if the sandwich has less than three slices, and not at all if lettuce or tomato are used. I would probably not buy this again, because it's a bit frustrating for the kids when the sandwich falls apart more often than it sticks together.Another note: Haba has begin manufacturing in China. I purchased this set thinking it was made in Germany and was quite surprised to find that it was actually made in China.

In this case the author is Anne Fremantle, a long time interpreter of the Middle Ages. She was a scholar, teacher and journalist who was a convert to Catholicism.This is not school textbook history. Europe in the Middle Ages (about 500 AD to 1450 AD) is presented as a coherent whole, a cultural entity not yet split into East and West. This is popular history to entertain without controversy or distortion: the rise of urban life, the power of the guild, the troubadours, the role of knights, the age of cathedrals and castles, the crusades and the monastic life. What a relief that feudalism and theological differences are explained painlessly. The picture essays, always a strength of Time-Life publications, are complemented by the author's feeling for the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"History repeats itself","review":"The powers that be in the good old USA seem to have read this book and borrowed a few tricks from it.

Yes, it is being done to immigrants all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Book Ever Written","review":"I have the full three volume set of the Gulag that I read years ago. It is the greatest book ever written. In portraying Communism, as he described as man's inhumanity to man, Solzhenitsyn has an exceptional ability while depicting the excessively cruel treatment of human beings in the Gulag to demonstrate his dignity and the dignity of those who suffered at the hands of their oppressors. The entire book is full of stories of the courage of human beings in the face of such evil. In that way, while depicting the horrible conditions of the Gulag, the book ultimately provides an uplifting message that peace and kindness are enduring human traits that can and do shine through despite overwhelming attempts to erase them. Never has there been a more courageous and humane writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work that Makes You Think - \\"Thank God I wasn't there!\\"","review":"I read this work while doing research in preparation for my senior Western Civilization presentation. Most students struggle to locate primary sources of any merit, it was not so when I found The Gulag Archipelago. Not only did I find that it provided me with an understanding of the Soviet penal system, Solzhenitsyn also manages to bring his words to life using his own experiences and recognizing his own faults. I would recommend this book to any student who didn't mind wading through long tirades and could fully appreciate the style the author uses to make his statement."},{"rating":"2","title":"a CLASSIC but not accurate","review":"Applebaums recent work 'Gulag' has used much more recent data and 'the Black Book of CUmmunism\\" is a good resource as a compendium to reading this classic book on the horrors of communism. Solzhenitsyn(a russian nationalist) was onbe oft he first to write on the Soviet Gulag, a system that had 10-20% of the country in camps throughout Siberia, crimea and northenr russia, building all manner of projects like the White Sea Canal. Communism enslaved its own people, worse then the Tsar had done, and used them to create a 'socialist paradise'.

It's 100% pure reaganaut political propaganda, of the same brand that the neocons sold us on Iraq. It's sweet and silly and full of touching fables. Of course, every event depicted was either totally fabricated or distorted beyond recognition. Now that the USSR has been dismantled, plenty of government archives are now available. Will anyone fact-check this book? No. The wall is down, and there is no further need of it. It served its purpose. There are 66 million lies in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much whining","review":"This is a boring book about a guy who goes to prison in the Soviet Union. Throughout the book, the author whines incessantly about getting a bum rap. He believes that he was wrongfully imprisoned (That's a new one).According to the author, he was imprisoned for criticizing the Soviet government in a letter that he wrote to a friend. But his story is not believable to me. I'm sure there is something that he isn't telling us.He also complains a lot about the unpleasant conditions in prison.Newsflash: Prison isn't supposed to be fun. People who are in prison should do their time and not complain about it.There are three huge volumes in The Gulag Archipelago saga. I only read the first (unabridged) volume. Maybe the abridged version is better. I don't know.

Although I hated her on Tell me I'm not dreaming (1995) and liked her on Hobo (1997), I wasn't sure whether she would evolve in something more than an interpreter of songs written by others. She clearly has made a ninety degrees turn in her handling of the material she likes and you can hear that she is content with this new approach; she literally has found her own way of making music. Due to the astonishing sound quality of the Chesky brothers (it's even better than on Hobo, which in comparison sounds a bit thin and distant), her voice is warm and compelling, the band is topnotch as usual and the arrangements are superb. Listen especially to A Whiter Shade of Pale, originally done by Procol Harum, and hear what Sara K. does with this too familiar song. She gives it back it's classical origin (the theme is from Bach) and here too, the accordion is marvelous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Key remote","review":"This one does not come programmed.

Along with almost all the other songs, it has been a change, a punk to an almost perfect representation of alternative rock (but the album formally named \\"bleed american\\" is the transformation's new spawn) Note: if \\"bleed american\\" is your first album by [J.E.W.], this album is different and may take some getting used to.

While it was a brilliant move to save money wasted on studio time people may feel betrayed at the loss of quality. It's a really decent recording regardless. 3 stars.2) Music: I love the music on this CD. You get the full spectrum. Styles range from mellow sleepers to the all out rockers that you'd come to expect. As all other owners of this CD know, a special shout out goes to track three. 5 stars.I'm going with the five star rating as I value the music much more. I love the variety. That's all. Buy it, you die hards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Disappointment","review":"I've been a Scooby Doo fan all my life. I've seen every incarnation of the show, all the movies from the 80's and all the recent movies including Zombie Island, Alien Invaders, etc. This is definitely one of the worst of the group, in my opinion. The villain in this movie has a very cheesy name, the music stinks and the end is very convoluted. Watching the Scooby Doo movies has been a strange experience, Of the 5 that I've seen I loved 2 of them. The other three, including this one, stink! if you're a Scooby Doo Fan, don't bother"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is great","review":"This Scoody-Doo gets 5 Scooby snacks.

This one is a bit different with some changes that are really good to see. Casey Kasem is back doing Shaggy's voice, which is definitely fantastic (though it does leave me wondering where this leaves Scott Innes because, frankly, I thought he did a GREAT job in the other movies). But, they have also brought back all of the old familiar background tunes from the 70's cartoons. And, the opening sequence on the ship with the Scooby theme playing is perfectly retro. The vampires are a very modern twist (not at all \\"dracula\\" looking- but also not bad).The extra features on the DVD are really good (several Scooby \\"music videos\\" and a make-your-own monster game) - my son had a great time with them.Even my husband sat happily through the entire movie, which is truly saying something! 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Casey's back!","review":"With the infinite commercials on Cartoon network, my 4 yr old had to be first in line for this one. Casey Kasem is back as the voice of Shaggy along with the retro animation makes the movie.The animation is more like the late 60's series than the recent new Scooby Doo movies. The detail is not present in the sets. backgrounds etc., but the look is classic right down to Freddy's ascot.Definitley worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"glad I just rented it!","review":"We here in my household are all fans of the animated Scooby Doo series.

Neither realizes initially that the rescue will be on multiple levels and she will need healing beyond what her body requires to recover from the sunburn and other physical effects resulting from her castaway status. Her father, an American like her, is lost at sea with his ship, her heart has been broken by a suitor who spurned her, and her entire future is up in the air. Fortunately, much to his surprise, Nicholas and the love that she awakens in his heart, are exactly what Julianna needs. Together, they work to solve a mystery and find a new life.** Though this story does have much potential, it falls a bit short of realizing it. The mystery is injected awkwardly into the romance and the end feels rushed. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"WILD GUITAR FLAILING ROCK AND ROLL IS BACK!","review":"The Gaza Strippers have resaturated a world full of pop and junk with their unique brand of high energy guitar frenzied music. It it good to see that these bands still exist and I hope to God they don't sell out to the Hollywood record execs just quite yet. They are in what I can describe as \\"the best point in a music career to be in\\" because we're not seeing them in the big corporate barns. I enjoy the energy they draw off the crowds in the small venuee. Gaza Strippers are definitely a rock and roll institution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad. Derivative, unoriginal.","review":"The Didjits were a much better band. You'd think from their antics and attitude the Gaza Strippers would have something to say - but they don't - their sound is like garbled Kiss or Cheap Trick at best - but they fluff it up with uncompelling cheesy machismo that ruins the gimmic.

I'll never know.","review":"I still cannot believe that this album has recieved so many negative remarks. The style of music on this album is almost exactly the same as the material on their previous albums. My belief is that people started trashing this album because of the release of Slayer's \\"Hell awaits\\" during the same year. Somehow, people thought that Slayer's music was more competent musically than Venom's. Anyway, I think that there is a great deal of musical competency displayed here, especially in the guitar work. Mantas belts out some tight, energetic solos throughout the album. The best soloing is evident on \\"Powerdrive\\", \\"Flytrap\\", \\"Harmony dies\\", \\"Hellchild\\", and \\"Mystique\\". Although this is my least favorite of the classic albums, I think that it is still a great buy for fans of classic metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great customer service!!","review":"I emailed the company to check status.

I bought these as a stop-gap to actual orthotics to straighten out my knees and the Walk Fits radically affected my gait, stride and shape on my foot. The podiatrist I finally got to see scolded me for making my orthotics a much more expensive proposition by first wearing a non-specific insole that did not address my feet, but rather was a commercial One Size Fits All.I'd be very very careful about putting these in your shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great orthotics","review":"These orthotics are the best for the price.

I have nothing but praise and complete satisfaction with the way they've worn over the years. Walking, jogging, sprinting with them gives me a solid and stable feel. The reason I bought two more of them was that I just got tired of pulling them out of the shoes from one to the other. Now I don't have to do this with three sets of Phase 4 Orthodics. At the beginning it took a while for me to get used to the raised arches but now I don't wear any shoe without them inside.

I have severely flat feet from years of doing courier work, on my feet for 10-14 hours a day. These inserts put my feet, ankles, and knees back inline. They also help with lower back pain. The only complaint I have is because they are so ridged, they tend to cause heal pain by the end of the day. For me it's worth that discomfort for the other benefits. If you're not use to wearing ridged inserts. They will take some time to break in and get use to. I owned a pair of these year's ago and couldn't wear them because they were very painful. Now that I am 40 years old and my feet are worse than they were then. These are the best solution for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walk Fit Orthotic insoles","review":"I ordered the insoles to fit my work boots. The heel support was good.

The arches in my feet are high, but not that damn high, good lord! I took the blue middle section out, and they STILL hurt like hell. They're just not for me...at. all.

In this series our protagonists are a Priestly Friar named Brother Athelstan, and that Falstaffian great Sir John Cranston, who is the Coroner of London.The two are greatly different- Athelstan is thin, studious, and abstinent, while Sir John is fat and a notorious imbiber (An early Nero Wolfe perhaps?). But they are united by a love of justice and a nose for a mystery. In some ways they have a Holmes-Watson relationship, but Sir John is no dummy, he has a sharp mind hidden under that flagon of ale.What makes this series great is the relationship between the two characters, and the cast of fools, villains and knaves that they encounter. Also well done is the setting- London in the 1380's is no garden spot, there is great suffering.Those who like historical mysteries should try one of the books in this series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Devil's Domain","review":"This was the first book I read of this author and the series.I did not like it much, I found the characters rather unattractive, and the story line also not very exciting.I love medieval thrillers, and I read many and enjoyed manyof them (the delightful series of Priscilla Royal, the three books of Jason Vail, and currently Peter Tremayne), and found the characters delightful, well defined and easy to like.But I did not like this particular story and the characters involved, and I had difficulties following.I guess Dominican monks are not very attractive to me...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devil's Domain review","review":"A great quick read, full of mystery, humor, and a bit of history from 14th century London.

After giving it a listen I was really suprised how polished they were. the tracks: COLD, GET UP 52 and JESUS COME UP got my attention right away and are solid heavy hard hitting songs.CORTIZONE does have their own sound and I'm thankful I bought this cd.

I was very pleased when I received it. It is very bright, more like a good flash light then an LED light.

The extra light is a good trade off.I haven't actually measured the battery life but I use the lamp at full power and change the batteries about every 2 weeks.

Maybe it's because I used an Ultimate Lithium 8x set of batteries (which really are more powerful aaa batteries than alkalines), but even if an alkaline might not have kept the single last LED lighted after turn-off (visibly) like the Lithium batteries did (and I don't know this), I would still suspect it of draining the batteries.

Probably why it's half-price. Why can't the Chinese manufacture stuff that works pretty well. It took a vicegrip to get into the battery compartment. Did they think no one would ever need to open it or didn't they care? Thank goodness I wasn't out camping and needed to change the batteries. It would be dangerous in the woods unless you were carrying pliers as well as batteries.A rubber headband is included but to use it you have to cut off the elastic headband. You can't alternate between them.Amazon needs to put a Made in China warning on a Made in China product.

I bought this light about 2 years ago because it's got adjustable lumens and it's a Streamlight with a lifetime warranty. I was very happy with it in the beginning but then the tilt screw kept coming loose. Then the strap bracket broke and I had to tape the band on. Then the hinge that holds the light to the band broke. The battery cap is also cracked. It does, however, produce great light and the batteries last a long time. I would only recommend this light to the occasional user not someone who uses them everyday all day. I have sent this light in for warranty and was told over the phone it would be at least 3 weeks so I'll have to buy another because I can't go that long without it. Let's hope the warranty is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lights","review":"This is a great light for the price.

It perfects the sensitive art of quotation and distillation, and the chronological arrangement of the encyclopedic material turns all of history into a common dialogue upon one of the very greatest ideas and problems there is to perplex and fascinate the mind and surround us with the mystery of natural possibilities that are both crazy and sublime. The book itself is like a universe of stellar minds contemplating the inverse puzzle of why there is life on Earth or any life at all.

We put it next to our pool for dramatic reflection and it's awesome to swim below it and gets a huge reaction from our friends. We were worried blower would be noisy but it's pretty quiet and does not interfere with sound. Resolution is great, and just shy of best sharpest quality. We noted though that the projector does say 'indoor use only'! One complaint is there are no directions to help you set up and cable between speakers is only 2 feet!

Very tasteful decor throughout, without a lot of stuff you don't need, with room for a few pictures in each section, and envelopes for mementos, I think this will be a keepsake the couple I chose it for will cherish throughout their life.

Five seconds later, they launched into the main chorus of \\"Oasis\\" and I said wow, this is weird. I eventually realized it was Puya, and their set was great. I've never heard (or seen) anything like it. The next day, I rushed out and bought Fundamental. What a great disc. It has Santana mixed with Biohazard.

They are talented at playing Latin music, and they are talented at playing metal. But when you combine the two, the result is completely unlistenable. I wish they would stick with the metal sound, then I would like their music. But the way it is, half of it sounds like Ricky Martin, and the other half reminds me of Static-X. Puya were on of the worst bands at Ozzfest '99. Their music is way too choppy, and will probably not be listened to much by people who like either genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"RABIOSO\\"","review":"This combination of jazz, hardcore, hip-hop, salsa and others rythms plus bilingual lyrics makes this album a most in your collection no matter where are you from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sproul's best","review":"I was disappointed since I have enjoyed other books by the same author.

He shares much about themes like the esoteric teachings hidden within the New Testament, the Fourth dimension, sacred geometry, dreams, yoga, hypnosis, and some of Ouspensky's own travels in search of the miraculous. It is well worth reading both as a preparation for studying the teachings of Gurdjieff and also in its own right. Ouspensky was a deep thinker and had much to share.

From collectivization, to Stalin's brutal purges, to invasion by Nazis, to the dark restless sleep of the soul inspired by Brezhnev, the Communist years were not kind to the Russians. From the tsar to Yeltsin, Moynihan offers a clear mix of history and analysis that makes this a quick read. Still, the chapter on Russia's war with Germany unfolds like the blitzkrieg, and if you're looking for details, this is not your book. Moynihan paints with very broad strokes and does not attempt to get into the minds of the Russian people. Given that they were treated as nothing more than neccessary cogs in Stalin's megalomaniacal drive to modernize a peasant state, it would be nice to know more about their perspective. Nonetheless, this is a lucid narrative of a century's worth of troubles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Photography of Russia & the former Soviet Union","review":"I was introduced to this book by my Russian language & literature professor at college.

The author wears his heart on his sleeve most of the time - his distaste for the ideology is always to the fore. He neglects to examine the confusion and fear of many older people when communism collapsed. The pace means that some human interest stories are passed over or only briefly visited - The basement in Ekaterinberg, Stalins body in the mausoleum, Khruschevs' fall from power, etc. But this leaves you with the desire to investigate these areas further.

Well, actually, the foreplay, because Terri Hamilton, the homicidal maniac egged on by her evil angel, is mostly into titillation, and even the saner people -- her soon-to-be ex-husband Jack and his new flame Hilary -- can't get much beyond foreplay before Terri breaks in to spoil their tryst.

The romance part of this book was so sappy I could hardly stand it. The plot was the overworked Tailhook Scandal reborn .I would suggest..oh never mind. I will never read another one of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"Lindsay McKenna has done a great job with her romance/mystery novel. I hope that she will be asked to do more. Her characters are well developed and the story line is current. She skillfully weaves the romance and the murder mystery together. The flow of the story is well done. The ending is a surprize and I forced myself not to peek at the ending.The romance is sweet and builds from dislike to love. This is typical in a McKenna story. One hint about the hero is that he is from Missouri. This is a delightful interlude and helps to relieve tense situations within the story.This is a must have book for any Lindsay McKeena fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"MS Money 2002 is still better","review":"I will not upgrade from 2002 version, even though invoices are not very customisabe.

Lots of real-world examples, with side-by-side comparisons of different queries that all produce the same result via different methods. It is easy to apply these techniques in my work. I have six books from Oracle Press, and while they are good as reference material, I find myself using them basically for syntax or server tuning, and never for PL/SQL tuning. Guy Harrison's book is a permanent fixture on my desk; this book covers table access methods, how to avoid unnecessary table scans, how to use TKPROF (with some excellent ratios and things to look for in the output), etc. The list goes on.

For a manual of this price, couldn't the publisher have inserted the new pages prior to shipment? I found this added work frustrating and time consuming.While most of the manual reads like much like a legal textbook as opposed to a practical guide (not many examples), the single sample private placement offering and exhibits were useful.

The bottom compartment that holds the fish stays in the water, but the top part (the door that you put the fish through) is plastic and stays at the surface. We had about 20 sunfish and bluegill in it and it had no problem floating. I doubt we'll lose it again. :)To sum it up, it works perfect (like the old one we had) and has the tremendous improvement of floating/staying at the surface => no more losing it on the bottom of the lake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fish basket is now broken in with lots of crappie","review":"Basked came as specified and was used immediately for holding crappie from a nearby lake.Thank you Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disturbing twist on Star Wars","review":"I picked up this book looking to fill in the gaps between episodes. Unfortunately this is the only one between IV and V. At first I had a lot of trouble with the writing style, very bland and boring. Then the author began to throw his own imagination into a plot that was begun by someone else. Luke and Leia act like children and do not show the maturity they did in A New Hope. The authors characters seem to be totally different people. Next with the addition of Luke and Leia's foreplay, I almost couldn't stomach the implications. Even after taking into account that the author did not know where the story was going in later movies, I found his writing style difficult to enjoy due to its simplicity and lack of good character development. If you are looking for a good Star Wars read and not concerned with reading them all, I would suggest skipping over this one because the tone does not fit in with the rest of the saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool","review":"a book about luke and Leia having an adventure together. I liked how they had to work together to get off the planet. But the best part was when Darth Vader showed up. Leia totally kicked butt.

A fun and fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This RETRO Star Wars Read is a must for serious fan.","review":"I remember my joy at finding this in a grocery store after the first star wars thinking it was the sequel to be ( because Vader and luke were on the cover, I don't think it actuall said Star Wars on the first run) as it happens Lucas hired Foster to write a potentially low budget follow up to New Hope in case the first was not a Financial success and he needed to continue with little or no studio backing. The universe feels streamlined too, no Han or Chewy, and Luke and Leia's behavior may seem creepy in hindsight . This may not be as easily canon as other SW books of late, but a must read for the fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure balony!!!!","review":"This book was worse than Bantha dung! The characters were totally flat and two - dimensional. Leia depends on Luke for EVERYTHING! As my favorite character, I should know that that is not her personality at all!

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"the force is not in this book","review":"I am the biggest Star Wars fan in the world and I love everything about it but this book makes me sick.

And thier is so many things that dont make sense compared to the SW movies (ex. Leia has no power in the force) that I just couldnt read the rest it disgusted me... If you like SW and dont care about how it follows up with the other episodes than you might like this book....I didn't"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT READ!!!","review":"Not worth reading unless you actually need to know everything there is to know about star wars. This takes place between A New Hope & The Empire Strike Back. Lets face it, between those two time periods Luke had no more control over the force than an acorn & somehow in this book he is not only able to stand up to Vader & live but actually win in a saber duel. I mean come on, even those little Padawans in episode 2 could have killed Luke. With all that aside I say this is a horrible book, a disgrace to Star Wars & a shame that it was ever written. I give this book one star & im even being generous with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh brother! (insert eye roll)","review":"I have read almost every Star Wars book out there and this was the worst, ok maybe tied with The Crystal Star. I can't believe all the great reviews this got. It seems like the characters personalities kept changing throughout the book. Also, although Luke just got a few lesson from Kenobi and had not even been to see Yoda yet, somehow he has this tremendous skill with a lightsaber. Oh please. This is the only Star Wars book that I actually threw away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this","review":"This book would be 5 stars if it wasn't for two things: Darth Vader kills people with his lightsaber, not at the throat force thing and, (2): Luke keeps telling Leia that she has no force talent, but she does, so she SHOULD be able to feel the Kalibur Crystal through the force! That makes me mad, because I am obssessed with Star Wars and everything that remotely relates to SW. If you don't get mad about little things like that, than this is OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a turd","review":"This is the wost SW book I have eve read.

Not good either.","review":"This book takes place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. It was interesting, but not the best by far. Leia, escorted by Luke, was on her way to Circarpous to enlist their Rebel underground in the battle against the Empire. Thier ships crash on a jungle planet known as Mimban. Hidden on the planet was a crystal that had controlable power over the force. Now, with Vader on the planet, Luke and Leia have to race to find it. Along with the two droids, their new friend Halla, and two Yuzzems.In this book, you can tell Luke and Leia have a strong connection with each other. They pretty much stay in character, except they act like a bunch of little kids. Han Solo and Chewbacca are left out. Which was dissapointing to me, since Han is my favorite character. All in all, this was a decent book that all fans should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I nice change of pace","review":"This book was written before Ep. 5 and 6 so it has a different feel to it then the other books. After reading many of the others it has a different and interesting feel to it considering many elements that we now know about certain characters in the star wars universe where not known at the time this book was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too unrealistic","review":"The book starts off as realistic and normal, as one would expect after A New Hope. By the end, it is completely unrealistic. There is no way things would take place as they did. Vader being so emotional? Never. While he was more emotional in A New Hope than any other time, he still was far colder than shown here. In Empire, Vader is pure darkness and evil, perhaps shown best when he jumps down at Luke during their duel, flying from above, like a dark raven. He has almost no dialogue in comparison, and the thought of him doing and saying all he did in Mind's Eye is not realistic. Vader did not seem all that strong in Mind's Eye, and Luke and Leia seemed stronger than they should have. In reality, Vader could have cut all of them up almost instantly. Luke had almost no training, and Leia none. Way too unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEAUTIFUL COVER ART","review":"I read this novel the instant it came out. Everyone was starving for more Star Wars. Most of us mistakenly thought the sequel to the movie was going to be based on this book, but happily, it wasn't. Its been many years since I read this book but I distinctly remember feeling it was all wrong. The stakes in this story are very small. HOWEVER, in spite of not liking the book, I still have it on my bookshelf twenty years later, because the cover art is AWESOME! It was the coolest star wars illustration around at the time, and still is a classic. there have been several covers for this novel, but the one I had featured a silhouette of Darth against a foggy forest, with Luke and Leia cowering in the foreground by a glowing red crystal. Save yourself the money, and just do a google search and look at the cover. Its very cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First remove the plank from your own mind's eye...","review":"Set between the films \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\" and \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" This is a good book, though a trifle shorter than the other Star Wars books.

With clear examples throughout, we are gradually shown a way of being that is truly revolutionary based on real presence and respect for ourselves and our fellow humans. The wonderful charts on 'Needs' and 'Feelings' alone are a gift and a reminder of how challenging it can be for many of us to truly know how we are feeling at any given time and what the real needs are behind the feeling. Allowing ourselves to acknowledge our feelings and supporting us to find constructive ways to meet our needs can only enhance all of our relationships leading to a world that is based on mutual respect and love.

In almost every case (the cases in which the person actually read the book!) the person had a very similar experience to my own. This book will help you see communication (and relationships) in a whole new way. As a therapist I have found this book to be helpful to clients with anger management difficulties and problems with conflict in relationships. It also promotes self-awareness and self-acceptance. It takes practice, but once you understand and internalize the general attitude promoted in this book, it sticks. And then it seeps into your life like a soothing balm.

I know it does not contain all the answers for life but it is a place to start. If you deal with anger issues this would be a good book to help you rethink your responses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non Violent Communication","review":"Nonvioldent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg is the foundation text for those who are interested in communicating in an effective manner. Not to give it all away - the book teaches how to use empathy to connect with others, hear and get heard and ultimately reach agreements where no one loses and everyone wins. Yes, this is a tall order and Marshall Rosenberg delivers. I recommend this CD without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"An indispensable reference, a book I return to","review":"Although it is not easy to assimilate linearly (i.e. in one sitting), this book's an indispensable reference for me. The listing of human emotions ALONE justifies the price of the entire book. From rereading it, I've learned: emotional literacy, to readily identify my own judgments, and more.For NVC learners, I recommend listening to Marshall on CDNonviolent Communication- hearing his stories in that format allowed me to learn the material much better than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Nonviolent Communication has helped me.","review":"I got so much out of this book, I have never been able to communicate with anyone without it becoming an argument or a fight. I was never able to listen to what people were feeling and to what they were trying to tell me. After reading this book,I am now able to listen to what people are trying to tell me. I understand their feelings and thier needs. This book has really changed my way of communicating. Since I've read this book, My wife and I have not had any problems communicating. It is a welcome change, there is a calm feeling between us and I find it very enjoyable. I hope that anyone who may have a problem communicating, will read this book and I hope it has the same effect on you that it has had on me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, but useful","review":"This book doesn't have a lot of concepts, but the framework that it presents for difficult communication situations is very useful. The author also uses a lot of examples to illustrate how the model is used.Personally, I found there were too many examples in the book for my taste and I got tired of reading them. However, I know some people really relate to this approach and it does drive the model into memory.In terms of material, I think there are lots of other good books on the subject out there that pack more material into the same space. However, for people who want an easy model, quick and enjoyable read and some concepts they can apply right away, then this might be just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful skills, but poorly written","review":"I didn't really like this book. Although the skills described are useful, the author's style is incredibly condescending and arrogant. I felt like a dumb child at the back of the class all the way through. And some of the examples given of \\"real life\\" situations are ridiculous. As if you would ever, in a group of people at a function, tell the person talking that you find what they are saying to be unnecessary and uninteresting. Well, not if you don't mind not having any friends or business contacts. Honesty should only go so far in my opinion. I'm sure there are many other better books if you want to learn some good communication skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ","review":"This book is a wonderful read.I love the premise but the actual implementation is a little tricky!

It is much sturdier than the last one I bought from another source. It's easy to use and comfortable on my head. There are three light strengths, yet surprisingly the highest setting appears to be lower in intensity although it spreads the light beam over a wider area. The straps are well constructed and easily adjustable. It also includes the over the head strap to keep it from sliding down your head. I did not give it five stars only because of the high beam intensity."},{"rating":"1","title":"too expensive for a piece of one-time-use plastic","review":"1- To use rubber straps you have to completely destroy the elastic ones, because they are permanently attached to the headlamp base.2- The plastic notch that is holding the lamp in the tilted position is flimsy.3- No instructions.Does not justify the price, I am very disappointed.Edit: (1) above is not correct, you can remove elastic straps easily...

The description indicated that i was ordering a pack of 6. It was only ONE pie plate. This leaves me VERY short in supply for the lab I was intending to complete with my class tomorrow. It also makes the cost incredibly higher being I was only getting one when I thought I was getting 6.

The waist strap is a little too thin for comfort. The elastic bands to adjust the length of the waist band don't stay in place and almost every time you take the pack on or off you must readjust it. The water bottle holder is too short and if you shift your weight sharply or bend over, the bottle falls out. I had to attach the bottle cap strap to the top handle of the pack with a carabiner to compensate. When full, the water bottle holder unbalances the pack to one side, which is a little annoying for longer walks.

The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics retains the virtues of the original edition but adds extensively to it in order to deal with the profound changes in critical practice that took place since the structural revolution.

It at times seems so comprehensive and detailed as to make understanding of its entries possible. It is in fact so overwhelming sometimes that it confuses by telling much more than I, at least, need or want to know.

However, after watching I learned how good the film itself really is! It is absolutely perfect comedic timing! Perfect cast! Silly little subplots! Cameo appearanes include: Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, Terry-Thomas, Jayne Mansfield, Sid Caesar, Carl Reiner, Joey Bishop, and Wally Cox. The title song, performed by The Turtles, was composed by John Williams with lyrics by Leslie Bricusse.ORDER THIS CLASSIC 1967 GEM FOR PURE \\"FAMILY FRIENDLY\\" ENTERTAINMENT!!!!

And what a movie treat to have Robert Morse, who is always at his best, playing the role of Matthau's mentor. This movie was a WOW! The plot is ingenious, not only about cheating in marriage, but about lessons from a professional cheater, creating very sophisticated skits from a stable of comedy stars including Art Carney, Wally Cox [Remember Mister Peepers?], Joey Bishop, Sid Caesar,Jack Benny, Carl Reiner, Phil Silvers, that Magnificent Man in the Bedroom of Errant Brassiers--Terry-Thomas, and Lucille Ball.

The guide is truly believable - I've seen it in action with a family member, and it worked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted, campy fun","review":"This is a sweet little gem I'd never heard of before doing an Amazon search. Walter Matthau's adorable naive performance as a rookie in the cheating lifestyle is complemented by cameos from some of the best-known stars of the time. My favorite was a couple played by Lucille Ball and Art Carney.This movie made me smile from beginning to end. It was more clever than laugh-out-loud funny like the Sunshine Boys.One caveat: the movie, made in 1967, is very dated. All women in the movie are portrayed as va-va voom sex objects, obedient faithful wives or occasionally as vindictive and money grabbing opportunists. As a feminist I was able to overlook this and enjoy the film. But if over-the-top sexism will ruin your enjoyment, pick another of the dozens of hilarious Walter Matthau movies on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars for funny plus 1 for nostalgia","review":"Not the laugh riot I remembered but still some classic bits, especially the Joey Bishop \\"deny, deny, deny\\" scene.

Not that todays music doesn't all have that. These are sounds of my generation and the people from my era can attest that this music had special meaning.

This set is difficult to understand and not formated in a user friendly manner. My biggest frustration is the multiple lessons on each track of the CD - making it very difficult to go back and repeat just what you need to listen to again rather than all of the lessons in a segment. To follow their lessons as intended you would have to constantly go between the book and the CD, making it very difficult to make much progress while driving. I ultimately purchased another French CD to replace this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for intermediate learners!","review":"This review refers to the CDs: I have about 6 years of junior high/high school French, so I would consider myself intermediate but by no means fluent. The CDs were great in helping me with my pronunciation and listening skills (as an Anglophone my pronunciation is horrible), and I was able to review one lesson a day during my daily car commute. I like the fact that the speakers are actual French speakers, although the background noises were indeed distracting and made it hard to hear at times.The problem with other CDs I've tried were that they repeated boring conjugations that would never stick. At least with learning from this CD if you misconjugate, the listener would at least understand what you mean. This CD was actually fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is Shastro not as well known as he should be","review":"I notice Shastro's CDs get good reviews yet when i discuss music among fans of this type of music, they say they have not heard of him.

As the reviews mention, the light around the mirror is virtually non-existent - in fact, you won't notice the light is on unless the room is totally dark! I thought that maybe the people who wrote those reviews were expecting salon-level light and I thought I'd be fine with just a reasonable amount of light, but this mirror is virtually no different from my old one, which did not have a light.I should mention that it is sturdy and the magnification is quite good, so I'm torn between wanting to keep it and being so frustrated with the fact that it has no lighting to speak of.

The father-son conflict and characters are very well portrayed, and the plot is exciting. What I liked in the book is pretty much everyone else should have liked: the suspense and thrill. What I did not like in the book is the simplicity and sheer impossibility of some of Orlov brothers' proposed schemes in the begining of the book (selling Russian blood to US? Come on, what about old classics like weapons or nuclear triggers?); and (being Turkish) the depiction of Turkey as a criminal heaven where every official can be bribed, and nothing works. Mr. Le Carre, it isn't so.In short, the book makes really great reading. I advise it to all fans of the genre, and the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I heard rumours he was a good writer.....","review":"I read a lot of Mysteries and Thrillers by Connolly, Lehane, Burke, Hiassen, Sandford, etc., etc., and I have always heard very good things about LeCarre. While reading this book, I thought perhaps he was too \\"sophisticated\\" for my tastes, and that I didn't get it. Wrong. It was just tedious. LeCarre decides to change directions in the story, and does an exceptionally poor job of setting it up. Hey, lets just hop over to Russia from Turkey, and nobody will ever know we are there. Gimme a break. I was hoping in the end that everyone would get shot. I'd hate to think this book may reproduce a sequal. I'll stick to stories about good ole U.S. gumshoes and Florida freaks. Sophistication is not all it is hyped up to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly needs an editor","review":"This book is a jumble, much longer than it had to be, filled with extraneous (and useless) detail. It simply does not grab your attention and carry you forward like Le Carre's earlier books did. You get sidetracked by the detail, which does not add anything to the story line. I wound up attempting to skim the most egregious parts because they were so boring. This book could have used a strong editor to force Le Carre to re-write and focus the story line. If you loved Le Carre's spy stories, you're going to be very disappointed with this attempt. I sure hope his next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single & Single","review":"I'm 60 pages into this book & one word seems to fit: OBTUSE. Perhaps if someone has the patience to sit down & blast past the jumbled first chapters in one sitting it will make more sense.

I also have a speed reading course I want to take & think I will use this book as fodder for the course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again a wonderful book by Le Carré","review":"Why write a lengthy review of this book. Yes there are shades of characters in this book we seem to have met before, but I do not care. This is Le Carré again at his very best and I loved it.

This one was prominently displayed, I read the back cover, it seemed OK so I bought it. It stinks. Period. It can be read about a minute a page, it's like a short story, and it's bad. BAD. Dumb silly pap for the mass market. Instead of bringing it back home with me, I threw it in the garbage, where it belongs. I can't believe Le Carre wrote this garbage. He used to be good. This is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not be more disappointed","review":"I am a big fan of thrillers (Graham Greene, Robert Ludlum, Ken Follett, Frederick Forsyth)--doubly so if they are well-done literary thrillers, so you can imagine my excitement when people recommended Le Carre to me as one of the great masters. So it was with great disappointment that I read Single & Single. The novel never rises above the conventional thriller: the predictable killings, the now mundane concept of the strained relationship between the protagonist and his father. Worse, and I admit that it might be just me, I found a lot of it ludicrous. Single detests his father and that lifestyle so much that he leaves it to become a clown and make animal balloons? Too bad that this was my first Le Carre novel (even my friends who are Le Carre fans told me that they didn't like this particular one). My friends tell me that I need to give one of his better novels, like Tinker, Sailor, Soldier, Spy a chance instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"used in immaculate condition/grate novel","review":"A grate novel.

Furthermore, the condition of the used book is immaculate, and i received it, as part of the whole order, earlier than stated by amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Carre's worst effort. He must be exhausted.","review":"As a long time LaCarre fan who has read everything he has written since \\"The Spy Who ...\\", I was most disappointed in this one. It had nothing of interest: dull, dull, dull. There was not a single character that one could care about. Don't waste your time with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First time for Le Carre.........no mas!","review":"I found this book to be very hard to understand and to stay with. I read for enjoyment and relaxation. I didn't get either. I had to labor through 180 pages before I threw in the towel and the book in file 13. If you must read it, go to the library. At least you can take it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it was a library borrow and did not purchase this book","review":"I am an old time LaCarre fan and eagerly await his new books. I have also enjoyed the challange of not having been spoon fed the content of his previous books, however this effort was beyond my understanding. Rather than repeat the comments of the previous negative reviews I thoroughly agree with most of them. It is interesting to note that the reviews are either 1 star are 5 stars,(few 3's),none in between, I wonder why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, boring, difficult","review":"Amazingly difficult to follow the story, I gave up on it 3-4 times, thought I might be missing something and tried again. In the end I thru it in the trash, and sorry I wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"Le Carre has been one of my favorites for years. It's always so exciting to buy a new book by an author who seems like an old friend. I've had this book two weeks and I'm only on page 158. I can't get into the locations at all, and the characters seem shallow, the plot confusing. I thought it was just me until I read some of your other reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating tour of the world of international corruption","review":"I hadn't picked up a Le Carre novel in years, but decided, after being urged on by my wife, to give this one a shot. I enjoyed it. Le Carre does an excellent job of delving into the schemes of the international lawyers, and bakers who support mafia operations worldwide. In doing so, he demonstrates that he is more than simply a spy novelist. Some readers may find the chronological shifts of the story to be jarring--especially if you tend to skim as I do when reading anything whatsoever. However, the story will make itself clear by the end of the book. I eagerly look forward to Mr. Le Carre's next literary venture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new and different Le Carre","review":"Single and Single portrays the consequences for Oliver Single after his crisis of conscience. Single is a trust lawyer, with his father, for an emerging Russian Mafia family. The novel thrusts Single into a cloak and dagger world where he attempts to rescue his estranged father, and uncover the conspiracy within the conspiracy of the Russia underworld.The novel maintains tight suspense, and yet addresses issues of personal ethics and family relations. The book is really a great read, the only drawback is the lack of development among woman's characters. This weakness has little impact on the story or the message, and like some others of Le Carre's books the main character propels the story into a thought provoking struggle between ideas, as much as a struggle between people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scattered audiotape","review":"This is a case where it doesn't seem quite fair to have an audiotape rating mixed in with the ratings of the print version. I might have liked the print version of the book assuming it filled it the gaping holes in the abridged tape. As it was, the tape was a frustrating experience in trying to keep track of a very large cast of characters; unexpected flashbacks; and sudden changes of scene. LeCarre's narration didn't help as he often spoke too softly.I'm not even sure if I can wrote coherently about the plot. Truely the tape was so scattered that I only have a mild sense of the complexities motivating Oliver. The rest of the characters, including some with terrific potential such as his father, are barely two-dimensional as abridged. I did manage to grasp that Oliver is torn between loyalties to his father and to the British government.Bottom-line: Maybe the print version is worth reading but avoid the tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound of Le Carre is terrific","review":"Not only can Le Carre write circles around hacks half his age, but he reads his stuff really really well. Ultimately, the characters that fall in and out (and are sometimes shown stage door left with a resounding gunshot) are pretty much the same. But they all represent what LC's work is about ... complete loneliness. Tattered men with tarnished ideals making one last good for the team. And LC's voice captures that loneliness perfectly. While not as stunning a performance as Tailor Of Panama, S & S shines nonetheless. In no small part because of Le Carre's terrifically lonely voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the movie","review":"LeCarre equals his performance in the Tailor of Panama. Finishing the book is an achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"an aborted takeoff","review":"Like an airliner taxiing around a foggy airport, Single and Single nears but never quite reaches the takeoff end of the runway. It revs its engines but fails to achieve the power required for takeoff. After several attempts to lift off it just shuts everything down and gets towed back to the terminal and deplanes its passengers. Maybe we'll go tomorrow"},{"rating":"2","title":"LeCarre is back to old form. A sensational book.","review":"I have been a fan of John LeCarre since \\"The Spy Who Came in From The Cold\\" was released. With Smiley's People, he hit the top of his form. Then the cold war ended and he appeared to lost his way with \\"The Night Manager\\" and \\"The Tailor of Panama.\\" With \\"Single & Single\\" he has entered a new era. International Intrigue, Fathers, Sons, lovers, betrayal, all are part of this engrossing book. A truly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single & Single is Tedious & Tedious","review":"This book should be recommended reading for anyone suffering from insomnia. I could hardly stay awake after reading two or three pages. The characters have little depth. There isn't a likeable or sympathetic character in the book. While some critics might call this Le Carre's best novel in years, this might be because it is only slightly more interesting than anything he may have done in years. This book is next to impossible to read. I would characterize Le Carre's writing style as both tedious and boring. Much of the dialog is crytic and virtually incomprehensible. I found the plot only slightly more interesting than a Martha Stewart cookbook. I really felt cheated after reading this book in light of the hype that came with its publication. Reading this book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"surprise ending","review":"Overall the story is an interesting read, but it seems to wander at times and there are a lot of subplots which don't seem to really contribute a whole lot to the main story. That's okay, but in the end you find yourself asking, \\"so what happened to....?\\" I found the end especially unsatisfying because it ended so abruptly as if Le Carre had just had about had enough of it already. Kinda disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expert at Work","review":"---expert storyteller and expert in painting scenes with the British language, that is. Reading le Carre is most always a pleasure, and this book is not one of the exceptions. He is a master at devising and presenting a stimulating sequence of chapters, gradually encouraging the reader to piece together a bit more of just what the story might be. And within each of those chapters, one discovers many a sentence with well-chosen words likewise arranged in an appealing and creative order. This plot turns out to be an appealing one, but le Carre probably would make the IRS instruction booklets appealing for this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are going to have to pay attention.","review":"If you take this book to the beach you are going to have to sacrifice something. You can't have it both ways. There are several flashbacks that force the reader to keep on top of the story line. The introduction of numerous characters also require the dedicated attention of the reader. A peak into the \\"mafia of tommorrow\\" and their efforts to establish in the west while retaining their ties to their homeland. The main character was likeable. The romance caught me buy surprise and worked well in the story. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"great lecarre at his bestt","review":"not done with the audio version. i keep rewinding, which is a pretty good gauge as to my enjoyment of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars","review":"Based on the other reviews, this book appears to be a \\"love it of leave it\\" type. I enjoyed how the author peeled off layer after layer revealing secrets along the way.The writing style was, at times, a little confusing. But that only required the reader to think and read carefully. This was welcomed in comparison to some of the bland and formulistic writing today.Not quite five stars but close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single & Single Keeps You Waiting and Waiting...","review":"I am a major John LeCarre fan. His Cold War novels were unique in distilling the moral ambiguities of that age into the lives of his characters. Like some foreign policy professionals, he has not adapted well to the New World order. This novel is as disappointing as The Night Porter.The characters are underdeveloped, especially the women. All of them play the role required of them by the main character, without any inkling of why they might act that way. Most often, they provide the common sense the hero seems to lack, but why?There are plenty of war stories left in the Cold War. Perhaps LeCarre would do better to continue writing those. The post-Cold War era seems to have eluded him."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"If LeCarre really is the author of this one, he has lost his touch. I agree with those reviewers who said such things as \\"tendentious\\", \\"obtuse\\", \\"overly confusing\\". I still have no idea how, where, when and why Oliver became a conjurer, nor do I really have a picture of him in my mind's eye. I was ever hopeful that the old LeCarre magic would show itself; what a disappointment that it never did. When I finished the book I threw it into the trashcan."},{"rating":"1","title":"LeCarre may have talent, but he doesn't demonstrate it here.","review":"Single and Single is a disjointed mass of words that surely doesn't represent the best of this author. This book should be sold with the warning to \\"read without expection of being informed or entertained.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, repetitive and pointless","review":"Who could find this interesting? In chapter one we witness the tediously drawn out last moments of a British financial market slimeball. Never has murder been so torturously boring. Then we meet Oliver Single, who lumbers akwardly through his moral crises at a sedentary pace appropriate to his gigantic physical stature. There's also Brock, English Righteousness personified, capable of deducing all, predicting all, leaping over tall buidlings, etc. Why bother plowing through each monotonous chapter - the impossibly talented Brock can deal with it. Into the dumper with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"where is this going","review":"A teacher at school recommended this book to me. I started on my flight home from Istanbul. I began the book over Europe and was ready to flush it down the toilet after the first chapter. The first chapter was full of useless flashbacks and empty words. I, however, continued with the book. The second chapter started better, but by the end of it, I was still confused. I, however, continued with the book. Are you seeing a trend? I read a lot of books and do not consider myself to usually be a tough critic. I also think I am a polished reader. I just didn't see where this book was going. I have stopped reading at page 130 and have started a different book. I will try to finish this one for my teacher's sake, but for no other reason.

However, when handling bond fund transactions, it does so incorrectly. To make the values turn out correctly, it has to fudge the numbers (number of shares and prices) because it assumes you are holding individual bonds rather than shares in a bond fund. I talked this over with the Microsoft person over the MSN chat room and got a stupid answer. In going to their old help files, I found this was a problem with Money 2001-it appears to still be a problem.

We then obtained the other two titles contained in this book. We read them so much, we wore out the paperback bindings, so I bought the hard cover collection.

I would recommend this product to any baker. It fits easily in a jelly roll pan can accomodate a dozen large cookies per sheet. I haven't used it for anything other than cookies and rolls at this point, but I do not think there will be a problem with any other types of baked goods.

Never used a baking mat before, but let me tell you we are a believer now. My wife bakes a LOT of cookies for Christmas, so I picked up several of these after reading other reviews. Well, after baking about 30 dozen cookies these mats performed wonderfully. All the cookies baked evenly and even the stickiest cookies (the Carmel Turtle Cookies) just slid right off.My wife was really happy with the performance. Clean up was easy, just rinse and wipe. We've noticed no difference in taste, no smell during baking, just perfect cookies.I compared against several other mats that were more expensive (including Silpat) and went with this mat due to price (about 1/2 the cost of the others) and are very happy with our decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"silicone cookie mat","review":"The product was not expensive and works all right though it is made in China and there were a few spots unevenly coated.

I don't know if it's really advisable to cut things on it but the packaging said it can't be cut since it's fiberglass and silicone. It worked for cutting on but I'm sure the counter top got scratched but hey what do I care - I'm only renting right? Anyways - 5 thumbs up. Maybe I'll try cooking with it next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Baking Tool","review":"I never would have believed that this mat would work, but it does!

Even though this film was made during the war they do not lighten the fact that americans die too ( Many of the main characters die and an actualll event is shown where a whole patrol is ambushed and slowly killed over a nights time which is also in the book and a true story).

Really like this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made","review":"I ordered this product with high hopes. It's cheaply made. I was not impressed with the mechanics of this item. To engage the record player you have to unhook the \\"arm\\" manually and then move all the way to the right to turn it on. To turn off, you have to be careful and pick the needle up off the record and pull the \\"arm\\" all the way to the left until you hear a click. The CD player opened just fine when the open/close button was pushed, but would not close until you pushed the slider. Sound quality was pretty good.

The handle was so flimsy it felt ready to snap off and the \\"guide\\" that was supposed to glide back and forth and evenly wind the hose onto the reel made one pass and then stalled in place and wound the hose entirely around the right end of the reel. Useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"low quality junk","review":"The whole reel is made of cheap and thin plastic. The crank gear is also plastic, and as soon as you put some stress on it (like trying to rewind a 100ft hose laying on the ground) it will start skipping and coming apart. The whole product is made of smaller plastic parts that are snapped together, which can not take the smallest amount of stress without breaking off from one another. By my second heavily assisted rewind the whole assembly started leaking like mad (something else snapped I guess), prompting me to return it.This seems to be a common theme with all the Suncast products, as this is a third model of their hose reel that I have tried. If you had a bad experience with one, do not assume that their more expensive units are any better made. They're just more expensive, that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T PURCHASE","review":"This is the second one we have boughten, thinking the first one was just a fluke that it leaked all over the place after a few months of use.

Not purchasing from Suncast again...any of their brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had a much better experience with this item!","review":"I just put this hose reel in the trash after almost 10 years of constant use. My only complaint was that it was lightweight which made it wobbly and tippy when the hose was mostly out and made it difficult to begin reeling when the hose was fully-extended. Otherwise, it held up well, kept its finish and color, and gave us 10 years of reliable use. Maybe the newer model is not as well made as ours was...

Don't even try to hit me with that backhand.Read through the other reviews-- \\"existential, quiet, surreal, delicate, understated\\"...ya mean, like frogs falling from the sky in \\"Magnolia\\"? Yup, if I had to find an excuse for this movie, I'd use those words, too.

Jarmusch is a really subtle director, and Forest Whitaker is an underappreciated actor- here in possibly one of his best roles. Every scene is so carefully put together, and there are moments of real beauty in it- the pigeons, the ice cream man- it's rare that a film is worthy of being called \\"art\\" but if you get it, I'm sure you'll agree.

A waste of talent using Forest Whitacker. Useless plot. Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Jarmusch movies","review":"This is one of the rare movies that merits watching again and again. It is subtle yet entertaining, and accessible in a way many of Jarmusch's movies are not. Forest Whitaker at his most powerful; the leading role he deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious understated Brilliance","review":"This film is a supremely poignant, brilliant, yet understated comedy. We look at this world through the prism of honor and through it is revealed the bittersweet absurdity of existence. The commonplace becomes comedy and gangsters become human instead of grotesque violent entities. The world is a dreamlike place in the eyes of a man confident of his place in the world and all things boil down to their essence;which seems to be good despite the painful outcome. Yet the film is never heavy. Indeed it is a comic masterpiece with every actor playing with dead on accuracy. The masterpiece of a soundtrack by RZA rounds out this excellent film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kurosawa Meets 'The Sopranos'...","review":"....meets Sergio Leone and The Hughes Brothers.I, too, was initially unsold on the idea of Whitaker as Samurai. But overall the movie works on many levels. Humor like how Ghost Dog repeats whatever his Haitian ice cream vendor buddy says and vice versa (the Haitian speaks French but no English and Ghost Dog speaks English but no French) and the one mob member (who gets offed the worst and the funniest) who likes Public Enemy and know the words to their records better than probably your average hip-hop fan is great, but not too heavy handed. Passages of the Samurai teachings are dispersed thru out the film to punctuate the varous moods and actions. Look out for The Bernie Mac Show's Vanessa (Camille Winbush) as the reluctant, unknowing Samurai initiate. I could see an independent comicbook or a strange sequel to this with the same flavor. Try it out, you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Dog with Forest Whitaker","review":"This is a very good film. The uniqueness of Whitaker's real-life persona enhances the unique character he brings to the screen. Ghost Dog displays all the discipline of a martial arts master but with a gun in hand. From this perspective he is far removed from the on-screen likes of Bruce Lee, Jim Kelly and Jet Li but equally as deadly. The film does not hide the fact the methods of destruction used by Ghost Dog are not only outlandish but straight out of a cartoon fantasy. This adds to its entertainment value: we know we're being taken for a ride. It's a fun trip. Whitaker's supporting cast round out this excellent ensemble work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, but it can be slow in parts","review":"If you are interested in Samurai, then you'll probably do better with this contemporary, urban drama than you would with most films set in Shogun Japan. If you've read the Hagakure, then you'll have a deeper appreciation for the moral struggles that the main character, Ghost Dog, faces. One must remember, throughout, that the Samurai must face death gladly and without fear and that one must, above all, honor one's retainer. Forest Whitaker does a commendable job throughout and the rest of the cast does a decent job as well. Most of the characters have some depth and the story is unique. It is certainly worth a look if you enjoy Samurai films or even just films that offer a unique take on moral conflicts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Deciding","review":"This is a neo-noir film that has a certain appeal.

Rent it before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh...?","review":"I really wanted to like this movie. I really did.Forest Whitaker plays an urban Mob assassin who lives his life by the code of the Samurai. When a hit gets witnessd by the Don's Daughter, he becomes a liability, and is targeted for termination. Director Jim Jarmusch seems to be an acquired taste, and I guess I ain't acquired it. The movie is WAAAY too long, and the meager plot is padded mercilessly by rapping Mobsters, French-speaking Ice-Cream vendors, a cute kid, a shouting old man, clothing thefts, etc. The movie takes avant-garde to a whole new level, and while there were parts that I enjoyed, it was just a little too weird for me to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Modern Day Samurai","review":"\\"Ghost Dog\\" is a fascinating film. Rarely do I use this word to describe a person or a book, let alone a non-documentary film. But here I must, simply because of what Jarmusch has crafted here a contemporary samurai film which mirrors oh so perfectly the lives of samurai of ancient Japan given the context of the year 1999, in a seemingly decrepit city, in the USA.Forrest Whitaker is an exceptional actor and here he does not disappoint. He IS a samurai, walking each step with compassion, yet keeping to his duty with calculated grace.For the independent-minded, taking this entire film as a whole, RZA's fantastic score, the intriguing, Isaach De Bankolé, the Dutch cinematographer's, Robby Müller's, dizzying yet serene art direction, you simply must see this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"no invincibility worship here","review":"I really enjoyed the style (music, humor, etc.) of this film (\\"passenger pigeon!!\\"). Ghost Dog seems invincible in combat, but we are not to see his character the way we see your typical strong and silent urban warrior--the kind of character that's appropriate for adolescents to worship.By giving a modern urban character an interest in the way of the samurai, the writer/director has given us an interesting perspective on how someone might find meaning and value in a life that may end all too abruptly in a violent death. Ghost Dog embraces his mortality and uses violence as a tool to carry out his convictions.The economy of Ghost Dog's personal relationships (although significant to him) and the calmness with which he goes about his business, illustrate just how successful he has been at turning a life at risk into a life where, ironically, there is peace and contentment...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for those who love cool movies!","review":"My brother was the one who convinced me to see this movie, and usually his reccomendation means the movie isn't worth my time. But this time he hit the Jackpot. The best thing about the moviem, I thought, were the quotes from the Samurai's code. They really enlightened my views on certain things.But if I were going to give you one reason to see this movie it would be for the music. The way that the music flows everything together is amazing, and I very much dislike rap. This movie however is accented sooo well by uit that you can't help but love it.

I caught it accidentally on the Independent Film Channel and immediately ordered a copy. the mix of modern urban culture with the philosophy of ancient Japan is pure genius. The old decaying mafia family is so well written and acted that their scenes are some of the best gangster scenes ever put on film. A mafia don who quotes Public Enemy is one of many cultural juxtapositions that make this such a rich film. The soundtrack is awsome and Forrest Whitaker is absolutely perfect in the lead role. Check this one out and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your life","review":"This film, was by far, the worst way I could have spent 2 hours of my life. It would have been more productive to bore a hole in my arm, or watch a spider sleep. This man, who for most of the film you watch walk aimlessly around the streets, is in no way a samurai. There is little plot, and what exists is sketchy at best. At numberous points in the film I actually screamed for something to happen, perhaps for some character to develop, or for a line to be said.I only award this film one star because the site will not allow a rating of zero. Life is a precious gift, too good to be wasted on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"MST3K Bound","review":"Trying to find deep meaning and sybolism in this movie is about as meaningless as edible toilet paper. The 'mafia'in this movie would be better suite at taking insight and direction from porn movies. The acting, editing, story, plot, and mood of this movie has got to be some of the worst ever put on film. I'm not saying it takes a big budget and highly skilled acters to make a movie. Just some people that might have taken an acting class or even perhaps looked the word up in a dictionary. This movie is good for only two things. Having the boys over for some drinks and having an MST3K party, or for a how not to make a movie. There were to many times the director tried to convey a message to his audience. What that message was stopped with the director. And how can someones highly acclaimed film debut consist of a sentence? You would be better off renting this first and using the money you save to go and get plastered so you could forget this horrible, horrible film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big yawn!","review":"I fell asleep during this movie and didn't bother to try to finish it. The story was incredibly slow and boring. Forest Whitaker's performance as a samurai is laughable. He just looks rediculous through the entire film. The mobsters in the movie are just corny Italian stereotypes. This movie was a waste of space on my Netflix queue. But on the bright side, RZA did the soundtrack and that may be worth checking that out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"My boyfriend nicely lured me into watching this, and I loved it.I have seen Forest Whitaker in plenty of movies, but this was one of my favorite performances. I'm surprised it didn't receive more attention in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie that really makes you think.","review":"When I rented this movie, I really didn't know what I was in for. All I had seen was the preview, but that was enough to convince me. The unique plot keeps you there, even if it is somewhat slow. The entire movie is unique and artistic; one that really makes you think. Forest Whittaker plays his role very well, and the rest of the cast is good as well. (I enjoyed his two friends, the Haitian and the child.) The jokes, if somewhat subtle, are humorous, and the assasination scenes are well done. This is a very good movie for anyone who is interested in a \\"true\\" samurai movie, so rent it as soon as you can, and if you like it, buy it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool.","review":"This is a surreal action movie laced with eastern philisophy and Japanese literature. Ghost Dog is a mafia hitman who subscribes to the way of the samurai. After one hit goes bad his employers try to rub him out. Big mistake the carnage begins as he hunts them down one by one. The visuals in this are amazing especially the scene where he enters the country hideout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny movie by a unique filmmaker","review":"I love how Jim Jarmusch lets the viewer decide whether Ghost Dog is a noble samurai dutifully and honorably carrying out the duties of his master, or completely, utterly insane. Forest Whitaker, perfectly cast for this role, also keeps the viewer guessing; a masterful performance. Jarmusch sometimes appears to let his affection for hip-hop culture overwhelm his sensibilities as a director, but Whitaker and the rest of the excellent cast keep the film grounded in (semi-)reality. Well worth seeing, despite the fact that the soon-to-be-famous \\"sink killing\\" would be impossible in real life -- pipes aren't shaped that way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most underrated movies I have ever seen","review":"I liked this film very much because it really goes deep into the main character's mind. Like all hit men, Ghost Dog leads a solitary and simple life, but what makes him special is that he's very reflective and dedicated to the code of the samurai. Throughout the film, various excepts from the Hagakure text are flashed on the screen whenever Ghost Dog ponders on them. These excepts from Hagakure will have you pondering as well because the ones that are flashed are very profound. When I rented this movie, I rewinded over some of the quotes several times and although I took the video back yesterday, I still find myself thinking about the quotes over and over again. My favorite quotes are the first one regarding meditating on a violent and brutal death and the one about two things becoming one. As a muslim, I can tell you that most of the quotes are consistent with what one would find in the Qur'aan or in the Hadiths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre and Lyrical","review":"This was my first Jarmusch film. It is just your ordinary hip-hop-samurai-mafioso-cartoon lover-literary film. You have seen movies with elements of Ghost Dog before, but you have never seen anything like this. Cartoon watching, rapping Mafiosos. A hip-hop samurai. Yet, it is not a comedy. This movie is really about codes of honor, respect, and I dare argue some kind of hope. It is strikingly original and the hip-hop score works wonders. Forrest Whitaker, a supremely talented actor, gives a masterful performance. I was intrigued by the newspaper reviews, but I think the standard reviewers were confused. What I love most about this movie are the chances that Jarmusch takes. I would love to see the mainstream studios put out bold pictures like this. The extras on the DVD, particularly the documentary and deleted scenes are not so good. I would have preferred Jarmusch and Whitaker on a commentary track. Still, take the risk and watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie for the individual in all of us!","review":"Whitaker reads from a \\"how-to-become-a-Samurai\\" manual. Whitaker also spends a lot of time with pigeons. He further carries on a \\"conversation\\" with an ice cream vendor that speaks only French. Mobster Cliff Gorman extols the virtues of Flava Flav. Henry Silva and his gang, individually, are obsessed with watching cartoons. Silva's \\"daughter\\", Tricia Vessey, has prolonged passages of silence that seem to reveal the film's most enigmatic character.This movie is so heavy-laden with symbolism that each viewer will probably interpret something entirely different. Thus, it becomes either a delicacy or travesty, dependent on the observer.I, for one, thought it was delicious. But because of its abstractness, I couldn't quite give it five big ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie tries too hard","review":"This movie tries too hard, it straddles the line between being too much of a cliche and overdoing the effort to be unique. The Italian characters were more detrimental than positive with their attempts at humor and bumbling incompetence. Also, the movie tries to take on too many roles at the same time--a black man who listens to hip-hop, reads a lot, studies the way of the Samurai, employed by the mafia, befriends a little girl and a French-speaking ice cream salesman, and lives on the roof of an apartment building beside a pigeon coop. A lot of potential but I think all those different elements pull the movie in too many directions at the same time. If you want to see a beautifully done movie of this genre, see \\"The Professional.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A really bad movie","review":"The acting in this movie was so bad, I was wondering if it was all done deliberately to make some kind of a joke. This has to be one the worst films of the year, no make that the decade. Amazingly horrible. The Samurai sayings made no sense whatsoever, the Italian gangsters were all ready for the old folks home (was there anyone under 70 years old?), and when anybody got shot (actually that was everybody) the frantic death scenes were comical. Was this movie directed by an 8th grader?"},{"rating":"1","title":"urban loneliness remake","review":"When I watched Ghost Dog some time ago, I was confused but also very embarassed as I thought obviously either the protagonist or the writer didn't understand anything about the Way of the Samurai. But having seen Melville's film Le Samourai, I can now explain Ghost Dog. Le Samourai is a non-sequitur in which the title of the film has essentially nothing to do with the plot (assassination) or theme (solitude) of the film. Ghost Dog is an homage re-make of Le Samourai that says \\"let's try to make the title relate to the plot.\\" It's that simple, and that's why the film fails. The idea of a overweight, out of shape inner-city contract killer who derives some lifestyle from reading Hagakure and swinging around a samurai sword is ridiculous and not even clever or fun if you actually know anything about Japanese history, martial arts culture, or, especially, the actual contents of Hagakure. Like Le Samourai, Ghost Dog depends entirely on fashion and film history for any success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and a waste of time","review":"I'm usually on the side of the intellectuals when it comes to movies, but this time I votewith the 22 people who give this one star. It took me 5 days to be able to see this film. And no, I don'thave a short attention span.Boring is the word I keep thinking of. I do love to read the 5 star reviews of this film, especially the first 5star review that says that \\"this film is an eclectic syncretism of many genres.\\" I also love the onestar review that says that it would be more interesting to watch a spider sleep than see this film.I agree with the fellow who said that this director is overrated. Glad I saw the film on TV, and glad thatI was able to erase it. This director's films are always interesting, but I vote with those who say \\"boring\\" forthis one. I think if this director pointed the camera at a tree for five minutes, his fans would see the deeper intellectual meaning of that. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slooowwwww.","review":"The cover for this video has quotes from newspaper/magazine reviews saying how 'funny' and 'fresh' this film is. Don't believe it, it is so slow. Some scenes just drag on for ages and the whole film is really in slow motion. I'm afraid I could find nothing entertaining here. Where was the humour?. It's one of those films that critics/die-hard movie enthusiasts love, but the general public find boring. The film also has no visual appeal at all. I don't want to watch a film to be depressed, I want to watch a film that is uplifting. Forrest Whitaker has a glum expression nearly all the way through.

I don't like hip hop, but i suffered through it. I love the main character. Very good acting job by Whittaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The movie \\"Ghost Dog\\" fails mainly due to it's cop-out of an ending. The self-sacrifice of the main character Ghost Dog to his Mafioso master doesn't work, it's too easy, too formulaic. The character learns nothing in his exploits. He fails to see his chosen \\"Master\\" for what he is. The story would have worked better if Ghost Dog had stopped to realize that he was making a fatal mistake with his slave-like dedication to the samurai code. The action offers Ghost Dog many opportunities for that brilliant flash of insight but he is too dedicated and loyal to step off the warrior path to see it for what it really is. Also, the scene where Ghost Dog kills his victim by shooting up through the plumbing is a joke. Ask any plumber. Jarmusch should have known better."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love it or hate it","review":"There have been many mixed reviews about this movie. Some people have loved it while others have scratched their heads. Jarmusch has packed artistic themes and mob action into a single flick; but if you do not enjoy interpreting artistic poignancies in movies then this is not for you. I personally loved the interaction between Ghost Dog and the french speaking ice cream man. Here is a man who has disciplined himself to the lonely existence of a near Ronin Samurai who's only friend speaks no English, yet they seem to understand and even parrot each other. Also, some of the hit scenes at the end were just marvelous in their clevernous. I for one loved this movie for both the theme and Forest Whitaker's acting.If you look for Rambo in a movie, stay away.If you like movies such as the Big Lebowski and Being John Malkovich, then you'll probably like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"The book was a bit of a false alarm (for me) in that I expected more detail in the how to parts.

Bush's grandfather was and alleged Nazi sympathizer, labeling people devils, extensive use of super imposed swastikas and skull and cross bones, etc), and logic that is repeatedly based on chains of supposition. This use of emotional rhetoric, symbols, and supposition are propaganda tactics, not tools of analysis and reason.

So not only is it a cash-in compilation, but it's one that Miles would be embarrased by. God bless Miles; curse his record company for selling him out like this when he can't do anything about it. Get a real Miles Davis album instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben Mann 2","review":"I fully agree with Ben Mann. Even to see a name like \\"LOVE SONGS\\" associated with Miles Davis makes me sick.

While he certainly revolutionized jazz many times, it's easy to forget that Miles continued to play standards at live shows (granted, in an increasingly radical way as time went on) well into the late 60's, and again towards the end of his life, he would throw \\"Stella By Starlight\\" into his live sets.This is a very nice collection of Miles' love songs, and for the casual fan may very well be worth looking into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything less than 5 stars is ridiculous","review":"I agree that the slick packaging of this CD is a bit off-putting. But that in no way detracts from the quality of the music contained on it. It's still 100% Miles. His majesty, subtlety, tenderness and pain come through on every track. And his sidemen are great.I understand the label wanting to package this CD in a \\"smooth jazz\\" sort of way. For me, a diehard traditionalist who can't stand smooth jazz, this is somewhat excruciating. But if it exposes more people to Miles who would otherwise be buying Kenny G albums, I'm all for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great jazz; offensive CD package notes","review":"Just adding to the chorus of reviews here: a terrific collection of Miles's more approachable music -- but an INSIPID, FAWNING, TOTALLY PATRONIZING SET OF NOTES on the back of the CD package.

However, the actual train robbery happened about 12 miles northeast of this location. The train tracks were moved 2 years after the train robbery and the actual site is along a raised abandoned railroad grade. Another errors is the photo of the jail cell where Butch was held in the Wyoming Territorial Prison (now a state park). While the building walls are original, almost nothing inside is. The whole place was gutted at one time and used as a barn.

If I was willing to spend another $20 in shipping costs, the seller said they would send me another of the $20 item. My math tells me that the $20 item would end up costing me $50.

I have bought five of them. Each new one heated up quickly and dried my long, thick hair in about 15 minutes, unfortunately in a few months the motor burned out. Before the motor burned out there was a burning burning odor (it's probably an electrical hazard too), then it overheated a few times and stopped working. I would turn it off and it will start again, until it didn't. It seems that the last two didn't last as long as the first two I bought. I actually started buying two at a time so I would have a backup. So sadly, I had to switch brands.

Unfortunately, the motor never ran an even speed. The second to last time I used it, I thought I smelled smoke. The last time I used it, I definitely saw smoke. That was enough for me to throw the item in the trash. As a result, I just can't recommend this item.For a period of over twenty years, I had 2 different hot air brushes from Conair.

The book is not only interesting, but didactic too. Michael Phillips showed Zack Hollister's feelings as a rebellious kid very well. He had also illustrated Drummond's fatherly love very well. Hawk was a good teacher. The Indians and Indian tales that M.P. brought in enhanced the entire plot. The reconciliation at the last was a fitting end. I give this book full ratings.

She was a school teacher and engaged in other allied activities, and was a recognized authority on parlimentary procedure, especially in women's clubs. The book is a good introduction to the subject for the newly-elected presiding officer of a voluntary association. It should noted, however, that Fox's version of parliamentary procedure varies somewhat from the traditional format set forth in Robert's Rules of Order. For example, under Fox's rules, a motion is not properly seconded until the member rises, secures recognition from the chair, and then seconds the motion.

There are certain images and angles in this film that will stay with you a long, long time. Also affecting is the rapport Roy has with his little doggie.

I was quite impressed with Eammon Walker (a dancer turned actor)-quite a commanding presence. As for the story--it's a pretty descent story, however, hard to believe-Yuri was a one man operation. As far as the problem with the arms dealers which this film was so eager to point out, is that there is no solution. None. This film was basically made to tell you to be afraid--be very afraid.

Despite some bullseyes Niccol doesn't seem to focus his arguments here, therefore, he can't ratchet the sufficient outrage against the death merchants in our midst. What redeems the film is Nicolas Cage's charasmatic turn as Yuri who enters into arms dealing as a lark and dicovers he's just so damned good at it. A great scene in the film is where Yuri is stuck in an African village with a planeload of munnitions.

Of course he doesn't figure the enormous cost it will eventually lead him to but that's one of the intriguing outcomes of this absorbing film. The narrative is done in the style of Scorsese's \\"Goodfellows\\" and is effective plus the supporting cast (Jared Leto, Ian Holm, Bridget Monihan) is excellent.

This book gives a detailed account of Dillinger's early years with his family leading up to his bank robbing criminal career, amazing escapes and his execution by Federal Agents on July 22, 1934 in a dark Chicago alley.

This is not easy bedtime reading, but for those who persevere through prose that at first brush may appear dense, but which is actually very lucidly written, the profundity shines through.

All-in-all it is an interesting collection, but the difference in the tunes makes it feel a bit fragmented. However, if you don't already have a copy of John Gorka's Christmas Bells, then that song alone is worth the price of the CD.

This CD is similar to \\"Christmas around the World\\" that was issued 3 years later. This CD has a few (2-3) good songs and the rest are not even vaguely recognizable as Xmas songs. The later released CD mentioned above kept the few good songs and added several more very good, xmas appropriate selections. I can only guess that many felt the same way that I did about this CD and Putumayo took notice. While this CD is 2 stars the other is now 4.5 stars.

How rare is it for a brand new disk to be released that is a true instant classic? This is Hatebreed's best album and an instant classic. Their previous CDs will always stand out on their own because they are all excellent, but this CD has something different about it. Jasta's lyrics are as inspiring as ever in the true Hatebreed fashion, and all the heavy instrumentation is there. This album has genius pacing, crisp production and truly quality songwriting. Thanks Hatebreed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bit of a let down...","review":"After hearing Perseverence I was totally hooked on Hatebreed - the blend of brutal drums, riffs & lyrics were like nothing I'd ever heard before. Rise of Brutality was awesome too... but Perseverance is still their benchmark in my books.Was super-keen to get out & buy this cd, and when I played it in the car for the first time I was REALLY disappointed - almost all the songs sound the same (well, the drums do anyways). I found it nowhere near as initially inspiring as the previous 2 albums. After listening to it a few more times I realised that the lyrics are sensational - as good as ever, but it seems as if the music side of things were rushed and not much thought was put into it. Really disappointing.Highlight of the album is \\"Spitting Venom\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hatebreed evolve and its great!","review":"Was I the only person thinking Hatebreed were starting to get boring and put out songs which were simply too similar. I bought the Rise of Brutality out of the blue one day and liked it but it had a rather short life span in my cd player. Then I read that the latest offering from them was very stong and decided to take a chance with it and I was pleasantly surprised! Hatebreed have changed ever so slightly and aren't quite as repeatitive as they once were. For anyone that previously had given up on them I say just give this album a chance. I really enjoyed it from start to finish! But don't worry, they are still as hard hitting and agressive as ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everytrack runs together....sorry folks, it's true","review":"Hatebreed is cool, but this Cd something is wrong with the production or possibly it is the songs themselves. Cool riffs, of course the vocals are strong, but man everything sounds alike .....kinda like one big giant song......and I find it impossible to remember what track was what.....Sorry folks....it's true.For some earthshattering, fist pounding, aggresive metal check out that new SkinnedAlive Cd when it comes out in a couple weeks by Skinlab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best work since Satisfaction =","review":"Whoever said that Rise of Brutality is better than this album needs to have their head examined. This album is full of energetic riffs and furocious beats. Jasta's vocals seem to be fully recharged with the aggression and angst that were more than prevalent on \\"Satisfaction = the Death of Desire.\\" This album is a must for anyone that is a fan of hardcore and is the best release of the past 2 months. Easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm going to agree with Jestergod on this one...","review":"HateBreed, from my hearing, is not a Christian band, so I conclude that they resort to one of the following: Trying to be tough, worshipping the devil, going on a cursing frenzy, etc. Bands like Dimmu Borgir is probably something they can relate to, and they could also relate to Children of Bodom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supreme Effort","review":"Cant beleive this is only getting some average reviews. I think this could be one of the best hatebreed and hardcore albums i've heard. Defeatist is one of the most brutal they've put out. Other great songs include destroy everything, which will be a mosh pit classic. give wings to my triumph, divine judgement, immortal enemies, and my personal favorite spitting venom.This album goes back to the basics with more of a hardcore style with supporting shout out vocals. Hatebreed may not be the fastest or even the heaviest, but they are the most brutal sounding band ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hatebreed - 'Supremacy' (Roadrunner)","review":"Most recent offering from this in-your-ugly-mug New Haven, CT based hardcore metal band. Also, this was the first CD of theirs I've ever heard. Just caught them on tour with Type O Negative. Whew! After the show I attended, I'm honestly amazed the club's main floor remained intact. Honestly, being in the crowd was sort of like being in a South Park episode - remember the one where Cartman and Kenny build their own tree house and the eventually end up up having a mosh party? Ha-ha! Tunes here that I thought sort of stood out were \\"Defeatist\\", \\"Give Wings To My Triumph\\", the h-e-a-v-y \\"Immortal Enemies\\" and \\"Spitting Venom\\".

Brushes not durable.","review":"I bought these paintncups and brushes as a joint gift for my 5 and my 2 year old. In theory, this set should be really great-- paint brushes that match corresponding spill-proof paint cups, with lids to save unused paint. As a previous review mentioned, the \\"cap\\" lids are NOT airtight. They are designed to fit over the inner \\"spill-proof\\" lid, but the caps are loose fitting and allow the paint contained within to dry out quickly.The brushes are also of poor quality. The first time I washed them, using only soap and water, bristles were falling out all over the place! Also, two of the brushes fell apart altogether--the metal cuff completely detaching from the plastic brush handle.In summary, this product would be great if it were better designed, and maybe if the brushes were made with better glue or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The paint cups were fine but I did not receive the matching brushes.

I love the fact that now when she asks to paint I don't have to think about setting paint out for her, doing clean up, etc. I can just say sure - go ahead!I usually keep about 1/4 inch of paint in the bottom of each pot and that way if she wants to combine colors it doesn't wreck a huge amount of paint.

If you don't like it, no amount of talent will entertain you. If you do like it, you savor each bit and are willing to sit through the dross. It helps if the satirists are good. These guys and gals are good. That makes sitting through their work pleasurable even when it not their best work.As with all work of this nature, it helps to be up on current events. The parodies are based upon items in the news. It also helps to be familiar with the American repertoire of popular music. Some are based on showtunes, some are based on rock or country. The sources come from all over the spectrum.IF you do like political satire, its always hard to go wrong with the Capital Steps. They are very talented.

The one disappointment was that there was no resolution of Zach's kidnapping saga.The book had excellent character development and was well-written. I grew up in rural Montana where there are many Hutterites. And, I have a good friend who is Mennonite, originally from TN. So, I am familiar with some Anabaptist faiths. But, I really enjoyed this book and learned quite a bit. There's a lot of difference between them, though, if this book is correct.This is the first book I read by this author and plan to read more.

Please. The dialogue is flat,unbelievable, and contrived. Why can't Christian book authors write intelligent, well-developed characters with believable dialogue? If I read the word \\"tresses\\" one more time to describe some girl's hair, I thought I would throw the book across the room!The Amish are romanticized, while the English world is there to give them car rides, deliver their children, and to steal them.Brenda Mailloux-Glidden"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, poor dialogue","review":"I agree with the reviewer who longs for Christian fiction that isn't so forced. It doesn't seem like it would be that difficult to take a good story and make the characters (and their words) more believable. I could hardly get into this book...in fact I only made it to page 40 before I gave up. The story drags and the forced dialogue results in characters that seem flat and one-dimensional. People just don't speak to each other in long, drawn-out sentences like this author uses. One character actually refers to her own hair as \\"my dark tresses.\\" Another good example of poor dialogue is the entire conversation that begins on page 28. It never ceases to amaze me how readers can overlook poor writing just because it is a Christian author. I am left feeling disappointed because I had high hopes for this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me sleepy","review":"This is a great book for people who don't want adventure or romance in their lives.

It was interesting to me that the author is in a relationship with a large age difference, however she mostly focuses on all of the negative aspects throughout the book. Only at the end does she acknowledge her success with her relationship. It just didn't flow. One would wonder how she ever ended up in a relationship like this. If she is going to make herself an example (having her picture on the front, and her husband's on the back), she should add some of her own experiences so that at least the ending would make a little more sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just enforces the stereotypes!","review":"This book *seemed* to have good intentions, but fell REALLY short. I think I was turned off right away by the full-page glamour shot of the author and her husband on the back cover.This book seems to make the assumption that most younger women/older men relationships break up marriages, cause turmoil within families, etc. The author seems to use this book as some sort of pet project to tell the world about her sob story. I didn't learn a thing from reading this book, and was disappointed to see that it just re-enforces the stereotypes about younger women that date older men.

It is a good book for a long or even semi-long commute, a bedtime read or for a lazy Sunday over coffee. It is also a book that a few other 'best selling' authors could learn from in terms of character development,style and substance.Connelly is a suspense Master in the making and it's fun to watch him build his craft. So what's the book about? About 404 well-written pages.Sorry, but I hate it when someone ruins the storyline before we have a chance to enjoy it for ourselves. Here's hoping Hollywood will do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"This is a review of the Audio Book. It was a little boring at first, but it quickly got interesting. The narrator does an excellent job - the characters are easily distinguished without over-doing it. This is the first book by Michael Connelly I have listened to, and I plan on listening/reading to more.Normally I listen to these on my lunch break, and get through 1 hr a day. This one was an exception - I started Sunday and had to finish it Monday. I really did not want to put this down. One thing I also appreciated was the limited use of language and sex.I won't get into the plot because other reviews have already done it a lot better than I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Job Well Done","review":"Given Connelly's background and previous courtroom scenes (Concrete Blond and A Darkness More Than Light) it shouldn't surprise anyone that he's done a superb job with presenting a \\"likeable\\" defense attorney. While Connelly does take some license with criminal procedure, it is still a very realistic (and entertaining) account of the criminal justice system.Adam Grupper performance brings it all together for a great audio book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exellent Story . . . skillfully crafted!","review":"What I found to be most intriguing is the way Connelly handles with great mastery, the deep character development of Mickey Haller, the story's protagonist, and how Haller navigates the thru the world of the justice system. Though there are several liberal takes on the ethic issues lawyers face, overall the execution of Haller portraying a middle-age man wondering and questioning the system he is a part of is excellent. Clearly, Connelly's opinion that there are many grays to the best legal system is well presented, and provides readers the opportunity to reflect upon our legal system.Readers will thoroughly enjoy this story of twists and turns, as Connelly takes us thru the Los Angeles legal system. Overall, this is an excellent story. Michael Connelly has just found another reader who will devour his past written books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get past the premise","review":"This was my first Michael Connelly book, and I bought it based on the very positive reviews. I just couldn't get past the basic premise that paints a defense lawyer from a jaded cop's perspective. I've known hundreds of defense lawyers, a few of them pretty sleazy, but no one's really like the protagonist of this book. It's such a false stereotype. I kept on trying to get past it, but just couldn't. A big disappointment for my first attempt at Connelly.

I was quite disappointed in the quality of the editing. I noticed several punctuation mistakes and the occasional misspelling. It was also more expensive than the mass paperback version of the same book. As for the story itself, it seemed to me that the author ran out of time to write a credible finish. It was rushed and unclear at the end. At one point I also noticed a lack of continuity in the locations in the story. It was a bit of a shame because this has the makings of a good book. However, it did not live up to the good reviews it got in some of the press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Thriller","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It's not your average crime thriller.

There is a plot within a plot but the characters remain in focus and the reader has no problems follwing the story. The author does not show his entire hand and the reader knows the central character has an ace up his sleave. But the reader in no way feels he's been had by having some of the plans withheld. I had to resist the urge to skip ahead and see how things turned out. I'm glad I didn't. This book is well worth reading. I don't give every book I read five stars. Four stars means a very good tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in the 5 Boroughs","review":"There may be lawyer-client relationship stories that are as good as the Lincoln Lawyer, but there is none better.

If you like criminal lawyer stories, you will be delighted with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I enjoyed this novel, as most of Connelly books. I am a big fan of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series and I find that Mickey Haller, a criminal defense attorney is another character that is probably as engaging and exciting as Harry. Mickey's clients are often individuals who are unlucky and somehow are always on the wrong side of the law. The two protagonists Harry & Mickey concentrate two sides of the coin. One catches the guilty the guilty to provide justice for the victims and their families, whereas Mickey's defends those that have opposed the law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read!","review":"I never write book reviews, but this case is an exception. I felt compelled to let others experience the same joy I felt reading Michael Connolly's thrilling novel The Lincoln Lawyer. After 3 pages of this gripping drama you're hooked. I need not tell you what the book is about, many other reviews have already done so, all I'm here to do is make sure you do your self a favor and get this book! Only 5 stars doesn't do this book justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Grabber by a Master","review":"This is an insightful, intense, exciting, convoluted tale of a defense attorney's realistic and yet cynical approach to practicing law. His well described methods produce a high rate of courtroom wins, but require the development of many scars and moral callouses. This author knows his subject and his craft, from years as a journalist focusing on crime. Here's hoping he'll fire up the Lincoln soon and get more books written about his hero!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Thriller!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I have been reading mystery novels for so many years and can almost always figure out the entire plot before finishing the first chapter. This book was different; there were lots of plot twists and the characters were well developed, complex, and likeable. I got my money's worth on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This was a great book. Had some interesting twists and turns along the way, which keeps the reader interested. Very much enjoyed it and would recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Connelly yet","review":"This was a good one, a really good one. Great characters, nice suspense. I was fully engrossed from beginning to end and it had me prepped to read the sequel right away.

Then check out THE LINCOLN LAWYER. Michael Connelly is a master at spinning a fascinating story that pulls the reader to keep turning the pages with the different twists and turns. I've read several other Connelly novels and this one delivered like the others. It is well worth your investment--time and money from my view."},{"rating":"2","title":"An astonishing accomplishment","review":"Astonishing may be hyperbole to some, but I find it amazing that Connelly can change genres and have such command with his story. I do not have the novel in front of me as I write this review, but I must say that a lot of credit must be given to the 3 lawyers that Connelly acknowledges at the end of this wonderful novel. He captures inticacies of the legal profession like a seasoned trial attorney. He had to have some great input.Other reviewers have already praised the intricate and exciting plot. Mickey Haller plays more like an Elmore Leonard protaganist than a typical courtroom novelist hero. But I love the character and look forward to more enjoyable Haller novels. I think Connelly has the best overall work of any novelist working today. He is that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but only so deep","review":"I bought this book after the reviewer for another book I liked spoke well of it in passing. And I liked it. The book was very well plotted and the dialog and details seemed to be true to life (as far as I could tell anyway). It was easy reading.There were only a few problems. There were a couple very small bits of political correctness A silly judge into his irish heritage who makes something of it on St. Patrick's day is reflexively labeled a racist. And the main character believes he's gaining understanding of his black clients' lives by listening to rap music, which would be a bit like me thinking I understand Irish life because I listen to Van Morrison.But, the only reason I didn't give 5 stars was the lack of any greater philosophical or aphoristic content. It's still worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ","review":"I enjoyed this book so much that I did not want it to end. Superior writing (as usual), this was exceptionaly good. Do youself a favor and read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love mysteries!","review":"Fast-paced, easy to read, fun! Liked the plot, the characters, the pace. Liked this book so well I passed it to my sister-in-law who also enjoyed it. Worth the price for mystery lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connelly's Best Work","review":"By far one of my favorite Connelly novels and perhaps one of my all-time favorite legal suspense thrillers. I can see why this was made into a movie for which I look forward to seeing some day. This is one of those books that I couldn't put down. Especially the last 100 pages. And, no matter how hard I tried to guess the ending, it wasn't how it turned out. Get ready for a roller-coaster ride of a story with an ending that will totally take you by surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"why so many stupids words all i want to say is GOOD book good company good grief!!! too many words and we wonder why nobody reads any more!!! stupid useless reviews if they help okay the book is good it arrived EARLY and in excellent condition!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Great. Connelly has written better","review":"As legal thrillers go, this one was just okay. Parts of the plot were downright silly, but Connelly makes up for it with his great writing. I wouldn't enthusiastically recommend it to anyone, but if you're a Connelly fan, then you should definitely check it out. In the hands of a lesser writer I wouldn't have given it four stars. Probably only three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read & a plus to any library!!","review":"Very happy with purchase. Book arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I appreciate the honesty of this seller. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good plot, good twist, good read","review":"I enjoyed this book. Connelly did a nice job with his writing and the plot was very intriguing. It kept my attention and wasn't predictable, which is something I cannot stand. I don't like reading a book and knowing in the first 20% what to expect at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Great read. My first Michael Connelly read, & looking forward to reading more. I think I enjoyed the book more, picturing Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Haller! Will watch the movie next."},{"rating":"1","title":"connelly gets lazy","review":"Having loved \\"The Poet\\" and other Connelly novels I was eagerly looking forward to reading this one, especially after the rave reviews I'd read. What a disappointment! It wanders around for the first 90% of the book, the plot obvious and the characters wooden, then picks up in the court sessions but can't sustain it to the end, which is melodramatic in the extreme. There are 2 or 3 pages of insight into lawyers' psyches, but the rest is, uncharacteristically, made up of ponderous dialogue and irrelevant and boring subplots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have been 5 stars but....","review":"The only thing that kept me from giving this book 5 stars was Cliford Irving. Read \\"Trial\\" by Cliford Irving. Same plot but in Mr. Irvings book the bad guy was a bad girl. Trial was also a 4-hour movie of the week back in the mid 90's. Both good books but I gave \\"Trial\\" 5 stars. You can't go wrong with either of these books, so read both and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving; doesn't engage the reader; character development mundane","review":"I'm not sure why this book's been so highly rated. It was the first time I've read Michael Connelly and it will certainly be the last. In comparisoon with other authors like Vince Flynn, Lee Child or Brian Haig, Connelly's story and character development are without punch or interest. The reader is never pulled into the storyline, making you want to turn to the next page to see what develops. This is a yawner that left me wanting no more. If this is typical of Connelly's work, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Read","review":"Like the movie this was a terrible read from the start to finish! If you watched the movie then you will know how the book goes and its not much better ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lincoln lawyer","review":"Very well written with multiple plot lines that were tied together. I especially enjoyed learning about how the judicial system works through the plot explanations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant wait to see the movie","review":"There was a section that dragged but overall the book was good, a lot to keep you wondering throughout book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"The first of the Micky Haller series of courtroom dramas, the books that are destined to become a phenomenon.A typical Connelly mystery - tough, gritty and so realistic you have to watch over your back as you read just to make sure you don't end up on the witness stand.Truly. Great. Stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"This is Connelly's best book by far. It deserves the praise it gets, and he earned the loot it brought him. I loved it, and as one who dabbled for a while in criminal defense work, I would say he has nailed the critical contradictions of our adversary system in a highly readable way. By the way, in my opinion the movie is one of those few that doesn't butcher the book and is excellent in its own right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Book!","review":"This is definately a great read! I just hope they haven't ruined the book for the movie. Very few movies equal the books, but I'll give the movie a shot. I have read this book twice, and will probably do so again before seeing the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!","review":"I have never read any of Michael Connelly's books, but I will read them now. \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" was a fast read, a page turner. I was impressed with the way in which it flowed. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This is typical Mike Connolly fare: action packed, fast paced, enthralling. The Lincoln in this case does not refer to Abe Lincoln the president, but the automobile and Mickey Haller works out of his.A suspensful plot keeps one guessing until the end. Definately a book worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mystery Thriller I Read in 2005","review":"I read over 150 mystery/thrillers in 2005 and I considered this to be the best one I read that year.In this legal thriller, Connelly does everything right -- plot, characters, everything. I practiced law in Los Angeles for six years, and I consider the legal procedures in this novel to be highly realistic. This book is gritty, but so is criminal law in real life. This beats anything by Grisham or Turow. The trial scene at the end of the book is tremendously well done.In particular, I recommend the audio version of this book, read by the excellent Adam Grupper. This is, quite simply, one of the best audiobooks that I have ever listened to. I normally don't enjoy audiobooks, but this one was first-rate.Highly recommended to anybody who enjoys legal thrillers or thrillers in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better than that","review":"I was worried this might be a bit of cheesy beach read -- but it is much better than that. This book is clever, actually says something about the legal system without completely hitting you over the head with it, and pretty much dead on with some of the courtroom and attorney/client dialogue. (I'm a trial lawyer in Los Angeles, as well.) Although I have liked the few Turow and Grisham books I have read, I think I like this book better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Thriller","review":"Good ethical dilemma legal thriller. Although there were a few holesin the story they didn't spoil the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I thought the book was great. I hated to end it! Definitely a read for entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This was my first Connelly book. It was a page turner. I think I've found a new author I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IMPRESSED","review":"I deliberately did not see the movie because I wanted to read the book ... don't know if it's the writing or the storyline, just couldn't get excited about this book ... sort of glad I didn't go to the movie now. I usually like this type of book, read most of John Grisham's, but some reason, just couldn't get into this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I loved this book. I only regret I did not purchase the 3 book deal for Mickey Haller instead of buying the 3 books separately. Would have saved money. Can't wait to see the movie now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The book was really good and the Kindle worked as advertised. I was completely satisfied with my purchase and with the way Amazon dealt with me. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Legal Thriller","review":"This may not be the finest book in the English language. But hey, who cares? In my opinion this is the best courtroom thriller in years. I love the character of the slick criminal defense attorney who conducts all his affairs from the back of a Lincoln Sedan. This is a fun casual read with real twists regarding the issues of Attorney-Client privilege. The way the title character gets himself out of the trap set for him is masterful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best!","review":"Entertaining. I hated for it to end. I have read most of his books and this one is a little different and is a very good read. You can be assurred that you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factually INACCurate","review":"The plot is good. But, other than feeding the ego of an L.A. Judge and a couple of cops, this book is factually inaccurate. The language is inaccurate, the procedures (which the author spends a lot of time on) are alien to L.A. County Courts. It's very frustrating to work in the system every day, and have something portrayed as factually correct when it is so far out in left field it makes the rest of the read annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical outcome but well written","review":"I broke away from Grisham to see if Michael Connelly might offer something different in the justice/suspense adventure. Every move seemed obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish","review":"So for starters -and this is not a SPOILER- the DA who goes against a shark in a courtroom is as green as grass and his boss wants him to win the case.Somewhere in the story you'll have a snitch, is he telling the truth?When you know who is the bad guy and what he did you don't have to read nothing about the trial because you'll know what's true and what's a whopper. This is the biggest mistake a writer can do - to show you the bad guy before the trial- and MC did.The other blunder MC did is that this book ends exactly the same way as the previous one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!!","review":"I have to say this book was my favorite by Connelly. I would recommend it to anyone, whether u like books about lawyers or not. LL had me readin it til like 3 in the morning. Awesome characters and an awesome story. I'm waiting for The Brass Verdict to be in paperback so I can read another story with Mickey Haller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lincoln Lawyer CDs","review":"The audio CDs added a new dimension to this incredibly written novel. It was an easy read, but the narration made it even more of a nail-biter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connelly's Best","review":"Michael Connelly is one of my favorite author's, and this book does not disappoint. I love it!!!! For those of you who like legal thrillers, you won't be able to put this book down, it grabbed me from the first page. Connelly's character of lawyer Mickey Haller is colorful, witty, engaging, and has a street intelligence that doesn't quit. And the other characters are just as entertaining, especially some of his clients. If I (or any of you out there) ever need a criminal lawyer, this is the guy to look for. And, I think this would make an excellent movie - if they let Connelly have creative rights so the story stays the same. I can't wait for the next Micky Haller installment!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure why people like this so much.","review":"I'm not a literature snob, but I thought the characters in this book are flat and that the plot was not very exciting or suspenseful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!!","review":"I saw the movie first and that movie started me reading all of Michael Connelly's books in order of their published dates. I am now in 2009 published books and love the way Mr. Connelly connects the characters from other books or mentions other crimes from other books to bring everything into sight and perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed every page. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a thrill ride in the mind of trial lawyer or crime thriller period."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lincoln lawyer","review":"XI didn't reD this but the kindle won't let me delete it so I am making up this review"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Close To Perfection As They Get ...","review":"Michael Connelly never disappoints -- in fact if this is any indication - he is not getting older, he is getting better. This is by far my favorite of all his books, and that is saying a lot because I have loved each and every one of them ... I hope we see Mickey again -- he is an awesome character with his own little set of unmatched \\"baggage\\" that endears you to him from the moment you read about him spending most of the winter eating mixed nuts out of a tupperware bowl ... The story is brilliant - fresh, crisp and beautifully detailed and layered, perfectly crafted by a master storyteller. Congrats, Michael, this one is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this book from start to end.","review":"Good book - fast paced and keeps your interest to the end. The reader is excellent, changing his voice for each person so that you feel involved in the storyline. Only complaint I had was they end and start each CD with music which almost blocks out the speaker's voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought paperback at Walmart for 5.99","review":"I love my kindle...... but more and more I am able to find the same books for much less money. And when I am done with my 5.99 paperback I can give it to a friend to read. Why do we pay more for digital books when it is far less expensive to produce a digital book than a printed book? The author......and the book are excellent. I cannot give the 5 star review out of principal, why are we paying so much for kindle editions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Plot, Pedestrian Writing","review":"The title of the review pretty much says it all. The story isn't bad but the writing style is mediocre at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just Another Lawyer Book.....","review":"Lincoln Lawyer was my first Michael Connelly book & it won't be my last. Michael Haller is a defense attorney who is chauffeured around in a Lincoln. He gets himself into an unusual predicament, but he's a pro & doesn't easily get outsmarted. The book was quite suspenseful & it kept me wondering WHAT would happen next and HOW would Mickey get out of his \\"situation\\"......... Most times I can figure out some \\"stuff\\" but not with this book. It took me until page 496 (out of 500) to learn \\"what happens\\". Different story, great writing, easy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Bosch?","review":"It may seem sacrilage, but I believe this book is even better than some of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch books.He has created a imminently likable character in Mickey Haller. One we can like and root for even though he freely admits to getting some of the most despicable criminals imaginable off scott free. You get the feeling Mickey is seeking redemption of some sort beyond just the wrongful imprisonment of a past client and is striving to do the right thing. The relationships between him and his clients, his friends and especially his ex-wives is well defined and a large part of the enjoyment of this book.A great plot, with likable characters, excellent writing and twists right up till the end make this quite possibly Connelly's best book yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced and fun","review":"Mickey Haller is a defense attorney that uses his Lincoln Town car as his mobile office. His Chauffeur is a former client who is working off his legal bill, one of Haller's ex-wives is a top-notch prosecuter and the other ex-wife is his office manager. Wow, all that is a basis for an interesting story, but it gets better. Mickey gets a new client, Louis Roulet, who is the son of a wealthy real estate agent. Louis is accused of brutally beating a prostitute. Mickey jumps at the chance to defend this upstanding, wealthy, obviously innocent client, but maybe things are not what they appear on the surface.The story moves at a good pace and is never boring. There is a network of inter-connecting stories that are all related and come together in the last several chapters. The author does an amazing job at bring it all to a satisfying conclusion that will put a smile on your face at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, excellent book!!","review":"I really loved this book. I thought it was exceptional. It is better than the Harry Bosch novels the aurthor writes. If the author is reading, would you please write another one with him? Thank you so much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Keeps you guessing and forces you to pay attention as you read. I;m still not finished with it yet, only 1/3 of the way through. Really enjoying it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"I enjoyed the style of the writing and found interesting how the author introduced experence of the legal system as it pertains to the USA. I also enjoyed the style of writing,"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lincoln Lawyer","review":"The book was excellent. I enjoyed read this book because,I could not but it down, until the book was finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment","review":"This wasn't my first taste of Mickey Haller. I read the second book, The Brass Verdict, about three years ago, so I was already familiar with him and his unconventional ways. This book is a great introduction to Haller, who is a stark contrast to Connelly's other leading man, Harry Bosch.Haller believes in doing what he has do to get the job done, whether it's negotiate with drug dealing bikers or arrange for a client to drive him around to work off his bill. When a big money client comes his way in this book, he soon finds out that some things are too good to be true. Even the best lawyer can be out-manipulated from time to time.I really like Haller as a character. He's entertaining and loyal and charmingly still hung up on his ex-wife. The audiobook was very well-done, and I'll probably continue digesting the series that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this mystery.","review":"I had seen this book on the best-selling Kindle books for some time and was interested in it. Then when it became a \\"Daily Deal\\" for $2.99, I couldn't resist. I am so glad. After reading it I would have gladly paid the full price. It was an excellent mystery. It was said to be a 'thriller mystery', but it was more of a mystery than a thriller, which I am grateful for. If you like lawyer, detective, courtroom mysteries, you should read this. I'm looking forward to reading the second book in the Mickey Haller series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move Over John Grisham!","review":"I'm a self-admitted addict when it comes to the legal mystery/thriller genre. I bought the book for a Seattle to Atlanta flight, and was so happy the plane had to circle the airport for an extra 30 minutes so I could continue reading it. The characters are engaging, Haller is interestingly flawed yet likeable and real. The plot is not a give-away, and the ending made me want to read the next Haller novel - which I'm sure will be on shelves soon. Buy it, read it, money well spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Better than Bosch!","review":"Calm down! I love Harry Bosch too, but this is really a great stand alone story. Mickey Haller is a defense lawyer whose office is his chauffeured Lincoln car. Even so, Mickey is no second rate rookie, he's a personality to be reckoned with. He's sought out by a host of unique characters in need of his help...and otherwise. Top entertainment, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Octane Fiction!","review":"Great escapist fiction: moves fast and corners well. And, at the end, I even liked the lawyer.Fortunately for me this author has a backlist for me to explore, and I'm looking forward to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connelly nails one","review":"The last few Bosch novels have been really weak; since Connelly decided to soften Bosch, he completely lost the character. His writing's been getting better at the same time his books have been getting weaker, so I was hoping for a book that showed he hasn't lost it.This is the book.I'm sure there are some legal technicalities in this book that experts might scoff at; there are certainly gaping plot holes. But forget it; this book features great characters, great pacing, it's well written, it's suspenseful. It's a better courtroom drama than anything Grisham has ever done.I couldn't put it down. Even though the flaws are many (the ending is telegraphed early and thus what I think Connelly meant as a surprise seems anti-climactic), this is the sort of book that rises way, way above it's flaws. I'd place my order for another Lincoln Lawyer book right now. I think Connelly's found his new franchise character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The Lincoln Lawyer was a good read! It slowed at times, but not for long periods. I found that it was entertaining and an easy to read novel. It is always good sometimes to read novels that are simply enjoyable and do not take a great deal of thinking. I would recommend this book to others, especially those readers that enjoy law based novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow, great fun!","review":"What a fun story! Loved the relationships, the friendships, the surprises, the self depreciating humor of the main character.Very entertaining, I am looking forward to more fun with the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I know I'm a late comer but had to say if you liked the movie, you will love the book. It's just as fast paced and action packed, but you'll get more detail and back story. This is the first Michael Connelly book I've read and look forward to more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written 2006 not 2011","review":"I bought this book last month and after a few pages realized I already read it. I buy all of Connelly's and a few other authors works as soon as they come out in paperback. I just realized Amazon displays the latest publishing date - not the copyright date or even the first paperback date so if you read as much as I do, and have a challenged memory, you can be easily fooled into buying older books. Sorry this is more a rant than review but hopefully it can alert other customers to this practice. Enjoy the book - I did - I think....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connelly is a Superg Story Teller","review":"\\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is the second Michael Connelly book I've read, and it cements his reputation in my mind, as a superb story teller. It must be hard for an author to come up with a new plot for a crime novel, but Connelly had me guessing until the end. If suspense is the name of the game, Connelly is a practiced practioner of the page turner variety. As a lawyer, I found the courtroom scenes realistic. The protagonist, a lawyer, is a character of the noir variety, meaning that while being personally flawed, doing justice is important to him. \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is now a major motion picture, and it could be a good one, but I'll pass it up because the cinema of my imagination is better for me than Hollywood graphics"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"The book is really good.

Been a big fan of Heart from their beginning. Heart opened their current tour in Minneapolis. My guitar teacher and I attended. Great concert. Good to see them on the stage. Ann sang her heart out again. Seeing Nancy on her guitar reminded me of my appreciation of her playing. My guitar teacher gave me an older magazine with an interview of Nancy. There she talked about a couple of solo albums she made. Live at McCabes and Baby Guitars. Nancy had some solo albums? A search of Amazon put both of them in my reach. Live at McCabe's is pretty good stuff. Nancy is playing live some old songs and newer ones. I love it but I have to say I prefer the Baby Guitars. I have been wearing both of these CD's out in my car. If you are a fan of Nancy's you should pick Live at McCabe's up for sure. But don't miss Baby Guitars either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrid, pitiful sad","review":"Where do these people come from with this sorry voices and say nothing lyrics.

Heart is an example of a group unoriginal to the extreme and resolutely middle brow which has become a huge selling pop juggernaut. Go figure. Sister Nancy, weary of the trappings of stardom has done an unplugged version of various favorites and originals-hair down, 'honest' and accessible. Wilson is quoted in the local paper suggesting that 'The Rain Song', written when she was twelve or thirteen, was probably the best thing whe ever wrote. And she is undoubtedly right. This is music which sounds exactly as if it were performed by someone whose entire musical ethos was in place at thirteen. Not very interesting. If you want to hear music by the more talented Wilson, get 'Traveling Miles' by Cassandra Wilson. Sophisticated, mature. The opposite of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss a Listen","review":"This is one of my favourite recordings of all time. Yes, it's not the greatest sound, but one gets an honest feeling of what it would be like to be in a room by yourself with this gifted artist. Also, the guitar, mando, etc. work is a real showcase for Ms. Wilson's talent. I wish I could find more recordings like this that give me the same soaring feeling. Thank you, Nancy, for releasing it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Nancy's voice!","review":"I may be in the minority here, but I prefer Nancy Wilson's voice to her sister Ann's. Don't get me wrong: Ann is a remarkable, world-class vocalist, but I have enjoyed Nancy's sturdy, vulnerable vocal stylings in all the Heart songs in which she does lead vocals (especially \\"There's The Girl\\" and \\"Stranded\\"). So, naturally, this CD had to be bought!While I would love Nancy to put out a solo studio album, this CD is great. It's a low-key live show, presented without pretense or expectation. Nancy did this solo show just for the love of music, and the listener can tell. She keeps it charming and light throughout, but she defintely impresses with her lovely singing and exemplary guitar playiing.I'd recommend this CD to any fan of Heart, and anyone who enjoys female acoustic singer-songwriter music. An awesome collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult words to read,but one must..","review":"How does an human being survive the horrors of Stalinism?

Cool yet vulnerable, always connected to the words, and with a style all her own, no matter what the material, she is the quintessential pop singer. This collection is a great place to start, in my opinion. I have so many favorites on this CD, but a few of them must be mentoned: \\"Crumbs off the Table\\" which rocks, \\"Yesterday When I was Young\\" and \\"I Think it's gonna rain today,\\" both of which weep, and \\"Mixed up girl\\" which does both. A true original, no matter which of her many faces she displays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gems.","review":"This isn't a good place to start for those just beginning a Springfield collection, but for those who already own her greatest hits (of which \\"The Silver Collection\\" is the best), this is a fine collection of recordings rare to American listeners. Notable chiefly for several exquisite readings of light ballads both familiar (\\"This Girl's in Love With You,\\" \\"A Song For You,\\" \\"Yesterday When I Was Young,\\" and \\"What Are You Doing The Rest of Your Life?\\") and overlooked (\\"I Start Counting,\\" \\"See All Her Faces,\\" \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today,\\" and the truly remarkable \\"Wasn't Born To Follow\\").

It also shows why this material wasn't released in the USA. Filled with wonderful song sung better by everyone else who sang them, this recording has few surprises. A few songs--- \\"See all her faces\\", the sweet \\"I start Counting\\", show some promise, but most sound like elaborately produced demos hoping for a better voice to come along. \\"Piece of My heart\\" sounds like she recorded it in a tin can. Her hysterical reading of \\"I Think is't going to Rain Today\\" makes one run for cover. This album and it's singer are better--- left in London.

The theme from The $25,000 Pyramid was included on the earlier cd, but it was fun to hear the theme from the original $10,000 Pyramid, which I grew up with. I had forgotten what a great theme Wheel of Fortune had at the beginning. I had also forgotten what great, rockin' themesTattletales, Blockbusters, and High Rollers had too. Being a game show wiz, this was such a treat.

Having written a song for none other than Madonna for her \\"American Life\\" album, Jem's aptly named debut album \\"Finally Woken\\" showcases her considerable talent under her own spotlight.The first song \\"They\\" was an immediate radio hit, with its unique and catchy intro and choral hook, blended with a little Hip Hop. The next single \\"Just a Ride\\" is also a radio friendly pop track, with a good beat and smooth vocals, and can be found on the \\"Monster in Law\\" soundtrack.Other buzz-worthy tracks are \\"Come on Closer\\" with a little similarity to Dido; the title track; the emotional ballad \\"Missing You\\"; the reggae backed \\"Save Me\\"; the sweetly melodic \\"Stay Now\\"; and the retro \\"Wish I\\".A great easy-listening pop album, from a girl who can both sing and write great songs. Look out for more from Jem.Amanda Richards, September 2, 2005"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! What a refreshing talent!","review":"I just happened to be browsing through CDs at my local Borders and saw Jem as a featured CD at a listening station and gave it a quick listen. I found myself listening to each track and I knew I had to have this CD. It is exactly what Dido's new CD should have been, but wasn't. The Dido sound is much more expanded here with more experimental infusion of rock, regaee, electronic beeps, and even 60s/70s lounge like samples. Jem's voice, ironically, sounds alot like Dido's or Beth Orton. I brought this CD to work and everyone throuroughly enjoyed listening to it over the BOSE speakers in the office. My personal favorite track is \\"Save Me\\" - very catchy, regaee and mid-tempo bass infused tune that is great to drive with in the summer with the sunroof up!In short, this is one of the best finds of the year. I would also recommend Toby Lightman as another wonderful addition to your sophisticated CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous.","review":"All I can say is : WOW. I can be pretty picky about, well, everything, but I absolutely LOVE this CD. Every single song.

Great things could come for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"very happy with my purchase!","review":"Love, love, love this cd!! Thank you so much!! Perfect shape and fast delivery!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Context and Mood","review":"I wasn't \\"grabbed\\" by every song on a cursory listen. I judge music by what it stirs in me, it's an emotional draw first. \\"24\\" had that extra quality that drew me in instantly. \\"Come on Closer\\" follows \\"24\\", and then \\"They\\". The other songs didn't stand out immediately, but I am guessing it's only a matter of time. I first heard Jem tonight, \\"24\\" was playing in a movie trailer. But since it came just before the feature (Underworld: Evolution) I think it's permanently connected to Underworld in my mind. Which means that for me the edge is darker and more bizarre than it might be for some other listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unplacable yet fantastic!","review":"I first heard the album in a Barnes and Noble, asked who the artist was, and promptly bought it. That was a little less than a week ago, since then it has barely left my CD player, both at work and at home (and while driving between the two). I have already converted three people into fans, and am currently working on three more. They always ask who she can be compared to, and neither I, nor anyone else can really describe it. The best description I have heard is rock/pop with electronica as well as trip-hop (whatever that is), and some reggae/ragga influence. On top of all of that she has an angelically beautiful voice that proves to have a very impressive range. \\"They\\" and \\"24\\" are my favorite tracks, while \\"Come on Closer\\" is absolutely the sexiest song I have ever heard (but not in a lewd way). I enjoy every track on the album, however, which is a great rarity, and so I have become a very devoted fan in less than a week. I recommend you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled","review":"I heard the song \\"They\\" on a progressive station and thought it was great--great musically, lyrically and vocally. It sounded different than other songs and was catchy. Sadly, it is the best song on the disc.Whatever song you hear--whether it's \\"They\\" or \\"24\\" (the most likely singles), don't be fooled. The rest of the songs are mediocre at best. The lyrics on the other songs are simple and, in some cases, juvenile. Vocally, the songs show that Jem only has one singing style and that style is supposed to go with all the musical styles (hip-hop/dance, reggae, pop). It doesn't work. The vocals either don't fit or get overwhelmed by guitar or drum tracks.That's not to say that future work won't be better. I think with a better producer and maybe a more consistent style, Jem could make some very good music. This is more of an experiment.Your best bet it to find a site that sells individual songs and get \\"They\\" and \\"24,\\" which are the best tracks on the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dido is way better than Jem.","review":"I purchased this CD based on Amazon recommendations that she sounds like Dido and was disappointed. Jem does sound like Dido but her voice is no comparison or her music. I can say that I like the last 3 songs, which aren't the ones that people have heard on TV shows. Those songs like \\"They\\" and \\"Breakdown\\" are just annoying. Don't buy this CD unless you like those songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"They\\"","review":"However hypnotic/hip/intriguing the song \\"They\\" is (I admit myself to enjoying this song), a previous poster made a very lucid and very valid point. There are numerous postings on this website about how 'original' Jem's song \\"They\\" is. However, I must point out, as did the aforementioned reviewer, that the backing vocals for \\"They\\" is taken straight out of the a capella group The Swingle Singers' album, \\"Jazz Sebastian Bach\\". The song is actually \\"Prelude No. 11 in F Major\\", and is in and of itself a very intriguing piece of music, made even more so by the Swingle Singers. Please take note that I am most definitely NOT degraded Jem's album. I am merely making an attempt to give artistic recognition to those whom truly deserve it, namely the Swingle Singers as well as the great J.S. Bach.Carpe Diem"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I first heard Jem's Come on Closer on a preview for the movie Closer.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover Finally Woken has no fillers whatsoever on it. I can see music from this album not just playing on many people's stereos or computers but appearing in the soundtracks of many future movies as well.

I can't remember the last time I bought a CD and didn't feel the need to skip over any of the songs! There's no filler here. Yes, Jem is a cross between Dido and Beth Orton; and though the music isn't particularly groundbreaking, I'll be darned if it's not the catchiest, poppiest, trip-hop CD of the year. Every song on the CD is radio-friendly- which to indie music snobs can be a turn off. I can be an indie music snob myself, but this CD just hooks you right from the opening track, \\"They\\". It's not really cutting edge, but who cares? Get ready to hear every song on this CD on commercials and movie trailers. My only hope is that \\"Finally Woken\\" doesn't get overplayed- like Moby's \\"Play\\".

Amazon might tell you it's the fault of the publisher but they are still selling a defective product. This is one of the best books ever written in Spanish.

I first read this book in english and didn't think it was that great but reading it in spanish has changed my mind about it 100%. I am now convinced 100 anos de soledad is a literary masterpiece that pays great attention to the cyclical nature of time in life. Garcia Marquez clearly put a lot of thought into his book. What's great about this version is that it comes with literary notes that help you appreciate the depth of this book by pointing out details that one could never detect in a first reading--unless you are brighter than your average person.

Sloane's novel, A NICE PLACE TO LIVE, is a very straightforward horror tale about a young couple and their son moving into a new neighborhood where something horrible and mysterious is going on. Cliched story, you might say, but that's where Mr. Sloane breathes fresh air into the premise. While I can't elaborate on the something that is slowly reducing the population of the new town, I can say that it was quite creative and novel, and back when this book first came out I really embraced the author's creativity. I will soon be revisiting the sequel, THE VENGEANCE, as well, since A NICE PLACE was as enjoyable this time out as it was back-in-the-day.

The projected time is very hard or impossible to see unless the room is pitch black. It also only projects continuously if you buy a separate power cord to plug it in. In my case, the cord jack connection appears to be weak, so the projection still blinks out. The front display is also hard to read. The black-on-grey color scheme does not provide enough contrast. It can show the time via back-light, but again you have to press a button for this function, and then it is on for a minute.My husband also had a difficult time getting it to detect the time, and we are in the eastern US time zone.Don't bother with this product.

He's got a few hang-ups but he doesn't deal with them; he lives with them. And he carries on, like the rest of us.

It was advertised as a radio with a range of over ten miles, however, I think it was a misprint and they really meant one mile. I read a few reviews where the reviewers said that they got reception of over ten miles. I wonder who wrote those reviews? HHHHUMMMMM! If you are looking for a handheld two way radio with extended range, do not get the Midland GXT-400! I was definitely no more than one mile from my house when I lost reception with my wife. I tried a different route and still same result. I do not live in a canyon or in an area surrounded by skyscrapers. I live in an area where the houses are no more than two stories high and I could not get reception once I was more than ten blocks from my house. I am going back to my Motorla t-250's. Easy to use, lighter and same range!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from these","review":"purchased radios and charger. charged batteries as directed for 24hr first charge. light on charger never turned green and radios read half power on battery meter. replaced with regular AA batteries still meter read half power so radios do not work properly! one of the radios lcd missing several digits making it impossible to see functions properly.conclusion there is little or no quality control, radios appear to be built very cheaply,not good as a toy or proffessionaly.KYLE THOMPSON"},{"rating":"2","title":"monster house","review":"My son has watched this many times and loves it. May be a little scary for younger ones but very entertaining with good ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun halloween movie","review":"I watched this because we had two copies and I never saw it before. My 4 year old nephew was watching it one day. After watching the first half hour, I am suprised no one checked if it was alright for him or not. Within that time frame, a guy claimed to have died, a guy was drinking beer, he ripped off the head and stuffing out of a stuffed animal, and the house is just scary. I recommend this for kids age 10 and over. It should have been PG-13 I believe. Anyways I am 26 and I thought it was a cool movie. Great graphics and almost every character in it was a famous actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining in 3D","review":"This was my very first 3D Movie, I've never seen a 3D movie even at the movies, and now that I know I can get even a better experence in my living room why bother with the expence of going to the movies.

Too many to count. Well here's one that is the exact opposite.I'm not a big fan of motion caputure CG. I thought the Polar Express human graphics looked like the result of a Star Trek transporter room malfunction. Monster House has made improvements but still has that \\"look\\". But the story in Monster House is so good it will keep you interested throughout the film.Also, it may be too intense for little kids but I saw nothing worse than was in the Harry Potter films."},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest movie for 2006!!!","review":"I loved this movie so much. Though Chowder was my favorite character but anyways. This story is about a boy who is left with a babysitter while his parents go on vacation...and across the street is a haunted house and the person who owns the house dies of a heartattack...or does he??? But I wont spoil the secret. This movie is great for people over the age of 8 or 9, because I got scared with some freaky parts.

I guess maybe kids 12-16 might like it but kids under 12 should not be allowed to watch it and kids over 15 would think it is too babyish. Adults would want that 90 minutes of their life back. The ending is horrible, most of the kids, especially the babysitter are just rude obnoxious children. I am so glad I watched this before allowing my daughter to watch this. It isn't that it was too scary. It just isn't a family film at all. Uvula and the little boys says, isn't that a girl part? Not cool. There is also cursing, tattoos and drinking in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before taking your kids to see this one.","review":"Think twice before taking your kids to see this one. In the first 10 minutes, the main character (a kid) has his neighbor die right on top of him (slumping on top of the kid's body). As if this weren't enough, there are then plenty of nice long shots of the dead man's eerie face smeared up against the screen, and other dramatic touches like a long close-up of his dead hand dragging on the ground, or the paramedics dragging the dead body away, uncovered. Then, when the kid seeks out his baby-sitter to talk about it (his parents being absent), she won't listen to him but is instead annoyed he's trying to talk to her, so she intentionally shows him who's \\"in control\\" by breaking a pot and blaming him for it. No one can be trusted! Save your money and go see something more worth your while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly inappropriate for kids","review":"I found the underlying premise of the film (involving the old man's carnie wife) extremely offensive and exactly the opposite of the kind of morals I want my kids to learn.

I would imagine the cheesy animation wouldn't be very appealing to older kids. Much too long. Boring story. Lame characters.I'm not sure who the intended audience is for this film.

Colors are vibrant, depth is strong, and the animation is very life like. Many of the visual effects, particularly towards the end, go straight to that part of the brain which first wanted to upgrade your TV to high definition. But I do feel Monster House stops short of receiving a perfect score, not because of the transfer, but because of the artificial grain filter which the film makers applied. It wasn't obtrusive but it did detract, ever so slightly, from the clarity of the image. Not once did it create the effect of 'Wow, was this shot on film?' but rather 'When are they going to do something about mpeg's dancing dither.' A score of 4.5(PS3 - 1080p projector - 92\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Blu-ray movie","review":"When I have friends over and I want them to experience Blu-ray for the first time, this is usually the movie I grab.

How it every got a PG rating I'll never know. I'm afraid this rating will lull parents into thinking this movie is safe for kids. It isn't. Despite being a \\"cartoon\\" it is mean, very violent and frightening right from the beginning with crude bathroom humor scattered throughout.

This movie doesn't really do that, but gave me the impression that with a little help it could. In the early Disney classics like Pinocchio and Bambi there are horrific moments that are really very scary! In Pinocchio when Lampwick is transformed into a donkey it is the stuff nightmare are made from! When I watched this movie I felt like this film was trying to do something like that. A cool story and great animation make this another Halloween classic! The DVD transfer is great and a worthy purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of lame","review":"Has occassional moments of interest, like the opening sequence (little girl riding her tricycle through the leaves), but mostly the movie engendered a ho-hum feeling.

I came upon this disc looking for more Celtic-type music. It has a couple of such songs and a great deal more variety. It is not one of those compilation of flukey songs by no-talent artists. Many of these artists are extremely talented and well known to audiences in different pockets of the world, but are left undiscovered to most of us.

That has a few reasons, some are:1 - Not available to license for compiliations (some artists NEVER appear on comps for many reasons)2 - The artists with the big big hits may want to much for the licensing of their track (either royalty or advance)3 - The programmer's of the disc know only what they've been told and didn't live the era.What I'm a fan of is the hardcore lost stuff. I played it then in the clubs and it lit up floors. Many people may remember them if they hit the clubs back then but the songs only were in the mixes or on DISCO stations, not the played out top 40 stuffExamples: John Davis, Liquid Gold, Le Pamplemousse, France Joli, CJ & Company and others.

His music is inspired by whatever movie he is trying to score, and much of the movies he had scored happened to be dark fantasy, and comic book adaptations.In A Simple Plan, the film is a serious thriller about greed and desperation. The somber nature of the movie is reflected in the soundtrack. The music is slower in tempo, and there is more use of traditional instruments in addition to various synthesizer samples."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?! THIS IS BAD!","review":"Elfman's foray into film scoring territory mastered by Thomas Newman, the subtle minimalist side, is a disappointment. Instead of bringing anything fresh to it, he creates a BORING main theme which he plays with incessantly. The only thing that buoys this record is \\"Tracks In The Snow\\", in which Elfman recovers, and crazily throws percussion around to weave a suspenseful and raucous action cue. (GOOD) But the rest? (BAD)"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"as a longtime fan of danny elfman, i've listened to almost all of his work, bought almost all of his CDs, and loved his music for years. unfortunately, elfman has disappointed me, for the 1st, and hopefully, the last time. A SIMPLE PLAN has good intentions as a score, it even has a couple good cues, but the entire score is boring, without that quirky bold flavor that elfman made his with scores to EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, BATMAN RETURNS and THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS!I realize elfman is trying to expand his musical horizons and experiment, but this score, as a listening experience, is a DUD."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Embroidery","review":"I bought this hat because I love the steelers.

It is a very eclectic album, with lots of different types of songs. Lee's voice was not at full strength at this point, but it doesn't matter; his weathered voice is totally appropriate for this album. There are five guest vocalists helping out on the album, including Lee's very young granddaughter. The songs highlight Lee brilliant production skills, as well as his eccentricities. Lee's own records were never as commercial as the ones he produced for Nancy Sinatra, but they are very charming in their own way. This is the perfect final album for an often under appreciated artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"J. Millar is Right","review":"I was going to write a review for 'Cake or Death', but it seems J.

It is such a beautiful song. Sarah Brightman's younger sister, Amelia (aka Violet) has a great voice.

A truly wonderful,eerie and quality movie, even though it does not include the next generation as the original book does it truly captures the spirited, confused and destructive romance between Cathy and Heathcliffe. The lavish party at the Grange and the lavish grounds, decor and gowns and the bright lighting within the house is a stark contrast to the dark, cold, grey and depressing Wuthering Heights. The 1939 version also captures the old English atmosphere with the reflection of the fireplace on the faces in the old house and the natural shadows of the candle light from within the large, empty and cold Wuthering Heights after its hay day.A truly wonderful experience with quality and convincing actors of a calibre that is difficult to find in modern times."},{"rating":"2","title":"swept up in the movie","review":"the first time i watched this movie was years ago,i really got swept up in the whole thing,like i was right there with them.and it's not just a chick flik as they say.my kids were very young and they both love the movie,thats why i am ordering it.my daughter wants it and we can't find it in stores.i think this will be her favorite birthday present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tortured Love","review":"Some people think Heathcliff and Cathy are very cruel, self-centered people.

For the ending to leave you happy, you must believe in life after death.The HBO version with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon is the BEST version of Wuthering Heights.

Unless, you happened to read the novel. Then, don't even bother to watch the movie. They omit, in my mind, some of the best scenes from the novel. Where are all the children characters like Cathy, Heathcliff, and Hindley had? They played very important roles in the novel. They did an excellent job of remaking the first half of the novel, then they jumped to the end and completely skipped the second half. If you like romantic movies, but prefer not to read the novels, then you will love this movie. However, if you prefer to read the good ol' classics, like myself, don't waste your time on this remake; you will be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wuthering Heights Is A Real tour de force","review":"As far as I can perceive,Wuthering Heights is honestly a real piece de resistance.Though the end of its major themes,love,passion,hate obssession and revenge is catastrophic, it's still the most enthralling,exciting and fascinitaing novel I have ever read in English literature. Regarding the characters,I think, my favourite one is Edgar Linton who loved his difficult-to-please-wife,Catherine.On the contrary,my most unfavourite character is the ingrateful,vindictive,ruthless Heathcliff. It's true that Catherine had made a mistake by marring Edgar,but she had paid dearly her own life for it.Even if you, Heathcliff want to wreck revenge on someone,it should be Catherine and only Catherine.Not,however,to extend your vengeance to the all family generations as you wickedly and spitefully did.

Laurence Olivier is mesmeric. His performance should be the template for all romantic leading men...which is especially to his credit given that it was in the process of making this film that he learned the difference between acting for the stage and for movies.Now, seventy-four years after the film was made, no one has yet to match his combination of vulnerability and power, of sensitivity and pure brute force,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wuthering Heights B/W","review":"I love the black and white version of Wuthering Heights. The Samuel Goldwyn adaption is wonderful. Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon star in this timeless classic of love betrayel and tragedy. Laurence Olivier gives a smashing performance as Heathcliff. Heathcliff is in love with Catherine Earnshaw played by Merle Oberon. David Niven plays the pale faced Edgar Linton. Olivier is as tragic and dark as Heathcliff is supposed to be. The story only focuses on the love story between the star crossed lovers. It ends with Catherine's death. Even though the rest of the book was not potrayed in the movie this 1930's film classic is timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever.","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen! It was supposed to be based on Emily Bronte's novel, but I don't think that the director even read the book! It was truly dissapointing to see this movie. They set it in the wrong time period, wrong clothes, and even cut out the last half of the book. Heathcliff, who is evil, is portrayed as good, and Edgar, who is good, is portrayed as evil! Even though the movie is bad, the novel \\"Wuthering Heights\\" was one of the best books I have read.

Have you read the book? this is THE blueprint for gothic romance...GOTHIC, not sentimental. I mean, in the book there are ghosts, drunkeness, murder and Heathcliff DIGS UP CATHY'S GRAVE for God's sake! Is ANY of that in here? No. Just a typical (for the time) cornball, flowery Hollywood version of the story that sort of alludes to the core of the book. And what is the core of the book? Come on, it's an S&M tinged power struggle where people put their very souls on the line, betray and insult each other to get revenge, etc. You won't find that here, just hearts and flowers and a bit of sadness. boo hoo hoo at the end, y'know? It's about as authentic as an American in bright green slacks eating a green beer and wearing a 'kiss me i'm Irish' button on St. Patrick's Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Over Rated !!","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is very possibly my favorite book and this ,by far the WORST filming that I've seen of it! They all speak in artificial and sonorous tones. Making dramatic pronoucements sometimes accompanied by rumbles of thunder like a bad horror movie! I never thought Merle Oberon, regardless of how pretty she was, could act and Olivier is too subdued and displays NONE of the passion described in Bronte's novel. Example: the \\"May you not rest until I am dead too!\\" Which is spoken as he bashes his head against a tree trunk, is delivered in a dreamy, removed and subdued manner with no head banging involved. Timothy Dalton and Ralph Fiennes ECLIPSE Olivier's pallid performance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too melodramatic","review":"i've never read the novel by bronte, but based on this film it's hard to see why it'd be considered a classic. the acting and story are far too melodramatic to be good; i found myself laughing where i think i was supposed to be crying. nevertheless, i'm intrigued enough to check out the book to see what, if anything, was left out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've loved this film for 60 years and more and it was time to replace my ancient Betamax tape. The adaptation from the novel is, one accepts, disgracefully free, but that was what the studio moguls wanted in those days.

When one questions the judgements of relationship choices, this script explores so many deeply instinctual feelings that appear unexplainable but upon further examination the development of attachments, ego, desire, fantasy, jealousy, materialism, acceptance and specifically the concept of separatism are exhibited in ample culture. A curse is an affliction, evil incarnate, an insidious state of affairs, and this aspect provides the thread of ethereal bar none in serious cinema. I appreciate the intensity of each character exposed against the delicate nature of desire. With the many and varied disparaging scenes, only to be redeemed at closing credits, is an incomparable feat, hence, I endorse this film with a high recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why'd they skip so much of the book?","review":"Wuthering Heights, as a movie, was very good.

Olivier, Fitzgerald, Oberon. Pretty good cast. I always like David Niven. He's the fussy Edgar, too stupid to know that he should not marry Oberon's Debbie. Olivier's Heathcliff turns into a real bastard. There's really no one to care for.several of the cast die. So what? See it if you must, for the acting.

This films shows us (perfectly) that \\"true love\\" which reaches deep into one's soul can be the closest thing to \\"Heaven on Earth\\". But when that love is broken and turned away it can be a force powerful enough to destroy lives. It's a classic in every sense. It's so compelling it will grip you every time you watch it.
